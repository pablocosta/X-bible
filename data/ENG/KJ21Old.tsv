KJ21	Genesis	1	1	In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	1	2	And the earth was without form and void , and darkness was upon the face of the deep . And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters .
KJ21	Genesis	1	3	And God said , “ Let there be light ” ; and there was light .
KJ21	Genesis	1	4	And God saw the light , that it was good ; and God divided the light from the darkness .
KJ21	Genesis	1	5	And God called the light Day , and the darkness He called Night . And the evening and the morning were the first day .
KJ21	Genesis	1	6	And God said , “ Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters. ”
KJ21	Genesis	1	7	And God made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament ; and it was so .
KJ21	Genesis	1	8	And God called the firmament Heaven . And the evening and the morning were the second day .
KJ21	Genesis	1	9	And God said , “ Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear ” ; and it was so .
KJ21	Genesis	1	10	And God called the dry land Earth ; and the gathering together of the waters called He Seas ; and God saw that it was good .
KJ21	Genesis	1	11	And God said , “ Let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yielding seed , and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind , whose seed is in itself , upon the earth ” ; and it was so .
KJ21	Genesis	1	12	And the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind ; and God saw that it was good .
KJ21	Genesis	1	13	And the evening and the morning were the third day .
KJ21	Genesis	1	14	And God said , “ Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs and for seasons , and for days and years ;
KJ21	Genesis	1	15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth ” ; and it was so .
KJ21	Genesis	1	16	And God made two great lights : the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night . He made the stars also .
KJ21	Genesis	1	17	And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth ,
KJ21	Genesis	1	18	and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness . And God saw that it was good .
KJ21	Genesis	1	19	And the evening and the morning were the fourth day .
KJ21	Genesis	1	20	And God said , “ Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. ”
KJ21	Genesis	1	21	And God created great whales and every living creature that moveth , which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind , and every winged fowl after his kind ; and God saw that it was good .
KJ21	Genesis	1	22	And God blessed them , saying , “ Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let fowl multiply on the earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	1	23	And the evening and the morning were the fifth day .
KJ21	Genesis	1	24	And God said , “ Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind : cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind ” ; and it was so .
KJ21	Genesis	1	25	And God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind ; and God saw that it was good .
KJ21	Genesis	1	26	And God said , “ Let Us make man in Our image , after Our likeness ; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	1	27	So God created man in His own image , in the image of God created He him ; male and female created He them .
KJ21	Genesis	1	28	And God blessed them , and God said unto them , “ Be fruitful and multiply , and replenish the earth , and subdue it ; and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	1	29	And God said , “ Behold , I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat .
KJ21	Genesis	1	30	And to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life , I have given every green herb for meat ” ; and it was so .
KJ21	Genesis	1	31	And God saw every thing that He had made , and behold , it was very good . And the evening and the morning were the sixth day .
KJ21	Genesis	2	2	And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made ; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made .
KJ21	Genesis	2	3	And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it , because in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made .
KJ21	Genesis	2	4	These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens ,
KJ21	Genesis	2	5	and before every plant of the field was in the earth , and before every herb of the field grew ; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground .
KJ21	Genesis	2	6	But there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
KJ21	Genesis	2	7	And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
KJ21	Genesis	2	8	And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden , and there He put the man whom He had formed .
KJ21	Genesis	2	9	And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food , the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
KJ21	Genesis	2	10	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden , and from thence it was parted and became four heads .
KJ21	Genesis	2	11	The name of the first is Pishon ; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold .
KJ21	Genesis	2	12	And the gold of that land is good , and there is bdellium and the onyx stone .
KJ21	Genesis	2	13	And the name of the second river is Gihon ; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush .
KJ21	Genesis	2	14	And the name of the third river is Hiddekel ; that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria . And the fourth river is Euphrates .
KJ21	Genesis	2	15	And the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it .
KJ21	Genesis	2	16	And the Lord God commanded the man , saying , “ Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat ;
KJ21	Genesis	2	17	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it . For in the day that thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die. ”
KJ21	Genesis	2	18	And the Lord God said , “ It is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him a helper meet for him. ”
KJ21	Genesis	2	19	And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air , and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them ; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature , that was the name thereof .
KJ21	Genesis	2	20	And Adam gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for Adam there was not found a helper meet for him .
KJ21	Genesis	2	21	And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam , and he slept ; and He took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh instead thereof .
KJ21	Genesis	2	22	And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man , made He a woman and brought her unto the man .
KJ21	Genesis	2	23	And Adam said , “ This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh ; she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man. ”
KJ21	Genesis	2	24	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife ; and they shall be one flesh .
KJ21	Genesis	2	25	And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
KJ21	Genesis	3	3	but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , ‘ Ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	3	2	And the woman said unto the serpent , “ We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden ,
KJ21	Genesis	3	4	And the serpent said unto the woman , “ Ye shall not surely die ;
KJ21	Genesis	3	5	for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil. ”
KJ21	Genesis	3	6	And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was pleasant to the eyes , and a tree to be desired to make one wise , she took of the fruit thereof and ate , and gave also unto her husband with her ; and he ate .
KJ21	Genesis	3	7	And the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together , and made themselves things to gird about .
KJ21	Genesis	3	8	And they heard the voice of the Lord God , walking in the garden in the cool of the day . And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden .
KJ21	Genesis	3	9	And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him , “ Where art thou ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	3	10	And he said , “ I heard Thy voice in the garden , and I was afraid because I was naked ; and I hid myself. ”
KJ21	Genesis	3	11	And He said , “ Who told thee that thou wast naked ? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	3	12	And the man said , “ The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I ate. ”
KJ21	Genesis	3	13	And the Lord God said unto the woman , “ What is this that thou hast done ? ” And the woman said , “ The serpent beguiled me , and I ate. ”
KJ21	Genesis	3	14	And the Lord God said unto the serpent , “ Because thou hast done this , thou art cursed above all cattle , and above every beast of the field . Upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life .
KJ21	Genesis	3	15	And I will put enmity between thee and the woman , and between thy seed and her Seed ; It shall bruise thy head , and thou shalt bruise His heel. ”
KJ21	Genesis	3	16	Unto the woman He said , “ I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception . In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee. ”
KJ21	Genesis	3	17	And unto Adam He said , “ Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife , and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee , saying , ‘ Thou shalt not eat of it , ’ cursed is the ground for thy sake ; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life .
KJ21	Genesis	3	18	Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee , and thou shalt eat the herb of the field .
KJ21	Genesis	3	19	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground , for out of it wast thou taken ; for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return. ”
KJ21	Genesis	3	20	And Adam called his wife ’ s name Eve , because she was the mother of all living .
KJ21	Genesis	3	21	Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins , and clothed them .
KJ21	Genesis	3	22	And the Lord God said , “ Behold , the man has become as one of Us , to know good and evil . And now , lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life , and eat and live for ever ” —
KJ21	Genesis	3	23	therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken .
KJ21	Genesis	3	24	So He drove out the man ; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
KJ21	Genesis	4	4	And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof . And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering ;
KJ21	Genesis	4	2	And she again bore his brother Abel . And Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
KJ21	Genesis	4	3	And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord .
KJ21	Genesis	4	5	but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect . And Cain was very wroth , and his countenance fell .
KJ21	Genesis	4	6	And the Lord said unto Cain , “ Why art thou wroth ? And why is thy countenance fallen ?
KJ21	Genesis	4	7	If thou doest well , shalt thou not be accepted ? And if thou doest not well , sin lieth at the door . And unto thee shall be his desire , and thou shalt rule over him. ”
KJ21	Genesis	4	8	And Cain talked with Abel his brother ; and it came to pass , when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him .
KJ21	Genesis	4	9	And the Lord said unto Cain , “ Where is Abel thy brother ? ” And he said , “ I know not . Am I my brother ’ s keeper ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	4	10	And He said , “ What hast thou done ? The voice of thy brother ’ s blood crieth unto Me from the ground .
KJ21	Genesis	4	11	And now art thou cursed from the earth , which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother ’ s blood from thy hand .
KJ21	Genesis	4	12	When thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength . A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be on the earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	4	13	And Cain said unto the Lord , “ My punishment is greater than I can bear .
KJ21	Genesis	4	14	Behold , Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth , and from Thy face shall I be hid ; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth . And it shall come to pass that every one who findeth me shall slay me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	4	15	And the Lord said unto him , “ Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain , vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. ” And the Lord set a mark upon Cain , lest any finding him should kill him .
KJ21	Genesis	4	16	And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord , and dwelt in the land of Nod to the east of Eden .
KJ21	Genesis	4	17	And Cain knew his wife , and she conceived and bore Enoch . And he built a city , and called the name of the city after the name of his son , Enoch .
KJ21	Genesis	4	18	And unto Enoch was born Irad ; and Irad begot Mehujael , and Mehujael begot Methushael , and Methushael begot Lamech .
KJ21	Genesis	4	19	And Lamech took unto him two wives : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other Zillah .
KJ21	Genesis	4	20	And Adah bore Jabal ; he was the father of those who dwell in tents , and of those who have cattle .
KJ21	Genesis	4	21	And his brother ’ s name was Jubal ; he was the father of all those who handle the harp and organ .
KJ21	Genesis	4	22	And Zillah , she also bore Tubalcain , an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron ; and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah .
KJ21	Genesis	4	23	And Lamech said unto his wives , “ Adah and Zillah , hear my voice ; ye wives of Lamech , hearken unto my speech ! For I have slain a man for my wounding , and a young man for my hurt .
KJ21	Genesis	4	24	If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold , truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. ”
KJ21	Genesis	4	25	And Adam knew his wife again ; and she bore a son and called his name Seth . “ For God , ” said she , “ hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel , whom Cain slew. ”
KJ21	Genesis	4	26	And to Seth also there was born a son , and he called his name Enosh . Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord .
KJ21	Genesis	5	5	And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years ; and he died .
KJ21	Genesis	5	2	Male and female created He them , and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created .
KJ21	Genesis	5	3	And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years , and begot a son in his own likeness , after his image , and called his name Seth .
KJ21	Genesis	5	4	And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years ; and he begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	5	6	And Seth lived a hundred and five years , and begot Enosh .
KJ21	Genesis	5	7	And Seth lived after he begot Enosh eight hundred and seven years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	5	8	And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years ; and he died .
KJ21	Genesis	5	9	And Enosh lived ninety years , and begot Cainan .
KJ21	Genesis	5	10	And Enosh lived after he begot Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	5	11	And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years ; and he died .
KJ21	Genesis	5	12	And Cainan lived seventy years , and begot Mahalaleel .
KJ21	Genesis	5	13	And Cainan lived after he begot Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	5	14	And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years ; and he died .
KJ21	Genesis	5	15	And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years , and begot Jared .
KJ21	Genesis	5	16	And Mahalaleel lived after he begot Jared eight hundred and thirty years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	5	17	And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years ; and he died .
KJ21	Genesis	5	18	And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years , and he begot Enoch .
KJ21	Genesis	5	19	And Jared lived after he begot Enoch eight hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	5	20	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years ; and he died .
KJ21	Genesis	5	21	And Enoch lived sixty and five years , and begot Methuselah .
KJ21	Genesis	5	22	And Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah three hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	5	23	And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years .
KJ21	Genesis	5	24	And Enoch walked with God ; and he was not , for God took him .
KJ21	Genesis	5	25	And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years , and begot Lamech .
KJ21	Genesis	5	26	And Methuselah lived after he begot Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	5	27	And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years ; and he died .
KJ21	Genesis	5	28	And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years , and begot a son .
KJ21	Genesis	5	29	And he called his name Noah , saying , “ This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands , because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed. ”
KJ21	Genesis	5	30	And Lamech lived after he begot Noah five hundred ninety and five years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	5	31	And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years ; and he died .
KJ21	Genesis	5	32	And Noah was five hundred years old ; and Noah begot Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
KJ21	Genesis	6	6	And the Lord repented that He had made man on the earth , and it grieved Him in His heart .
KJ21	Genesis	6	2	that the sons of God saw the daughters of men , that they were fair ; and they took for themselves wives of all whom they chose .
KJ21	Genesis	6	3	And the Lord said , “ My Spirit shall not always strive with man , for he also is flesh ; yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years. ”
KJ21	Genesis	6	4	There were giants on the earth in those days ; and also after that , when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bore children to them , the same became mighty men who were of old , men of renown .
KJ21	Genesis	6	5	And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagining of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
KJ21	Genesis	6	7	And the Lord said , “ I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth , both man and beast , and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air , for I repent that I have made them. ”
KJ21	Genesis	6	8	But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord .
KJ21	Genesis	6	9	These are the generations of Noah . Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations , and Noah walked with God .
KJ21	Genesis	6	10	And Noah begot three sons : Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
KJ21	Genesis	6	11	The earth also was corrupt before God , and the earth was filled with violence .
KJ21	Genesis	6	12	And God looked upon the earth , and behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	6	13	And God said unto Noah , “ The end of all flesh has come before Me , for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	6	14	Make thee an ark of gopherwood ; rooms shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt cover it within and without with pitch .
KJ21	Genesis	6	15	And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of : the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits , the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits .
KJ21	Genesis	6	16	A window shalt thou make for the ark , and to a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third stories shalt thou make it .
KJ21	Genesis	6	17	And behold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven ; and every thing that is on the earth shall die .
KJ21	Genesis	6	18	But with thee will I establish My covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark , thou and thy sons , and thy wife and thy sons ’ wives with thee .
KJ21	Genesis	6	19	And of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
KJ21	Genesis	6	20	Of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive .
KJ21	Genesis	6	21	And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be food for thee and for them. ”
KJ21	Genesis	6	22	Thus did Noah ; according to all that God commanded him , so did he .
KJ21	Genesis	7	7	And Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ’ wives with him into the ark , because of the waters of the flood .
KJ21	Genesis	7	2	Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens , the male and his female ; and of beasts that are not clean by two , the male and his female .
KJ21	Genesis	7	3	Of fowls also of the air by sevens , the male and the female , to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	7	4	For yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights , and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	7	5	And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him .
KJ21	Genesis	7	6	And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	7	8	Of clean beasts , and of beasts that are not clean , and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth ,
KJ21	Genesis	7	9	there went in two by two unto Noah into the ark , the male and the female as God had commanded Noah .
KJ21	Genesis	7	10	And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	7	11	In the six hundredth year of Noah ’ s life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , that same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened .
KJ21	Genesis	7	12	And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights .
KJ21	Genesis	7	13	In the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem and Ham and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah ’ s wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark—
KJ21	Genesis	7	14	they , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort .
KJ21	Genesis	7	15	And they went in unto Noah into the ark , two by two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life .
KJ21	Genesis	7	16	And they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him ; and the Lord shut him in .
KJ21	Genesis	7	17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth , and the waters increased and bore up the ark , and it was lifted up above the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	7	18	And the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth , and the ark went upon the face of the waters .
KJ21	Genesis	7	19	And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth , and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered .
KJ21	Genesis	7	20	Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail , and the mountains were covered .
KJ21	Genesis	7	21	And all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of fowl and of cattle and of beast , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
KJ21	Genesis	7	22	all in whose nostrils was the breath of life , all that was on the dry land , died .
KJ21	Genesis	7	23	And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground , both man and cattle , and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven , and they were destroyed from the earth . And Noah only remained alive , and they that were with him in the ark .
KJ21	Genesis	7	24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days .
KJ21	Genesis	8	8	Also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
KJ21	Genesis	8	2	The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained .
KJ21	Genesis	8	3	And the waters returned from off the earth continually , and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated .
KJ21	Genesis	8	4	And the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of Ararat .
KJ21	Genesis	8	5	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month . In the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
KJ21	Genesis	8	6	And it came to pass at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made .
KJ21	Genesis	8	7	And he sent forth a raven , which went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	8	9	but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot , and she returned unto him into the ark , for the waters were on the face of the whole earth . Then he put forth his hand and took her , and pulled her in unto him into the ark .
KJ21	Genesis	8	10	And he stayed yet another seven days , and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark .
KJ21	Genesis	8	11	And the dove came in to him in the evening , and lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off ; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	8	12	And he stayed yet another seven days and sent forth the dove , which returned not again unto him any more .
KJ21	Genesis	8	13	And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dried up from off the earth ; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked , and behold , the face of the ground was dry .
KJ21	Genesis	8	14	And in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried .
KJ21	Genesis	8	15	And God spoke unto Noah , saying ,
KJ21	Genesis	8	16	“ Go forth from the ark , thou and thy wife , and thy sons and thy sons ’ wives with thee .
KJ21	Genesis	8	17	Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh , both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , that they may breed abundantly on the earth , and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	8	18	And Noah went forth , and his sons and his wife and his sons ’ wives with him .
KJ21	Genesis	8	19	Every beast , every creeping thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the ark .
KJ21	Genesis	8	20	And Noah built an altar unto the Lord , and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
KJ21	Genesis	8	21	And the Lord smelled a sweet savor ; and the Lord said in His heart , “ I will not again curse the ground any more for man ’ s sake , for the imagination of man ’ s heart is evil from his youth ; neither will I again smite any more every thing living , as I have done .
KJ21	Genesis	8	22	While the earth remaineth , seedtime and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease . ”
KJ21	Genesis	9	9	“ And I , behold , I establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you ,
KJ21	Genesis	9	2	And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth , and upon every fowl of the air , upon all that moveth upon the earth , and upon all the fishes of the sea ; into your hand are they delivered .
KJ21	Genesis	9	3	Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things .
KJ21	Genesis	9	4	“ But flesh with the life thereof , which is the blood thereof , shall ye not eat .
KJ21	Genesis	9	5	And surely your blood of your lives will I require . At the hand of every beast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man ’ s brother will I require the life of man .
KJ21	Genesis	9	6	Whoso sheddeth man ’ s blood , by man shall his blood be shed ; for in the image of God made He man .
KJ21	Genesis	9	7	And you , be ye fruitful and multiply ; bring forth abundantly in the earth , and multiply therein. ”
KJ21	Genesis	9	8	And God spoke unto Noah and to his sons with him , saying ,
KJ21	Genesis	9	10	and with every living creature that is with you — of the fowl , of the cattle , and of every beast of the earth with you , from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	9	11	And I will establish My covenant with you : Neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	9	12	And God said , “ This is the token of the covenant which I make between Me and you and every living creature that is with you , for perpetual generations :
KJ21	Genesis	9	13	I do set My rainbow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	9	14	And it shall come to pass , when I bring a cloud over the earth , that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud .
KJ21	Genesis	9	15	And I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh , and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
KJ21	Genesis	9	16	And the rainbow shall be in the cloud ; and I will look upon it , that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	9	17	And God said unto Noah , “ This is the token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	9	18	And the sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth ; and Ham is the father of Canaan .
KJ21	Genesis	9	19	These are the three sons of Noah , and from them was the whole earth overspread .
KJ21	Genesis	9	20	And Noah began to be a husbandman , and he planted a vineyard .
KJ21	Genesis	9	21	And he drank of the wine , and was drunken ; and he was uncovered within his tent .
KJ21	Genesis	9	22	And Ham , the father of Canaan , saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren outside .
KJ21	Genesis	9	23	And Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were turned away , and they saw not their father ’ s nakedness .
KJ21	Genesis	9	24	And Noah awoke from his wine , and knew what his younger son had done unto him .
KJ21	Genesis	9	25	And he said , “ Cursed be Canaan ! A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. ”
KJ21	Genesis	9	26	And he said , “ Blessed be the Lord God of Shem ; and Canaan shall be his servant .
KJ21	Genesis	9	27	God shall enlarge Japheth , and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem ; and Canaan shall be his servant. ”
KJ21	Genesis	9	28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years .
KJ21	Genesis	9	29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years , and he died .
KJ21	Genesis	10	10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech , and Accad , and Calneh , in the land of Shinar .
KJ21	Genesis	10	2	The sons of Japheth : Gomer , and Magog , and Madai , and Javan , and Tubal , and Meshech , and Tiras .
KJ21	Genesis	10	3	And the sons of Gomer : Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah .
KJ21	Genesis	10	4	And the sons of Javan : Elishah and Tarshish , Kittim and Dodanim .
KJ21	Genesis	10	5	By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided into their lands , every one after his own tongue , according to their families , into their nations .
KJ21	Genesis	10	6	And the sons of Ham : Cush and Mizraim , and Put and Canaan .
KJ21	Genesis	10	7	And the sons of Cush : Seba and Havilah , and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabtechah ; and the sons of Raamah : Sheba , and Dedan .
KJ21	Genesis	10	8	And Cush begot Nimrod ; he began to be a mighty one on the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	10	9	He was a mighty hunter before the Lord ; therefore it is said , “ Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. ”
KJ21	Genesis	10	11	Out of that land he went forth to Assyria , and built Nineveh and the city Rehoboth , and Calah ,
KJ21	Genesis	10	12	and Resen between Nineveh and Calah ; the same is a great city .
KJ21	Genesis	10	13	And Mizraim begot Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim , and Naphtuhim
KJ21	Genesis	10	14	and Pathrusim and Casluhim ( out of whom came the Philistines ) and Caphtorim .
KJ21	Genesis	10	15	And Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn , and Heth ;
KJ21	Genesis	10	16	and the Jebusite and the Amorite , and the Girgashite
KJ21	Genesis	10	17	and the Hivite , and the Arkite and the Sinite ,
KJ21	Genesis	10	18	and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite ; and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad .
KJ21	Genesis	10	19	And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as thou comest to Gerar , unto Gaza ; and as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah , and Admah and Zeboiim , even unto Lasha .
KJ21	Genesis	10	20	These are the sons of Ham , according to their families , according to their tongues , in their countries and in their nations .
KJ21	Genesis	10	21	Unto Shem also , the father of all the children of Eber , the brother of Japheth the elder , even to him were children born .
KJ21	Genesis	10	22	The children of Shem : Elam and Asshur , and Arphaxad and Lud and Aram .
KJ21	Genesis	10	23	And the children of Aram : Uz and Hul , and Gether and Mash .
KJ21	Genesis	10	24	And Arphaxad begot Salah , and Salah begot Eber .
KJ21	Genesis	10	25	And unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg , for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother ’ s name was Joktan .
KJ21	Genesis	10	26	And Joktan begot Almodad and Sheleph , and Hazarmaveth and Jerah ,
KJ21	Genesis	10	27	and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah ,
KJ21	Genesis	10	28	and Obal and Abimael and Sheba ,
KJ21	Genesis	10	29	and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab ; all these were the sons of Joktan .
KJ21	Genesis	10	30	And their dwelling was from Mesha as thou goest unto Sephar , a mount of the east .
KJ21	Genesis	10	31	These are the sons of Shem , according to their families , according to their tongues , in their lands , according to their nations .
KJ21	Genesis	10	32	These are the families of the sons of Noah , according to their generations , in their nations ; and by these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood .
KJ21	Genesis	11	11	and Shem lived after he begot Arphaxad five hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	11	2	And it came to pass , as they journeyed from the east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar , and they dwelt there .
KJ21	Genesis	11	3	And they said one to another , “ Come , let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly. ” And they had brick for stone , and slime had they for mortar .
KJ21	Genesis	11	4	And they said , “ Come , let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let us make us a name , lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	11	5	And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built .
KJ21	Genesis	11	6	And the Lord said , “ Behold , the people are one and they have all one language , and this they begin to do ; and now nothing will be withheld from them which they have imagined to do .
KJ21	Genesis	11	7	Come , let Us go down , and there confound their language , that they may not understand one another ’ s speech. ”
KJ21	Genesis	11	8	So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth ; and they left off building the city .
KJ21	Genesis	11	9	Therefore is the name of it called Babel [ that is , Confusion ] , because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth ; and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	11	10	These are the generations of Shem : Shem was a hundred years old and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood ;
KJ21	Genesis	11	12	And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begot Salah ;
KJ21	Genesis	11	13	and Arphaxad lived after he begot Salah four hundred and three years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	11	14	And Salah lived thirty years and begot Eber ;
KJ21	Genesis	11	15	and Salah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	11	16	And Eber lived four and thirty years and begot Peleg ;
KJ21	Genesis	11	17	and Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	11	18	And Peleg lived thirty years and begot Reu ;
KJ21	Genesis	11	19	and Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	11	20	And Reu lived two and thirty years and begot Serug ;
KJ21	Genesis	11	21	and Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	11	22	And Serug lived thirty years and begot Nahor ;
KJ21	Genesis	11	23	and Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	11	24	And Nahor lived nine and twenty years and begot Terah ;
KJ21	Genesis	11	25	and Nahor lived after he begot Terah one hundred and nineteen years , and begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	11	26	And Terah lived seventy years and begot Abram , Nahor , and Haran .
KJ21	Genesis	11	27	Now these are the generations of Terah : Terah begot Abram , Nahor , and Haran ; and Haran begot Lot .
KJ21	Genesis	11	28	And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity , in Ur of the Chaldeans .
KJ21	Genesis	11	29	And Abram and Nahor took for themselves wives : the name of Abram ’ s wife was Sarai , and the name of Nahor ’ s wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah , and the father of Iscah .
KJ21	Genesis	11	30	But Sarai was barren ; she had no child .
KJ21	Genesis	11	31	And Terah took Abram his son , and Lot the son of Haran his son ’ s son , and Sarai his daughter-in-law , his son Abram ’ s wife ; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan ; and they came unto Haran and dwelt there .
KJ21	Genesis	11	32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years , and Terah died in Haran .
KJ21	Genesis	12	12	Therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , ‘ This is his wife ’ ; and they will kill me , but they will save thee alive .
KJ21	Genesis	12	2	And I will make of thee a great nation , and I will bless thee and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing .
KJ21	Genesis	12	3	And I will bless them that bless thee , and curse him that curseth thee ; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. ”
KJ21	Genesis	12	4	So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him , and Lot went with him ; and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran .
KJ21	Genesis	12	5	And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother ’ s son , and all their substance that they had gathered , and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran ; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan , and into the land of Canaan they came .
KJ21	Genesis	12	6	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem , unto the plain of Moreh . And the Canaanites were then in the land .
KJ21	Genesis	12	7	And the Lord appeared unto Abram and said , “ Unto thy seed will I give this land. ” And there built he an altar unto the Lord , who appeared unto him .
KJ21	Genesis	12	8	And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent , having Bethel on the west and Ai on the east ; and there he built an altar unto the Lord , and called upon the name of the Lord .
KJ21	Genesis	12	9	And Abram journeyed , going on still toward the south .
KJ21	Genesis	12	10	And there was a famine in the land ; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there , for the famine was grievous in the land .
KJ21	Genesis	12	11	And it came to pass , when he had come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sarai his wife , “ Behold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon .
KJ21	Genesis	12	13	Say , I pray thee , thou art my sister , that it may be well with me for thy sake , and my soul shall live because of thee. ”
KJ21	Genesis	12	14	And it came to pass , when Abram had come into Egypt , that the Egyptians beheld the woman , that she was very fair .
KJ21	Genesis	12	15	The princes also of Pharaoh saw her , and commended her before Pharaoh ; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh ’ s house .
KJ21	Genesis	12	16	And he treated Abram well for her sake ; and he had sheep and oxen and heasses , and menservants and maidservants , and sheasses and camels .
KJ21	Genesis	12	17	And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai , Abram ’ s wife .
KJ21	Genesis	12	18	And Pharaoh called Abram and said , “ What is this that thou hast done unto me ? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
KJ21	Genesis	12	19	Why saidst thou , ‘ She is my sister , ’ so I might have taken her to me for a wife ? Now therefore behold thy wife ; take her and go thy way. ”
KJ21	Genesis	12	20	And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him ; and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had .
KJ21	Genesis	13	13	But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly .
KJ21	Genesis	13	2	And Abram was very rich in cattle , in silver , and in gold .
KJ21	Genesis	13	3	And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Bethel and Ai ,
KJ21	Genesis	13	4	unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first ; and there Abram called on the name of the Lord .
KJ21	Genesis	13	5	And Lot also , who went with Abram , had flocks and herds and tents .
KJ21	Genesis	13	6	And the land was not able to bear them , that they might dwell together ; for their substance was great , so that they could not dwell together .
KJ21	Genesis	13	7	And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram ’ s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot ’ s cattle ; and the Canaanites and the Perizzites dwelled then in the land .
KJ21	Genesis	13	8	And Abram said unto Lot , “ Let there be no strife , I pray thee , between me and thee and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen ; for we are brethren .
KJ21	Genesis	13	9	Is not the whole land before thee ? Separate thyself , I pray thee , from me . If thou wilt take the left hand , then I will go to the right , or if thou depart to the right hand , then I will go to the left. ”
KJ21	Genesis	13	10	And Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan , that it was well watered everywhere ( before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah ) , even as the garden of the Lord , like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto Zoar .
KJ21	Genesis	13	11	Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan ; and Lot journeyed east , and they separated themselves the one from the other .
KJ21	Genesis	13	12	Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan , and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain , and pitched his tent toward Sodom .
KJ21	Genesis	13	14	And the Lord said unto Abram after Lot was separated from him , “ Lift up now thine eyes , and look from the place where thou art , northward and southward and eastward and westward ;
KJ21	Genesis	13	15	for all the land which thou seest , to thee will I give it and to thy seed for ever .
KJ21	Genesis	13	16	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth , so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbered .
KJ21	Genesis	13	17	Arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it , for I will give it unto thee. ”
KJ21	Genesis	13	18	Then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre , which is in Hebron , and built there an altar unto the Lord .
KJ21	Genesis	14	14	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive , he armed his trained servants , born in his own house ( three hundred and eighteen ) , and pursued them unto Dan .
KJ21	Genesis	14	2	that these made war with Bera king of Sodom , and with Birsha king of Gomorrah , Shinab king of Admah , and Shemeber king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela , which is Zoar .
KJ21	Genesis	14	3	All these were joined together in the Vale of Siddim , which is the Salt Sea .
KJ21	Genesis	14	4	Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth year they rebelled .
KJ21	Genesis	14	5	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him , and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim , and the Zuzim in Ham , and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim ,
KJ21	Genesis	14	6	and the Horites in their Mount Seir , unto Elparan , which is by the wilderness .
KJ21	Genesis	14	7	And they returned and came to Enmishpat , which is Kadesh , and smote all the country of the Amalekites and also the Amorites , who dwelt in Hazezontamar .
KJ21	Genesis	14	8	And there went out the king of Sodom , and the king of Gomorrah , and the king of Admah , and the king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( the same is Zoar ) , and they joined battle with them in the Vale of Siddim ,
KJ21	Genesis	14	9	against Chedorlaomer the king of Elam , and against Tidal king of nations , and Amraphel king of Shinar , and Arioch king of Ellasar — four kings against five .
KJ21	Genesis	14	10	And the Vale of Siddim was full of slime pits ; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there , and those who remained fled to the mountain .
KJ21	Genesis	14	11	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their victuals , and went their way .
KJ21	Genesis	14	12	And they took Lot , Abram ’ s brother ’ s son , who dwelt in Sodom , and his goods and departed .
KJ21	Genesis	14	13	And there came one who had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew , for he dwelt on the plain of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner ; and these were confederate with Abram .
KJ21	Genesis	14	15	And he divided himself against them , he and his servants by night , and smote them and pursued them unto Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
KJ21	Genesis	14	16	And he brought back all the goods , and also brought again his brother Lot and his goods , and the women also and the people .
KJ21	Genesis	14	17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh ( which is the King ’ s Dale ) after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and of the kings who were with him .
KJ21	Genesis	14	18	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine ; and he was the priest of the Most High God .
KJ21	Genesis	14	19	And he blessed him and said , “ Blessed be Abram of the Most High God , possessor of heaven and earth ;
KJ21	Genesis	14	20	and blessed be the Most High God , who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. ” And he gave him tithes of all .
KJ21	Genesis	14	21	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram , “ Give me the persons , and take the goods for thyself. ”
KJ21	Genesis	14	22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom , “ I have lifted up mine hand unto the Lord , the Most High God , the possessor of heaven and earth ,
KJ21	Genesis	14	23	that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe strap , and that I will not take any thing that is thine , lest thou shouldest say , ‘ I have made Abram rich ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	14	24	except only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men who went with me : Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre ; let them take their portion . ”
KJ21	Genesis	15	15	And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried at a good old age .
KJ21	Genesis	15	2	And Abram said , “ Lord God , what wilt Thou give me , seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	15	3	And Abram said , “ Behold , to me Thou hast given no seed ; and lo , one born in my house is mine heir. ”
KJ21	Genesis	15	4	And behold , the word of the Lord came unto him , saying , “ This shall not be thine heir , but he that shall come forth out of thine own loins shall be thine heir. ”
KJ21	Genesis	15	5	And He brought him forth outdoors and said , “ Look now toward heaven and count the stars , if thou be able to number them. ” And He said unto him , “ So shall thy seed be. ”
KJ21	Genesis	15	6	And he believed in the Lord ; and He accounted it to him for righteousness .
KJ21	Genesis	15	7	And He said unto him , “ I am the Lord who brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans , to give thee this land to inherit it. ”
KJ21	Genesis	15	8	And he said , “ Lord God , whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	15	9	And He said unto him , “ Take Me a heifer of three years old , and a shegoat of three years old , and a ram of three years old , and a turtledove , and a young pigeon. ”
KJ21	Genesis	15	10	And he took unto Him all these , and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another ; but the birds divided he not .
KJ21	Genesis	15	11	And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses , Abram drove them away .
KJ21	Genesis	15	12	And when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and lo , a horror of great darkness fell upon him .
KJ21	Genesis	15	13	And He said unto Abram , “ Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years .
KJ21	Genesis	15	14	And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge , and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
KJ21	Genesis	15	16	But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again , for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. ”
KJ21	Genesis	15	17	And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark , behold , a smoking furnace and a burning lamp passed between those pieces .
KJ21	Genesis	15	18	On the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram , saying , “ Unto thy seed have I given this land , from the river of Egypt unto the great river , the River Euphrates :
KJ21	Genesis	15	19	the Kenites and the Kenizzites and the Kadmonites ,
KJ21	Genesis	15	20	and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Rephaim ,
KJ21	Genesis	15	21	and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Girgashites and the Jebusites . ”
KJ21	Genesis	16	16	And Abram was fourscore and six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram .
KJ21	Genesis	16	2	And Sarai said unto Abram , “ Behold now , the Lord hath restrained me from bearing . I pray thee , go in unto my maid . It may be that I may obtain children by her. ” And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai .
KJ21	Genesis	16	3	And Sarai , Abram ’ s wife , took Hagar her maid , the Egyptian , after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife .
KJ21	Genesis	16	4	And he went in unto Hagar , and she conceived . And when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
KJ21	Genesis	16	5	And Sarai said unto Abram , “ My wrong be upon thee . I have given my maid into thy bosom ; and when she saw that she had conceived , I was despised in her eyes . The Lord judge between me and thee. ”
KJ21	Genesis	16	6	But Abram said unto Sarai , “ Behold , thy maid is in thy hand . Do to her as it pleaseth thee. ” And when Sarai dealt harshly with her , she fled from her face .
KJ21	Genesis	16	7	And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain on the way to Shur .
KJ21	Genesis	16	8	And he said , “ Hagar , Sarai ’ s maid , whence camest thou ? And whither wilt thou go ? ” And she said , “ I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. ”
KJ21	Genesis	16	9	And the angel of the Lord said unto her , “ Return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under her hands. ”
KJ21	Genesis	16	10	And the angel of the Lord said unto her , “ I will multiply thy seed exceedingly , that it shall not be numbered for multitude. ”
KJ21	Genesis	16	11	And the angel of the Lord said unto her , “ Behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name Ishmael [ that is , God shall hear ] , because the Lord hath heard thy affliction .
KJ21	Genesis	16	12	And he will be a wild man . His hand will be against every man , and every man ’ s hand against him ; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. ”
KJ21	Genesis	16	13	And she called the name of the Lord who spoke unto her : “ Thou God seest me. ” For she said , “ Have I also here looked upon Him that seeth me ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	16	14	Therefore the well was called Beerlahairoi [ that is , The well of Him that liveth and seeth me ] . Behold , it is between Kadesh and Bered .
KJ21	Genesis	16	15	And Hagar bore Abram a son ; and Abram called his son ’ s name , whom Hagar bore , Ishmael .
KJ21	Genesis	17	17	Then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed , and said in his heart , “ Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old ? And shall Sarah , who is ninety years old , bear ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	17	2	And I will make My covenant between Me and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly. ”
KJ21	Genesis	17	3	And Abram fell on his face ; and God talked with him , saying ,
KJ21	Genesis	17	4	“ As for Me , behold , My covenant is with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nations .
KJ21	Genesis	17	5	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram , but thy name shall be Abraham ; for a father of many nations have I made thee .
KJ21	Genesis	17	6	And I will make thee exceeding fruitful , and I will make nations of thee , and kings shall come out of thee .
KJ21	Genesis	17	7	And I will establish My covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant , to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee .
KJ21	Genesis	17	8	And I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God. ”
KJ21	Genesis	17	9	And God said unto Abraham , “ Thou shalt keep My covenant , therefore , thou and thy seed after thee in their generations .
KJ21	Genesis	17	10	This is My covenant which ye shall keep between Me and you and thy seed after thee : every manchild among you shall be circumcised .
KJ21	Genesis	17	11	And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin ; and it shall be a token of the covenant between Me and you .
KJ21	Genesis	17	12	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you , every manchild in your generations , he that is born in the house or bought with money from any stranger who is not of thy seed .
KJ21	Genesis	17	13	He that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must be circumcised ; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
KJ21	Genesis	17	14	And the uncircumcised manchild whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised , that soul shall be cut off from his people ; he hath broken My covenant. ”
KJ21	Genesis	17	15	And God said unto Abraham , “ As for Sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call her name Sarai , but Sarah shall her name be .
KJ21	Genesis	17	16	And I will bless her and give thee a son also by her . Yea , I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her. ”
KJ21	Genesis	17	18	And Abraham said unto God , “ O that Ishmael might live before Thee ! ”
KJ21	Genesis	17	19	And God said , “ Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed , and thou shalt call his name Isaac ; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant , and with his seed after him .
KJ21	Genesis	17	20	And as for Ishmael , I have heard thee . Behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly . Twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation .
KJ21	Genesis	17	21	But My covenant will I establish with Isaac , whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. ”
KJ21	Genesis	17	22	And He left off talking with him , and God went up from Abraham .
KJ21	Genesis	17	23	And Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham ’ s house , and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day , as God had said unto him .
KJ21	Genesis	17	24	And Abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
KJ21	Genesis	17	25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
KJ21	Genesis	17	26	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised , and Ishmael his son .
KJ21	Genesis	17	27	And all the men of his house , born in the house , and bought with money from the stranger , were circumcised with him .
KJ21	Genesis	18	18	seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him ?
KJ21	Genesis	18	2	And he lifted up his eyes and looked , and lo , three men stood by him . And when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bowed himself toward the ground
KJ21	Genesis	18	3	and said , “ My lord , if now I have found favor in thy sight , pass not away , I pray thee , from thy servant .
KJ21	Genesis	18	4	Let a little water , I pray you , be fetched , and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree ;
KJ21	Genesis	18	5	and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts . After that ye shall pass on , for therefor are ye come to your servant. ” And they said , “ So do , as thou hast said. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	6	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah , and said , “ Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes upon the hearth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	7	And Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf , tender and good , and gave it unto a young man , and he hastened to dress it .
KJ21	Genesis	18	8	And he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed , and set it before them ; and he stood by them under the tree , and they ate .
KJ21	Genesis	18	9	And they said unto him , “ Where is Sarah thy wife ? ” And he said , “ Behold , in the tent. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	10	And he said , “ I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life ; and lo , Sarah thy wife shall have a son. ” And Sarah heard it from the tent door , which was behind him .
KJ21	Genesis	18	11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age , and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women .
KJ21	Genesis	18	12	Therefore Sarah laughed within herself , saying , “ After I have waxed old shall I have pleasure , my lord being old also ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	13	And the Lord said unto Abraham , “ Why did Sarah laugh , saying , ‘ Shall I of a surety bear a child , who am old ? ’
KJ21	Genesis	18	14	Is any thing too hard for the Lord ? At the time appointed I will return unto thee , according to the time of life , and Sarah shall have a son. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	15	Then Sarah denied , saying , “ I laughed not , ” for she was afraid . And He said , “ Nay , but thou didst laugh. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	16	And the men rose up from thence , and looked toward Sodom ; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way .
KJ21	Genesis	18	17	And the Lord said , “ Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do ,
KJ21	Genesis	18	19	For I know him , that he will command his children and his household after him , and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment , that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	20	And the Lord said , “ Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great , and because their sin is very grievous ,
KJ21	Genesis	18	21	I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which has come unto Me ; and if not , I will know. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	22	And the men turned their faces from thence , and went toward Sodom ; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord .
KJ21	Genesis	18	23	And Abraham drew near and said , “ Wilt Thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
KJ21	Genesis	18	24	Perhaps there be fifty righteous within the city ; wilt Thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein ?
KJ21	Genesis	18	25	That be far from Thee to do in this manner — to slay the righteous with the wicked ; and that the righteous should be as the wicked , that be far from Thee ! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	26	And the Lord said , “ If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their sakes. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	27	And Abraham answered and said , “ Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord , I , who am but dust and ashes .
KJ21	Genesis	18	28	Perhaps there shall lack five of the fifty righteous ; wilt Thou destroy all the city for lack of five ? ” And He said , “ If I find there forty and five , I will not destroy it. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	29	And he spoke unto Him yet again and said , “ Perhaps there shall be forty found there ? ” And He said , “ I will not do it for forty ’ s sake. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	30	And he said unto Him , “ Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak : Perhaps there shall thirty be found there. ” And He said , “ I will not do it if I find thirty there. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	31	And he said , “ Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord : Perhaps there shall be twenty found there. ” And He said , “ I will not destroy it for twenty ’ s sake. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	32	And he said , “ Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak yet but this once : Perhaps ten shall be found there. ” And He said , “ I will not destroy it for ten ’ s sake. ”
KJ21	Genesis	18	33	And the Lord went His way , as soon as He had finished communing with Abraham ; and Abraham returned unto his place .
KJ21	Genesis	19	19	Behold now , thy servant hath found grace in thy sight , and thou hast magnified thy mercy , which thou hast shown unto me in saving my life ; and I can not escape to the mountain , lest some evil take me , and I die .
KJ21	Genesis	19	2	and he said , “ Behold now , my lords , turn in , I pray you , into your servant ’ s house and tarry all night , and wash your feet , and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways. ” And they said , “ Nay , but we will remain in the street all night. ”
KJ21	Genesis	19	3	And he pressed upon them greatly , and they turned in unto him and entered into his house ; and he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread , and they ate .
KJ21	Genesis	19	4	But before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom — both young and old , all the people from every quarter —compassed the house around .
KJ21	Genesis	19	5	And they called unto Lot and said unto him , “ Where are the men who came in to thee this night ? Bring them out unto us , that we may know them. ”
KJ21	Genesis	19	6	And Lot went out at the door unto them , and shut the door after him
KJ21	Genesis	19	7	and said , “ I pray you , brethren , do not so wickedly .
KJ21	Genesis	19	8	Behold now , I have two daughters who have not known a man . Let me , I pray you , bring them out unto you , and do ye to them as is good in your eyes . Only unto these men do nothing , for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. ”
KJ21	Genesis	19	9	And they said , “ Stand back. ” And they said again , “ This one fellow came in to sojourn , and he will become a judge ! Now will we deal worse with thee than with them. ” And they pressed sore upon the man , even Lot , and came near to break the door .
KJ21	Genesis	19	10	But the men put forth their hands , and pulled Lot into the house to them , and shut the door .
KJ21	Genesis	19	11	And they smote the men who were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great , so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
KJ21	Genesis	19	12	And the men said unto Lot , “ Hast thou here any besides ? Soninlaw , and thy sons , and thy daughters , and whomsoever thou hast in the city — bring them out of this place .
KJ21	Genesis	19	13	For we will destroy this place , because the cry of them has waxed great before the face of the Lord , and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it. ”
KJ21	Genesis	19	14	And Lot went out and spoke unto his sons-in-law , who married his daughters , and said , “ Up , get ye out of this place ; for the Lord will destroy this city ! ” But he seemed as one who mocked unto his sons-in-law .
KJ21	Genesis	19	15	And when the morning arose , then the angels hastened Lot , saying , “ Arise , take thy wife and thy two daughters who are here , lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. ”
KJ21	Genesis	19	16	And while he lingered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters , the Lord being merciful unto him ; and they brought him forth and set him outside the city .
KJ21	Genesis	19	17	And it came to pass , when they had brought them forth outside , that he said , “ Escape for thy life ! Look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain . Escape to the mountain , lest thou be consumed ! ”
KJ21	Genesis	19	18	And Lot said unto them , “ Oh , not so , my lord .
KJ21	Genesis	19	20	Behold now , this city is near enough to flee unto , and it is a little one . Oh , let me escape thither , ( is it not a little one ? ) and my soul shall live. ”
KJ21	Genesis	19	21	And he said unto him , “ See , I have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow this city for which thou hast spoken .
KJ21	Genesis	19	22	Hasten thee , escape thither ; for I can not do any thing till thou hast come thither. ” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar .
KJ21	Genesis	19	23	The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar .
KJ21	Genesis	19	24	Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire , from the Lord out of heaven ;
KJ21	Genesis	19	25	and He overthrew those cities , and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
KJ21	Genesis	19	26	But his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
KJ21	Genesis	19	27	And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord ;
KJ21	Genesis	19	28	and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld . And lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
KJ21	Genesis	19	29	And it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt .
KJ21	Genesis	19	30	And Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt on the mountain , and his two daughters with him , for he feared to dwell in Zoar ; and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	19	31	And the firstborn said unto the younger , “ Our father is old , and there is not a man on the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	19	32	Come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father. ”
KJ21	Genesis	19	33	And they made their father drink wine that night , and the firstborn went in and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
KJ21	Genesis	19	34	And it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger , “ Behold , I lay yesternight with my father . Let us make him drink wine this night also , and go thou in and lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father. ”
KJ21	Genesis	19	35	And they made their father drink wine that night also . And the younger arose and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
KJ21	Genesis	19	36	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father .
KJ21	Genesis	19	37	And the firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab ; the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day .
KJ21	Genesis	19	38	And the younger , she also bore a son and called his name Benammi ; the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day .
KJ21	Genesis	20	20	And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country , and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in Gerar .
KJ21	Genesis	20	2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife , “ She is my sister. ” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah .
KJ21	Genesis	20	3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and said to him , “ Behold , thou art but a dead man , because of the woman whom thou hast taken ; for she is a man ’ s wife. ”
KJ21	Genesis	20	4	But Abimelech had not come near her ; and he said , “ Lord , wilt Thou slay also a righteous nation ?
KJ21	Genesis	20	5	Said he not unto me , ‘ She is my sister ’ ? And she , even she herself said , ‘ He is my brother. ’ In the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. ”
KJ21	Genesis	20	6	And God said unto him in a dream , “ Yea , I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart , for I also withheld thee from sinning against Me . Therefore I suffered thee not to touch her .
KJ21	Genesis	20	7	Now therefore restore the man his wife ; for he is a prophet , and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live . And if thou restore her not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou and all that are thine. ”
KJ21	Genesis	20	8	Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their hearing ; and the men were sore afraid .
KJ21	Genesis	20	9	Then Abimelech called Abraham and said unto him , “ What hast thou done unto us ? And how have I offended thee , that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin ? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. ”
KJ21	Genesis	20	10	And Abimelech said unto Abraham , “ What sawest thou , that thou hast done this thing ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	20	11	And Abraham said , “ Because I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place , and they will slay me for my wife ’ s sake .
KJ21	Genesis	20	12	And yet indeed she is my sister : she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother , and she became my wife .
KJ21	Genesis	20	13	And it came to pass , when God caused me to wander from my father ’ s house , that I said unto her , ‘ This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me : at every place whither we shall come , say of me , “ He is my brother. ” ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	20	14	And Abimelech took sheep and oxen , and menservants and womenservants , and gave them unto Abraham , and restored to him Sarah his wife .
KJ21	Genesis	20	15	And Abimelech said , “ Behold , my land is before thee . Dwell where it pleaseth thee. ”
KJ21	Genesis	20	16	And unto Sarah he said , “ Behold , I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver ; behold , he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all who are with thee and with all other. ” Thus she was reproved .
KJ21	Genesis	20	17	So Abraham prayed unto God . And God healed Abimelech , and his wife and his maidservants ; and they bore children ,
KJ21	Genesis	20	18	for the Lord had closed up fast all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah , Abraham ’ s wife .
KJ21	Genesis	21	21	And he dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran , and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	21	2	For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
KJ21	Genesis	21	3	And Abraham called the name of his son who was born unto him , whom Sarah bore to him , Isaac .
KJ21	Genesis	21	4	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac , being eight days old , as God had commanded him .
KJ21	Genesis	21	5	And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto him .
KJ21	Genesis	21	6	And Sarah said , “ God hath made me laugh , so that all who hear will laugh with me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	21	7	And she said , “ Who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children suck ? For I have borne him a son in his old age. ”
KJ21	Genesis	21	8	And the child grew , and was weaned ; and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned .
KJ21	Genesis	21	9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian , whom she had borne unto Abraham , mocking .
KJ21	Genesis	21	10	Therefore she said unto Abraham , “ Cast out this bondwoman and her son ; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with Isaac. ”
KJ21	Genesis	21	11	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham ’ s sight because of his son .
KJ21	Genesis	21	12	And God said unto Abraham , “ Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad , and because of thy bondwoman . In all that Sarah hath said unto thee , hearken unto her voice ; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called .
KJ21	Genesis	21	13	And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation , because he is thy seed. ”
KJ21	Genesis	21	14	And Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread and a bottle of water ; and he gave it unto Hagar , putting it on her shoulder , and the child , and sent her away . And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba .
KJ21	Genesis	21	15	And the water in the bottle was spent , and she cast the child under one of the shrubs .
KJ21	Genesis	21	16	And she went and sat down apart from him a good way off , as it were , a bowshot ; for she said , “ Let me not see the death of the child. ” And she sat opposite him , and lifted up her voice and wept .
KJ21	Genesis	21	17	And God heard the voice of the lad ; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her , “ What aileth thee , Hagar ? Fear not , for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is .
KJ21	Genesis	21	18	Arise ; lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand , for I will make him a great nation. ”
KJ21	Genesis	21	19	And God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water ; and she went and filled the bottle with water , and gave the lad drink .
KJ21	Genesis	21	20	And God was with the lad ; and he grew , and dwelt in the wilderness , and became an archer .
KJ21	Genesis	21	22	And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phichol , the chief captain of his host , spoke unto Abraham , saying , “ God is with thee in all that thou doest .
KJ21	Genesis	21	23	Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me , nor with my son , nor with my son ’ s son ; but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee , thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. ”
KJ21	Genesis	21	24	And Abraham said , “ I will swear. ”
KJ21	Genesis	21	25	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech ’ s servants had violently taken away .
KJ21	Genesis	21	26	And Abimelech said , “ I know not who hath done this thing ; neither didst thou tell me , neither yet heard I of it until today. ”
KJ21	Genesis	21	27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto Abimelech , and both of them made a covenant .
KJ21	Genesis	21	28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
KJ21	Genesis	21	29	And Abimelech said unto Abraham , “ What mean these seven ewe lambs , which thou hast set by themselves ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	21	30	And he said , “ These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take from my hand , that they may be a witness unto me that I have dug this well. ”
KJ21	Genesis	21	31	Therefore he called that place Beersheba [ that is , The well of the oath ] , because there they swore , both of them .
KJ21	Genesis	21	32	Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba . Then Abimelech rose up , and Phichol the chief captain of his host , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
KJ21	Genesis	21	33	And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba , and called there on the name of the Lord , the Everlasting God .
KJ21	Genesis	21	34	And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines ’ land many days .
KJ21	Genesis	22	22	and Chesed and Hazo , and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel. ”
KJ21	Genesis	22	2	And He said , “ Take now thy son , thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest , and get thee into the land of Moriah , and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. ”
KJ21	Genesis	22	3	And Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son ; and he cleaved the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him .
KJ21	Genesis	22	4	Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place afar off .
KJ21	Genesis	22	5	And Abraham said unto his young men , “ Abide ye here with the ass ; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you. ”
KJ21	Genesis	22	6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand and a knife , and they went both of them together .
KJ21	Genesis	22	7	And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father and said , “ My father ! ” And he said , “ Here am I , my son. ” And he said , “ Behold the fire and the wood ; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	22	8	And Abraham said , “ My son , God will provide Himself a lamb for a burnt offering. ” So they went both of them together .
KJ21	Genesis	22	9	And they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
KJ21	Genesis	22	10	And Abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
KJ21	Genesis	22	11	And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said , “ Abraham , Abraham ! ” And he said , “ Here am I. ”
KJ21	Genesis	22	12	And He said , “ Lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him ; for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son , from Me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	22	13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked ; and behold , behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns . And Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
KJ21	Genesis	22	14	And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh [ that is , The Lord will provide ] ; as it is said to this day , “ In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen. ”
KJ21	Genesis	22	15	And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time
KJ21	Genesis	22	16	and said , “ By Myself have I sworn , saith the Lord , for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son , thine only son ,
KJ21	Genesis	22	17	in blessing I will bless thee , and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore ; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies .
KJ21	Genesis	22	18	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed , because thou hast obeyed My voice. ”
KJ21	Genesis	22	19	So Abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to Beersheba ; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba .
KJ21	Genesis	22	20	And it came to pass after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , “ Behold Milcah , she hath also borne children unto thy brother Nahor :
KJ21	Genesis	22	21	Huz his firstborn , and Buz his brother , and Kemuel the father of Aram ,
KJ21	Genesis	22	23	And Bethuel begot Rebekah . These eight Milcah bore to Nahor , Abraham ’ s brother .
KJ21	Genesis	22	24	And his concubine , whose name was Reumah , she bore also Tebah and Gaham , and Thahash and Maachah .
KJ21	Genesis	23	23	And Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old ; these were the years of the life of Sarah .
KJ21	Genesis	23	2	And Sarah died in Kirjatharba ( the same is Hebron ) in the land of Canaan ; and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her .
KJ21	Genesis	23	3	And Abraham stood up from before his dead , and spoke unto the sons of Heth , saying ,
KJ21	Genesis	23	4	“ I am a stranger and a sojourner with you . Give me a possession for a burying place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight. ”
KJ21	Genesis	23	5	And the children of Heth answered Abraham , saying unto him ,
KJ21	Genesis	23	6	“ Hear us , my lord : Thou art a mighty prince among us ; in the choicest of our sepulchers bury thy dead . None of us shall withhold from thee his sepulcher , that thou mayest bury thy dead. ”
KJ21	Genesis	23	7	And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of Heth .
KJ21	Genesis	23	8	And he communed with them , saying , “ If it be in your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar ,
KJ21	Genesis	23	9	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he hath , which is in the end of his field . For as much money as it is worth he shall give it to me as a possession for a burying place amongst you. ”
KJ21	Genesis	23	10	And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth ; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
KJ21	Genesis	23	11	“ Nay , my lord , hear me : The field give I thee ; and the cave that is therein , I give it to thee . In the presence of the sons of my people give I it to thee ; bury thy dead. ”
KJ21	Genesis	23	12	And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land .
KJ21	Genesis	23	13	And he spoke unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land , saying , “ But if thou wilt give it , I pray thee , hear me . I will give thee money for the field . Take it from me , and I will bury my dead there. ”
KJ21	Genesis	23	14	And Ephron answered Abraham , saying unto him ,
KJ21	Genesis	23	15	“ My lord , hearken unto me : The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver . What is that between me and thee ? Bury therefore thy dead. ”
KJ21	Genesis	23	16	And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron ; and Abraham weighed the silver for Ephron which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth : four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant .
KJ21	Genesis	23	17	And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah , which was before Mamre , the field and the cave which was therein , and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders round about , were secured
KJ21	Genesis	23	18	unto Abraham as a possession in the presence of the children of Heth , before all who went in at the gate of his city .
KJ21	Genesis	23	19	And after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah , before Mamre ( the same is Hebron ) in the land of Canaan .
KJ21	Genesis	23	20	And the field and the cave that is therein were secured unto Abraham as a possession for a burying place by the sons of Heth .
KJ21	Genesis	24	24	And she said unto him , “ I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah , whom she bore unto Nahor. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	2	And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house , who ruled over all that he had , “ Put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh ;
KJ21	Genesis	24	3	and I will make thee swear by the Lord , the God of heaven and the God of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I dwell .
KJ21	Genesis	24	4	But thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred , and take a wife for my son Isaac. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	5	And the servant said unto him , “ Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land . Must I bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	6	And Abraham said unto him , “ Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again .
KJ21	Genesis	24	7	The Lord God of heaven , who took me from my father ’ s house and from the land of my kindred , and who spoke unto me and who swore unto me , saying , ‘ Unto thy seed will I give this land , ’ He shall send His angel before thee , and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence .
KJ21	Genesis	24	8	And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath ; only bring not my son thither again. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	9	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and swore to him concerning that matter .
KJ21	Genesis	24	10	And the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master and departed , for all the goods of his master were in his hand . And he arose and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor .
KJ21	Genesis	24	11	And he made his camels to kneel down outside the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
KJ21	Genesis	24	12	And he said , “ O Lord God of my master Abraham , I pray Thee , send me good speed this day , and show kindness unto my master Abraham .
KJ21	Genesis	24	13	Behold , I stand here by the well of water , and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water .
KJ21	Genesis	24	14	And let it come to pass , that the damsel to whom I shall say , ‘ Let down thy pitcher , I pray thee , that I may drink , ’ and she shall say , ‘ Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also ’ — let the same be she whom Thou hast appointed for Thy servant Isaac ; and thereby shall I know that Thou hast shown kindness unto my master. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	15	And it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham ’ s brother , with her pitcher upon her shoulder .
KJ21	Genesis	24	16	And the damsel was very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither had any man known her ; and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up .
KJ21	Genesis	24	17	And the servant ran to meet her and said , “ Let me , I pray thee , drink a little water from thy pitcher. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	18	And she said , “ Drink , my lord ” ; and she hastened and let down her pitcher upon her hand , and gave him drink .
KJ21	Genesis	24	19	And when she had done giving him drink , she said , “ I will draw water for thy camels also , until they have done drinking. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	20	And she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
KJ21	Genesis	24	21	And the man , wondering at her , held his peace to learn whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not .
KJ21	Genesis	24	22	And it came to pass , as the camels were done drinking , that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ,
KJ21	Genesis	24	23	and said , “ Whose daughter art thou ? Tell me , I pray thee , is there room in thy father ’ s house for us to lodge in ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	25	She said moreover unto him , “ We have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	26	And the man bowed down his head , and worshiped the Lord .
KJ21	Genesis	24	27	And he said , “ Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham , who hath not left destitute my master from His mercy and His truth . I , being on the way , the Lord led me to the house of my master ’ s brethren. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	28	And the damsel ran and told those of her mother ’ s house these things .
KJ21	Genesis	24	29	And Rebekah had a brother , and his name was Laban ; and Laban ran out unto the man by the well .
KJ21	Genesis	24	30	And it came to pass , when he saw the earring , and bracelets upon his sister ’ s hands , and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister , saying , “ Thus spoke the man unto me , ” that he came unto the man ; and behold , he stood by the camels at the well .
KJ21	Genesis	24	31	And he said , “ Come in , thou blessed of the Lord . Why standest thou outside ? For I have prepared the house , and room for the camels. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	32	And the man came into the house ; and he ungirded his camels , and gave straw and provender to the camels , and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him .
KJ21	Genesis	24	33	And there was meat set before him to eat ; but he said , “ I will not eat until I have told mine errand. ” And he said , “ Speak on. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	34	And he said , “ I am Abraham ’ s servant .
KJ21	Genesis	24	35	And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly , and he is become great ; and He hath given him flocks and herds , and silver and gold , and menservants and maidservants , and camels and asses .
KJ21	Genesis	24	36	And Sarah my master ’ s wife bore a son to my master when she was old , and unto him hath he given all that he hath .
KJ21	Genesis	24	37	And my master made me swear , saying , ‘ Thou shalt not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I dwell ;
KJ21	Genesis	24	38	but thou shalt go unto my father ’ s house and to my kindred , and take a wife for my son. ’
KJ21	Genesis	24	39	And I said unto my master , ‘ Perhaps the woman will not follow me. ’
KJ21	Genesis	24	40	And he said unto me , ‘ The Lord , before whom I walk , will send His angel with thee and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father ’ s house .
KJ21	Genesis	24	41	Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath. ’
KJ21	Genesis	24	42	And I came this day unto the well and said , ‘ O Lord God of my master Abraham , if now Thou do prosper my way which I go ,
KJ21	Genesis	24	43	behold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water , and I say to her , “ Give me , I pray thee , a little water of thy pitcher to drink , ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	44	and she say to me , “ Both drink thou , and I will also draw for thy camels , ” let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master ’ s son. ’
KJ21	Genesis	24	45	And before I was done speaking in mine heart , behold , Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well and drew water . And I said unto her , ‘ Let me drink , I pray thee. ’
KJ21	Genesis	24	46	And she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , ‘ Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also ’ ; so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
KJ21	Genesis	24	47	And I asked her and said , ‘ Whose daughter art thou ? ’ And she said , ‘ The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor ’ s son , whom Milcah bore unto him ’ ; and I put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands .
KJ21	Genesis	24	48	And I bowed down my head and worshiped the Lord , and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham , who had led me in the right way to take my master ’ s brother ’ s daughter for his son .
KJ21	Genesis	24	49	And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me ; and if not , tell me , that I may turn to the right hand or to the left. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said , “ The thing proceedeth from the Lord ; we can not speak unto thee bad or good .
KJ21	Genesis	24	51	Behold , Rebekah is before thee ; take her and go , and let her be thy master ’ s son ’ s wife , as the Lord hath spoken. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	52	And it came to pass , when Abraham ’ s servant heard their words , that he worshiped the Lord , bowing himself to the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	24	53	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah ; he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
KJ21	Genesis	24	54	And they ate and drank , he and the men who were with him , and tarried all night ; and they arose up in the morning , and he said , “ Send me away unto my master. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	55	And her brother and her mother said , “ Let the damsel abide with us a few days , at the least ten . After that she shall go. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	56	And he said unto them , “ Hinder me not , seeing the Lord hath prospered my way . Send me away , that I may go to my master. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	57	And they said , “ We will call the damsel , and inquire from her mouth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	58	And they called Rebekah and said unto her , “ Wilt thou go with this man ? ” And she said , “ I will go. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	59	And they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse , and Abraham ’ s servant and his men .
KJ21	Genesis	24	60	And they blessed Rebekah and said unto her , “ Thou art our sister ; be thou the mother of thousands of millions ; and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them. ”
KJ21	Genesis	24	61	And Rebekah arose , and her damsels , and they rode upon the camels and followed the man ; and the servant took Rebekah and went his way .
KJ21	Genesis	24	62	And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi ; for he dwelt in the south country .
KJ21	Genesis	24	63	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide ; and he lifted up his eyes and saw , and behold , the camels were coming .
KJ21	Genesis	24	64	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac she alighted from the camel .
KJ21	Genesis	24	65	For she had said unto the servant , “ What man is this who walketh in the field to meet us ? ” And the servant had said , “ It is my master ” ; therefore she took a veil and covered herself .
KJ21	Genesis	24	66	And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done .
KJ21	Genesis	24	67	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah ’ s tent ; and he took Rebekah and she became his wife , and he loved her . And Isaac was comforted after his mother ’ s death .
KJ21	Genesis	25	25	And the first came out red , all over like a hairy garment ; and they called his name Esau .
KJ21	Genesis	25	2	And she bore him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan , and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah .
KJ21	Genesis	25	3	And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan . And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim .
KJ21	Genesis	25	4	And the sons of Midian : Ephah and Epher , and Hanoch and Abidah and Eldaah . All these were the children of Keturah .
KJ21	Genesis	25	5	And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac .
KJ21	Genesis	25	6	But unto the sons of the concubines whom Abraham had , Abraham gave gifts ; and while he yet lived he sent them away from Isaac his son , eastward unto the east country .
KJ21	Genesis	25	7	And these are the days of the years of Abraham ’ s life which he lived , a hundred threescore and fifteen years .
KJ21	Genesis	25	8	Then Abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age , an old man and full of years , and was gathered to his people .
KJ21	Genesis	25	9	And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ,
KJ21	Genesis	25	10	the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth . There was Abraham buried , and Sarah his wife .
KJ21	Genesis	25	11	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi .
KJ21	Genesis	25	12	Now these are the generations of Ishmael , Abraham ’ s son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah ’ s handmaid , bore unto Abraham .
KJ21	Genesis	25	13	And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam ,
KJ21	Genesis	25	14	and Mishma and Dumah and Massa ,
KJ21	Genesis	25	15	Hadar and Tema , Jetur , Naphish , and Kedemah .
KJ21	Genesis	25	16	These are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their towns and by their castles , twelve princes according to their nations .
KJ21	Genesis	25	17	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael , a hundred and thirty and seven years ; and he gave up the ghost and died , and was gathered unto his people .
KJ21	Genesis	25	18	And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur , that is before Egypt as thou goest toward Assyria ; and he died in the presence of all his brethren .
KJ21	Genesis	25	19	And these are the generations of Isaac , Abraham ’ s son . Abraham begot Isaac .
KJ21	Genesis	25	20	And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah for a wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram , the sister of Laban the Syrian .
KJ21	Genesis	25	21	And Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife , because she was barren ; and the Lord was entreated by him , and Rebekah his wife conceived .
KJ21	Genesis	25	22	And the children struggled together within her ; and she said , “ If it be so , why am I thus ? ” And she went to inquire of the Lord .
KJ21	Genesis	25	23	And the Lord said unto her , “ Two nations are in thy womb , and two manner of people shall be separated from thy body ; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people , and the elder shall serve the younger. ”
KJ21	Genesis	25	24	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
KJ21	Genesis	25	26	And after that came his brother out , and his hand took hold of Esau ’ s heel ; and his name was called Jacob . And Isaac was threescore years old when she bore them .
KJ21	Genesis	25	27	And the boys grew . And Esau was a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and Jacob was a plain man , dwelling in tents .
KJ21	Genesis	25	28	And Isaac loved Esau , because he ate of his venison ; but Rebekah loved Jacob .
KJ21	Genesis	25	29	And Jacob boiled pottage ; and Esau came from the field , and he was faint .
KJ21	Genesis	25	30	And Esau said to Jacob , “ Feed me , I pray thee , with that same red pottage , for I am faint ” ; therefore was his name called Edom .
KJ21	Genesis	25	31	And Jacob said , “ Sell me this day thy birthright. ”
KJ21	Genesis	25	32	And Esau said , “ Behold , I am at the point of dying . And what profit shall this birthright be to me ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	25	33	And Jacob said , “ Swear to me this day. ” And he swore unto him , and he sold his birthright unto Jacob .
KJ21	Genesis	25	34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils ; and he ate and drank , and rose up and went his way . Thus Esau despised his birthright .
KJ21	Genesis	26	26	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath one of his friends and Phichol the chief captain of his army .
KJ21	Genesis	26	2	And the Lord appeared unto him , and said , “ Go not down into Egypt ; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of .
KJ21	Genesis	26	3	Sojourn in this land , and I will be with thee and will bless thee . For unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father .
KJ21	Genesis	26	4	And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven , and will give unto thy seed all these countries ; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ,
KJ21	Genesis	26	5	because Abraham obeyed My voice , and kept My charge , My commandments , My statutes , and My laws. ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	6	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar .
KJ21	Genesis	26	7	And the men of the place asked him concerning his wife . And he said , “ She is my sister ” ; for he feared to say , “ She is my wife , ” lest , said he , “ the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah , because she was fair to look upon. ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	8	And it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out a window and saw , and behold , Isaac was frolicking with Rebekah his wife .
KJ21	Genesis	26	9	And Abimelech called Isaac and said , “ Behold , of a surety she is thy wife ; and how saidst thou , ‘ She is my sister ’ ? ” And Isaac said unto him , “ Because I said , ‘ Lest I die for her. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	10	And Abimelech said , “ What is this thou hast done unto us ? One of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife , and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	11	And Abimelech charged all his people , saying , “ He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	12	Then Isaac sowed in that land , and received in the same year a hundredfold ; and the Lord blessed him .
KJ21	Genesis	26	13	And the man waxed great , and went forward , and grew until he became very great .
KJ21	Genesis	26	14	For he had possession of flocks and possession of herds , and great store of servants ; and the Philistines envied him .
KJ21	Genesis	26	15	For all the wells which his father ’ s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth .
KJ21	Genesis	26	16	And Abimelech said unto Isaac , “ Go from us , for thou art much mightier than we. ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	17	And Isaac departed from thence , and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar and dwelt there .
KJ21	Genesis	26	18	And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father , for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham ; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
KJ21	Genesis	26	19	And Isaac ’ s servants dug in the valley , and found there a well of springing water .
KJ21	Genesis	26	20	And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac ’ s herdsmen , saying , “ The water is ours. ” And he called the name of the well Esek [ that is , Contention ] , because they strove with him .
KJ21	Genesis	26	21	And they dug another well , and strove for that also ; and he called the name of it Sitnah [ that is , Hatred ] .
KJ21	Genesis	26	22	And he removed from thence , and dug another well , and for that they strove not ; and he called the name of it Rehoboth [ that is , Room ] . And he said , “ For now the Lord hath made room for us , and we shall be fruitful in the land. ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	23	And he went up from thence to Beersheba .
KJ21	Genesis	26	24	And the Lord appeared unto him the same night and said , “ I am the God of Abraham thy father . Fear not , for I am with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for My servant Abraham ’ s sake. ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	25	And he built an altar there , and called upon the name of the Lord , and pitched his tent there ; and there Isaac ’ s servants dug a well .
KJ21	Genesis	26	27	And Isaac said unto them , “ Why come ye to me , seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	28	And they said , “ We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee ; and we said , ‘ Let there be now an oath between us , even between us and thee , and let us make a covenant with thee ,
KJ21	Genesis	26	29	that thou wilt do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace . Thou art now the blessed of the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	30	And he made them a feast , and they ate and drank .
KJ21	Genesis	26	31	And they rose up early in the morning and swore one to another ; and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
KJ21	Genesis	26	32	And it came to pass the same day , that Isaac ’ s servants came and told him concerning the well which they had dug , and said unto him , “ We have found water. ”
KJ21	Genesis	26	33	And he called it Shebah [ that is , An oath ] ; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba [ that is , The well of the oath ] unto this day .
KJ21	Genesis	26	34	And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite ,
KJ21	Genesis	26	35	who were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah .
KJ21	Genesis	27	27	And he came near , and kissed him ; and he smelled the smell of his raiment , and blessed him and said , “ See , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed .
KJ21	Genesis	27	2	And he said , “ Behold now , I am old ; I know not the day of my death .
KJ21	Genesis	27	3	Now therefore take , I pray thee , thy weapons , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field and take me some venison .
KJ21	Genesis	27	4	And make me savory meat , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , that my soul may bless thee before I die. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	5	And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son . And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
KJ21	Genesis	27	6	And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son , saying , “ Behold , I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother , saying ,
KJ21	Genesis	27	7	‘ Bring me venison , and make me savory meat , that I may eat and bless thee before the Lord before my death. ’
KJ21	Genesis	27	8	Now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command thee .
KJ21	Genesis	27	9	Go now to the flock , and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats , and I will make them savory meat for thy father , such as he loveth ;
KJ21	Genesis	27	10	and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	11	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother , “ Behold , Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am a smooth man .
KJ21	Genesis	27	12	My father perhaps will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a deceiver ; and I shall bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	13	And his mother said unto him , “ Upon me be thy curse , my son ; only obey my voice , and go , fetch me them. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	14	And he went , and fetched and brought them to his mother ; and his mother made savory meat , such as his father loved .
KJ21	Genesis	27	15	And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau , which were with her in the house , and put them upon Jacob her younger son ;
KJ21	Genesis	27	16	and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck .
KJ21	Genesis	27	17	And she gave the savory meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
KJ21	Genesis	27	18	And he came unto his father , and said , “ My father. ” And he said , “ Here am I . Who art thou , my son ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	19	And Jacob said unto his father , “ I am Esau thy firstborn ; I have done according as thou badest me . Arise , I pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	20	And Isaac said unto his son , “ How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ? ” And he said , “ Because the Lord thy God brought it to me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	21	And Isaac said unto Jacob , “ Come near , I pray thee , that I may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son Esau or not. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	22	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father ; and he felt him and said , “ The voice is Jacob ’ s voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	23	And he discerned him not , because his hands were hairy , as his brother Esau ’ s hands ; so he blessed him .
KJ21	Genesis	27	24	And he said , “ Art thou my very son Esau ? ” And he said , “ I am. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	25	And he said , “ Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son ’ s venison , that my soul may bless thee. ” And he brought it near to him , and he ate ; and he brought him wine , and he drank .
KJ21	Genesis	27	26	And his father Isaac said unto him , “ Come near now , and kiss me , my son. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	28	Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven , and the fatness of the earth , and plenty of corn and wine .
KJ21	Genesis	27	29	Let people serve thee , and nations bow down to thee ; be lord over thy brethren , and let thy mother ’ s sons bow down to thee . Cursed be every one that curseth thee , and blessed be he that blesseth thee ! ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	30	And it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
KJ21	Genesis	27	31	And he also had made savory meat , and brought it unto his father and said unto his father , “ Let my father arise and eat of his son ’ s venison , that thy soul may bless me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	32	And Isaac his father said unto him , “ Who art thou ? ” And he said , “ I am thy son , thy firstborn , Esau. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	33	And Isaac trembled exceedingly and said , “ Who ? Where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me , and I have eaten of all before thou camest , and have blessed him ? Yea , and he shall be blessed. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	34	And when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , “ Bless me , even me also , O my father ! ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	35	And he said , “ Thy brother came with subtlety , and hath taken away thy blessing. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	36	And he said , “ Is not he rightly named Jacob [ that is , A supplanter ] ? For he hath supplanted me these two times : he took away my birthright , and behold , now he hath taken away my blessing. ” And he said , “ Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	37	And Isaac answered and said unto Esau , “ Behold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him . And what shall I do now unto thee , my son ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	38	And Esau said unto his father , “ Hast thou but one blessing , my father ? Bless me , even me also , O my father ! ” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept .
KJ21	Genesis	27	39	And Isaac his father answered and said unto him , “ Behold , thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above .
KJ21	Genesis	27	40	And by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	41	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him . And Esau said in his heart , “ The days of mourning for my father are at hand . Then will I slay my brother Jacob. ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	42	And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah ; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said unto him , “ Behold , thy brother Esau doth comfort himself concerning thee , purposing to kill thee .
KJ21	Genesis	27	43	Now therefore my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to Laban my brother in Haran ,
KJ21	Genesis	27	44	and tarry with him a few days until thy brother ’ s fury turn away—
KJ21	Genesis	27	45	until thy brother ’ s anger turn away from thee , and he forget that which thou hast done to him . Then I will send and fetch thee from thence . Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	27	46	And Rebekah said to Isaac , “ I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth . If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth , such as these who are of the daughters of the land , what good shall my life do me ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	28	28	And Isaac called Jacob and blessed him , and charged him and said unto him , “ Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
KJ21	Genesis	28	2	Arise , go to Padanaram to the house of Bethuel thy mother ’ s father , and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother ’ s brother .
KJ21	Genesis	28	3	And God Almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a multitude of people ;
KJ21	Genesis	28	4	and give thee the blessing of Abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee , that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger , which God gave unto Abraham. ”
KJ21	Genesis	28	5	And Isaac sent away Jacob ; and he went to Padanaram unto Laban , son of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebekah , Jacob ’ s and Esau ’ s mother .
KJ21	Genesis	28	6	When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob , and sent him away to Padanaram to take him a wife from thence , and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge , saying , “ Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan , ”
KJ21	Genesis	28	7	and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padanaram ,
KJ21	Genesis	28	8	and Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father—
KJ21	Genesis	28	9	then went Esau unto Ishmael , and added unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael , Abraham ’ s son , the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife .
KJ21	Genesis	28	10	And Jacob went out from Beersheba , and went toward Haran .
KJ21	Genesis	28	11	And he alighted upon a certain place , and tarried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows , and lay down in that place to sleep .
KJ21	Genesis	28	12	And he dreamed , and behold , a ladder was set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven ; and behold , the angels of God were ascending and descending on it .
KJ21	Genesis	28	13	And behold , the Lord stood above it and said , “ I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac : The land whereon thou liest , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed .
KJ21	Genesis	28	14	And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east , and to the north and to the south ; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
KJ21	Genesis	28	15	And behold , I am with thee , and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for I will not leave thee , until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. ”
KJ21	Genesis	28	16	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , “ Surely the Lord is in this place , and I knew it not. ”
KJ21	Genesis	28	17	And he was afraid and said , “ How fearsome is this place ! This is none other than the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven. ”
KJ21	Genesis	28	18	And Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pillows , and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it .
KJ21	Genesis	28	19	And he called the name of that place Bethel [ that is , The house of God ] ; but the name of that city was called Luz at the first .
KJ21	Genesis	28	20	And Jacob vowed a vow , saying , “ If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on ,
KJ21	Genesis	28	21	so that I come again to my father ’ s house in peace , then shall the Lord be my God .
KJ21	Genesis	28	22	And this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God ’ s house ; and of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give a tenth unto Thee . ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	29	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid .
KJ21	Genesis	29	2	And he looked , and behold , a well in the field , and lo , there were three flocks of sheep lying by it ; for out of that well they watered the flocks ; and a great stone was upon the well ’ s mouth .
KJ21	Genesis	29	3	And thither were all the flocks gathered ; and they rolled the stone from the well ’ s mouth and watered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well ’ s mouth in his place .
KJ21	Genesis	29	4	And Jacob said unto them , “ My brethren , from whence be ye ? ” And they said , “ Of Haran are we. ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	5	And he said unto them , “ Know ye Laban the son of Nahor ? ” And they said , “ We know him. ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	6	And he said unto them , “ Is he well ? ” And they said , “ He is well ; and behold , Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	7	And he said , “ Lo , it is yet high day , neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together . Water ye the sheep , and go and feed them. ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	8	And they said , “ We can not until all the flocks are gathered together , and until they roll the stone from the well ’ s mouth . Then we water the sheep. ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	9	And while he yet spoke with them , Rachel came with her father ’ s sheep , for she kept them .
KJ21	Genesis	29	10	And it came to pass , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban , his mother ’ s brother , and the sheep of Laban , his mother ’ s brother , that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well ’ s mouth and watered the flock of Laban , his mother ’ s brother .
KJ21	Genesis	29	11	And Jacob kissed Rachel , and lifted up his voice and wept .
KJ21	Genesis	29	12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father ’ s brother , and that he was Rebekah ’ s son ; and she ran and told her father .
KJ21	Genesis	29	13	And it came to pass , when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister ’ s son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him and kissed him , and brought him to his house . And he told Laban all these things .
KJ21	Genesis	29	14	And Laban said to him , “ Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. ” And he abode with him the space of a month .
KJ21	Genesis	29	15	And Laban said unto Jacob , “ Because thou art my brother , shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought ? Tell me , what shall thy wages be ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	16	And Laban had two daughters : the name of the elder was Leah , and the name of the younger was Rachel .
KJ21	Genesis	29	17	Leah was tendereyed , but Rachel was beautiful and wellfavored .
KJ21	Genesis	29	18	And Jacob loved Rachel , and said , “ I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	19	And Laban said , “ It is better that I give her to thee , than that I should give her to another man . Abide with me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	20	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel ; and they seemed unto him but a few days , for the love he had for her .
KJ21	Genesis	29	21	And Jacob said unto Laban , “ Give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in unto her. ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	22	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast .
KJ21	Genesis	29	23	And it came to pass in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him ; and he went in unto her .
KJ21	Genesis	29	24	And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah , Zilpah his maid for a handmaid .
KJ21	Genesis	29	25	And it came to pass that in the morning , behold , it was Leah ; and he said to Laban , “ What is this thou hast done unto me ? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel ? Why then hast thou beguiled me ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	26	And Laban said , “ It must not be so done in our country , to give the younger before the firstborn .
KJ21	Genesis	29	27	Fulfill her week , and we will give thee this other also , for which service thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	28	And Jacob did so , and fulfilled her week ; and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a wife also .
KJ21	Genesis	29	30	And he went in also unto Rachel , and he loved also Rachel more than Leah , and served with him yet seven other years .
KJ21	Genesis	29	31	And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated , he opened her womb ; but Rachel was barren .
KJ21	Genesis	29	32	And Leah conceived and bore a son , and she called his name Reuben [ that is , See a son ] ; for she said , “ Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction . Now therefore my husband will love me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	29	33	And she conceived again and bore a son , and said , “ Because the Lord hath heard that I was hated , He hath therefore given me this son also. ” And she called his name Simeon [ that is , Hearing ] .
KJ21	Genesis	29	34	And she conceived again and bore a son , and said , “ Now this time will my husband be joined unto me , because I have borne him three sons. ” Therefore was his name called Levi [ that is , Joined ] .
KJ21	Genesis	29	35	And she conceived again and bore a son ; and she said , “ Now will I praise the Lord. ” Therefore she called his name Judah [ that is , Praise ] , and ceased bearing .
KJ21	Genesis	30	30	For it was little which thou had before I came , and it is now increased unto a multitude ; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my coming . And now , when shall I provide for mine own house also ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	2	And Jacob ’ s anger was kindled against Rachel ; and he said , “ Am I in God ’ s stead , who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	3	And she said , “ Behold my maid Bilhah . Go in unto her , and she shall bear upon my knees , that I may also have children by her. ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	4	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid for a wife ; and Jacob went in unto her .
KJ21	Genesis	30	5	And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son .
KJ21	Genesis	30	6	And Rachel said , “ God hath judged me , and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son. ” Therefore she called his name Dan [ that is , Judging ] .
KJ21	Genesis	30	7	And Bilhah , Rachel ’ s maid , conceived again and bore Jacob a second son .
KJ21	Genesis	30	8	And Rachel said , “ With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister , and I have prevailed. ” And she called his name Naphtali [ that is , My wrestling ] .
KJ21	Genesis	30	9	When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing , she took Zilpah her maid and gave her to Jacob for a wife ;
KJ21	Genesis	30	10	and Zilpah , Leah ’ s maid , bore Jacob a son .
KJ21	Genesis	30	11	And Leah said , “ A troop cometh. ” And she called his name Gad [ that is , A troop or company ] .
KJ21	Genesis	30	12	And Zilpah , Leah ’ s maid , bore Jacob a second son .
KJ21	Genesis	30	13	And Leah said , “ Happy am I , for the daughters will call me blessed. ” And she called his name Asher [ that is , Happy ] .
KJ21	Genesis	30	14	And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Leah . Then Rachel said to Leah , “ Give me , I pray thee , of thy son ’ s mandrakes. ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	15	But she said unto her , “ Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband ? And wouldest thou take away my son ’ s mandrakes also ? ” And Rachel said , “ Therefore he shall lie with thee tonight , for thy son ’ s mandrakes. ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	16	And Jacob came out of the field in the evening , and Leah went out to meet him and said , “ Thou must come in unto me , for surely I have hired thee with my son ’ s mandrakes. ” And he lay with her that night .
KJ21	Genesis	30	17	And God hearkened unto Leah , and she conceived and bore Jacob the fifth son .
KJ21	Genesis	30	18	And Leah said , “ God hath given me my hire , because I have given my maiden to my husband. ” And she called his name Issachar [ that is , A hire ] .
KJ21	Genesis	30	19	And Leah conceived again and bore Jacob the sixth son .
KJ21	Genesis	30	20	And Leah said , “ God hath endued me with a good dowry . Now will my husband dwell with me , because I have borne him six sons. ” And she called his name Zebulun [ that is , Dwelling ] .
KJ21	Genesis	30	21	And afterwards she bore a daughter , and called her name Dinah [ that is , Judgment ] .
KJ21	Genesis	30	22	And God remembered Rachel , and God hearkened to her and opened her womb .
KJ21	Genesis	30	23	And she conceived and bore a son , and said , “ God hath taken away my reproach. ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	24	And she called his name Joseph [ that is , Adding ] , and said , “ The Lord shall add to me another son. ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	25	And it came to pass , when Rachel had borne Joseph , that Jacob said unto Laban , “ Send me away , that I may go unto mine own place and to my country .
KJ21	Genesis	30	26	Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee , and let me go ; for thou knowest my service which I have done thee. ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	27	And Laban said unto him , “ I pray thee , if I have found favor in thine eyes , tarry ; for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake. ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	28	And he said , “ Appoint me thy wages , and I will give it. ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	29	And he said unto him , “ Thou knowest how I have served thee and how thy flocks have been with me .
KJ21	Genesis	30	31	And he said , “ What shall I give thee ? ” And Jacob said , “ Thou shalt not give me any thing . If thou wilt do this thing for me , I will again feed and keep thy flock :
KJ21	Genesis	30	32	I will pass through all thy flock today , removing from thence all the speckled and spotted animals , and all the brown animals among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goats ; and of such shall be my hire .
KJ21	Genesis	30	33	So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come , when it shall come for my hire before thy face : every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats , and brown among the sheep , that shall be counted stolen with me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	34	And Laban said , “ Behold , I would it might be according to thy word. ”
KJ21	Genesis	30	35	And he removed that day the hegoats that were ringstreaked and spotted , and all the shegoats that were speckled and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
KJ21	Genesis	30	36	And he set three days ’ journey between himself and Jacob ; and Jacob fed the rest of Laban ’ s flocks .
KJ21	Genesis	30	37	And Jacob took rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chestnut tree , and peeled white strips in them and made the white appear which was in the rods .
KJ21	Genesis	30	38	And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the gutters , in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink .
KJ21	Genesis	30	39	And the flocks conceived before the rods , and brought forth animals ringstreaked , speckled and spotted .
KJ21	Genesis	30	40	And Jacob separated the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban ; and he put his own flocks by themselves , and put them not with Laban ’ s flocks .
KJ21	Genesis	30	41	And it came to pass , whensoever the stronger animals conceived , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the animals in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods .
KJ21	Genesis	30	42	But when the animals were feeble , he put them not in ; so the feebler were Laban ’ s , and the stronger Jacob ’ s .
KJ21	Genesis	30	43	And the man increased exceedingly and had large flocks , and maidservants and menservants , and camels and asses .
KJ21	Genesis	31	31	And Jacob answered and said to Laban , “ Because I was afraid ; for I said , ‘ Perhaps thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. ’
KJ21	Genesis	31	2	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban , and behold , it was not toward him as before .
KJ21	Genesis	31	3	And the Lord said unto Jacob , “ Return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred , and I will be with thee. ”
KJ21	Genesis	31	4	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock ,
KJ21	Genesis	31	5	and said unto them , “ I see your father ’ s countenance , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father hath been with me .
KJ21	Genesis	31	6	And ye know that with all my power I have served your father .
KJ21	Genesis	31	7	And your father hath deceived me , and changed my wages ten times , but God did not suffer him to hurt me .
KJ21	Genesis	31	8	If he said thus : ‘ The speckled shall be thy wages , ’ then all the animals bore speckled ; and if he said thus : ‘ The ringstreaked shall be thy hire , ’ then all the animals bore ringstreaked .
KJ21	Genesis	31	9	Thus God hath taken away the flocks of your father , and given them to me .
KJ21	Genesis	31	10	And it came to pass at the time that the animals conceived , that I lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream , and behold , the rams which leaped upon the animals were ringstreaked , speckled , and grizzled .
KJ21	Genesis	31	11	And the angel of God spoke unto me in a dream , saying , ‘ Jacob ! ’ And I said , ‘ Here am I. ’
KJ21	Genesis	31	12	And he said , ‘ Lift up now thine eyes and see : all the rams which leap upon the animals are ringstreaked , speckled , and grizzled ; for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee .
KJ21	Genesis	31	13	I am the God of Bethel , where thou anointed the pillar , and where thou vowed a vow unto Me . Now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	31	14	And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him , “ Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father ’ s house ?
KJ21	Genesis	31	15	Are we not counted by him strangers ? For he hath sold us , and hath quite devoured also our money .
KJ21	Genesis	31	16	For all the riches which God hath taken from our father , that is ours and our children ’ s . Now then , whatsoever God hath said unto thee , do. ”
KJ21	Genesis	31	17	Then Jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives upon camels .
KJ21	Genesis	31	18	And he carried away all his flocks and all his goods which he had gotten , the flocks of his getting which he had gotten in Padanaram , to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan .
KJ21	Genesis	31	19	And Laban went to shear his sheep ; and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father ’ s .
KJ21	Genesis	31	20	And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
KJ21	Genesis	31	21	So he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount of Gilead .
KJ21	Genesis	31	22	And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled .
KJ21	Genesis	31	23	And he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ’ journey ; and they overtook him on the mount of Gilead .
KJ21	Genesis	31	24	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night , and said unto him , “ Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. ”
KJ21	Genesis	31	25	Then Laban overtook Jacob . Now Jacob had pitched his tent on the mount ; and Laban with his brethren pitched on the mount of Gilead .
KJ21	Genesis	31	26	And Laban said to Jacob , “ What hast thou done , that thou hast stolen away unawares to me , and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword ?
KJ21	Genesis	31	27	Why didst thou flee away secretly , and steal away from me and didst not tell me , that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs , with taboret and with harp ,
KJ21	Genesis	31	28	and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? Thou hast now done foolishly in so doing .
KJ21	Genesis	31	29	It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt ; but the God of your father spoke unto me yesternight , saying , ‘ Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. ’
KJ21	Genesis	31	30	And now , though thou wouldest be gone , because thou sorely longed after thy father ’ s house , yet why hast thou stolen my gods ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	31	32	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods , let him not live . Before our brethren , discern thou what is thine with me , and take it with thee. ” For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them .
KJ21	Genesis	31	33	And Laban went into Jacob ’ s tent , and into Leah ’ s tent , and into the two maidservants ’ tents , but he found them not . Then went he out of Leah ’ s tent , and entered into Rachel ’ s tent .
KJ21	Genesis	31	34	Now Rachel had taken the images , and put them in the camel ’ s saddle and sat upon them . And Laban searched all the tent , but found them not .
KJ21	Genesis	31	35	And she said to her father , “ Let it not displease my lord that I can not rise up before thee , for the custom of women is upon me. ” And he searched , but found not the images .
KJ21	Genesis	31	36	And Jacob was wroth , and chided Laban ; and Jacob answered and said to Laban , “ What is my trespass ? What is my sin , that thou hast so hotly pursued after me ?
KJ21	Genesis	31	37	Whereas thou hast searched all my goods , what hast thou found of all thy household things ? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren , that they may judge between us both .
KJ21	Genesis	31	38	These twenty years have I been with thee ; thy ewes and thy shegoats have not cast their young , and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten .
KJ21	Genesis	31	39	That which was torn by beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bore the loss of it . From my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
KJ21	Genesis	31	40	Thus I was : in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night , and my sleep departed from mine eyes .
KJ21	Genesis	31	41	Thus have I been twenty years in thy house . I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters , and six years for thy flocks ; and thou hast changed my wages ten times .
KJ21	Genesis	31	42	Unless the God of my father , the God of Abraham and the fear of Isaac , had been with me , surely thou would have sent me away now empty . God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands , and rebuked thee yesternight. ”
KJ21	Genesis	31	43	And Laban answered and said unto Jacob , “ These daughters are my daughters , and these children are my children , and these flocks are my flocks , and all that thou seest is mine . And what can I do this day unto these my daughters , or unto their children whom they have borne ?
KJ21	Genesis	31	44	Now therefore come thou , let us make a covenant , I and thou ; and let it be a witness between me and thee. ”
KJ21	Genesis	31	45	And Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar .
KJ21	Genesis	31	46	And Jacob said unto his brethren , “ Gather stones ” ; and they took stones and made a heap , and they ate there upon the heap .
KJ21	Genesis	31	47	And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha [ that is , The heap of witness ] , but Jacob called it Galeed .
KJ21	Genesis	31	48	And Laban said , “ This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. ” Therefore was the name of it called Galeed ,
KJ21	Genesis	31	49	and Mizpah [ that is , A beacon or watchtower ] ; for he said , “ The Lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another .
KJ21	Genesis	31	50	If thou shalt afflict my daughters , or if thou shalt take other wives besides my daughters , no man is with us—see , God is witness between me and thee ! ”
KJ21	Genesis	31	51	And Laban said to Jacob , “ Behold this heap and behold this pillar , which I have cast between me and thee .
KJ21	Genesis	31	52	This heap is a witness , and this pillar is a witness , that I will not pass beyond this heap to thee , and that thou shalt not pass beyond this heap and this pillar unto me , for harm .
KJ21	Genesis	31	53	The God of Abraham , and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge between us. ” And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac .
KJ21	Genesis	31	54	Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread ; and they ate bread , and tarried all night on the mount .
KJ21	Genesis	31	55	And early in the morning Laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them . And Laban departed , and returned unto his place .
KJ21	Genesis	32	32	Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank , which is upon the hollow of the thigh , unto this day , because he touched the hollow of Jacob ’ s thigh in the sinew that shrank .
KJ21	Genesis	32	2	And when Jacob saw them , he said , “ This is God ’ s host. ” And he called the name of that place Mahanaim [ that is , Two hosts or camps ] .
KJ21	Genesis	32	3	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir , the country of Edom .
KJ21	Genesis	32	4	And he commanded them , saying , “ Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau , ‘ Thy servant Jacob saith thus : I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now ,
KJ21	Genesis	32	5	and I have oxen and asses , flocks and menservants and womenservants ; and I have sent to tell my lord , that I may find grace in thy sight. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	6	And the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , “ We came to thy brother Esau , and also he cometh to meet thee , and four hundred men with him. ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed ; and he divided the people who were with him , and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands .
KJ21	Genesis	32	8	And he said , “ If Esau come to the one company and smite it , then the other company which is left shall escape. ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	9	And Jacob said , “ O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac , the Lord who saidst unto me , ‘ Return unto thy country and to thy kindred , and I will deal well with thee ’ —
KJ21	Genesis	32	10	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan , and now I have become two bands .
KJ21	Genesis	32	11	Deliver me , I pray Thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau ; for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children .
KJ21	Genesis	32	12	And Thou saidst , ‘ I will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which can not be numbered for multitude. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	13	And he lodged there that same night , and took from that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother :
KJ21	Genesis	32	14	two hundred shegoats and twenty hegoats , two hundred ewes and twenty rams ,
KJ21	Genesis	32	15	thirty milk camels with their colts , forty cows and ten bulls , twenty sheasses and ten foals .
KJ21	Genesis	32	16	And he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by itself , and said unto his servants , “ Pass over before me , and put a space between drove and drove. ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	17	And he commanded the foremost , saying , “ When Esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee , saying , ‘ Whose art thou ? And whither goest thou ? And whose are these before thee ? ’
KJ21	Genesis	32	18	then thou shalt say , ‘ They are thy servant Jacob ’ s . It is a present sent unto my lord Esau ; and behold also , he is behind us. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	19	And so commanded he the second , and the third , and all who followed the droves , saying , “ In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau when ye find him .
KJ21	Genesis	32	20	And say ye moreover , ‘ Behold , thy servant Jacob is behind us. ’ ” For he said , “ I will appease him with the presents that goeth before me , and afterward I will see his face . Perhaps he will accept me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	21	So went the presents over before him , and he himself lodged that night in the company .
KJ21	Genesis	32	22	And he rose up that night , and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons , and passed over the ford Jabbok .
KJ21	Genesis	32	23	And he took them and sent them over the brook , and sent over what he had .
KJ21	Genesis	32	24	And Jacob was left alone , and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day .
KJ21	Genesis	32	25	And when the man saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob ’ s thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him .
KJ21	Genesis	32	26	And the man said , “ Let me go , for the day breaketh. ” And he said , “ I will not let thee go , unless thou bless me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	27	And he said unto him , “ What is thy name ? ” And he said , “ Jacob. ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	28	And he said , “ Thy name shall be called no more Jacob , but Israel ; for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men , and hast prevailed. ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	29	And Jacob asked him , and said , “ Tell me , I pray thee , thy name. ” And he said , “ Why is it that thou dost ask after my name ? ” And he blessed him there .
KJ21	Genesis	32	30	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel [ that is , The face of God ] : “ For I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved. ”
KJ21	Genesis	32	31	And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him , and he limped upon his thigh .
KJ21	Genesis	33	33	And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , Esau came and with him four hundred men . And he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two handmaids .
KJ21	Genesis	33	2	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost , and Leah and her children after , and Rachel and Joseph hindmost .
KJ21	Genesis	33	3	And he passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother .
KJ21	Genesis	33	4	And Esau ran to meet him , and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him ; and they wept .
KJ21	Genesis	33	5	And he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children , and said , “ Who are those with thee ? ” And he said , “ The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. ”
KJ21	Genesis	33	6	Then the handmaidens came near , they and their children , and they bowed themselves .
KJ21	Genesis	33	7	And Leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves ; and after these came Joseph and Rachel near , and they bowed themselves .
KJ21	Genesis	33	8	And he said , “ What meanest thou by all this drove which I met ? ” And he said , “ These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. ”
KJ21	Genesis	33	9	And Esau said , “ I have enough , my brother . Keep what thou hast unto thyself. ”
KJ21	Genesis	33	10	And Jacob said , “ Nay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand ; for therefore I have seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God , and thou wast pleased with me .
KJ21	Genesis	33	11	Take , I pray thee , my blessing that is brought to thee , because God hath dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough. ” And he urged him , and he took it .
KJ21	Genesis	33	12	And he said , “ Let us take our journey ; and let us go , and I will go before thee. ”
KJ21	Genesis	33	13	And he said unto him , “ My lord knoweth that the children are tender , and the flocks and herds with young are with me ; and if men should overdrive them one day , all the flock will die .
KJ21	Genesis	33	14	Let my lord , I pray thee , pass over before his servant ; and I will lead on gently , according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children are able to endure , until I come unto my lord unto Seir. ”
KJ21	Genesis	33	15	And Esau said , “ Let me now leave with thee some of the folk who are with me. ” And he said , “ What need is there ? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord. ”
KJ21	Genesis	33	16	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir .
KJ21	Genesis	33	17	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth , and built him a house , and made booths for his cattle . Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth [ that is , Booths ] .
KJ21	Genesis	33	18	And Jacob came to Shalem , a city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Padanaram , and pitched his tent before the city .
KJ21	Genesis	33	19	And he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem ’ s father , for a hundred pieces of money .
KJ21	Genesis	33	20	And he erected there an altar , and called it El-elohe-Israel [ that is , God , the God of Israel ] .
KJ21	Genesis	34	34	And Dinah the daughter of Leah , whom she bore unto Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
KJ21	Genesis	34	2	And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , prince of the country , saw her , he took her and lay with her , and defiled her .
KJ21	Genesis	34	3	And his soul cleaved unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob , and he loved the damsel and spoke kindly unto the damsel .
KJ21	Genesis	34	4	And Shechem spoke unto his father Hamor , saying , “ Get me this damsel for a wife. ”
KJ21	Genesis	34	5	And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter . Now his sons were with his cattle in the field , and Jacob held his peace until they had come .
KJ21	Genesis	34	6	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him .
KJ21	Genesis	34	7	And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it ; and the men were grieved and they were very wroth , because he had wrought folly in Israel by lying with Jacob ’ s daughter , which thing ought not to be done .
KJ21	Genesis	34	8	And Hamor communed with them , saying , “ The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter . I pray you give her to him for a wife ;
KJ21	Genesis	34	9	and make ye marriages with us , and give your daughters unto us , and take our daughters unto you .
KJ21	Genesis	34	10	And ye shall dwell with us , and the land shall be before you . Dwell and trade ye therein , and get you possessions therein. ”
KJ21	Genesis	34	11	And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren , “ Let me find grace in your eyes , and what ye shall say unto me , I will give .
KJ21	Genesis	34	12	Ask me ever so much dowry and gift , and I will give according as ye shall say unto me ; but give me the damsel for a wife. ”
KJ21	Genesis	34	13	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully , and said — because he had defiled Dinah their sister ”
KJ21	Genesis	34	14	and they said unto them , “ We can not do this thing , to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised , for that would be a reproach unto us .
KJ21	Genesis	34	15	But in this will we consent unto you : If ye will be as we are , that every male of you be circumcised ,
KJ21	Genesis	34	16	then will we give our daughters unto you ; and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
KJ21	Genesis	34	17	But if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised , then will we take our daughter and we will be gone. ”
KJ21	Genesis	34	18	And their words pleased Hamor , and Shechem , Hamor ’ s son .
KJ21	Genesis	34	19	And the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in Jacob ’ s daughter ; and he was more honorable than all the house of his father .
KJ21	Genesis	34	20	And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city , and communed with the men of their city , saying ,
KJ21	Genesis	34	21	“ These men are peaceable with us . Therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them . Let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
KJ21	Genesis	34	22	Only herein will the men consent unto us to dwell with us , to be one people : if every male among us be circumcised , as they are circumcised .
KJ21	Genesis	34	23	Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours ? Only let us consent unto them , and they will dwell with us. ”
KJ21	Genesis	34	24	And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all who went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circumcised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
KJ21	Genesis	34	25	And it came to pass on the third day , when they were sore , that two of the sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , Dinah ’ s brethren , took each man his sword , and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males .
KJ21	Genesis	34	26	And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem ’ s house , and went out .
KJ21	Genesis	34	27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and despoiled the city , because they had defiled their sister .
KJ21	Genesis	34	28	They took their sheep and their oxen and their asses , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ;
KJ21	Genesis	34	29	and all their wealth , and all their little ones and their wives took they captive , and despoiled even all that was in the house .
KJ21	Genesis	34	30	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , “ Ye have troubled me to make me a stench among the inhabitants of the land , among the Canaanites and the Perizzites . And I being few in number , they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me ; and I shall be destroyed , I and my house. ”
KJ21	Genesis	34	31	And they said , “ Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	35	35	And God said unto Jacob , “ Arise , go up to Bethel and dwell there ; and make there an altar unto God , who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. ”
KJ21	Genesis	35	2	Then Jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him , “ Put away the strange gods that are among you , and be clean and change your garments .
KJ21	Genesis	35	3	And let us arise and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went. ”
KJ21	Genesis	35	4	And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand , and all their earrings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem .
KJ21	Genesis	35	5	And they journeyed ; and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob .
KJ21	Genesis	35	6	So Jacob came to Luz ( that is , Bethel ) , which is in the land of Canaan , he and all the people that were with him .
KJ21	Genesis	35	7	And he built there an altar and called the place Elbethel [ that is , The God of Bethel ] , because there God appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother .
KJ21	Genesis	35	8	But Deborah , Rebekah ’ s nurse , died , and she was buried below Bethel under an oak ; and the name of it was called Allonbachuth [ that is , The oak of weeping ] .
KJ21	Genesis	35	9	And God appeared unto Jacob again when he came out of Padanaram , and blessed him .
KJ21	Genesis	35	10	And God said unto him , “ Thy name is Jacob ; thy name shall not be called Jacob any more , but Israel shall be thy name ” ; and He called his name Israel .
KJ21	Genesis	35	11	And God said unto him , “ I am God Almighty . Be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and kings shall come out of thy loins .
KJ21	Genesis	35	12	And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac , to thee I will give it , and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. ”
KJ21	Genesis	35	13	And God went up from him in the place where He talked with him .
KJ21	Genesis	35	14	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him , even a pillar of stone ; and he poured a drink offering thereon , and he poured oil thereon .
KJ21	Genesis	35	15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him Bethel .
KJ21	Genesis	35	16	And they journeyed from Bethel . And there was but a little way to come to Ephrath ; and Rachel travailed , and she had hard labor .
KJ21	Genesis	35	17	And it came to pass , when she was in hard labor , that the midwife said unto her , “ Fear not . Thou shalt have this son also. ”
KJ21	Genesis	35	18	And it came to pass as her soul was in departing ( for she died ) , that she called his name Benoni [ that is , The son of my sorrow ] , but his father called him Benjamin [ that is , The son of the right hand ] .
KJ21	Genesis	35	19	And Rachel died , and was buried on the way to Ephrath , which is Bethlehem .
KJ21	Genesis	35	20	And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave ; that is the pillar of Rachel ’ s grave unto this day .
KJ21	Genesis	35	21	And Israel journeyed , and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder .
KJ21	Genesis	35	22	And it came to pass , when Israel dwelt in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah , his father ’ s concubine ; and Israel heard it . Now the sons of Jacob were twelve .
KJ21	Genesis	35	23	The sons of Leah : Reuben , Jacob ’ s firstborn , and Simeon and Levi , and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun ;
KJ21	Genesis	35	24	the sons of Rachel : Joseph and Benjamin ;
KJ21	Genesis	35	25	and the sons of Bilhah , Rachel ’ s handmaid : Dan and Naphtali ;
KJ21	Genesis	35	26	and the sons of Zilpah , Leah ’ s handmaid : Gad and Asher . These are the sons of Jacob , who were born to him in Padanaram .
KJ21	Genesis	35	27	And Jacob came unto Isaac his father at Mamre , unto the city of Arbah ( which is Hebron ) where Abraham and Isaac sojourned .
KJ21	Genesis	35	28	And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years .
KJ21	Genesis	35	29	And Isaac gave up the ghost and died , and was gathered unto his people , being old and full of days ; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him .
KJ21	Genesis	36	36	And Hadad died , and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead .
KJ21	Genesis	36	2	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan : Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite ; and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite ;
KJ21	Genesis	36	3	and Basemath , Ishmael ’ s daughter , sister of Nebajoth .
KJ21	Genesis	36	4	And Adah bore to Esau , Eliphaz ; and Basemath bore Reuel ;
KJ21	Genesis	36	5	and Aholibamah bore Jeush and Jaalam and Korah . These are the sons of Esau , who were born unto him in the land of Canaan .
KJ21	Genesis	36	6	And Esau took his wives , and his sons and his daughters , and all the persons of his house , and his cattle and all his beasts , and all his substance which he had gotten in the land of Canaan , and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob .
KJ21	Genesis	36	7	For their riches were more than that they might dwell together , and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle .
KJ21	Genesis	36	8	Thus dwelt Esau in Mount Seir . Esau is Edom .
KJ21	Genesis	36	9	And these are the generations of Esau , the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir .
KJ21	Genesis	36	10	These are the names of Esau ’ s sons : Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau , Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau .

KJ21	Genesis	36	21	and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan : these are the chiefs of the Horites , the children of Seir in the land of Edom .

KJ21	Genesis	36	24	And these are the children of Zibeon : both Ajah and Anah ; this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father .
KJ21	Genesis	36	25	And the children of Anah were these : Dishon , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah .
KJ21	Genesis	36	26	And these are the children of Dishon : Hemdan and Eshban , and Ithran and Cheran .
KJ21	Genesis	36	27	The children of Ezer are these : Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan .

KJ21	Genesis	36	31	And these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom , before there reigned any king over the children of Israel .
KJ21	Genesis	36	32	And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom ; and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
KJ21	Genesis	36	33	And Bela died , and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead .
KJ21	Genesis	36	34	And Jobab died , and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead .

KJ21	Genesis	36	40	And these are the names of the chiefs who came of Esau , according to their families , after their places , by their names : Chief Timnah , Chief Alvah , Chief Jetheth ,

KJ21	Genesis	37	37	And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger , in the land of Canaan .
KJ21	Genesis	37	2	These are the generations of Jacob . Joseph , being seventeen years old , was feeding the flock with his brethren ; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah , and with the sons of Zilpah , his father ’ s wives . And Joseph brought unto his father an evil report about them .
KJ21	Genesis	37	3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age ; and he made him a coat of many colors .
KJ21	Genesis	37	4	And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren , they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him .
KJ21	Genesis	37	5	And Joseph dreamed a dream , and he told it to his brethren ; and they hated him yet the more .
KJ21	Genesis	37	6	And he said unto them , “ Hear , I pray you , this dream which I have dreamed :
KJ21	Genesis	37	7	For , behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and lo , my sheaf arose and also stood upright ; and behold , your sheaves stood round about , and made obeisance to my sheaf. ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	8	And his brethren said to him , “ Shalt thou indeed reign over us ? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us ? ” And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words .
KJ21	Genesis	37	9	And he dreamed yet another dream , and told it to his brethren and said , “ Behold , I have dreamed one dream more ; and behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	10	And he told it to his father and to his brethren ; and his father rebuked him and said unto him , “ What is this dream that thou hast dreamed ? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	11	And his brethren envied him , but his father observed the saying .
KJ21	Genesis	37	12	And his brethren went to feed their father ’ s flock in Shechem .
KJ21	Genesis	37	13	And Israel said unto Joseph , “ Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem ? Come , and I will send thee unto them. ” And he said to him , “ Here am I. ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	14	And he said to him , “ Go , I pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks , and bring me word again. ” So he sent him out of the Vale of Hebron , and he came to Shechem .
KJ21	Genesis	37	15	And a certain man found him , and behold , he was wandering in the field ; and the man asked him , saying , “ What seekest thou ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	16	And he said , “ I seek my brethren . Tell me , I pray thee , where they feed their flocks. ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	17	And the man said , “ They have departed hence , for I heard them say , ‘ Let us go to Dothan. ’ ” And Joseph went after his brethren , and found them in Dothan .
KJ21	Genesis	37	18	And when they saw him afar off , even before he came near unto them , they conspired against him to slay him .
KJ21	Genesis	37	19	And they said one to another , “ Behold , this dreamer cometh .
KJ21	Genesis	37	20	Come now therefore and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , ‘ Some evil beast hath devoured him ’ ; and we shall see what will become of his dreams. ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	21	And Reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands and said , “ Let us not kill him. ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	22	And Reuben said unto them , “ Shed no blood , but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness , and lay no hand upon him ” — that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again .
KJ21	Genesis	37	23	And it came to pass , when Joseph had come unto his brethren , that they stripped Joseph of his coat , his coat of many colors that was on him ;
KJ21	Genesis	37	24	and they took him and cast him into a pit . And the pit was empty ; there was no water in it .
KJ21	Genesis	37	25	And they sat down to eat bread ; and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and behold , a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels , bearing spices and balm and myrrh , going to carry them down to Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	37	26	And Judah said unto his brethren , “ What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood ?
KJ21	Genesis	37	27	Come , and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our flesh. ” And his brethren were content .
KJ21	Genesis	37	28	Then there passed by Midianite merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver . And they brought Joseph into Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	37	29	And Reuben returned unto the pit , and behold , Joseph was not in the pit ; and he rent his clothes .
KJ21	Genesis	37	30	And he returned unto his brethren and said , “ The child is no more ; and I , whither shall I go ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	31	And they took Joseph ’ s coat , and killed a kid from the goats , and dipped the coat in the blood .
KJ21	Genesis	37	32	And they sent the coat of many colors , and they brought it to their father and said , “ This have we found . Know now whether it be thy son ’ s coat or not ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	33	And he knew it , and said , “ It is my son ’ s coat . An evil beast hath devoured him . Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. ”
KJ21	Genesis	37	34	And Jacob rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his loins , and mourned for his son many days .
KJ21	Genesis	37	35	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him ; but he refused to be comforted , and he said , “ For I will go down into the grave unto my son , mourning. ” Thus his father wept for him .
KJ21	Genesis	37	36	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh ’ s and captain of the guard .
KJ21	Genesis	38	38	And it came to pass at that time , that Judah went down from his brethren , and turned unto a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
KJ21	Genesis	38	2	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite , whose name was Shua ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
KJ21	Genesis	38	3	And she conceived and bore a son , and he called his name Er .
KJ21	Genesis	38	4	And she conceived again and bore a son , and she called his name Onan .
KJ21	Genesis	38	5	And she yet again conceived and bore a son , and called his name Shelah . And he was at Chezib when she bore him .
KJ21	Genesis	38	6	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn , whose name was Tamar .
KJ21	Genesis	38	7	And Er , Judah ’ s firstborn , was wicked in the sight of the Lord ; and the Lord slew him .
KJ21	Genesis	38	8	And Judah said unto Onan , “ Go in unto thy brother ’ s wife and marry her , and raise up seed to thy brother. ”
KJ21	Genesis	38	9	And Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother ’ s wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest he should give seed to his brother .
KJ21	Genesis	38	10	And the thing which he did displeased the Lord ; therefore He slew him also .
KJ21	Genesis	38	11	Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law , “ Remain a widow at thy father ’ s house , until Shelah my son is grown ” ; for he said , “ Lest perhaps he die also , as his brethren did. ” And Tamar went and dwelt in her father ’ s house .
KJ21	Genesis	38	12	And in process of time , the daughter of Shua , Judah ’ s wife , died ; and Judah was comforted , and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnah , he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite .
KJ21	Genesis	38	13	And it was told Tamar , saying , “ Behold , thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep. ”
KJ21	Genesis	38	14	And she put her widow ’ s garments off from her and covered herself with a veil , and wrapped herself , and sat in an open place which is on the way to Timnah ; for she saw that Shelah was grown , and she was not given unto him as wife .
KJ21	Genesis	38	15	When Judah saw her , he thought her to be a harlot , because she had covered her face .
KJ21	Genesis	38	16	And he turned unto her on the wayside and said , “ Come , I pray thee , let me come in unto thee ” ( for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law ) . And she said , “ What wilt thou give me , that thou mayest come in unto me ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	38	17	And he said , “ I will send thee a kid from the flock. ” And she said , “ Wilt thou give me a pledge until thou send it ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	38	18	And he said , “ What pledge shall I give thee ? ” And she said , “ Thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand. ” And he gave it to her and came in unto her , and she conceived by him .
KJ21	Genesis	38	19	And she arose and went away , and laid aside her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
KJ21	Genesis	38	20	And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to receive his pledge from the woman ’ s hand , but he found her not .
KJ21	Genesis	38	21	Then he asked the men of that place , saying , “ Where is the harlot who was openly by the wayside ? ” And they said , “ There was no harlot in this place. ”
KJ21	Genesis	38	22	And he returned to Judah and said , “ I can not find her , and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place. ”
KJ21	Genesis	38	23	And Judah said , “ Let her take them for herself , lest we be shamed ; behold , I sent this kid , and thou hast not found her. ”
KJ21	Genesis	38	24	And it came to pass about three months after that it was told Judah , saying , “ Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot ; and also , behold , she is with child by whoredom. ” And Judah said , “ Bring her forth , and let her be burned. ”
KJ21	Genesis	38	25	When she was brought forth , she sent to her father-in-law , saying , “ By the man whose these are , am I with child. ” And she said , “ Discern , I pray thee , whose are these — the signet , and bracelets , and staff. ”
KJ21	Genesis	38	26	And Judah acknowledged them and said , “ She hath been more righteous than I , because I gave her not to Shelah my son. ” And he knew her again no more .
KJ21	Genesis	38	27	And it came to pass in the time of her travail that , behold , twins were in her womb .
KJ21	Genesis	38	28	And it came to pass , when she travailed , that the one put out his hand ; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread , saying , “ This came out first. ”
KJ21	Genesis	38	29	And it came to pass as he drew back his hand that , behold , his brother came out ; and she said , “ How hast thou broken forth ? This breach be upon thee. ” Therefore his name was called Perez [ that is , A breach ] .
KJ21	Genesis	38	30	And afterward came out his brother who had the scarlet thread upon his hand , and his name was called Zerah .
KJ21	Genesis	39	39	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hands of the Ishmaelites , who had brought him down thither .
KJ21	Genesis	39	2	And the Lord was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
KJ21	Genesis	39	3	And his master saw that the Lord was with him , and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
KJ21	Genesis	39	4	And Joseph found grace in his sight , and he served him . And he made him overseer over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
KJ21	Genesis	39	5	And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had , that the Lord blessed the Egyptian ’ s house for Joseph ’ s sake ; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field .
KJ21	Genesis	39	6	And he left all that he had in Joseph ’ s hand ; and he knew not anything he had , save the bread which he ate . And Joseph was a goodly person , and wellfavored .
KJ21	Genesis	39	7	And it came to pass after these things , that his master ’ s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph ; and she said , “ Lie with me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	39	8	But he refused , and said unto his master ’ s wife , “ Behold , my master knoweth not what is with me in the house , and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand .
KJ21	Genesis	39	9	There is none greater in this house than I , neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee , because thou art his wife . How then can I do this great wickedness , and sin against God ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	39	10	And it came to pass , as she spoke to Joseph day by day , that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her .
KJ21	Genesis	39	11	And it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business , and there were none of the men of the house there within .
KJ21	Genesis	39	12	And she caught him by his garment , saying , “ Lie with me. ” And he left his garment in her hand and fled , and got himself out .
KJ21	Genesis	39	13	And it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled forth ,
KJ21	Genesis	39	14	that she called unto the men of her house and spoke unto them , saying , “ See , he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us . He came in unto me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice .
KJ21	Genesis	39	15	And it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me and fled , and got himself out. ”
KJ21	Genesis	39	16	And she laid aside his garment by her until his lord came home .
KJ21	Genesis	39	17	And she spoke unto him according to these words , saying , “ The Hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me .
KJ21	Genesis	39	18	And it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me and fled out. ”
KJ21	Genesis	39	19	And it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke unto him , saying , “ After this manner did thy servant to me , ” that his wrath was kindled .
KJ21	Genesis	39	20	And Joseph ’ s master took him and put him into the prison , a place where the king ’ s prisoners were bound ; and he was there in the prison .
KJ21	Genesis	39	21	But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy , and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
KJ21	Genesis	39	22	And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph ’ s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the doer of it .
KJ21	Genesis	39	23	The keeper of the prison looked not into any thing that was under his hand , because the Lord was with him ; and that which he did , the Lord made it to prosper .
KJ21	Genesis	40	40	And it came to pass after these things , that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	40	2	And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers—against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers .
KJ21	Genesis	40	3	And he put them under guard in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
KJ21	Genesis	40	4	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them , and he served them ; and they continued a season under guard .
KJ21	Genesis	40	5	And they dreamed a dream both of them , each man his dream in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
KJ21	Genesis	40	6	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them , and behold , they were sad .
KJ21	Genesis	40	7	And he asked Pharaoh ’ s officers who were with him in the guard of his lord ’ s house , saying , “ Why look ye so sadly today ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	40	8	And they said unto him , “ We have dreamed a dream , and there is no interpreter of it. ” And Joseph said unto them , “ Do not interpretations belong to God ? Tell me them , I pray you. ”
KJ21	Genesis	40	9	And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , “ In my dream , behold , a vine was before me .
KJ21	Genesis	40	10	And in the vine were three branches ; and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot forth , and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes .
KJ21	Genesis	40	11	And Pharaoh ’ s cup was in my hand ; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh ’ s cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh ’ s hand. ”
KJ21	Genesis	40	12	And Joseph said unto him , “ This is the interpretation of it : The three branches are three days .
KJ21	Genesis	40	13	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place ; and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh ’ s cup into his hand , after the former manner when thou wast his butler .
KJ21	Genesis	40	14	But think on me when it shall be well with thee , and show kindness , I pray thee , unto me ; and make mention of me unto Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house .
KJ21	Genesis	40	15	For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews ; and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. ”
KJ21	Genesis	40	16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good , he said unto Joseph , “ I also was in my dream , and behold , I had three white baskets on my head .
KJ21	Genesis	40	17	And in the uppermost basket there were all manner of baked meats for Pharaoh , and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head. ”
KJ21	Genesis	40	18	And Joseph answered and said , “ This is the interpretation thereof : The three baskets are three days .
KJ21	Genesis	40	19	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. ”
KJ21	Genesis	40	20	And it came to pass the third day , which was Pharaoh ’ s birthday , that he made a feast unto all his servants . And he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants .
KJ21	Genesis	40	21	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again , and he gave the cup into Pharaoh ’ s hand ;
KJ21	Genesis	40	22	but he hanged the chief baker , as Joseph had interpreted to them .
KJ21	Genesis	40	23	Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph , but forgot him .
KJ21	Genesis	41	41	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , “ See , I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	2	And behold , there came up out of the river seven wellfavored cows , and fatfleshed ; and they fed in a meadow .
KJ21	Genesis	41	3	And behold , seven other cows came up after them out of the river , illfavored and leanfleshed , and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river .
KJ21	Genesis	41	4	And the illfavored and leanfleshed cows ate up the seven wellfavored and fat cows . So Pharaoh awoke .
KJ21	Genesis	41	5	And he slept and dreamed the second time ; and behold , seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk , rank and good .
KJ21	Genesis	41	6	And behold , seven thin ears , blasted with the east wind sprang up after them .
KJ21	Genesis	41	7	And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears . And Pharaoh awoke , and behold , it was a dream .
KJ21	Genesis	41	8	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof . And Pharaoh told them his dream , but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh .
KJ21	Genesis	41	9	Then spoke the chief butler unto Pharaoh , saying , “ I do remember my faults this day .
KJ21	Genesis	41	10	Pharaoh was wroth with his servants , and put me under guard in the captain of the guard ’ s house , both me and the chief baker .
KJ21	Genesis	41	11	And we dreamed a dream one night , I and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
KJ21	Genesis	41	12	And there was there with us a young man , a Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams . To each man according to his dream he did interpret .
KJ21	Genesis	41	13	And it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was : me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon ; and he shaved himself and changed his raiment , and came in unto Pharaoh .
KJ21	Genesis	41	15	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , “ I have dreamed a dream , and there is none that can interpret it ; and I have heard say of thee , that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	16	And Joseph answered Pharaoh , saying , “ It is not in me : God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , “ In my dream , behold , I stood upon the bank of the river .
KJ21	Genesis	41	18	And behold , there came up out of the river seven cows , fatfleshed and wellfavored , and they fed in a meadow .
KJ21	Genesis	41	19	And behold , seven other cows came up after them , poor and very illfavored and leanfleshed , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness .
KJ21	Genesis	41	20	And the lean and the illfavored cows ate up the first seven fat cows ;
KJ21	Genesis	41	21	and when they had eaten them up , it could not be known that they had eaten them , but they were still illfavored , as at the beginning . So I awoke .
KJ21	Genesis	41	22	And I saw in my dream , and behold , seven ears came up in one stalk , full and good ;
KJ21	Genesis	41	23	and behold , seven ears , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind sprang up after them .
KJ21	Genesis	41	24	And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears . And I told this unto the magicians , but there was none that could declare it to me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	25	And Joseph said unto Pharaoh , “ The dreams of Pharaoh are one . God hath shown Pharaoh what He is about to do .
KJ21	Genesis	41	26	The seven good cows are seven years , and the seven good ears are seven years : the dreams are one .
KJ21	Genesis	41	27	And the seven thin and illfavored cows that came up after them are seven years , and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine .
KJ21	Genesis	41	28	This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh : what God is about to do He showeth unto Pharaoh .
KJ21	Genesis	41	29	Behold , there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	41	30	And there shall arise after them seven years of famine ; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt , and the famine shall consume the land .
KJ21	Genesis	41	31	And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following , for it shall be very grievous .
KJ21	Genesis	41	32	And for that the dream was repeated unto Pharaoh twice ; it is because the thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass .
KJ21	Genesis	41	33	Now therefore let Pharaoh seek out a man discreet and wise , and set him over the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	41	34	Let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint overseers over the land , and take up a fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years .
KJ21	Genesis	41	35	And let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
KJ21	Genesis	41	36	And that food shall be for store for the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt , that the land perish not through the famine. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	37	And the counsel was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants .
KJ21	Genesis	41	38	And Pharaoh said unto his servants , “ Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the Spirit of God is ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	39	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , “ Inasmuch as God hath shown thee all this , there is none so discreet and wise as thou art .
KJ21	Genesis	41	40	Thou shalt be over my house , and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled . Only in the throne will I be greater than thou. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	42	And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph ’ s hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck .
KJ21	Genesis	41	43	And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had ; and they cried before him , “ Bow the knee ! ” And he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	41	44	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , “ I am Pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	45	And Pharaoh called Joseph ’ s name Zaphnathpaaneah ; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah , priest of On . And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	41	46	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	41	47	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls .
KJ21	Genesis	41	48	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities ; the food of the field , which was round about every city , laid he up in the same .
KJ21	Genesis	41	49	And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea — very much , until he left off numbering ; for it was without number .
KJ21	Genesis	41	50	And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came , whom Asenath the daughter of Potipherah , priest of On , bore unto him .
KJ21	Genesis	41	51	And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh [ that is , Forgetting ] , “ For God , ” said he , “ hath made me forget all my toil and all my father ’ s house. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	52	And the name of the second called he Ephraim [ that is , Fruitful ] , “ For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	53	And the seven years of plenteousness , which were in the land of Egypt , were ended .
KJ21	Genesis	41	54	And the seven years of dearth began to come , according as Joseph had said ; and the dearth was in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
KJ21	Genesis	41	55	And when all the land of Egypt was famished , the people cried to Pharaoh for bread ; and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians , “ Go unto Joseph . What he saith to you , do. ”
KJ21	Genesis	41	56	And the famine was over all the face of the earth ; and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the Egyptians . And the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	41	57	And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn , because the famine was so sore in all lands .
KJ21	Genesis	42	42	Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt , Jacob said unto his sons , “ Why do ye look one upon another ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	2	And he said , “ Behold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt . Go down thither and buy for us from thence , that we may live and not die. ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	3	And Joseph ’ s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	42	4	But Benjamin , Joseph ’ s brother , Jacob sent not with his brethren , for he said , “ Lest perhaps mischief befall him. ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	5	And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those who came , for the famine was in the land of Canaan .
KJ21	Genesis	42	6	And Joseph was the governor over the land , and he it was who sold to all the people of the land ; and Joseph ’ s brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	42	7	And Joseph saw his brethren , and he recognized them , but made himself as a stranger unto them and spoke roughly unto them ; and he said unto them , “ From whence come ye ? ” And they said , “ From the land of Canaan to buy food. ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	8	And Joseph knew his brethren , but they knew not him .
KJ21	Genesis	42	9	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them , and said unto them , “ Ye are spies ! To see the nakedness of the land ye have come ! ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	10	And they said unto him , “ Nay , my lord , but to buy food have thy servants come .
KJ21	Genesis	42	11	We are all one man ’ s sons ; we are true men , thy servants are no spies. ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	12	And he said unto them , “ Nay , but to see the nakedness of the land ye have come. ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	13	And they said , “ Thy servants are twelve brethren , the sons of one man in the land of Canaan ; and behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is no more. ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	14	And Joseph said unto them , “ That is it that I spoke unto you , saying , ‘ Ye are spies ! ’
KJ21	Genesis	42	15	Hereby ye shall be tested : by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence , unless your youngest brother come hither .
KJ21	Genesis	42	16	Send one of you and let him fetch your brother ; and ye shall be kept in prison , that your words may be tested , whether there be any truth in you ; or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies ! ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	17	And he put them all together into custody three days .
KJ21	Genesis	42	18	And Joseph said unto them the third day , “ This do , and live , for I fear God :
KJ21	Genesis	42	19	If ye be true men , let one of your brethren be bound in the prison house . Go ye , carry corn for the famine of your houses .
KJ21	Genesis	42	20	But bring your youngest brother unto me ; so shall your words be verified , and ye shall not die. ” And they did so .
KJ21	Genesis	42	21	And they said one to another , “ We are verily guilty concerning our brother , in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us , and we would not hear . Therefore has this distress come upon us. ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	22	And Reuben answered them , saying , “ Spoke I not unto you , saying , ‘ Do not sin against the child ’ ; and ye would not hear ? Therefore , behold , also his blood is required. ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	23	And they knew not that Joseph understood them , for he spoke unto them by an interpreter .
KJ21	Genesis	42	24	And he turned himself away from them and wept ; and returned to them again and communed with them , and took from them Simeon and bound him before their eyes .
KJ21	Genesis	42	25	Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every man ’ s money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way ; and thus did he unto them .
KJ21	Genesis	42	26	And they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence .
KJ21	Genesis	42	27	And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender at the inn , he espied his money ; for behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .
KJ21	Genesis	42	28	And he said unto his brethren , “ My money is restored ; and lo , it is even in my sack. ” And their heart failed them and they were afraid , saying one to another , “ What is this that God hath done unto us ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	29	And they came unto Jacob their father , unto the land of Canaan , and told him all that befell them , saying ,
KJ21	Genesis	42	30	“ The man who is the lord of the land spoke roughly to us , and took us for spies of the country .
KJ21	Genesis	42	31	And we said unto him , ‘ We are true men ; we are no spies .
KJ21	Genesis	42	32	We are twelve brethren , sons of our father . One is no more , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. ’
KJ21	Genesis	42	33	And the man , the lord of the country , said unto us , ‘ Hereby shall I know that ye are true men : Leave one of your brethren here with me , and take food for the famine of your households , and be gone ;
KJ21	Genesis	42	34	and bring your youngest brother unto me . Then shall I know that ye are not spies , but that ye are true men ; so will I deliver you your brother , and ye shall traffic in the land. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	35	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that behold , every man ’ s bundle of money was in his sack ; and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
KJ21	Genesis	42	36	And Jacob their father said unto them , “ Me have ye bereaved of my children : Joseph is no more , and Simeon is no more , and ye will take Benjamin away . All these things are against me. ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	37	And Reuben spoke unto his father , saying , “ Slay my two sons if I bring him not to thee . Deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again. ”
KJ21	Genesis	42	38	And he said , “ My son shall not go down with you , for his brother is dead , and he is left alone . If mischief befall him by the way in which ye go , then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave . ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	43	And the famine was sore in the land .
KJ21	Genesis	43	2	And it came to pass , when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said unto them , “ Go again , buy us a little food. ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	3	And Judah spoke unto him , saying , “ The man did solemnly declare unto us , saying , ‘ Ye shall not see my face , unless your brother be with you. ’
KJ21	Genesis	43	4	If thou wilt send our brother with us , we will go down and buy thee food .
KJ21	Genesis	43	5	But if thou wilt not send him , we will not go down , for the man said unto us , ‘ Ye shall not see my face , unless your brother be with you. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	6	And Israel said , “ Why dealt ye so ill with me , as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	7	And they said , “ The man asked us strictly about our state , and about our kindred , saying , ‘ Is your father yet alive ? Have ye another brother ? ’ And we told him according to the tenor of these words . Could we certainly know that he would say , ‘ Bring your brother down ’ ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	8	And Judah said unto Israel his father , “ Send the lad with me , and we will arise and go , that we may live and not die , both we and thou , and also our little ones .
KJ21	Genesis	43	9	I will be surety for him ; from my hand shalt thou require him . If I bring him not unto thee and set him before thee , then let me bear the blame for ever ;
KJ21	Genesis	43	10	for had we not lingered , surely now we would have returned this second time. ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	11	And their father Israel said unto them , “ If it must be so now , do this : Take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels , and carry down the man a present , a little balm and a little honey , spices and myrrh , nuts and almonds .
KJ21	Genesis	43	12	And take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks , carry it again in your hand . Perhaps it was an oversight .
KJ21	Genesis	43	13	Take also your brother , and arise , go again unto the man ;
KJ21	Genesis	43	14	and God Almighty give you mercy before the man , that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin . If I am bereaved of my children , I am bereaved ! ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	15	And the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and they rose up , and went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
KJ21	Genesis	43	16	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the ruler of his house , “ Bring these men home , and slay a beast and make ready ; for these men shall dine with me at noon. ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	17	And the man did as Joseph bade , and the man brought the men into Joseph ’ s house .
KJ21	Genesis	43	18	And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph ’ s house ; and they said , “ Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time are we brought in , that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us , and take us for bondmen , and also our asses. ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	19	And they came near to the steward of Joseph ’ s house , and they communed with him at the door of the house
KJ21	Genesis	43	20	and said , “ O sir , we came indeed down the first time to buy food .
KJ21	Genesis	43	21	And it came to pass , when we came to the inn , that we opened our sacks , and behold , every man ’ s money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight ; and we have brought it again in our hand .
KJ21	Genesis	43	22	And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food . We can not tell who put our money in our sacks. ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	23	And he said , “ Peace be to you , fear not ; your God and the God of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks . I had your money. ” And he brought Simeon out unto them .
KJ21	Genesis	43	24	And the man brought the men into Joseph ’ s house , and gave them water and they washed their feet ; and he gave their asses provender .
KJ21	Genesis	43	25	And they made ready the present for Joseph ’ s coming at noon , for they heard that they should eat bread there .
KJ21	Genesis	43	26	And when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed themselves before him to the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	43	27	And he asked them of their welfare and said , “ Is your father well , the old man of whom ye spoke ? Is he yet alive ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	28	And they answered , “ Thy servant our father is in good health ; he is yet alive. ” And they bowed down their heads and made obeisance .
KJ21	Genesis	43	29	And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin , his mother ’ s son , and said , “ Is this your younger brother of whom ye spoke unto me ? ” And he said , “ God be gracious unto thee , my son. ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	30	And Joseph made haste , for his heart yearned for his brother , and he sought somewhere to weep ; and he entered into his chamber and wept there .
KJ21	Genesis	43	31	And he washed his face and went out , and restrained himself , and said , “ Set on the bread. ”
KJ21	Genesis	43	32	And they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves , because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews , for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
KJ21	Genesis	43	33	And they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth ; and the men marveled one at another .
KJ21	Genesis	43	34	And he took and sent portions unto them from before him , but Benjamin ’ s portion was five times as much as any of theirs . And they drank and were merry with him .
KJ21	Genesis	44	44	And he commanded the steward of his house , saying , “ Fill the men ’ s sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man ’ s money in the mouth of his sack .
KJ21	Genesis	44	2	And put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack ’ s mouth of the youngest , and his corn money. ” And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
KJ21	Genesis	44	3	As soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their asses .
KJ21	Genesis	44	4	And when they had gone out of the city , and not yet far off , Joseph said unto his steward , “ Up , follow after the men ; and when thou dost overtake them , say unto them , ‘ Why have ye rewarded evil for good ?
KJ21	Genesis	44	5	Is not this that from which my lord drinketh , and whereby indeed he divineth ? Ye have done evil in so doing. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	44	6	And he overtook them , and he spoke unto them these same words .
KJ21	Genesis	44	7	And they said unto him , “ Why saith my lord these words ? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing !
KJ21	Genesis	44	8	Behold , the money which we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan . How then would we steal out of thy lord ’ s house silver or gold ?
KJ21	Genesis	44	9	With whomsoever of thy servants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lord ’ s bondmen. ”
KJ21	Genesis	44	10	And he said , “ Now also let it be according unto your words : he with whom it is found shall be my servant , and ye shall be blameless. ”
KJ21	Genesis	44	11	Then every man speedily took down his sack to the ground , and opened every man his sack .
KJ21	Genesis	44	12	And he searched , and began with the eldest and ended with the youngest ; and the cup was found in Benjamin ’ s sack .
KJ21	Genesis	44	13	Then they rent their clothes ; and every man loaded his ass , and returned to the city .
KJ21	Genesis	44	14	And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph ’ s house ( for he was yet there ) , and they fell before him on the ground .
KJ21	Genesis	44	15	And Joseph said unto them , “ What deed is this that ye have done ? Know ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	44	16	And Judah said , “ What shall we say unto my lord ? What shall we speak ? Or how shall we clear ourselves ? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants ; behold , we are my lord ’ s servants , both we and he also with whom the cup was found. ”
KJ21	Genesis	44	17	And he said , “ God forbid that I should do so ; but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , go up in peace unto your father. ”
KJ21	Genesis	44	18	Then Judah came near unto him and said , “ Oh my lord , let thy servant , I pray thee , speak a word in my lord ’ s ears , and let not thine anger burn against thy servant ; for thou art even as Pharaoh .
KJ21	Genesis	44	19	My lord asked his servants , saying , ‘ Have ye a father or a brother ? ’
KJ21	Genesis	44	20	And we said unto my lord , ‘ We have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother , and his father loveth him. ’
KJ21	Genesis	44	21	And thou saidst unto thy servants , ‘ Bring him down unto me , that I may set mine eyes upon him. ’
KJ21	Genesis	44	22	And we said unto my lord , ‘ The lad can not leave his father ; for if he should leave his father , his father would die. ’
KJ21	Genesis	44	23	And thou saidst unto thy servants , ‘ Unless your youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more. ’
KJ21	Genesis	44	24	And it came to pass , when we came up unto thy servant , my father , we told him the words of my lord .
KJ21	Genesis	44	25	And our father said , ‘ Go again , and buy us a little food. ’
KJ21	Genesis	44	26	And we said , ‘ We can not go down . If our youngest brother be with us , then will we go down , for we may not see the man ’ s face unless our youngest brother is with us. ’
KJ21	Genesis	44	27	And thy servant , my father , said unto us , ‘ Ye know that my wife bore me two sons ;
KJ21	Genesis	44	28	and the one went out from me , and I said , “ Surely he is torn in pieces ” ; and I saw him not since .
KJ21	Genesis	44	29	And if ye take this also from me , and harm befall him , ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. ’
KJ21	Genesis	44	30	Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us , seeing that his life is bound up in the lad ’ s life ,
KJ21	Genesis	44	31	it shall come to pass , when he seeth that the lad is not with us , that he will die ; and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave .
KJ21	Genesis	44	32	For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father , saying , ‘ If I bring him not unto thee , then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. ’
KJ21	Genesis	44	33	Now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant remain instead of the lad as a bondman to my lord , and let the lad go up with his brethren .
KJ21	Genesis	44	34	For how shall I go up to my father and the lad be not with me , lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come upon my father ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	45	45	Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood by him ; and he cried , “ Cause every man to go out from me ! ” And there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
KJ21	Genesis	45	2	And he wept aloud , and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard .
KJ21	Genesis	45	3	And Joseph said unto his brethren , “ I am Joseph . Doth my father yet live ? ” And his brethren could not answer him , for they were troubled at his presence .
KJ21	Genesis	45	4	And Joseph said unto his brethren , “ Come near to me , I pray you. ” And they came near ; and he said , “ I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	45	5	Now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither , for God sent me before you to preserve life .
KJ21	Genesis	45	6	For these two years hath the famine been in the land , and yet there are five years in which there shall neither be planting nor harvest .
KJ21	Genesis	45	7	And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save your lives by a great deliverance .
KJ21	Genesis	45	8	So now it was not you that sent me hither , but God ; and He hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	45	9	Hasten ye , and go up to my father and say unto him , ‘ Thus saith thy son Joseph : God hath made me lord of all Egypt . Come down unto me , tarry not ;
KJ21	Genesis	45	10	and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen , and thou shalt be near unto me — thou , and thy children , and thy children ’ s children , and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast .
KJ21	Genesis	45	11	And there will I nourish thee ( for yet there are five years of famine ) , lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty. ’
KJ21	Genesis	45	12	And behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin , that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you .
KJ21	Genesis	45	13	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall make haste and bring down my father hither. ”
KJ21	Genesis	45	14	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin ’ s neck , and wept ; and Benjamin wept upon his neck .
KJ21	Genesis	45	15	Moreover he kissed all his brethren , and wept upon them ; and after that his brethren talked with him .
KJ21	Genesis	45	16	And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh ’ s house , saying , “ Joseph ’ s brethren have come ” ; and it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
KJ21	Genesis	45	17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , “ Say unto thy brethren , ‘ This do ye : Load your beasts and go , get you unto the land of Canaan .
KJ21	Genesis	45	18	And take your father and your households , and come unto me ; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land. ’
KJ21	Genesis	45	19	Now thou art commanded , this do ye : ‘ Take with you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
KJ21	Genesis	45	20	Also , regard not your possessions , for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	45	21	And the children of Israel did so ; and Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
KJ21	Genesis	45	22	To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of raiment .
KJ21	Genesis	45	23	And to his father he sent in this manner : ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten sheasses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father on the way .
KJ21	Genesis	45	24	So he sent his brethren away , and they departed ; and he said unto them , “ See that ye fall not out on the way. ”
KJ21	Genesis	45	25	And they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father ,
KJ21	Genesis	45	26	and told him , saying , “ Joseph is yet alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. ” And Jacob ’ s heart fainted , for he believed them not .
KJ21	Genesis	45	27	And they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said unto them ; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob their father revived .
KJ21	Genesis	45	28	And Israel said , “ It is enough ; Joseph my son is yet alive ! I will go and see him before I die . ”
KJ21	Genesis	46	46	And Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba , and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac .
KJ21	Genesis	46	2	And God spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night and said , “ Jacob , Jacob. ” And he said , “ Here am I. ”
KJ21	Genesis	46	3	And He said , “ I am God , the God of thy father . Fear not to go down into Egypt , for I will there make of thee a great nation .
KJ21	Genesis	46	4	I will go down with thee into Egypt , and I will also surely bring thee up again ; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. ”
KJ21	Genesis	46	5	And Jacob rose up from Beersheba ; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father , and their little ones and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
KJ21	Genesis	46	6	And they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt , Jacob , and all his seed with him :
KJ21	Genesis	46	7	his sons and his sons ’ sons with him , his daughters and his sons ’ daughters ; and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	46	8	And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt , Jacob and his sons : Reuben , Jacob ’ s firstborn .
KJ21	Genesis	46	9	And the sons of Reuben : Hanoch and Pallu , and Hezron and Carmi .
KJ21	Genesis	46	10	And the sons of Simeon : Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman .
KJ21	Genesis	46	11	And the sons of Levi : Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
KJ21	Genesis	46	12	And the sons of Judah : Er and Onan , and Shelah and Perez and Zerah ( but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan ) . And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul .
KJ21	Genesis	46	13	And the sons of Issachar : Tola , and Puvah and Job , and Shimron .
KJ21	Genesis	46	14	And the sons of Zebulun : Sered and Elon and Jahleel .
KJ21	Genesis	46	15	These are the sons of Leah , whom she bore unto Jacob in Padanaram , with his daughter Dinah . All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three .
KJ21	Genesis	46	16	And the sons of Gad : Ziphion and Haggi , Shuni , and Ezbon , Eri , and Arodi , and Areli .
KJ21	Genesis	46	17	And the sons of Asher : Jimnah and Ishuah , and Isui and Beriah , and Serah their sister . And the sons of Beriah : Heber and Malchiel .
KJ21	Genesis	46	18	These are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter , and these she bore unto Jacob , even sixteen souls .
KJ21	Genesis	46	19	The sons of Rachel , Jacob ’ s wife : Joseph and Benjamin .
KJ21	Genesis	46	20	And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , whom Asenath the daughter of Potipherah , priest of On , bore unto him .
KJ21	Genesis	46	21	And the sons of Benjamin were Belah and Becher and Ashbel , Gera and Naaman , Ehi and Rosh , Muppim and Huppim and Ard .
KJ21	Genesis	46	22	These are the sons of Rachel , who were born to Jacob ; all the souls were fourteen .
KJ21	Genesis	46	23	And the son of Dan : Hushim .
KJ21	Genesis	46	24	And the sons of Naphtali : Jahzeel and Guni , and Jezer and Shillem .
KJ21	Genesis	46	25	These are the sons of Bilhah , whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter , and she bore these unto Jacob ; all the souls were seven .
KJ21	Genesis	46	26	All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt , who came out of his loins , besides Jacob ’ s sons ’ wives , all the souls were threescore and six .
KJ21	Genesis	46	27	And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two souls ; all the souls of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt , were threescore and ten .
KJ21	Genesis	46	28	And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph to direct his face unto Goshen , and they came into the land of Goshen .
KJ21	Genesis	46	29	And Joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
KJ21	Genesis	46	30	And Israel said unto Joseph , “ Now let me die , since I have seen thy face , because thou art yet alive. ”
KJ21	Genesis	46	31	And Joseph said unto his brethren and unto his father ’ s house , “ I will go up and show Pharaoh , and say unto him , ‘ My brethren and my father ’ s house , who were in the land of Canaan , have come unto me .
KJ21	Genesis	46	32	And the men are shepherds , for their trade hath been to feed cattle ; and they have brought their flocks and their herds , and all that they have. ’
KJ21	Genesis	46	33	And it shall come to pass , when Pharaoh shall call you and shall say , ‘ What is your occupation ? ’
KJ21	Genesis	46	34	that ye shall say , ‘ Thy servants ’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now , both we and also our fathers , ’ that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians . ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	47	Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh , and said , “ My father and my brethren , and their flocks and their herds and all that they have , have come out of the land of Canaan ; and behold , they are in the land of Goshen. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	2	And he took some of his brethren , even five men , and presented them unto Pharaoh .
KJ21	Genesis	47	3	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren , “ What is your occupation ? ” And they said unto Pharaoh , “ Thy servants are shepherds , both we and also our fathers. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	4	They said moreover unto Pharaoh , “ To sojourn in the land have we come , for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks ; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan . Now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	5	And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph , saying , “ Thy father and thy brethren have come unto thee .
KJ21	Genesis	47	6	The land of Egypt is before thee . In the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell ; in the land of Goshen let them dwell ; and if thou knowest any industrious men among them , then make them rulers over my cattle. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	7	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father , and set him before Pharaoh ; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh .
KJ21	Genesis	47	8	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob , “ How old art thou ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	9	And Jacob said unto Pharaoh , “ The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years . Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been , and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh , and went out from before Pharaoh .
KJ21	Genesis	47	11	And Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
KJ21	Genesis	47	12	And Joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his father ’ s household with bread , according to their families .
KJ21	Genesis	47	13	And there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
KJ21	Genesis	47	14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the corn which they bought ; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh ’ s house .
KJ21	Genesis	47	15	And when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said , “ Give us bread ; for why should we die in thy presence ? For the money faileth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	16	And Joseph said , “ Give your cattle ; and I will give to you for your cattle , if money fail. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	17	And they brought their cattle unto Joseph ; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks , and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses ; and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year .
KJ21	Genesis	47	18	When that year was ended , they came unto him the second year , and said unto him , “ We will not hide it from my lord that our money is spent ; my lord also hath our herds of cattle . There is not anything left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands .
KJ21	Genesis	47	19	Why shall we die before thine eyes , both we and our land ? Buy us and our land for bread , and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh ; and give us seed , that we may live and not die , that the land be not desolate. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	20	And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh ; for the Egyptians sold every man his field , because the famine prevailed over them ; so the land became Pharaoh ’ s .
KJ21	Genesis	47	21	And as for the people , he removed them to cities , from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof .
KJ21	Genesis	47	22	Only the land of the priests bought he not ; for the priests had a portion assigned them by Pharaoh , and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them . Therefore they sold not their lands .
KJ21	Genesis	47	23	Then Joseph said unto the people , “ Behold , I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh . Lo , here is seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
KJ21	Genesis	47	24	And it shall come to pass in the harvest , that ye shall give a fifth part unto Pharaoh , and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food , and for those of your households and for food for your little ones. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	25	And they said , “ Thou hast saved our lives . Let us find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh ’ s servants. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	26	And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day , that Pharaoh should have a fifth part , except the land of the priests only , which became not Pharaoh ’ s .
KJ21	Genesis	47	27	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt , in the country of Goshen ; and they had possessions therein , and grew and multiplied exceedingly .
KJ21	Genesis	47	28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years ; so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred forty and seven years .
KJ21	Genesis	47	29	And the time drew nigh that Israel must die , and he called his son Joseph and said unto him , “ If now I have found grace in thy sight , put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh , and deal kindly and truly with me : bury me not , I pray thee , in Egypt .
KJ21	Genesis	47	30	But I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place. ” And he said , “ I will do as thou hast said. ”
KJ21	Genesis	47	31	And he said , “ Swear unto me. ” And he swore unto him . And Israel bowed himself upon the bed ’ s head .
KJ21	Genesis	48	48	And it came to pass after these things that one told Joseph , “ Behold , thy father is sick ” ; and he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
KJ21	Genesis	48	2	And one told Jacob and said , “ Behold , thy son Joseph cometh unto thee ” ; and Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed .
KJ21	Genesis	48	3	And Jacob said unto Joseph , “ God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan , and blessed me
KJ21	Genesis	48	4	and said unto me , ‘ Behold , I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee ; and I will make of thee a multitude of people , and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. ’
KJ21	Genesis	48	5	And now thy two sons , Ephraim and Manasseh , who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt , are mine ; as Reuben and Simeon , they shall be mine .
KJ21	Genesis	48	6	And thy issue whom thou begettest after them shall be thine , and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
KJ21	Genesis	48	7	And as for me , when I came from Padan , Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way , when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath ; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath ” ( the same is Bethlehem ) .
KJ21	Genesis	48	8	And Israel beheld Joseph ’ s sons , and said , “ Who are these ? ”
KJ21	Genesis	48	9	And Joseph said unto his father , “ They are my sons , whom God hath given me in this place. ” And he said , “ Bring them , I pray thee , unto me , and I will bless them. ”
KJ21	Genesis	48	10	( Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age , so that he could not see . ) And he brought them near unto him ; and he kissed them and embraced them .
KJ21	Genesis	48	11	And Israel said unto Joseph , “ I had not thought to see thy face ; and lo , God hath shown me also thy seed. ”
KJ21	Genesis	48	12	And Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
KJ21	Genesis	48	13	And Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel ’ s left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel ’ s right hand , and brought them near unto him .
KJ21	Genesis	48	14	And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim ’ s head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Manasseh ’ s head , guiding his hands wittingly ; for Manasseh was the firstborn .
KJ21	Genesis	48	15	And he blessed Joseph and said , “ God , before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked , the God who fed me all my life long unto this day ,
KJ21	Genesis	48	16	the Angel who redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads ; and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	48	17	And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim , it displeased him ; and he held up his father ’ s hand to remove it from Ephraim ’ s head unto Manasseh ’ s head .
KJ21	Genesis	48	18	And Joseph said unto his father , “ Not so , my father , for this is the firstborn . Put thy right hand upon his head. ”
KJ21	Genesis	48	19	And his father refused and said , “ I know it , my son , I know it . He also shall become a people , and he also shall be great ; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he , and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. ”
KJ21	Genesis	48	20	And he blessed them that day , saying , “ In thee shall Israel bless , saying , ‘ God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. ’ ” And he set Ephraim before Manasseh .
KJ21	Genesis	48	21	And Israel said unto Joseph , “ Behold , I die ; but God shall be with you , and bring you again unto the land of your fathers .
KJ21	Genesis	48	22	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow . ”
KJ21	Genesis	49	49	And Jacob called unto his sons and said , “ Gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days .
KJ21	Genesis	49	2	“ Gather yourselves together and hear , ye sons of Jacob , and hearken unto Israel your father :
KJ21	Genesis	49	3	“ Reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power .
KJ21	Genesis	49	4	Unstable as water , thou shalt not excel , because thou wentest up to thy father ’ s bed ; then defiledst thou it ; he went up to my couch .
KJ21	Genesis	49	5	“ Simeon and Levi are brethren ; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations .
KJ21	Genesis	49	6	O my soul , come not thou into their secret ; unto their assembly , mine honor , be not thou united ; for in their anger they slew a man , and in their selfwill they dug down a wall .
KJ21	Genesis	49	7	Cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel ! I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
KJ21	Genesis	49	8	“ Judah , thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise ; thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies ; thy father ’ s children shall bow down before thee .
KJ21	Genesis	49	9	Judah is a lion ’ s whelp ; from the prey , my son , thou art gone up . He stooped down , he couched as a lion , and as an old lion ; who shall rouse him up ?
KJ21	Genesis	49	10	The scepter shall not depart from Judah , nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come ; and unto Him shall the gathering of the people be .
KJ21	Genesis	49	11	Binding his foal unto the vine , and his ass ’ s colt unto the choice vine , he washed his garments in wine , and his clothes in the blood of grapes .
KJ21	Genesis	49	12	His eyes shall be red with wine , and his teeth white with milk .
KJ21	Genesis	49	13	“ Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for a haven of ships , and his border shall be unto Sidon .
KJ21	Genesis	49	14	“ Issachar is a strong ass , couching down between two burdens .
KJ21	Genesis	49	15	And he saw that rest was good , and the land that it was pleasant , and bowed his shoulder to bear , and became a servant to tribute .
KJ21	Genesis	49	16	“ Dan shall judge his people , as one of the tribes of Israel .
KJ21	Genesis	49	17	Dan shall be a serpent by the way , an adder in the path , that biteth the horse ’ s heels , so that his rider shall fall backward .
KJ21	Genesis	49	18	I have waited for Thy salvation , O Lord !
KJ21	Genesis	49	19	“ Gad , a troop shall overcome him ; but he shall overcome at the last .
KJ21	Genesis	49	20	“ Out of Asher , his bread shall be fat , and he shall yield royal dainties .
KJ21	Genesis	49	21	“ Naphtali is a hind let loose ; he giveth goodly words .
KJ21	Genesis	49	22	“ Joseph is a fruitful bough , even a fruitful bough by a well , whose branches run over the wall .
KJ21	Genesis	49	23	The archers have sorely grieved him , and shot at him , and hated him .
KJ21	Genesis	49	24	But his bow abode in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob , from thence is the Shepherd , the Stone of Israel ,
KJ21	Genesis	49	25	even by the God of thy father , who shall help thee , and by the Almighty , who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lieth under , blessings of the breasts and of the womb .
KJ21	Genesis	49	26	The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills ; they shall be on the head of Joseph , and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren .
KJ21	Genesis	49	27	“ Benjamin shall raven as a wolf ; in the morning he shall devour the prey , and at night he shall divide the spoil. ”
KJ21	Genesis	49	28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel , and this is it that their father spoke unto them and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
KJ21	Genesis	49	29	And he charged them and said unto them , “ I am to be gathered unto my people . Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite ,
KJ21	Genesis	49	30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession as a burying place .
KJ21	Genesis	49	31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife ; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife , and there I buried Leah .
KJ21	Genesis	49	32	The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth. ”
KJ21	Genesis	49	33	And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
KJ21	Genesis	50	50	And Joseph fell upon his father ’ s face , and wept upon him , and kissed him .
KJ21	Genesis	50	2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father ; and the physicians embalmed Israel .
KJ21	Genesis	50	3	And forty days were fulfilled for him ( for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed ) , and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days .
KJ21	Genesis	50	4	And when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph spoke unto the house of Pharaoh , saying , “ If now I have found grace in your eyes , speak , I pray you , in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
KJ21	Genesis	50	5	‘ My father made me swear , saying , “ Lo , I die ; in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan , there shalt thou bury me. ” Now therefore let me go up , I pray thee , and bury my father , and I will come again. ’ ”
KJ21	Genesis	50	6	And Pharaoh said , “ Go up , and bury thy father , according as he made thee swear. ”
KJ21	Genesis	50	7	And Joseph went up to bury his father ; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
KJ21	Genesis	50	8	and all the house of Joseph , and his brethren , and his father ’ s house . Only their little ones , and their flocks and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
KJ21	Genesis	50	9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen ; and it was a very great company .
KJ21	Genesis	50	10	And they came to the threshing floor of Atad , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation ; and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
KJ21	Genesis	50	11	And when the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , saw the mourning at the floor of Atad , they said , “ This is a grievous mourning of the Egyptians. ” Therefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim [ that is , The mourning of the Egyptians ] , which is beyond the Jordan .
KJ21	Genesis	50	12	And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them .
KJ21	Genesis	50	13	For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession as a burying place from Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
KJ21	Genesis	50	14	And Joseph returned into Egypt , he and his brethren and all who went up with him to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
KJ21	Genesis	50	15	And when Joseph ’ s brethren saw that their father was dead , they said , “ Joseph will perhaps hate us , and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. ”
KJ21	Genesis	50	16	And they sent a messenger unto Joseph , saying , “ Thy father did command before he died , saying ,
KJ21	Genesis	50	17	‘ So shall ye say unto Joseph , “ Forgive , I pray thee now , the trespass of thy brethren and their sin , for they did unto thee evil. ” ’ And now , we pray thee , forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. ” And Joseph wept when they spoke unto him .
KJ21	Genesis	50	18	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face , and they said , “ Behold , we are thy servants. ”
KJ21	Genesis	50	19	And Joseph said unto them , “ Fear not ; for am I in the place of God ?
KJ21	Genesis	50	20	But as for you , ye thought evil against me , but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day , to save many people alive .
KJ21	Genesis	50	21	Now therefore fear ye not ; I will nourish you and your little ones. ” And he comforted them , and spoke kindly unto them .
KJ21	Genesis	50	22	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt , he and his father ’ s house ; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years .
KJ21	Genesis	50	23	And Joseph saw Ephraim ’ s children of the third generation . The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph ’ s knees .
KJ21	Genesis	50	24	And Joseph said unto his brethren , “ I die ; and God will surely visit you , and bring you out of this land unto the land which He swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob. ”
KJ21	Genesis	50	25	And Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel , saying , “ God will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. ”
KJ21	Genesis	50	26	So Joseph died , being a hundred and ten years old . And they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	1	1	Now these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob :
KJ21	Exodus	1	2	Reuben , Simeon , Levi and Judah ,
KJ21	Exodus	1	3	Issachar , Zebulun and Benjamin ,
KJ21	Exodus	1	4	Dan and Naphtali , Gad and Asher .
KJ21	Exodus	1	5	And all the souls who came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls , for Joseph was in Egypt already .
KJ21	Exodus	1	6	And Joseph died , and all his brethren , and all that generation .
KJ21	Exodus	1	7	And the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
KJ21	Exodus	1	8	Now there arose up a new king over Egypt , who knew not Joseph .
KJ21	Exodus	1	9	And he said unto his people , “ Behold , the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we .
KJ21	Exodus	1	10	Come on , let us deal wisely with them , lest they multiply and it come to pass , when there befalleth any war , that they join also unto our enemies and fight against us , and so get them up out of the land. ”
KJ21	Exodus	1	11	Therefore they set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens . And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities , Pithom and Raamses .
KJ21	Exodus	1	12	But the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew ; and they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Exodus	1	13	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor .
KJ21	Exodus	1	14	And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage , in mortar and in brick and in all manner of service in the field ; all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigor .
KJ21	Exodus	1	15	And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives , of whom the name of one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah .
KJ21	Exodus	1	16	And he said , “ When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the birthstools , if it be a son then ye shall kill him ; but if it be a daughter then she shall live. ”
KJ21	Exodus	1	17	But the midwives feared God , and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them , but saved the men children alive .
KJ21	Exodus	1	18	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them , “ Why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men children alive ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	1	19	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh , “ Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women ; for they are lively , and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. ”
KJ21	Exodus	1	20	Therefore God dealt well with the midwives , and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty .
KJ21	Exodus	1	21	And it came to pass , because the midwives feared God , that He made them houses .
KJ21	Exodus	1	22	And Pharaoh charged all his people , saying , “ Every son who is born ye shall cast into the river , and every daughter ye shall save alive . ”
KJ21	Exodus	2	2	And the woman conceived and bore a son ; and when she saw that he was a goodly child , she hid him three months .
KJ21	Exodus	2	3	And when she could no longer hide him , she took for him an ark of bulrushes , and daubed it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she laid it in the reeds by the river ’ s brink .
KJ21	Exodus	2	4	And his sister stood afar off to learn what would be done to him .
KJ21	Exodus	2	5	And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river , and her maidens walked along by the riverside ; and when she saw the ark among the reeds , she sent her maid to fetch it .
KJ21	Exodus	2	6	And when she had opened it , she saw the child ; and behold , the babe wept . And she had compassion on him and said , “ This is one of the Hebrews ’ children. ”
KJ21	Exodus	2	7	Then said his sister to Pharaoh ’ s daughter , “ Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for thee ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	2	8	And Pharaoh ’ s daughter said to her , “ Go. ” And the maid went and called the child ’ s mother .
KJ21	Exodus	2	9	And Pharaoh ’ s daughter said unto her , “ Take this child away and nurse it for me , and I will give thee thy wages. ” And the woman took the child , and nursed it .
KJ21	Exodus	2	10	And the child grew , and she brought him unto Pharaoh ’ s daughter , and he became her son . And she called his name Moses [ that is , Drawn out ] , and she said , “ Because I drew him out of the water. ”
KJ21	Exodus	2	11	And it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens ; and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew , one of his brethren .
KJ21	Exodus	2	12	And he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand .
KJ21	Exodus	2	13	And when he went out the second day , behold , two men of the Hebrews strove together ; and he said to him that did the wrong , “ Why smitest thou thy fellow ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	2	14	And he said , “ Who made thee a prince and a judge over us ? Intendest thou to kill me as thou killed the Egyptian ? ” And Moses feared and said , “ Surely this thing is known. ”
KJ21	Exodus	2	15	Now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses . But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian ; and he sat down by a well .
KJ21	Exodus	2	16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters ; and they came and drew water , and filled the troughs to water their father ’ s flock .
KJ21	Exodus	2	17	And the shepherds came and drove them away ; but Moses stood up and helped them , and watered their flock .
KJ21	Exodus	2	18	And when they came to Reuel their father , he said , “ How is it that ye have come so soon today ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	2	19	And they said , “ An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds , and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock. ”
KJ21	Exodus	2	20	And he said unto his daughters , “ And where is he ? Why is it that ye have left the man ? Call him , that he may eat bread. ”
KJ21	Exodus	2	21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man ; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter .
KJ21	Exodus	2	22	And she bore him a son , and he called his name Gershom [ that is , A stranger there ] ; for he said , “ I have been a stranger in a strange land. ”
KJ21	Exodus	2	23	And it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died . And the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage , and they cried ; and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage .
KJ21	Exodus	2	24	And God heard their groaning , and God remembered His covenant with Abraham , with Isaac , and with Jacob .
KJ21	Exodus	2	25	And God looked upon the children of Israel , and God took heed of them .
KJ21	Exodus	3	3	And Moses said , “ I will now turn aside and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt. ”
KJ21	Exodus	3	2	And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush ; and he looked and , behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
KJ21	Exodus	3	4	And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see , God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said , “ Moses , Moses. ” And he said , “ Here am I. ”
KJ21	Exodus	3	5	And He said , “ Draw not nigh hither . Put off thy shoes from off thy feet , for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. ”
KJ21	Exodus	3	6	Moreover He said , “ I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ” And Moses hid his face , for he was afraid to look upon God .
KJ21	Exodus	3	7	And the Lord said , “ I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt , and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters , for I know their sorrows .
KJ21	Exodus	3	8	And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large , unto a land flowing with milk and honey , unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites , and the Amorites and the Perizzites , and the Hivites and the Jebusites .
KJ21	Exodus	3	9	Now therefore behold , the cry of the children of Israel hath come unto Me , and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them .
KJ21	Exodus	3	10	Come now therefore , and I will send thee unto Pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth My people , the children of Israel , out of Egypt. ”
KJ21	Exodus	3	11	And Moses said unto God , “ Who am I , that I should go unto Pharaoh , and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	3	12	And He said , “ Certainly I will be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee : when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt , ye shall serve God upon this mountain. ”
KJ21	Exodus	3	13	And Moses said unto God , “ Behold , when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them , ‘ The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you , ’ and they shall say to me , ‘ What is His name ? ’ what shall I say unto them ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	3	14	And God said unto Moses , “ I Am That I Am. ” And He said , “ Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , ‘ I Am hath sent me unto you. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	3	15	And God said moreover unto Moses , “ Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel : ‘ The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob hath sent me unto you. ’ This is My name for ever , and this is My memorial unto all generations .
KJ21	Exodus	3	16	Go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , ‘ The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob appeared unto me , saying , “ I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt ;
KJ21	Exodus	3	17	and I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites , and the Amorites and the Perizzites , and the Hivites and the Jebusites , unto a land flowing with milk and honey. ” ’
KJ21	Exodus	3	18	And they shall hearken to thy voice ; and thou shalt come , thou and the elders of Israel , unto the king of Egypt , and ye shall say unto him , ‘ The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us ; and now let us go , we beseech thee , three days ’ journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God. ’
KJ21	Exodus	3	19	And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go , no , not by a mighty hand .
KJ21	Exodus	3	20	And I will stretch out My hand and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst thereof ; and after that he will let you go .
KJ21	Exodus	3	21	And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . And it shall come to pass that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty ,
KJ21	Exodus	3	22	but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment ; and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters , and ye shall despoil the Egyptians . ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	4	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Put forth thine hand and take it by the tail. ” And he put forth his hand and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand—
KJ21	Exodus	4	2	And the Lord said unto him , “ What is that in thine hand ? ” And he said , “ A rod. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	3	And He said , “ Cast it on the ground. ” And he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from before it .
KJ21	Exodus	4	5	“ that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	6	And the Lord said furthermore unto him , “ Put now thine hand into thy bosom. ” And he put his hand into his bosom ; and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous as snow .
KJ21	Exodus	4	7	And He said , “ Put thine hand into thy bosom again. ” And he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom , and behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
KJ21	Exodus	4	8	“ And it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
KJ21	Exodus	4	9	And it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land ; and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	10	And Moses said unto the Lord , “ O my Lord , I am not eloquent , neither heretofore nor since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant ; but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	11	And the Lord said unto him , “ Who hath made man ’ s mouth ? Or who maketh the dumb or deaf , or the seeing or the blind ? Have notI , the Lord ?
KJ21	Exodus	4	12	Now therefore go , and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	13	And he said , “ O my Lord , send , I pray Thee , by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	14	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses , and He said , “ Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother ? I know that he can speak well . And also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee ; and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in his heart .
KJ21	Exodus	4	15	And thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth ; and I will be with thy mouth and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
KJ21	Exodus	4	16	And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people ; and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him instead of God .
KJ21	Exodus	4	17	And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand , wherewith thou shalt do signs. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	18	And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law , and said unto him , “ Let me go , I pray thee , and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt and see whether they are yet alive. ” And Jethro said to Moses , “ Go in peace. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	19	And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian , “ Go , return into Egypt ; for all the men are dead who sought thy life. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	20	And Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt . And Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
KJ21	Exodus	4	21	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ When thou goest to return into Egypt , see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thine hand ; but I will harden his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
KJ21	Exodus	4	22	And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Israel is My son , even My firstborn .
KJ21	Exodus	4	23	And I say unto thee , “ Let My son go , that he may serve Me. ” And if thou refuse to let him go , behold , I will slay thy son , even thy firstborn. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	24	And it came to pass , on the way at the inn , that the Lord met him and sought to kill him .
KJ21	Exodus	4	25	Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet and said , “ Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	26	So He let him go ; then she said , “ A bloody husband thou art , because of the circumcision. ”
KJ21	Exodus	4	27	And the Lord said to Aaron , “ Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. ” And he went and met him on the mount of God , and kissed him .
KJ21	Exodus	4	28	And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him , and all the signs which He had commanded him .
KJ21	Exodus	4	29	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Exodus	4	30	And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
KJ21	Exodus	4	31	And the people believed ; and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that He had looked upon their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshiped .
KJ21	Exodus	5	5	And Pharaoh said , “ Behold , the people of the land now are many , and ye make them rest from their burdens ! ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	2	And Pharaoh said , “ Who is the Lord , that I should obey his voice to let Israel go ? I know not the Lord , neither will I let Israel go. ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	3	And they said , “ The God of the Hebrews hath met with us . Let us go , we pray thee , three days ’ journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the Lord our God , lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword. ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	4	And the king of Egypt said unto them , “ Why do ye , Moses and Aaron , delay the people from their work ? Get you unto your burdens ! ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	6	And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers , saying ,
KJ21	Exodus	5	7	“ Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore . Let them go and gather straw for themselves .
KJ21	Exodus	5	8	And the tally of bricks which they made heretofore , ye shall lay upon them ; ye shall not diminish any thereof . For they are idle ; therefore they cry , saying , ‘ Let us go and sacrifice to our God. ’
KJ21	Exodus	5	9	Let there more work be laid upon the men , that they may labor therein , and let them not regard vain words. ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	10	And the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spoke to the people , saying , “ Thus saith Pharaoh : ‘ I will not give you straw .
KJ21	Exodus	5	11	Go ye , get you straw where ye can find it ; yet not any of your work shall be diminished. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw .
KJ21	Exodus	5	13	And the taskmasters hastened them , saying , “ Fulfill your works , your daily tasks , as when there was straw. ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	14	And the officers of the children of Israel , whom Pharaoh ’ s taskmasters had set over them , were beaten and were demanded , “ Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today , as heretofore ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	15	Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh , saying , “ Why dealest thou thus with thy servants ?
KJ21	Exodus	5	16	There is no straw given unto thy servants , and they say to us , ‘ Make brick ! ’ And behold , thy servants are beaten , but the fault is in thine own people. ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	17	But he said , “ Ye are idle , ye are idle ! Therefore ye say , ‘ Let us go and do sacrifice to the Lord. ’
KJ21	Exodus	5	18	Go therefore now and work ; for there shall no straw be given you , yet shall ye deliver the tally of bricks. ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	19	And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil straits after it was said , “ Ye shall not diminish any from your bricks of your daily task. ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	20	And they met Moses and Aaron , who stood in the way as they came forth from Pharaoh .
KJ21	Exodus	5	21	And they said unto them , “ The Lord look upon you and judge , because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to slay us. ”
KJ21	Exodus	5	22	And Moses returned unto the Lord and said , “ Lord , why hast Thou so evilly treated this people ? Why is it that Thou hast sent me ?
KJ21	Exodus	5	23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name , he hath done evil to this people ; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at all . ”
KJ21	Exodus	6	6	Therefore say unto the children of Israel : ‘ I am the Lord , and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians , and I will rid you out from their bondage , and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments .
KJ21	Exodus	6	2	And God spoke unto Moses and said unto him , “ I am the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	6	3	And I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty , but by My name Jehovah was I not known to them .
KJ21	Exodus	6	4	And I have also established My covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
KJ21	Exodus	6	5	And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage ; and I have remembered My covenant .
KJ21	Exodus	6	7	And I will take you to Me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
KJ21	Exodus	6	8	And I will bring you in unto the land , concerning which I swore to give to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it to you for a heritage : I am the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	6	9	And Moses spoke so unto the children of Israel , but they hearkened not unto Moses from anguish of spirit and from cruel bondage .
KJ21	Exodus	6	10	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Exodus	6	11	“ Go in , speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. ”
KJ21	Exodus	6	12	And Moses spoke before the Lord , saying , “ Behold , the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me . How then shall Pharaoh hear me , who am of uncircumcised lips ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	6	13	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	6	14	These are the heads of their fathers ’ houses . The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel : Hanoch and Pallu , Hezron and Carmi ; these are the families of Reuben .
KJ21	Exodus	6	15	And the sons of Simeon : Jemuel and Jamin , and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
KJ21	Exodus	6	16	And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations : Gershon and Kohath and Merari ; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years .
KJ21	Exodus	6	17	The sons of Gershon : Libni and Shimi , according to their families .
KJ21	Exodus	6	18	And the sons of Kohath : Amram and Izhar , and Hebron and Uzziel ; and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years .
KJ21	Exodus	6	19	And the sons of Merari : Mahali and Mushi ; these are the families of Levi according to their generations .
KJ21	Exodus	6	20	And Amram took Jochebed , his father ’ s sister , for a wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses ; and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years .
KJ21	Exodus	6	21	And the sons of Izhar : Korah and Nepheg and Zichri .
KJ21	Exodus	6	22	And the sons of Uzziel : Mishael and Elzaphan and Zithri .
KJ21	Exodus	6	23	And Aaron took Elisheba , daughter of Amminadab , sister of Nahshon , for a wife ; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
KJ21	Exodus	6	24	And the sons of Korah : Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph ; these are the families of the Korahites .
KJ21	Exodus	6	25	And Eleazar , Aaron ’ s son , took one of the daughters of Putiel for a wife ; and she bore him Phinehas ; these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
KJ21	Exodus	6	26	These are that Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said , “ Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. ”
KJ21	Exodus	6	27	These are they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . These are that Moses and Aaron .
KJ21	Exodus	6	28	And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt ,
KJ21	Exodus	6	29	that the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying , “ I am the Lord . Speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. ”
KJ21	Exodus	6	30	And Moses said before the Lord , “ Behold , I am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	7	7	And Moses was fourscore years old , and Aaron fourscore and three years old when they spoke unto Pharaoh .
KJ21	Exodus	7	2	Thou shalt speak all that I command thee ; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh , that he send the children of Israel out of his land .
KJ21	Exodus	7	3	And I will harden Pharaoh ’ s heart , and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	7	4	But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that I may lay My hand upon Egypt and bring forth Mine armies and My people , the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
KJ21	Exodus	7	5	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I stretch forth Mine hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them. ”
KJ21	Exodus	7	6	And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them ; so did they .
KJ21	Exodus	7	8	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
KJ21	Exodus	7	9	“ When Pharaoh shall speak unto you , saying , ‘ Show a miracle for yourselves , ’ then thou shalt say unto Aaron , ‘ Take thy rod and cast it before Pharaoh , and it shall become a serpent. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	7	10	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh , and they did so as the Lord had commanded ; and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants , and it became a serpent .
KJ21	Exodus	7	11	Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers . Now the magicians of Egypt , they also did in like manner with their enchantments .
KJ21	Exodus	7	12	For they cast down every man his rod , and they became serpents ; but Aaron ’ s rod swallowed up their rods .
KJ21	Exodus	7	13	And He hardened Pharaoh ’ s heart , that he hearkened not unto them , as the Lord had said .
KJ21	Exodus	7	14	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Pharaoh ’ s heart is hardened ; he refuseth to let the people go .
KJ21	Exodus	7	15	Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning . Lo , he goeth out unto the water , and thou shalt stand by the river ’ s brink until he come ; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand .
KJ21	Exodus	7	16	And thou shalt say unto him , ‘ The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee , saying , “ Let My people go , that they may serve Me in the wilderness ” ; and behold , hitherto thou wouldest not hear .
KJ21	Exodus	7	17	Thus saith the Lord : “ In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord : Behold , I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
KJ21	Exodus	7	18	And the fish that are in the river shall die , and the river shall stink ; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river. ” ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	7	19	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , “ Say unto Aaron , ‘ Take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt , upon their streams , upon their rivers , and upon their ponds , and upon all their pools of water , that they may become blood ; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt , both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	7	20	And Moses and Aaron did so , as the Lord commanded ; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
KJ21	Exodus	7	21	And the fish that were in the river died ; and the river stank , and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	7	22	And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments ; and Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened , neither did he hearken unto them , as the Lord had said .
KJ21	Exodus	7	23	And Pharaoh turned and went into his house , neither did he set his heart to this also .
KJ21	Exodus	7	24	And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink , for they could not drink of the water of the river .
KJ21	Exodus	7	25	And seven days were fulfilled after the Lord had smitten the river .
KJ21	Exodus	8	8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said , “ Entreat the Lord , that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord. ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	2	And if thou refuse to let them go , behold , I will smite all thy borders with frogs .
KJ21	Exodus	8	3	And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly , which shall go up and come into thine house , and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed , and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people , and into thine ovens and into thy kneading troughs .
KJ21	Exodus	8	4	And the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	5	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , “ Say unto Aaron , ‘ Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams , over the rivers and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	6	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt , and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	8	7	And the magicians did so with their enchantments , and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	8	9	And Moses said unto Pharaoh , “ Glory over me : When shall I entreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses , that they may remain in the river only ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	10	And he said , “ Tomorrow. ” And Moses said , “ Be it according to thy word , that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God .
KJ21	Exodus	8	11	And the frogs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people . They shall remain in the river only. ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	12	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh ; and Moses cried unto the Lord because of the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh .
KJ21	Exodus	8	13	And the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
KJ21	Exodus	8	14	And they gathered them together upon heaps , and the land stank .
KJ21	Exodus	8	15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite , he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them , as the Lord had said .
KJ21	Exodus	8	16	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Say unto Aaron , ‘ Stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the land , that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	17	And they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth , and it became lice on man and on beast . All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	8	18	And the magicians so did with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not ; so there were lice upon man and upon beast .
KJ21	Exodus	8	19	Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh , “ This is the finger of God. ” And Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them , as the Lord had said .
KJ21	Exodus	8	20	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh . Lo , he cometh forth to the water , and say unto him , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Let My people go , that they may serve Me .
KJ21	Exodus	8	21	Else , if thou wilt not let My people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies upon thee , and upon thy servants and upon thy people and into thy houses ; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
KJ21	Exodus	8	22	And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen in which My people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there , to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth .
KJ21	Exodus	8	23	And I will put a division between My people and thy people . Tomorrow shall this sign be. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	24	And the Lord did so ; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ’ houses and into all the land of Egypt . The land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies .
KJ21	Exodus	8	25	And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said , “ Go ye , sacrifice to your God in the land. ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	26	And Moses said , “ It is not meet so to do ; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God . Lo , shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes , and will they not stone us ?
KJ21	Exodus	8	27	We will go three days ’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God , as He shall command us. ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	28	And Pharaoh said , “ I will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away . Entreat for me. ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	29	And Moses said , “ Behold , I go out from thee , and I will entreat the Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh , from his servants and from his people tomorrow ; but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord. ”
KJ21	Exodus	8	30	And Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	8	31	And the Lord did according to the word of Moses , and He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
KJ21	Exodus	8	32	And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also , neither would he let the people go .
KJ21	Exodus	9	9	And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains , upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of Egypt. ”
KJ21	Exodus	9	2	For if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still ,
KJ21	Exodus	9	3	behold , the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which are in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the camels , upon the oxen , and upon the sheep . There shall be a very grievous pestilence .
KJ21	Exodus	9	4	And the Lord shall distinguish between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt ; and there shall nothing die of all that belong to the children of Israel. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	9	5	And the Lord appointed a set time , saying , “ Tomorrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land. ”
KJ21	Exodus	9	6	And the Lord did that thing on the morrow ; and all the cattle of Egypt died , but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one .
KJ21	Exodus	9	7	And Pharaoh sent , and behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
KJ21	Exodus	9	8	And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron , “ Take to you handfuls of ashes from the furnace , and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh .
KJ21	Exodus	9	10	And they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh , and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven ; and it became boils breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast .
KJ21	Exodus	9	11	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils , for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians .
KJ21	Exodus	9	12	And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh , and he hearkened not unto them , as the Lord had spoken unto Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	9	13	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh and say unto him , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews : Let My people go , that they may serve Me .
KJ21	Exodus	9	14	For I will at this time send all My plagues upon thine heart , and upon thy servants and upon thy people , that thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth .
KJ21	Exodus	9	15	For now I will stretch out My hand , that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence , and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
KJ21	Exodus	9	16	And in very deed , for this cause have I raised thee up : to show in thee My power , and that My name may be declared throughout all the earth .
KJ21	Exodus	9	17	As yet exaltest thou thyself against My people , that thou wilt not let them go ?
KJ21	Exodus	9	18	Behold , tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
KJ21	Exodus	9	19	Send therefore now , and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field , for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home , the hail shallcome down upon them , and they shall die. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	9	20	He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses ,
KJ21	Exodus	9	21	and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field .
KJ21	Exodus	9	22	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt. ”
KJ21	Exodus	9	23	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven ; and the Lord sent thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	9	24	So there was hail and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
KJ21	Exodus	9	25	And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field .
KJ21	Exodus	9	26	Only in the land of Goshen , where the children of Israel were , was there no hail .
KJ21	Exodus	9	27	And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron , and said unto them , “ I have sinned this time . The Lord is righteous , and I and my people are wicked .
KJ21	Exodus	9	28	Entreat the Lord ( for it is enough ) , that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail ; and I will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer. ”
KJ21	Exodus	9	29	And Moses said unto him , “ As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord ; and the thunder shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail , that thou mayest know that the earth is the Lord ’ S .
KJ21	Exodus	9	30	But as for thee and thy servants , I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God. ”
KJ21	Exodus	9	31	And the flax and the barley were smitten ; for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was in bolls .
KJ21	Exodus	9	32	But the wheat and the rye were not smitten , for they were not grown up .
KJ21	Exodus	9	33	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord ; and the thunder and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
KJ21	Exodus	9	34	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased , he sinned yet more and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
KJ21	Exodus	9	35	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , neither would he let the children of Israel go , as the Lord had spoken by Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	10	10	And he said unto them , “ Let the Lord be so with you , as I will let you go , and your little ones . Look to it , for evil is before you .
KJ21	Exodus	10	2	and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son ’ s son what things I have wrought in Egypt , and My signs which I have done among them , that ye may know that I am the Lord. ”
KJ21	Exodus	10	3	And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh and said unto him , “ Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews : ‘ How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before Me ? Let My people go , that they may serve Me .
KJ21	Exodus	10	4	Else , if thou refuse to let My people go , behold , tomorrow will I bring the locusts into thy border .
KJ21	Exodus	10	5	And they shall cover the face of the earth , that one shall not be able to see the earth ; and they shall eat the residue of that which has escaped , which remaineth unto you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field .
KJ21	Exodus	10	6	And they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the Egyptians — which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers ’ fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. ’ ” And he turned himself , and went out from Pharaoh .
KJ21	Exodus	10	7	And Pharaoh ’ s servants said unto him , “ How long shall this man be a snare unto us ? Let the men go , that they may serve the Lord their God . Knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	10	8	And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh ; and he said unto them , “ Go , serve the Lord your God . But who are they that shall go ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	10	9	And Moses said , “ We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go , for we must hold a feast unto the Lord. ”
KJ21	Exodus	10	11	Not so ! Go now ye that are men , and serve the Lord , for that ye did desire. ” And they were driven out from Pharaoh ’ s presence .
KJ21	Exodus	10	12	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail hath left. ”
KJ21	Exodus	10	13	And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
KJ21	Exodus	10	14	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . Very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
KJ21	Exodus	10	15	For they covered the face of the whole earth , so that the land was darkened ; and they ate every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left , and there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	10	16	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste , and he said , “ I have sinned against the Lord your God , and against you .
KJ21	Exodus	10	17	Now therefore forgive , I pray thee , my sin only this once , and entreat the Lord your God , that he may take away from me this death only. ”
KJ21	Exodus	10	18	And he went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	10	19	And the Lord turned a mighty , strong west wind , which took away the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea . There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	10	20	But the Lord hardened Pharaoh ’ s heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go .
KJ21	Exodus	10	21	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Stretch out thine hand toward heaven , that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt , even darkness which may be felt. ”
KJ21	Exodus	10	22	And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven , and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days .
KJ21	Exodus	10	23	They saw not one another , neither rose any from his place for three days ; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
KJ21	Exodus	10	24	And Pharaoh called unto Moses and said , “ Go ye , serve the Lord ; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed . Let your little ones also go with you. ”
KJ21	Exodus	10	25	And Moses said , “ Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God .
KJ21	Exodus	10	26	Our cattle also shall go with us . There shall not a hoof be left behind ; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God , and we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we come thither. ”
KJ21	Exodus	10	27	But the Lord hardened Pharaoh ’ s heart , and he would not let them go .
KJ21	Exodus	10	28	And Pharaoh said unto him , “ Get thee from me ! Take heed to thyself ! See my face no more , for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die ! ”
KJ21	Exodus	10	29	And Moses said , “ Thou hast spoken well . I will see thy face again no more . ”
KJ21	Exodus	11	11	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt . Afterwards he will let you go hence . When he shall let you go , he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether .
KJ21	Exodus	11	2	Speak now in the ears of the people , and let every man borrow from his neighbor , and every woman from her neighbor , jewels of silver and jewels of gold. ”
KJ21	Exodus	11	3	And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt in the sight of Pharaoh ’ s servants and in the sight of the people .
KJ21	Exodus	11	4	And Moses said , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt ;
KJ21	Exodus	11	5	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sitteth upon his throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant who is behind the mill , and all the firstborn of beasts .
KJ21	Exodus	11	6	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
KJ21	Exodus	11	7	But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast , that ye may know how the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. ’
KJ21	Exodus	11	8	And all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bowdown themselves unto me , saying , ‘ Get thee out , and all the people who follow thee ! ’ And after that I will go out. ” And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger .
KJ21	Exodus	11	9	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. ”
KJ21	Exodus	11	10	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh ; and the Lord hardened Pharaoh ’ s heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land .
KJ21	Exodus	12	12	For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	12	2	“ This month shall be unto you the beginning of months ; it shall be the first month of the year to you .
KJ21	Exodus	12	3	Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel , saying , ‘ On the tenth day of this month they shall take for themselves every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for a house .
KJ21	Exodus	12	4	And if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls ; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb .
KJ21	Exodus	12	5	Your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year ; ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats .
KJ21	Exodus	12	6	And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month , and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
KJ21	Exodus	12	7	And they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it .
KJ21	Exodus	12	8	And they shall eat the flesh in that night , roasted with fire ; and with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it .
KJ21	Exodus	12	9	Eat not of it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but roasted with fire — his head with his legs and with the viscera thereof .
KJ21	Exodus	12	10	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning , and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
KJ21	Exodus	12	11	And thus shall ye eat it : with your loins girded , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste ; it is the Lord ’ S Passover .
KJ21	Exodus	12	13	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are ; and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	12	14	“ ‘ And this day shall be unto you for a memorial , and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever .
KJ21	Exodus	12	15	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread . Even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses ; for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
KJ21	Exodus	12	16	And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you . No manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
KJ21	Exodus	12	17	And ye shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread , for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt . Therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever .
KJ21	Exodus	12	18	In the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at evening , ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at evening .
KJ21	Exodus	12	19	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses ; for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger or born in the land .
KJ21	Exodus	12	20	Ye shall eat nothing leavened ; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	12	21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said unto them , “ Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families , and kill the Passover .
KJ21	Exodus	12	22	And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the basin , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin ; and none of you shall go out from the door of his house until the morning .
KJ21	Exodus	12	23	For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians ; and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts , the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you .
KJ21	Exodus	12	24	And ye shall observe this thing as an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
KJ21	Exodus	12	25	And it shall come to pass , when ye come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as He hath promised , that ye shall keep this service .
KJ21	Exodus	12	26	And it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , ‘ What mean ye by this service ? ’
KJ21	Exodus	12	27	that ye shall say , ‘ It is the sacrifice of the Lord ’ S Passover , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses. ’ ” And the people bowed their heads and worshiped .
KJ21	Exodus	12	28	And the children of Israel went away , and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron ; so did they .
KJ21	Exodus	12	29	And it came to pass , that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne , unto the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon , and all the firstborn of cattle .
KJ21	Exodus	12	30	And Pharaoh rose up in the night , he and all his servants and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
KJ21	Exodus	12	31	And he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said , “ Rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the children of Israel ! And go , serve the Lord , as ye have said .
KJ21	Exodus	12	32	Also take your flocks and your herds , as ye have said ; and be gone , and bless me also. ”
KJ21	Exodus	12	33	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , “ We are all dead men. ”
KJ21	Exodus	12	34	And the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
KJ21	Exodus	12	35	And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses , and they borrowed from the Egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment .
KJ21	Exodus	12	36	And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they lent unto them such things as they required . And they despoiled the Egyptians .
KJ21	Exodus	12	37	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot who were men , besides children .
KJ21	Exodus	12	38	And a mixed multitude went up also with them , and flocks and herds , even very much cattle .
KJ21	Exodus	12	39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt ; for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselves any victual .
KJ21	Exodus	12	40	Now the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years .
KJ21	Exodus	12	41	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even on the selfsame day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	12	42	It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt . This is that night of the Lord to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations .
KJ21	Exodus	12	43	And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron , “ This is the ordinance of the Passover : There shall no stranger eat thereof ;
KJ21	Exodus	12	44	but every man ’ s servant who is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then shall he eat thereof .
KJ21	Exodus	12	45	A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof .
KJ21	Exodus	12	46	In one house shall it be eaten ; thou shalt not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house , neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
KJ21	Exodus	12	47	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it .
KJ21	Exodus	12	48	And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the Passover to the Lord , let all his males be circumcised , and then let him come near and keep it ; and he shall be as one that is born in the land , for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof .
KJ21	Exodus	12	49	One law shall be for him that is homeborn and for the stranger who sojourneth among you. ”
KJ21	Exodus	12	50	Thus did all the children of Israel ; as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
KJ21	Exodus	12	51	And it came to pass the selfsame day that the Lord brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
KJ21	Exodus	13	13	And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; and if thou wilt not redeem it , then thou shalt break his neck ; and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem .
KJ21	Exodus	13	2	“ Sanctify unto Me all the firstborn , whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel , both of man and of beast ; it is Mine. ”
KJ21	Exodus	13	3	And Moses said unto the people , “ Remember this day in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place . There shall no leavened bread be eaten .
KJ21	Exodus	13	4	This day came ye out , in the month Abib .
KJ21	Exodus	13	5	“ And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites , which He swore unto thy fathers to give thee , a land flowing with milk and honey , that thou shalt keep this service in this month .
KJ21	Exodus	13	6	Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	13	7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days ; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee , neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters .
KJ21	Exodus	13	8	And thou shalt show thy son in that day , saying , ‘ This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. ’
KJ21	Exodus	13	9	And it shall be as a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eyes , that the Lord ’ S law may be in thy mouth ; for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	13	10	Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year .
KJ21	Exodus	13	11	“ And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , as He swore unto thee and to thy fathers , and shall give it to thee ,
KJ21	Exodus	13	12	that thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the womb , and every firstling that cometh from a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the Lord ’ S .
KJ21	Exodus	13	14	And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come , saying , ‘ What is this ? ’ that thou shalt say unto him , ‘ By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt , from the house of bondage .
KJ21	Exodus	13	15	And it came to pass , when Pharaoh would hardly let us go , that the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast ; therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb , being males ; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem. ’
KJ21	Exodus	13	16	And it shall be as a token upon thine hand , and as frontlets between thine eyes ; for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt. ”
KJ21	Exodus	13	17	And it came to pass , when Pharaoh had let the people go , that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines , although that was near ; for God said , “ Lest perhaps the people repent when they see war , and they return to Egypt. ”
KJ21	Exodus	13	18	But God led the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went up by five in a rank out of the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	13	19	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him ; for he had strictly sworn the children of Israel , saying , “ God will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. ”
KJ21	Exodus	13	20	And they took their journey from Succoth , and encamped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness .
KJ21	Exodus	13	21	And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way , and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light , to go by day and night .
KJ21	Exodus	13	22	He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people .
KJ21	Exodus	14	14	The Lord shall fight for you , and ye shall hold your peace. ”
KJ21	Exodus	14	2	“ Speak unto the children of Israel , that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth , between Migdol and the sea , opposite Baalzephon ; before it shall ye encamp by the sea .
KJ21	Exodus	14	3	For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , ‘ They are entangled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in. ’
KJ21	Exodus	14	4	And I will harden Pharaoh ’ s heart , that he shall follow after them ; and I will be honored above Pharaoh , and above all his host , that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord. ” And they did so .
KJ21	Exodus	14	5	And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled ; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people , and they said , “ Why have we done this , that we have let Israel go from serving us ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	14	6	And he made ready his chariot and took his people with him ,
KJ21	Exodus	14	7	and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and captains over every one of them .
KJ21	Exodus	14	8	And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
KJ21	Exodus	14	9	But the Egyptians pursued after them , all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh , and his horsemen and his army , and overtook them encamping by the sea beside Pihahiroth , before Baalzephon .
KJ21	Exodus	14	10	And when Pharaoh drew nigh , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and behold , the Egyptians marched after them ; and they were sore afraid ; and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	14	11	And they said unto Moses , “ Because there were no graves in Egypt , hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness ? Why hast thou dealt thus with us , to carry us forth out of Egypt ?
KJ21	Exodus	14	12	Is not this the word that we told thee in Egypt , saying , ‘ Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ’ ? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness. ”
KJ21	Exodus	14	13	And Moses said unto the people , “ Fear ye not . Stand still , and see the salvation of the Lord , which He will show to you today ; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
KJ21	Exodus	14	15	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Why criest thou unto Me ? Speak unto the children of Israel , that they go forward .
KJ21	Exodus	14	16	But lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it ; and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
KJ21	Exodus	14	17	And I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them ; and I will get Myself honor above Pharaoh and above all his host , above his chariots and above his horsemen .
KJ21	Exodus	14	18	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten Myself honor above Pharaoh , above his chariots , and above his horsemen. ”
KJ21	Exodus	14	19	And the angel of God , who went before the camp of Israel , removed and went behind them ; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them .
KJ21	Exodus	14	20	And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel ; and it was a cloud and darkness to them , but it gave light by night to these , so that the one came not near the other all the night .
KJ21	Exodus	14	21	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
KJ21	Exodus	14	22	And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground , and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left .
KJ21	Exodus	14	23	And the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all Pharaoh ’ s horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
KJ21	Exodus	14	24	And it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and troubled the host of the Egyptians .
KJ21	Exodus	14	25	And He took off their chariot wheels , that they drove them heavily , so that the Egyptians said , “ Let us flee from the face of Israel , for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians. ”
KJ21	Exodus	14	26	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians , upon their chariots , and upon their horsemen. ”
KJ21	Exodus	14	27	And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared . And the Egyptians fled against it , and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
KJ21	Exodus	14	28	And the waters returned , and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them . There remained not so much as one of them .
KJ21	Exodus	14	29	But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea , and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left .
KJ21	Exodus	14	30	Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians , and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore .
KJ21	Exodus	14	31	And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians ; and the people feared the Lord , and believed the Lord and His servant Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	15	15	Then the chiefs of Edom shall be amazed ; the mighty men of Moab , trembling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away .
KJ21	Exodus	15	2	The Lord is my strength and song , and He has become my salvation ; He is my God , and I will prepare Him a habitation ; my father ’ s God , and I will exalt Him .
KJ21	Exodus	15	3	The Lord is a man of war ; the Lord is His name .
KJ21	Exodus	15	4	Pharaoh ’ s chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea ; his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea .
KJ21	Exodus	15	5	The depths have covered them ; they sank into the bottom as a stone .
KJ21	Exodus	15	6	Thy right hand , O Lord , has become glorious in power ; Thy right hand , O Lord , hath dashed in pieces the enemy .
KJ21	Exodus	15	7	And in the greatness of Thine excellency Thou hast overthrown them that rose up against Thee ; Thou sentest forth Thy wrath , which consumed them as stubble .
KJ21	Exodus	15	8	And with the blast of Thy nostrils the waters were gathered together , the floods stood upright as a heap , and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea .
KJ21	Exodus	15	9	The enemy said , ‘ I will pursue , I will overtake , I will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfied upon them . I will draw my sword ; my hand shall destroy them. ’
KJ21	Exodus	15	10	Thou didst blow with Thy wind , the sea covered them ; they sank as lead in the mighty waters .
KJ21	Exodus	15	11	“ Who is like unto Thee , O Lord , among the gods ? Who is like Thee , glorious in holiness , fearful in praises , doing wonders ?
KJ21	Exodus	15	12	Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand ; the earth swallowed them .
KJ21	Exodus	15	13	Thou in Thy mercy hast led forth the people whom Thou hast redeemed ; Thou hast guided them in Thy strength unto Thy holy habitation .
KJ21	Exodus	15	14	“ The people shall hear and be afraid ; sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina .
KJ21	Exodus	15	16	Fear and dread shall fall upon them . By the greatness of Thine arm they shall be as still as a stone , till Thy people pass over , O Lord , till the people pass over , whom Thou hast purchased .
KJ21	Exodus	15	17	Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance , in the place , O Lord , which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in , in the sanctuary , O Lord , which Thy hands have established .
KJ21	Exodus	15	18	The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. ”
KJ21	Exodus	15	19	For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea .
KJ21	Exodus	15	20	And Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances .
KJ21	Exodus	15	21	And Miriam answered them : “ Sing ye to the Lord , for He hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea ! ”
KJ21	Exodus	15	22	So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea , and they went out into the Wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
KJ21	Exodus	15	23	And when they came to Marah , they could not drink of the waters of Marah , for they were bitter . Therefore the name of it was called Marah [ that is , Bitterness ] .
KJ21	Exodus	15	24	And the people murmured against Moses , saying , “ What shall we drink ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	15	25	And he cried unto the Lord ; and the Lord showed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweet . There He made for them a statute and an ordinance , and there He put them to the proof ,
KJ21	Exodus	15	26	and said , “ If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God , and wilt do that which is right in His sight , and wilt give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes , I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians ; for I am the Lord that healeth thee. ”
KJ21	Exodus	15	27	And they came to Elim , where were twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm trees ; and they encamped there by the waters .
KJ21	Exodus	16	16	This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded : ‘ Gather of it every man according to his eating , an omer for every man , according to the number of your persons . Take ye every man for those who are in his tents. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	2	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness .
KJ21	Exodus	16	3	And the children of Israel said unto them , “ Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt , when we sat by the fleshpots and when we ate bread to the full ! For ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger. ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	4	Then said the Lord unto Moses , “ Behold , I will rain bread from heaven for you ; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day , that I may put them to the proof , whether they will walk in My law , or no .
KJ21	Exodus	16	5	And it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	6	And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel , “ At evening , then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
KJ21	Exodus	16	7	and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the Lord , for He heareth your murmurings against the Lord . And what are we , that ye murmur against us ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	8	And Moses said , “ This shall be when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full , for the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against Him . And what are we ? Your murmurings are not against us , but against the Lord. ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	9	And Moses spoke unto Aaron , “ Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , ‘ Come near before the Lord , for He hath heard your murmurings. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	10	And it came to pass , as Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud .
KJ21	Exodus	16	11	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Exodus	16	12	“ I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel . Speak unto them , saying , ‘ At evening ye shall eat flesh , and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	13	And it came to pass that at evening the quails came up and covered the camp , and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
KJ21	Exodus	16	14	And when the dew that lay had gone up , behold , upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing , as small as the hoarfrost on the ground .
KJ21	Exodus	16	15	And when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , “ What is this ? ” For they knew not what it was . And Moses said unto them , “ This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat .
KJ21	Exodus	16	17	And the children of Israel did so and gathered , some more , some less .
KJ21	Exodus	16	18	And when they measured it with an omer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his eating .
KJ21	Exodus	16	19	And Moses said , “ Let no man leave any of it until the morning. ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	20	Notwithstanding , they hearkened not unto Moses ; but some of them left part of it until the morning , and it bred worms and stank . And Moses was wroth with them .
KJ21	Exodus	16	21	And they gathered it every morning , every man according to his eating ; and when the sun waxed hot , it melted .
KJ21	Exodus	16	22	And it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for one man ; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	16	23	And he said unto them , “ This is that which the Lord hath said : ‘ Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord . Bake that which ye will bake today , and boil what ye will boil ; and that which remaineth over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	24	And they laid it up until the morning , as Moses bade ; and it did not stink , neither was there any worm therein .
KJ21	Exodus	16	25	And Moses said , “ Eat that today , for today is a Sabbath unto the Lord . Today ye shall not find it in the field .
KJ21	Exodus	16	26	Six days ye shall gather it , but on the seventh day , which is the Sabbath , in it there shall be none. ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	27	And it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day to gather , and they found none .
KJ21	Exodus	16	28	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws ?
KJ21	Exodus	16	29	See , for the Lord hath given you the Sabbath ; therefore He giveth you on the sixth day the bread for two days . Abide ye every man in his place . Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day .
KJ21	Exodus	16	31	And the house of Israel called the name thereof manna ; and it was like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey .
KJ21	Exodus	16	32	And Moses said , “ This is the thing which the Lord commandeth : ‘ Fill an omer with it to be kept for your generations , that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	33	And Moses said unto Aaron , “ Take a pot , and put an omer full of manna therein , and lay it up before the Lord to be kept for your generations. ”
KJ21	Exodus	16	34	As the Lord commanded Moses , so Aaron laid it up before the testimony , to be kept .
KJ21	Exodus	16	35	And the children of Israel ate manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited . They ate manna until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
KJ21	Exodus	16	36	Now an omer is a tenth part of an ephah .
KJ21	Exodus	17	17	And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the Wilderness of Sin after their journeys , according to the commandment of the Lord , and pitched camp in Rephidim ; and there was no water for the people to drink .
KJ21	Exodus	17	2	Therefore the people chided Moses and said , “ Give us water that we may drink. ” And Moses said unto them , “ Why chide ye me ? Why do ye tempt the Lord ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	17	3	And the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against Moses and said , “ Why is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	17	4	And Moses cried unto the Lord , saying , “ What shall I do unto this people ? They are almost ready to stone me ! ”
KJ21	Exodus	17	5	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of Israel ; and thy rod with which thou smotest the river , take in thine hand and go .
KJ21	Exodus	17	6	Behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink. ” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
KJ21	Exodus	17	7	And he called the name of the place Massah [ that is , Temptation ] , and Meribah [ that is , Chiding ] , because of the chiding of the children of Israel , and because they tempted the Lord , saying , “ Is the Lord among us or not ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	17	8	Then came Amalek and fought with Israel in Rephidim .
KJ21	Exodus	17	9	And Moses said unto Joshua , “ Choose us out men , and go out , fight with Amalek . Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. ”
KJ21	Exodus	17	10	So Joshua did as Moses had said to him , and fought with Amalek ; and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
KJ21	Exodus	17	11	And it came to pass , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
KJ21	Exodus	17	12	But Moses ’ hands were heavy ; and they took a stone and put it under him , and he sat thereon . And Aaron and Hur held up his hands , the one on the one side and the other on the other side ; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun .
KJ21	Exodus	17	13	And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword .
KJ21	Exodus	17	14	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Write this for a memorial in a book , and recount it in the ears of Joshua ; for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. ”
KJ21	Exodus	17	15	And Moses built an altar , and called the name of it Jehovahnissi [ that is , The Lord my banner ] ;
KJ21	Exodus	17	16	for he said , “ Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation . ”
KJ21	Exodus	18	18	Thou wilt surely wear away , both thou and this people who are with thee . For this thing is too heavy for thee . Thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
KJ21	Exodus	18	2	then Jethro , Moses ’ father-in-law , took Zipporah , Moses ’ wife , after Moses had sent her back
KJ21	Exodus	18	3	and her two sons ( of whom the name of the one was Gershom [ that is , A stranger there ] , for he said , “ I have been an alien in a strange land ” ;
KJ21	Exodus	18	4	and the name of the other was Eliezer [ that is , My God is a help ] , “ For the God of my father , ” said he , “ was my help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh ” ) ;
KJ21	Exodus	18	5	and Jethro , Moses ’ father-in-law , came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness , where he encamped at the mount of God .
KJ21	Exodus	18	6	And he said unto Moses , “ I , thy father-in-law Jethro , have come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her. ”
KJ21	Exodus	18	7	And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law , and did obeisance and kissed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
KJ21	Exodus	18	8	And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel ’ s sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
KJ21	Exodus	18	9	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel , whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians .
KJ21	Exodus	18	10	And Jethro said , “ Blessed be the Lord , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
KJ21	Exodus	18	11	Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods ; for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly , He was above them. ”
KJ21	Exodus	18	12	And Jethro , Moses ’ father-in-law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God ; and Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ’ father-in-law before God .
KJ21	Exodus	18	13	And it came to pass on the morrow that Moses sat to judge the people , and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening .
KJ21	Exodus	18	14	And when Moses ’ father-in-law saw all that he did for the people , he said , “ What is this thing that thou doest for the people ? Why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto evening ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	18	15	And Moses said unto his father-in-law , “ Because the people come unto me to inquire of God .
KJ21	Exodus	18	16	When they have a matter , they come unto me , and I judge between one and another , and I make them know the statutes of God and His laws. ”
KJ21	Exodus	18	17	And Moses ’ father-in-law said unto him , “ The thing that thou doest is not good .
KJ21	Exodus	18	19	Hearken now unto my voice ! I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee : Be thou for the people to Godward , that thou mayest bring the causes unto God .
KJ21	Exodus	18	20	And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws , and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do .
KJ21	Exodus	18	21	Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God — men of truth , hating covetousness — and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties and rulers of tens .
KJ21	Exodus	18	22	And let them judge the people at all seasons ; and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge . So shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
KJ21	Exodus	18	23	If thou shalt do this thing and God command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. ”
KJ21	Exodus	18	24	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law , and did all that he had said .
KJ21	Exodus	18	25	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people : rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
KJ21	Exodus	18	26	And they judged the people at all seasons . The hard causes they brought unto Moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
KJ21	Exodus	18	27	And Moses let his father-in-law depart , and he went his way into his own land .
KJ21	Exodus	19	19	And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder , Moses spoke , and God answered him by a voice .
KJ21	Exodus	19	2	For they had departed from Rephidim , and had come to the desert of Sinai and had pitched camp in the wilderness ; and there Israel camped before the mount .
KJ21	Exodus	19	3	And Moses went up unto God , and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain , saying , “ Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
KJ21	Exodus	19	4	‘ Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians , and how I bore you on eagles ’ wings and brought you unto Myself .
KJ21	Exodus	19	5	Now therefore , if ye will obey My voice indeed and keep My covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people ; for all the earth is Mine .
KJ21	Exodus	19	6	And ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. ’ These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. ”
KJ21	Exodus	19	7	And Moses came and called for the elders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him .
KJ21	Exodus	19	8	And all the people answered together and said , “ All that the Lord hath spoken we will do. ” And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	19	9	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Lo , I come unto thee in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when I speak with thee , and believe thee for ever. ” And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	19	10	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow , and let them wash their clothes
KJ21	Exodus	19	11	and be ready against the third day ; for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount Sinai .
KJ21	Exodus	19	12	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , ‘ Take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it . Whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death .
KJ21	Exodus	19	13	There shall not a hand touch it , but he shall surely be stoned or shot through ; whether it be beast or man , it shall not live. ’ When the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come up to the mount. ”
KJ21	Exodus	19	14	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes .
KJ21	Exodus	19	15	And he said unto the people , “ Be ready against the third day . Come not at your wives. ”
KJ21	Exodus	19	16	And it came to pass on the third day in the morning , that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud , so that all the people who were in the camp trembled .
KJ21	Exodus	19	17	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God , and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
KJ21	Exodus	19	18	And Mount Sinai was altogether in smoke , because the Lord descended upon it in fire ; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mount quaked greatly .
KJ21	Exodus	19	20	And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai , on the top of the mount ; and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount , and Moses went up .
KJ21	Exodus	19	21	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Go down . Charge the people , lest they break through to gaze unto the Lord , and many of them perish .
KJ21	Exodus	19	22	And let the priests also , who come near to the Lord , sanctify themselves , lest the Lord break forth upon them. ”
KJ21	Exodus	19	23	And Moses said unto the Lord , “ The people can not come up to Mount Sinai ; for Thou charged us , saying , ‘ Set bounds about the mount and sanctify it. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	19	24	And the Lord said unto him , “ Away ! Get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou and Aaron with thee ; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord , lest He break forth upon them. ”
KJ21	Exodus	19	25	So Moses went down unto the people and spoke unto them .
KJ21	Exodus	20	20	And Moses said unto the people , “ Fear not ; for God has come to test you , and that His fear may be before your faces , that ye sin not. ”
KJ21	Exodus	20	2	“ I am the Lord thy God , who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
KJ21	Exodus	20	3	“ Thou shalt have no other gods before Me .
KJ21	Exodus	20	4	“ Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth .
KJ21	Exodus	20	5	Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them ; for I , the Lord thy God , am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me ,
KJ21	Exodus	20	6	and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments .
KJ21	Exodus	20	7	“ Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain , for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain .
KJ21	Exodus	20	8	“ Remember the Sabbath day , to keep it holy .
KJ21	Exodus	20	9	Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work ;
KJ21	Exodus	20	10	but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God . In it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates .
KJ21	Exodus	20	11	For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day . Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it .
KJ21	Exodus	20	12	“ Honor thy father and thy mother , that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee .
KJ21	Exodus	20	13	“ Thou shalt not kill .
KJ21	Exodus	20	14	“ Thou shalt not commit adultery .
KJ21	Exodus	20	15	“ Thou shalt not steal .
KJ21	Exodus	20	16	“ Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor .
KJ21	Exodus	20	17	“ Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor ’ s house ; thou shalt not covet thy neighbor ’ s wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor anything that is thy neighbor ’ s. ”
KJ21	Exodus	20	18	And all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings , and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking ; and when the people saw it , they removed and stood afar off .
KJ21	Exodus	20	19	And they said unto Moses , “ Speak thou with us and we will hear ; but let not God speak with us , lest we die. ”
KJ21	Exodus	20	21	And the people stood afar off , and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was .
KJ21	Exodus	20	22	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel : ‘ Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
KJ21	Exodus	20	23	Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver , neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold .
KJ21	Exodus	20	24	An altar of earth thou shalt make unto Me , and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings , thy sheep and thine oxen . In all places where I record My name I will come unto thee , and I will bless thee .
KJ21	Exodus	20	25	And if thou wilt make Me an altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hewn stone ; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
KJ21	Exodus	20	26	Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto Mine altar , that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon . ’
KJ21	Exodus	21	21	Notwithstanding , if he continue a day or two , he shall not be punished ; for he is his money .
KJ21	Exodus	21	2	If thou buy a Hebrew servant , six years he shall serve ; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing .
KJ21	Exodus	21	3	If he came in by himself , he shall go out by himself ; if he was married , then his wife shall go out with him .
KJ21	Exodus	21	4	If his master has given him a wife , and she has borne him sons or daughters , the wife and her children shall be her master ’ s , and he shall go out by himself .
KJ21	Exodus	21	5	And if the servant shall plainly say , ‘ I love my master , my wife , and my children ; I will not go out free , ’
KJ21	Exodus	21	6	then his master shall bring him unto the judges . He shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost , and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl , and he shall serve him for ever .
KJ21	Exodus	21	7	“ And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant , she shall not go out as the menservants do .
KJ21	Exodus	21	8	If she please not her master who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed . To sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .
KJ21	Exodus	21	9	And if he has betrothed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
KJ21	Exodus	21	10	If he take for himself another wife , her food , her raiment , and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish .
KJ21	Exodus	21	11	And if he does not do these three unto her , then shall she go out free , without money .
KJ21	Exodus	21	12	“ He that smiteth a man so that he die shall be surely put to death .
KJ21	Exodus	21	13	And if a man lie not in wait , but God deliver him into his hand , then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
KJ21	Exodus	21	14	But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor to slay him with guile , thou shalt take him from Mine altar , that he may die .
KJ21	Exodus	21	15	“ And he that smiteth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death .
KJ21	Exodus	21	16	“ And he that stealeth a man and selleth him , or if he shall be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death .
KJ21	Exodus	21	17	“ And he that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death .
KJ21	Exodus	21	18	“ And if men strive together and one smite another with a stone or with his fist , and he die not but keepeth to his bed ,
KJ21	Exodus	21	19	if he rise again and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smote him be acquitted ; he shall only pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
KJ21	Exodus	21	20	“ And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod , and he die under his hand , he shall be surely punished .
KJ21	Exodus	21	22	“ If men strive and hurt a woman with child , so that her fruit depart from her , and yet no misfortune follow , he shall be surely punished according as the woman ’ s husband will lay upon him ; and he shall pay as the judges determine .
KJ21	Exodus	21	23	And if any misfortune follow , then thou shalt give life for life ,
KJ21	Exodus	21	24	eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
KJ21	Exodus	21	25	burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe .
KJ21	Exodus	21	26	“ And if a man smite the eye of his servant or the eye of his maid , that it perish , he shall let him go free for his eye ’ s sake .
KJ21	Exodus	21	27	And if he smite out his manservant ’ s tooth or his maidservant ’ s tooth , he shall let him go free for his tooth ’ s sake .
KJ21	Exodus	21	28	“ If an ox gore a man or a woman , so that they die , then the ox shall be surely stoned , and his flesh shall not be eaten ; but the owner of the ox shall be acquitted .
KJ21	Exodus	21	29	But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in times past , and it hath been testified to his owner , and he hath not kept him in so that he hath killed a man or a woman , the ox shall be stoned and his owner also shall be put to death .
KJ21	Exodus	21	30	If there be laid on him a sum of money , then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him .
KJ21	Exodus	21	31	Whether he hath gored a son or hath gored a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done unto him .
KJ21	Exodus	21	32	If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant , he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
KJ21	Exodus	21	33	“ And if a man shall open a pit , or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it , and an ox or an ass fall therein ,
KJ21	Exodus	21	34	the owner of the pit shall make it good and give money unto the owner of them , and the dead beast shall be his .
KJ21	Exodus	21	35	And if one man ’ s ox hurt another ’ s , so that he die , then they shall sell the live ox and divide the money from it , and the dead ox also they shall divide .
KJ21	Exodus	21	36	Or if it be known that the ox used to push in times past and his owner hath not kept him in , he shall surely pay ox for ox , and the dead shall be his own .
KJ21	Exodus	22	22	Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child .
KJ21	Exodus	22	2	“ If a thief be found breaking in and be smitten so that he die , there shall no blood be shed for him .
KJ21	Exodus	22	3	If the sun be risen upon him , there shall be blood shed for him , for he should make full restitution . If he have nothing , then he shall be sold for his theft .
KJ21	Exodus	22	4	If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive , whether it be ox or ass or sheep , he shall restore double .
KJ21	Exodus	22	5	“ If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten , and shall put in his beast and shall feed in another man ’ s field , of the best of his own field and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution .
KJ21	Exodus	22	6	“ If fire break out and catch in thorns , so that the stacks of corn or the standing corn or the field be consumed therewith , he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution .
KJ21	Exodus	22	7	“ If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep , and it be stolen out of the man ’ s house , if the thief be found , let him pay double .
KJ21	Exodus	22	8	If the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges to see whether he has put his hand unto his neighbor ’ s goods .
KJ21	Exodus	22	9	“ For all manner of trespass , whether it be for ox , for ass , for sheep , for raiment , or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his , the cause of both parties shall come before the judges ; and whom the judges shall condemn , he shall pay double unto his neighbor .
KJ21	Exodus	22	10	“ If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass , or an ox , or a sheep , or any beast to keep , and it die or be hurt or driven away , no man seeing it ,
KJ21	Exodus	22	11	then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbor ’ s goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
KJ21	Exodus	22	12	And if it be stolen from him , he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof .
KJ21	Exodus	22	13	If it be torn in pieces , then let him bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which was torn .
KJ21	Exodus	22	14	“ And if a man borrow aught from his neighbor , and it become hurt or die , the owner thereof being not with it , he shall surely make it good .
KJ21	Exodus	22	15	But if the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good ; if it be a hired thing , it came for his hire .
KJ21	Exodus	22	16	“ And if a man entice a maid who is not betrothed , and lie with her , he shall surely endow her to be his wife .
KJ21	Exodus	22	17	If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him , he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins .
KJ21	Exodus	22	18	“ Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live .
KJ21	Exodus	22	19	“ Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death .
KJ21	Exodus	22	20	“ He that sacrificeth unto any god , save unto the Lord only , he shall be utterly destroyed .
KJ21	Exodus	22	21	“ Thou shalt neither vex a stranger nor oppress him , for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	22	23	If thou afflict them in any wise , and they cry at all unto Me , I will surely hear their cry ;
KJ21	Exodus	22	24	and My wrath shall wax hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
KJ21	Exodus	22	25	“ If thou lend money to any of My people who are poor among thee , thou shalt not be to him as a usurer , neither shalt thou lay upon him usury .
KJ21	Exodus	22	26	If thou at all take thy neighbor ’ s raiment in pledge , thou shalt deliver it unto him by the time the sun goeth down ,
KJ21	Exodus	22	27	for that is his only covering . It is his raiment for his skin . Wherein shall he sleep ? And it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto Me , that I will hear , for I am gracious .
KJ21	Exodus	22	28	“ Thou shalt not revile the judges , nor curse the ruler of thy people .
KJ21	Exodus	22	29	“ Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits and of thy liquors . The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me .
KJ21	Exodus	22	30	Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen and with thy sheep : seven days it shall be with his dam ; on the eighth day thou shalt give it to Me .
KJ21	Exodus	22	31	“ And ye shall be holy men unto Me ; neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn by beasts in the field : ye shall cast it to the dogs .
KJ21	Exodus	23	23	For Mine angel shall go before thee , and bring thee in unto the Amorites and the Hittites , and the Perizzites and the Canaanites , the Hivites and the Jebusites ; and I will cut them off .
KJ21	Exodus	23	2	Thou shalt not follow the multitude to do evil ; neither shalt thou speak in a cause , following many , to divert judgment .
KJ21	Exodus	23	3	Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause .
KJ21	Exodus	23	4	“ If thou meet thine enemy ’ s ox or his ass going astray , thou shalt surely bring it back to him again .
KJ21	Exodus	23	5	If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden , and wouldest forbear to help him , thou shalt surely help with him .
KJ21	Exodus	23	6	“ Thou shalt not divert the judgment from thy poor in his cause .
KJ21	Exodus	23	7	Keep thee far from a false matter , and the innocent and righteous slay thou not ; for I will not justify the wicked .
KJ21	Exodus	23	8	And thou shalt take no bribe , for the bribe blindeth the wise and perverteth the words of the righteous .
KJ21	Exodus	23	9	“ Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger ; for ye know the heart of a stranger , seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	23	10	“ And six years thou shalt sow thy land and shalt gather in the fruits thereof ,
KJ21	Exodus	23	11	but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still , that the poor of thy people may eat ; and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat . In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard and with thy olive trees .
KJ21	Exodus	23	12	“ Six days thou shalt do thy work , and on the seventh day thou shalt rest , that thine ox and thine ass may rest , and the son of thy handmaid and the stranger may be refreshed .
KJ21	Exodus	23	13	And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect ; and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of thy mouth .
KJ21	Exodus	23	14	“ Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year .
KJ21	Exodus	23	15	Thou shalt keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread ( thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days , as I commanded thee , at the time appointed in the month of Abib , for in it thou camest out from Egypt ; and none shall appear before Me empty ) ,
KJ21	Exodus	23	16	and the Feast of Harvest , the firstfruits of thy labors which thou hast sown in the field , and the Feast of Ingathering , which is at the end of the year when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the field .
KJ21	Exodus	23	17	Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord God .
KJ21	Exodus	23	18	“ Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the fat of My sacrifice remain until the morning .
KJ21	Exodus	23	19	“ The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God . “ Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother ’ s milk .
KJ21	Exodus	23	20	“ Behold , I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way , and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared .
KJ21	Exodus	23	21	Have regard for him , and obey his voice . Provoke him not , for he will not pardon your transgressions , for My name is in him .
KJ21	Exodus	23	22	But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak , then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies , and an adversary unto thine adversaries .
KJ21	Exodus	23	24	Thou shalt not bow down to their gods , nor serve them , nor do according to their works ; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images .
KJ21	Exodus	23	25	And ye shall serve the Lord your God , and He shall bless thy bread and thy water ; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee .
KJ21	Exodus	23	26	None shall cast their young nor be barren in thy land ; the number of thy days I will fulfill .
KJ21	Exodus	23	27	“ I will send My fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee .
KJ21	Exodus	23	28	And I will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the Hivite , the Canaanite , and the Hittite from before thee .
KJ21	Exodus	23	29	I will not drive them out from before thee in one year , lest the land become desolate and the beast of the field multiply against thee .
KJ21	Exodus	23	30	Little by little I will drive them out from before thee , until thou be increased and inherit the land .
KJ21	Exodus	23	31	And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines , and from the desert unto the river ; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand , and thou shalt drive them out before thee .
KJ21	Exodus	23	32	Thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor with their gods .
KJ21	Exodus	23	33	They shall not dwell in thy land , lest they make thee sin against Me ; for if thou serve their gods , it will surely be a snare unto thee . ”
KJ21	Exodus	24	24	And He said unto Moses , “ Come up unto the Lord , thou and Aaron , Nadab and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel , and worship ye afar off .
KJ21	Exodus	24	2	And Moses alone shall come near the Lord ; but they shall not come nigh , neither shall the people go up with him. ”
KJ21	Exodus	24	3	And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the judgments ; and all the people answered with one voice and said , “ All the words which the Lord hath said will we do. ”
KJ21	Exodus	24	4	And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord , and rose up early in the morning and built an altar under the hill , and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel .
KJ21	Exodus	24	5	And he sent young men of the children of Israel , who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord .

KJ21	Exodus	29	35	“ And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron and to his sons , according to all things which I have commanded thee . Seven days shalt thou consecrate them .
KJ21	Exodus	29	36	And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement ; and thou shalt cleanse the altar when thou hast made an atonement for it , and thou shalt anoint it to sanctify it .
KJ21	Exodus	29	37	Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar and sanctify it ; and it shall be an altar most holy . Whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy .
KJ21	Exodus	29	38	“ Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar : two lambs of the first year , day by day continually .
KJ21	Exodus	29	39	The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning , and the other lamb thou shalt offer at evening .
KJ21	Exodus	29	40	And with the one lamb a tenth part of flour mingled with a fourth part of a hin of beaten oil , and a fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering .
KJ21	Exodus	29	41	And the other lamb thou shalt offer at evening , and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning and according to the drink offering thereof , for a sweet savor , an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	29	42	“ This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord , where I will meet you to speak there unto thee .
KJ21	Exodus	29	43	And there I will meet with the children of Israel , and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by My glory .
KJ21	Exodus	29	44	And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar . I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to minister to Me in the priest ’ s office .
KJ21	Exodus	29	45	And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will be their God .
KJ21	Exodus	29	46	And they shall know that I am the Lord their God , who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I may dwell among them . I am the Lord their God .
KJ21	Exodus	30	30	And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them , that they may minister unto Me in the priest ’ s office .
KJ21	Exodus	30	2	A cubit shall be the length thereof and a cubit the breadth thereof . Foursquare shall it be , and two cubits shall be the height thereof . The horns thereof shall be part of the same .
KJ21	Exodus	30	3	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , the top thereof and the sides thereof round about , and the horns thereof ; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about .
KJ21	Exodus	30	4	And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown of it , by the two corners thereof ; upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it ; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it .
KJ21	Exodus	30	5	And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood and overlay them with gold .
KJ21	Exodus	30	6	And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the Testimony , before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony , where I will meet with thee .
KJ21	Exodus	30	7	And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning . When he dresseth the lamps , he shall burn incense upon it .
KJ21	Exodus	30	8	And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at evening , he shall burn incense upon it , a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations .
KJ21	Exodus	30	9	Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon , nor burnt sacrifice , nor meat offering ; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon .
KJ21	Exodus	30	10	And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements . Once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations . It is most holy unto the Lord. ”
KJ21	Exodus	30	11	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Exodus	30	12	“ When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel according to their number , then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord when thou numberest them , that there be no plague among them when thou numberest them .
KJ21	Exodus	30	13	This they shall give , every one that passeth among them that are numbered : half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary ( a shekel is twenty gerahs ) ; a half shekel shall be the offering to the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	30	14	Every one who passeth among them that are numbered , from twenty years old and above , shall give an offering unto the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	30	15	The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel , when they give an offering unto the Lord to make an atonement for your souls .
KJ21	Exodus	30	16	And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel , and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the Lord , to make an atonement for your souls. ”
KJ21	Exodus	30	17	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Exodus	30	18	“ Thou shalt also make a laver of brass , with his foot also of brass , for washing ; and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar , and thou shalt put water therein .
KJ21	Exodus	30	19	For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat .
KJ21	Exodus	30	20	When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation , they shall wash with water , that they die not . Or when they come near to the altar to minister , to burn offering made by fire unto the Lord ,
KJ21	Exodus	30	21	so they shall wash their hands and their feet , that they die not . And it shall be a statute for ever to them , even to him and to his seed throughout their generations. ”
KJ21	Exodus	30	22	Moreover the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Exodus	30	23	“ Take thou also unto thee principal spices : of pure myrrh five hundred shekels , and of sweet cinnamon half as much ( even two hundred and fifty shekels ) , and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels ,
KJ21	Exodus	30	24	and of cassia five hundred shekels , according to the shekel of the sanctuary , and of olive oil a hin .
KJ21	Exodus	30	25	And thou shalt make from it an oil of holy ointment , an ointment compound according to the art of the perfumer ; it shall be a holy anointing oil .
KJ21	Exodus	30	26	And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith , and the ark of the Testimony ,
KJ21	Exodus	30	27	and the table and all his vessels , and the candlestick and his vessels , and the altar of incense ,
KJ21	Exodus	30	28	and the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels , and the laver and his foot ;
KJ21	Exodus	30	29	and thou shalt sanctify them , that they may be most holy . Whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy .
KJ21	Exodus	30	31	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , ‘ This shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations .
KJ21	Exodus	30	32	Upon man ’ s flesh shall it not be poured , neither shall ye make any other like it , according to the composition of it . It is holy , and it shall be holy unto you .
KJ21	Exodus	30	33	Whosoever compoundeth any like it , or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger , shall even be cut off from his people. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	30	34	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Take unto thee sweet spices : stacte and onycha and galbanum ; these sweet spices with pure frankincense , of each shall there be a like weight .
KJ21	Exodus	30	35	And thou shalt make it a perfume , a confection according to the art of the perfumer , tempered together , pure and holy .
KJ21	Exodus	30	36	And thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation where I will meet with thee ; it shall be unto you most holy .
KJ21	Exodus	30	37	And as for the perfume which thou shalt make , ye shall not make it for yourselves according to the composition thereof ; it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	30	38	Whosoever shall make like unto that , to smell thereto , shall even be cut off from his people . ”
KJ21	Exodus	31	31	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Exodus	31	2	“ See , I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah .
KJ21	Exodus	31	3	And I have filled him with the Spirit of God , in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship ,
KJ21	Exodus	31	4	to devise skillful works : to work in gold and in silver and in brass ,
KJ21	Exodus	31	5	and in cutting of stones to set them , and in carving of timber , to work in all manner of workmanship .
KJ21	Exodus	31	6	And I , behold , I have given with him Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan ; and in the hearts of all who are wisehearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee :
KJ21	Exodus	31	7	the tabernacle of the congregation , and the ark of the Testimony and the mercy seat that is thereupon , and all the furniture of the tabernacle ,
KJ21	Exodus	31	8	and the table and his furniture , and the pure candlestick with all his furniture , and the altar of incense ,
KJ21	Exodus	31	9	and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture , and the laver and his foot ,
KJ21	Exodus	31	10	and the clothes of service , and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priest ’ s office ,
KJ21	Exodus	31	11	and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place . According to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. ”
KJ21	Exodus	31	13	“ Speak thou also unto the children of Israel , saying , ‘ Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep ; for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations , that ye may know that I am the Lord who doth sanctify you .
KJ21	Exodus	31	14	Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore , for it is holy unto you . Every one who defileth it shall surely be put to death ; for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
KJ21	Exodus	31	15	Six days may work be done , but on the seventh is the Sabbath of rest , holy to the Lord . Whosoever doeth any work on the Sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
KJ21	Exodus	31	16	Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath , to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant .
KJ21	Exodus	31	17	It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel for ever ; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	31	18	And He gave unto Moses , when He had made an end of communing with him upon Mount Sinai , two tablets of testimony , tablets of stone , written with the finger of God .
KJ21	Exodus	32	32	Yet now , if Thou wilt forgive their sin — and if not , blot me , I pray Thee , out of Thy book which Thou hast written ! ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	2	And Aaron said unto them , “ Break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons and of your daughters , and bring them unto me. ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	3	And all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
KJ21	Exodus	32	4	And he received them from their hand , and fashioned it with an engraving tool after he had made it a molten calf ; and they said , “ These are thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt ! ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	5	And when Aaron saw it , he built an altar before it ; and Aaron made proclamation and said , “ Tomorrow is a feast to the Lord. ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	6	And they rose up early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
KJ21	Exodus	32	7	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Go , get thee down ; for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves .
KJ21	Exodus	32	8	They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them . They have made themselves a molten calf and have worshiped it , and have sacrificed thereunto and said , ‘ These are thy gods , O Israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt ! ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	9	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ I have seen this people , and behold , it is a stiffnecked people .
KJ21	Exodus	32	10	Now therefore let Me alone , that My wrath may wax hot against them , and that I may consume them ; and I will make of thee a great nation. ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	11	And Moses besought the Lord his God and said , “ Lord , why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy people , whom Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand ?
KJ21	Exodus	32	12	Why should the Egyptians speak and say , ‘ For mischief did He bring them out , to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth ’ ? Turn from Thy fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against Thy people .
KJ21	Exodus	32	13	Remember Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , Thy servants to whom Thou sworest by Thine own self and saidst unto them , ‘ I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven , and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed , and they shall inherit it for ever. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	14	And the Lord repented of the evil which He thought to do unto His people .
KJ21	Exodus	32	15	And Moses turned and went down from the mount , and the two tablets of the testimony were in his hand . The tablets were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
KJ21	Exodus	32	16	And the tablets were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , graven upon the tablets .
KJ21	Exodus	32	17	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said unto Moses , “ There is a noise of war in the camp. ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	18	And Moses said , “ It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome ; but the noise of them that sing do I hear. ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	19	And it came to pass , as soon as he came nigh unto the camp , that he saw the calf and the dancing ; and Moses ’ anger waxed hot , and he cast the tablets out of his hands and broke them beneath the mount .
KJ21	Exodus	32	20	And he took the calf which they had made and burned it in the fire and ground it to powder , and strewed it upon the water and made the children of Israel drink of it .
KJ21	Exodus	32	21	And Moses said unto Aaron , “ What did this people unto thee , that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them ? ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	22	And Aaron said , “ Let not the anger of my lord wax hot . Thou knowest the people , that they are set on mischief .
KJ21	Exodus	32	23	For they said unto me , ‘ Make us gods which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we know not what has become of him. ’
KJ21	Exodus	32	24	And I said unto them , ‘ Whosoever hath any gold , let them break it off. ’ So they gave it to me . Then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this calf. ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	25	And when Moses saw that the people were naked ( for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies ) ,
KJ21	Exodus	32	26	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said , “ Who is on the Lord ’ S side ? Let him come unto me. ” And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him .
KJ21	Exodus	32	27	And he said unto them , “ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : ‘ Put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbor. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	28	And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses , and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
KJ21	Exodus	32	29	For Moses had said , “ Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord , even every man upon his son and upon his brother , that He may bestow upon you a blessing this day. ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	30	And it came to pass on the morrow that Moses said unto the people , “ Ye have sinned a great sin . And now I will go up unto the Lord . Perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin. ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	31	And Moses returned unto the Lord and said , “ Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made themselves gods of gold .
KJ21	Exodus	32	33	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Whosoever hath sinned against Me , him will I blot out of My book .
KJ21	Exodus	32	34	Therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee ; behold , Mine angel shall go before thee . Nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. ”
KJ21	Exodus	32	35	And the Lord plagued the people , because they made the calf which Aaron made .
KJ21	Exodus	33	33	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Depart and go up hence , thou and the people whom thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt , unto the land which I swore unto Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , ‘ Unto thy seed will I give it. ’
KJ21	Exodus	33	2	And I will send an angel before thee ; and I will drive out the Canaanite , the Amorite , and the Hittite and the Perizzite , the Hivite and the Jebusite ”
KJ21	Exodus	33	3	unto a land flowing with milk and honey . For I will not go up in the midst of thee , for thou art a stiffnecked people , lest I consume thee on the way. ”
KJ21	Exodus	33	4	And when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned , and no man put on his ornaments .
KJ21	Exodus	33	5	For the Lord had said unto Moses , “ Say unto the children of Israel , ‘ Ye are a stiffnecked people . I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee . Therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee , that I may know what to do unto thee. ’ ”
KJ21	Exodus	33	6	And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb .
KJ21	Exodus	33	7	And Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it outside the camp , afar off from the camp , and called it the tabernacle of the congregation . And it came to pass that every one who sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation , which was outside the camp .
KJ21	Exodus	33	8	And it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle .
KJ21	Exodus	33	9	And it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tabernacle , the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the Lord talked with Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	33	10	And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tabernacle door ; and all the people rose up and worshiped , every man in his tent door .
KJ21	Exodus	33	11	And the Lord spoke unto Moses face to face , as a man speaketh unto his friend . And he returned again into the camp ; but his servant Joshua , the son of Nun , a young man , departed not out of the tabernacle .
KJ21	Exodus	33	12	And Moses said unto the Lord , “ See , Thou sayest unto me , ‘ Bring up this people , ’ and Thou hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me . Yet Thou hast said , ‘ I know thee by name , and thou hast also found grace in My sight. ’
KJ21	Exodus	33	13	Now therefore , I pray Thee , if I have found grace in Thy sight , show me now Thy way , that I may know Thee , that I may find grace in Thy sight ; and consider that this nation is Thy people. ”
KJ21	Exodus	33	14	And He said , “ My presence shall go with thee , and I will give thee rest. ”
KJ21	Exodus	33	15	And he said unto Him , “ If Thy presence go not with me , carry us not up hence .
KJ21	Exodus	33	16	For wherein shall it be known here that I and Thy people have found grace in Thy sight ? Is it not in that Thou goest with us ? So shall we be separated , I and Thy people , from all the people who are upon the face of the earth. ”
KJ21	Exodus	33	17	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken ; for thou hast found grace in My sight , and I know thee by name. ”
KJ21	Exodus	33	18	And he said , “ I beseech Thee , show me Thy glory. ”
KJ21	Exodus	33	19	And He said , “ I will make all My goodness pass before thee ; and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee , and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious , and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. ”
KJ21	Exodus	33	20	And He said , “ Thou canst not see My face , for there shall no man see Me and live. ”
KJ21	Exodus	33	21	And the Lord said , “ Behold , there is a place by Me , and thou shalt stand upon a rock .
KJ21	Exodus	33	22	And it shall come to pass , while My glory passeth by , that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock , and will cover thee with My hand while I pass by ;
KJ21	Exodus	33	23	and I will take away Mine hand , and thou shalt see My back parts , but My face shall not be seen . ”
KJ21	Exodus	34	34	But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him , he took the veil off until he came out . And he came out , and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
KJ21	Exodus	34	2	And be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai , and present thyself there to Me on the top of the mount .
KJ21	Exodus	34	3	And no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount ; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. ”
KJ21	Exodus	34	4	And he hewed two tablets of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto Mount Sinai , as the Lord had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tablets of stone .
KJ21	Exodus	34	5	And the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there , and proclaimed the name of the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	34	6	And the Lord passed by before him , and proclaimed , “ The Lord , the Lord God , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
KJ21	Exodus	34	7	keeping mercy for thousands , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children ’ s children unto the third and to the fourth generation. ”
KJ21	Exodus	34	8	And Moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped .
KJ21	Exodus	34	9	And he said , “ If now I have found grace in Thy sight , O Lord , let my Lord , I pray Thee , go among us , for it is a stiffnecked people ; and pardon our iniquity and our sin , and take us for Thine inheritance. ”
KJ21	Exodus	34	10	And He said , “ Behold , I make a covenant . Before all thy people I will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth , nor in any nation ; and all the people among whom thou art shall see the work of the Lord , for it is a fearsome thing that I will do with thee .
KJ21	Exodus	34	11	Observe thou that which I command thee this day . Behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite and the Canaanite , and the Hittite and the Perizzite , and the Hivite and the Jebusite .
KJ21	Exodus	34	12	Take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee .
KJ21	Exodus	34	13	But ye shall destroy their altars , break their images , and cut down their Asherah poles .
KJ21	Exodus	34	14	For thou shalt worship no other god ; for the Lord , whose name is Jealous , is a jealous God ,
KJ21	Exodus	34	15	lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go a whoring after their gods , and do sacrifice unto their gods , and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice ,
KJ21	Exodus	34	16	and thou take their daughters unto thy sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods .
KJ21	Exodus	34	17	“ Thou shalt make thee no molten gods .
KJ21	Exodus	34	18	“ The Feast of Unleavened Bread shalt thou keep . Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , as I commanded thee , in the time of the month of Abib ; for in the month of Abib thou camest out from Egypt .
KJ21	Exodus	34	19	“ All that openeth the womb is Mine , and every firstling among thy cattle , whether ox or sheep , that is male .
KJ21	Exodus	34	20	But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; and if thou redeem him not , then shalt thou break his neck . All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem . And none shall appear before Me empty .
KJ21	Exodus	34	21	“ Six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest ; in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
KJ21	Exodus	34	22	And thou shalt observe the Feast of Weeks of the firstfruits of wheat harvest , and the Feast of Ingathering at the year ’ s end .
KJ21	Exodus	34	23	Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the Lord God , the God of Israel .
KJ21	Exodus	34	24	For I will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders ; neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year .
KJ21	Exodus	34	25	“ Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven , neither shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be left until the morning .
KJ21	Exodus	34	26	The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord thy God . Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother ’ s milk. ”
KJ21	Exodus	34	27	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Write thou these words , for according to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. ”
KJ21	Exodus	34	28	And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights ; he neither ate bread nor drank water . And He wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant , the Ten Commandments .
KJ21	Exodus	34	29	And it came to pass , when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of testimony in Moses ’ hand , when he came down from the mount , that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with Him .
KJ21	Exodus	34	30	And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone , and they were afraid to come nigh him .
KJ21	Exodus	34	31	And Moses called unto them , and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him ; and Moses talked with them .
KJ21	Exodus	34	32	And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh , and he gave them in commandments all that the Lord had spoken with him on Mount Sinai .
KJ21	Exodus	34	33	And until Moses had done speaking with them , he put a veil on his face .
KJ21	Exodus	34	35	And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses ’ face shone ; and Moses put the veil upon his face again , until he went in to speak with Him .
KJ21	Exodus	35	35	Them hath He filled with wisdom of heart , to work all manner of work of the engraver and of the skilled workman , and of the embroiderer in blue and in purple , in scarlet and in fine linen , and of the weaver —even of those who do any work and of those who devise skillful work . ”
KJ21	Exodus	35	2	Six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be for you a holy day , a Sabbath of rest to the Lord . Whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death .
KJ21	Exodus	35	3	Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the Sabbath day. ”
KJ21	Exodus	35	4	And Moses spoke unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , saying , “ This is the thing which the Lord commanded , saying ,
KJ21	Exodus	35	5	‘ Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord . Whosoever is of a willing heart , let him bring it , an offering of the Lord : gold and silver and brass ;
KJ21	Exodus	35	6	and blue and purple and scarlet , and fine linen and goats ’ hair ;
KJ21	Exodus	35	7	and rams ’ skins dyed red , and badgers ’ skins , and shittim wood ;
KJ21	Exodus	35	8	and oil for the light , and spices for anointing oil and for the sweet incense ;
KJ21	Exodus	35	9	and onyx stones , and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate .
KJ21	Exodus	35	10	“ ‘ And every wisehearted among you shall come and make all that the Lord hath commanded :
KJ21	Exodus	35	11	the tabernacle , his tent and his covering , his clasps , and his boards , his bars , his pillars and his sockets ;
KJ21	Exodus	35	12	the ark and the staves thereof , with the mercy seat and the veil of the covering ;
KJ21	Exodus	35	13	the table and his staves and all his vessels , and the showbread ;
KJ21	Exodus	35	14	the candlestick also for the light , and his furniture and his lamps with the oil for the light ;
KJ21	Exodus	35	15	and the incense altar and his staves , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle ;

KJ21	Exodus	35	20	And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	35	21	And they came every one whose heart stirred him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the Lord ’ S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation , and for all his service and for the holy garments .
KJ21	Exodus	35	22	And they came , both men and women , as many as were willinghearted , and brought bracelets and earrings , and rings and tablets , all jewels of gold ; and every man who offered , offered an offering of gold unto the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	35	23	And every man with whom was found blue and purple and scarlet , and fine linen and goats ’ hair , and red skins of rams and badgers ’ skins , brought them .
KJ21	Exodus	35	24	Every one who offered an offering of silver and brass brought the Lord ’ S offering ; and every man with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service brought it .
KJ21	Exodus	35	25	And all the women who were wisehearted spun with their hands and brought that which they had spun , both of blue and of purple , and of scarlet and of fine linen .
KJ21	Exodus	35	26	And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats ’ hair .
KJ21	Exodus	35	27	And the rulers brought onyx stones , and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate ,
KJ21	Exodus	35	28	and spices , and oil for the light and for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense .
KJ21	Exodus	35	29	The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord , every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	35	30	And Moses said unto the children of Israel , “ See , the Lord hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah .
KJ21	Exodus	35	31	And He hath filled him with the Spirit of God , in wisdom , in understanding and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
KJ21	Exodus	35	32	and to devise skillful works , to work in gold and in silver and in brass ,
KJ21	Exodus	35	33	and in the cutting of stones to set them , and in carving of wood to make any manner of skillful work .
KJ21	Exodus	35	34	And He hath put in his heart that he may teach , both he and Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan .
KJ21	Exodus	36	36	And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold . Their hooks were of gold , and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
KJ21	Exodus	36	2	And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wisehearted man in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom , even every one whose heart stirred him up , to come unto the work to do it .
KJ21	Exodus	36	3	And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , to make it thereby . And they brought yet unto him freewill offerings every morning .
KJ21	Exodus	36	4	And all the wise men who wrought all the work of the sanctuary came every man from his work which they made ,
KJ21	Exodus	36	5	and they spoke unto Moses , saying , “ The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the Lord commanded to make. ”
KJ21	Exodus	36	6	And Moses gave a commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , “ Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. ” So the people were restrained from bringing ,
KJ21	Exodus	36	7	for the supply they had was sufficient for all the work to make it , and too much .
KJ21	Exodus	36	8	And every wisehearted man among them who wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of finetwined linen , and blue and purple and scarlet ; with cherubims of skillful work made he them .
KJ21	Exodus	36	9	The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits ; the curtains were all of one size .
KJ21	Exodus	36	10	And he coupled the five curtains one unto another , and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another .
KJ21	Exodus	36	11	And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvage in the coupling . Likewise he made in the outermost side of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
KJ21	Exodus	36	12	Fifty loops made he in one curtain , and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second ; the loops held one curtain to another .
KJ21	Exodus	36	13	And he made fifty clasps of gold , and coupled the curtains one unto another with the clasps . So it became one tabernacle .
KJ21	Exodus	36	14	And he made curtains of goats ’ hair for the tent over the tabernacle ; eleven curtains he made them .
KJ21	Exodus	36	15	The length of one curtain was thirty cubits , and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain ; the eleven curtains were of one size .
KJ21	Exodus	36	16	And he coupled five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves .
KJ21	Exodus	36	17	And he made fifty loops upon the outermost edge of the curtain in the coupling , and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
KJ21	Exodus	36	18	And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together , that it might be one .
KJ21	Exodus	36	19	And he made a covering for the tent of rams ’ skins dyed red , and a covering of badgers ’ skins above that .
KJ21	Exodus	36	20	And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood , standing upright .
KJ21	Exodus	36	21	The length of a board was ten cubits , and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half .
KJ21	Exodus	36	22	One board had two tenons equally distant one from another . Thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
KJ21	Exodus	36	23	And he made boards for the tabernacle , twenty boards for the south side southward .
KJ21	Exodus	36	24	And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards : two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .

KJ21	Exodus	36	27	And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards .
KJ21	Exodus	36	28	And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides .
KJ21	Exodus	36	29	And they were coupled beneath and coupled together at the head thereof to one ring ; thus he did to both of them in both the corners .
KJ21	Exodus	36	30	And there were eight boards , and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver , under every board two sockets .
KJ21	Exodus	36	31	And he made bars of shittim wood : five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
KJ21	Exodus	36	32	and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward .
KJ21	Exodus	36	33	And he made the middle bar to extend through the boards from the one end to the other .
KJ21	Exodus	36	34	And he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
KJ21	Exodus	36	35	And he made a veil of blue and purple and scarlet , and finetwined linen ; with cherubims he made it of skillful work .
KJ21	Exodus	36	37	And he made a hanging for the tabernacle door of blue and purple and scarlet , and finetwined linen , of needlework ,
KJ21	Exodus	36	38	and the five pillars of it with their hooks . And he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold , but their five sockets were of brass .

KJ21	Exodus	37	8	one cherub on the end on this side , and another cherub on the other end on that side ; out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
KJ21	Exodus	37	9	And the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered over the mercy seat with their wings with their faces one toward another ; even toward the mercy seat were the faces of the cherubims .

KJ21	Exodus	39	3	And they beat the gold into thin plates , and cut it into wires to work it in the blue and in the purple and in the scarlet and in the fine linen , with skillful work .
KJ21	Exodus	39	4	They made shoulder pieces for it to couple it together ; by the two edges was it coupled together .

KJ21	Exodus	39	8	And he made the breastplate of skillful work , like the work of the ephod : of gold , blue and purple and scarlet , and finetwined linen .
KJ21	Exodus	39	9	It was foursquare . They made the breastplate double : a span was the length thereof and a span the breadth thereof , being doubled .
KJ21	Exodus	39	10	And they set in it four rows of stones : the first row was a sardius , a topaz and a carbuncle ; this was the first row ;
KJ21	Exodus	39	11	and the second row , an emerald , a sapphire , and a diamond ;
KJ21	Exodus	39	12	and the third row , a ligure , an agate , and an amethyst ;

KJ21	Exodus	39	19	And they made two rings of gold and put them on the two ends of the breastplate , upon the border of it which was on the side of the ephod inward ;
KJ21	Exodus	39	20	and they made two other golden rings and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the front of it over against the other coupling thereof , above the embroidered girdle of the ephod .
KJ21	Exodus	39	21	And they bound the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it might be above the embroidered girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	39	22	And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work , all of blue .
KJ21	Exodus	39	23	And there was a hole in the midst of the robe , as the hole of a jacket of mail , with a band round about the hole , that it should not rend .
KJ21	Exodus	39	24	And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet , and twined linen .
KJ21	Exodus	39	25	And they made bells of pure gold , and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe , round about between the pomegranates :
KJ21	Exodus	39	26	a bell and a pomegranate , a bell and a pomegranate , round about the hem of the robe to minister in , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	39	27	And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron and for his sons ,

KJ21	Exodus	39	30	And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like the engravings of a signet : Holiness to the Lord .
KJ21	Exodus	39	31	And they tied unto it a lace of blue to fasten it on high upon the miter , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	39	32	Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished , and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses ; so did they .
KJ21	Exodus	39	33	And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses : the tent and all his furniture , his clasps , his boards , his bars and his pillars and his sockets ;
KJ21	Exodus	39	34	and the covering of rams ’ skins dyed red , and the covering of badgers ’ skins , and the veil of the covering ;

KJ21	Exodus	39	43	And Moses looked upon all the work , and behold , they had done it as the Lord had commanded ; even so had they done it . And Moses blessed them .
KJ21	Exodus	40	40	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Exodus	40	2	“ On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation .
KJ21	Exodus	40	3	And thou shalt put therein the ark of the Testimony , and cover the ark with the veil .
KJ21	Exodus	40	4	And thou shalt bring in the table and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick and light the lamps thereof .
KJ21	Exodus	40	5	And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the Testimony , and put up the hanging of the door to the tabernacle .
KJ21	Exodus	40	6	And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation .
KJ21	Exodus	40	7	And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
KJ21	Exodus	40	8	And thou shalt set up the court round about , and hang up the hanging at the court gate .
KJ21	Exodus	40	9	And thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it and all the vessels thereof ; and it shall be holy .
KJ21	Exodus	40	10	And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all his vessels , and sanctify the altar ; and it shall be an altar most holy .
KJ21	Exodus	40	11	And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot , and sanctify it .
KJ21	Exodus	40	12	And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and wash them with water .
KJ21	Exodus	40	13	And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments , and anoint him and sanctify him , that he may minister unto Me in the priest ’ s office .
KJ21	Exodus	40	14	And thou shalt bring his sons and clothe them with coats ;
KJ21	Exodus	40	15	and thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto Me in the priest ’ s office . For their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. ”
KJ21	Exodus	40	16	Thus did Moses : according to all that the Lord commanded him , so did he .
KJ21	Exodus	40	17	And it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
KJ21	Exodus	40	18	And Moses reared up the tabernacle , and fastened his sockets and set up the boards thereof , and put in the bars thereof and reared up his pillars .
KJ21	Exodus	40	19	And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle , and put the covering of the tent above upon it , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	40	20	And he took and put the testimony into the ark , and set the staves on the ark , and put the mercy seat above upon the ark .
KJ21	Exodus	40	21	And he brought the ark into the tabernacle , and set up the veil of the covering and covered the ark of the Testimony , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	40	22	And he put the table in the tent of the congregation upon the side of the tabernacle northward , outside the veil .
KJ21	Exodus	40	23	And he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	40	24	And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation opposite the table , on the side of the tabernacle southward .
KJ21	Exodus	40	25	And he lighted the lamps before the Lord , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	40	26	And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil ;
KJ21	Exodus	40	27	and he burned sweet incense thereon , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	40	28	And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle .
KJ21	Exodus	40	29	And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation , and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	40	30	And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and put water there for washing .
KJ21	Exodus	40	31	And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat .
KJ21	Exodus	40	32	When they went into the tent of the congregation and when they came near unto the altar , they washed , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Exodus	40	33	And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . So Moses finished the work .
KJ21	Exodus	40	34	Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation , and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .
KJ21	Exodus	40	35	And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .

KJ21	Leviticus	7	34	For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings , and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever , from among the children of Israel. ’ ”
KJ21	Leviticus	7	35	This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron and of the anointing of his sons out of the offerings to the Lord made by fire , on the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest ’ s office ,
KJ21	Leviticus	7	36	which the Lord commanded to be given them by the children of Israel on the day that He anointed them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
KJ21	Leviticus	7	37	This is the law of the burnt offering , of the meat offering , and of the sin offering , and of the trespass offering , and of the consecrations , and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings ,
KJ21	Leviticus	7	38	which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day that He commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord in the Wilderness of Sinai .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	8	And he put the breastplate upon him . Also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	2	“ Take Aaron and his sons with him , and the garments , and the anointing oil , and a bullock for the sin offering , and two rams , and a basket of unleavened bread ;
KJ21	Leviticus	8	3	and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	8	4	And Moses did as the Lord commanded him , and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	5	And Moses said unto the congregation : “ This is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	8	6	And Moses brought Aaron and his sons , and washed them with water .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	7	And he put upon him the coat , and girded him with the girdle , and clothed him with the robe , and put the ephod upon him , and he girded him with the woven girdle of the ephod , and bound it unto him therewith .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	9	And he put the miter upon his head . Also upon the miter , even upon the front thereof , did he put the golden plate , the holy crown , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	10	And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein , and sanctified them .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	11	And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times , and anointed the altar and all his vessels , both the laver and his foot , to sanctify them .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	12	And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron ’ s head and anointed him , to sanctify him .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	13	And Moses brought Aaron ’ s sons and put coats upon them , and girded them with girdles , and put headdresses upon them , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	14	And he brought the bullock for the sin offering ; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	15	And he slew it ; and Moses took the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified the altar , and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar and sanctified it , to make reconciliation upon it .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	16	And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and Moses burned it upon the altar .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	17	But the bullock and his hide , his flesh , and his dung he burned with fire outside the camp , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	18	And he brought the ram for the burnt offering ; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	19	And he killed it ; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	20	And he cut the ram into pieces ; and Moses burned the head and the pieces and the fat .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	21	And he washed the inwards and the legs in water ; and Moses burned the whole ram upon the altar . It was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savor , and an offering made by fire unto the Lord , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	22	And he brought the other ram , the ram of consecration ; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	23	And he slew it ; and Moses took of the blood of it and put it upon the tip of Aaron ’ s right ear and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	24	And he brought Aaron ’ s sons , and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear and upon the thumbs of their right hands and upon the great toes of their right feet ; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	25	And he took the fat , and the rump , and all the fat that was upon the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys and their fat , and the right shoulder ;
KJ21	Leviticus	8	26	and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord he took one unleavened cake and a cake of oiled bread and one wafer , and put them on the fat and upon the right shoulder .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	27	And he put all upon Aaron ’ s hands and upon his sons ’ hands , and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	28	And Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar upon the burnt offering . They were consecrations for a sweet savor ; it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	29	And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord ; for of the ram of consecration , it was Moses ’ part , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	30	And Moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood which was upon the altar , and sprinkled it upon Aaron and upon his garments , and upon his sons and upon his sons ’ garments with him , and sanctified Aaron and his garments , and his sons and his sons ’ garments with him .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	31	And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons , “ Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations , as I commanded , saying , ‘ Aaron and his sons shall eat it. ’
KJ21	Leviticus	8	32	And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	33	And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation for seven days , until the days of your consecration are at an end ; for seven days shall He consecrate you .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	34	As He hath done this day , so the Lord hath commanded to do , to make an atonement for you .
KJ21	Leviticus	8	35	Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days , and keep the charge of the Lord , that ye die not ; for so I am commanded. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	8	36	So Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	9	And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him , and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar , and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar ;
KJ21	Leviticus	9	2	and he said unto Aaron , “ Take thee a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering , without blemish , and offer them before the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	3	And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak , saying , ‘ Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering , and a calf and a lamb , both of the first year , without blemish , for a burnt offering ,
KJ21	Leviticus	9	4	also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the Lord , and a meat offering mingled with oil ; for today the Lord will appear unto you. ’ ”
KJ21	Leviticus	9	5	And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation , and all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	6	And Moses said , “ This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do , and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	9	7	And Moses said unto Aaron , “ Go unto the altar , and offer thy sin offering and thy burnt offering , and make an atonement for thyself and for the people ; and offer the offering of the people and make an atonement for them , as the Lord commanded. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	9	8	Aaron therefore went unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin offering , which was for himself .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	10	but the fat , and the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin offering , he burned upon the altar , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	11	And the flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	12	And he slew the burnt offering ; and Aaron ’ s sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled round about upon the altar .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	13	And they presented the burnt offering unto him , with the pieces thereof and the head ; and he burned them upon the altar .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	14	And he washed the inwards and the legs , and burned them upon the burnt offering on the altar .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	15	And he brought the people ’ s offering , and took the goat , which was the sin offering for the people , and slew it and offered it for sin , as the first .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	16	And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	17	And he brought the meat offering , and took a handful thereof and burned it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	18	He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people ; and Aaron ’ s sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled upon the altar round about ,
KJ21	Leviticus	9	19	and the fat of the bullock and of the ram , the rump , and that which covereth the inwards , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	20	And they put the fat upon the breasts , and he burned the fat upon the altar .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	21	And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the Lord , as Moses commanded .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	22	And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them , and came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and peace offerings .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation , and came out and blessed the people ; and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people .
KJ21	Leviticus	9	24	And there came a fire out from before the Lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat , which when all the people saw , they shouted and fell on their faces .
KJ21	Leviticus	10	10	that ye may put difference between holy and unholy , and between unclean and clean ,
KJ21	Leviticus	10	2	And there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them , and they died before the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	10	3	Then Moses said unto Aaron , “ This is that which the Lord spoke , saying , ‘ I will be sanctified in them that come nigh Me , and before all the people I will be glorified. ’ ” And Aaron held his peace .
KJ21	Leviticus	10	4	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said unto them , “ Come near ; carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	10	5	So they went near and carried them in their coats out of the camp , as Moses had said .
KJ21	Leviticus	10	6	And Moses said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons , “ Uncover not your heads , neither rend your clothes , lest ye die , and lest wrath come upon all the people ; but let your brethren , the whole house of Israel , bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled .
KJ21	Leviticus	10	7	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die ; for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you. ” And they did according to the word of Moses .
KJ21	Leviticus	10	8	And the Lord spoke unto Aaron , saying ,
KJ21	Leviticus	10	9	“ Do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die . It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations ,
KJ21	Leviticus	10	11	and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	10	12	And Moses spoke unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons who were left : “ Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made by fire , and eat it without leaven beside the altar ; for it is most holy .
KJ21	Leviticus	10	13	And ye shall eat it in the holy place , because it is thy due and thy sons ’ due of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire ; for so I am commanded .
KJ21	Leviticus	10	14	And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place , thou , and thy sons , and thy daughters with thee ; for they are thy due and thy sons ’ due , which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Leviticus	10	15	The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat , to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord ; and it shall be thine and thy sons ’ with thee by a statute for ever , as the Lord hath commanded. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	10	16	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering , and behold , it was burned ; and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar , the sons of Aaron who were left alive , saying ,
KJ21	Leviticus	10	17	“ Why have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place , seeing it is most holy , and God hath given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation , to make atonement for them before the Lord ?
KJ21	Leviticus	10	18	Behold , the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place ; ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place , as I commanded. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	10	19	And Aaron said unto Moses , “ Behold , this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord , and such things have befallen me . And if I had eaten the sin offering today , should it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord ? ”
KJ21	Leviticus	10	20	And when Moses heard that , he was content .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	11	They shall be even an abomination unto you : ye shall not eat of their flesh , but ye shall hold their carcasses in abomination .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	2	“ Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , ‘ These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	3	Whatsoever parteth the hoof and is cloven-footed and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that shall ye eat .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	4	Nevertheless these shall ye not eat , of those that chew the cud or of those that divide the hoof : the camel , because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof , he is unclean unto you ;
KJ21	Leviticus	11	5	and the coney , because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof , he is unclean unto you ;
KJ21	Leviticus	11	6	and the hare , because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof , he is unclean unto you ;
KJ21	Leviticus	11	7	and the swine , though he divide the hoof and is cloven-footed , yet he cheweth not the cud , he is unclean to you .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	8	Of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcass shall ye not touch ; they are unclean to you .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	9	“ ‘ These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters : whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters , in the seas , and in the rivers , them shall ye eat .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	10	And all that have not fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	12	Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters , that shall be an abomination unto you .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	13	“ ‘ And these are they which ye shall hold in abomination among the fowls ; they shall not be eaten , they are an abomination : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the osprey ,
KJ21	Leviticus	11	14	and the vulture , and the kite after his kind ,
KJ21	Leviticus	11	15	every raven after his kind ,
KJ21	Leviticus	11	16	and the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckoo , and the hawk after his kind ,
KJ21	Leviticus	11	17	and the little owl , and the cormorant , and the great owl ,
KJ21	Leviticus	11	18	and the swan , and the pelican , and the gier eagle ,
KJ21	Leviticus	11	19	and the stork , the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	20	“ ‘ All fowls that creep , going upon all fours , shall be an abomination unto you .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	21	Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all fours , which have legs above their feet with which to leap upon the earth ;
KJ21	Leviticus	11	22	even these of them ye may eat : the locust after his kind , and the bald locust after his kind , and the beetle after his kind , and the grasshopper after his kind .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	23	But all other flying creeping things which have four feet shall be an abomination unto you .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	24	“ ‘ And by these ye shall be unclean . Whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the evening ,
KJ21	Leviticus	11	25	and whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	26	The carcasses of every beast which divideth the hoof , and is not cloven-footed nor cheweth the cud , are unclean unto you ; every one who toucheth them shall be unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	27	And whatsoever goeth upon his paws , among all manner of beasts that go on all fours , those are unclean unto you ; whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the evening .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	28	And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening ; they are unclean unto you .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	29	“ ‘ These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth : the weasel , and the mouse , and the tortoise after his kind ,
KJ21	Leviticus	11	30	and the ferret , and the chameleon , and the lizard , and the snail , and the mole .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	31	These are unclean to you among all that creep ; whosoever doth touch them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	32	And upon whatsoever any of them when they are dead doth fall , it shall be unclean . Whether it be any vessel of wood or raiment or skin or sack , whatsoever vessel it be wherein any work is done , it must be put into water , and it shall be unclean until the evening ; so it shall be cleansed .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	33	And every earthen vessel whereinto any of them falleth , whatsoever is in it shall be unclean , and ye shall break it .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	34	Of all meat which may be eaten , that on which such water cometh shall be unclean ; and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	35	And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth shall be unclean . Whether it be an oven or ranges for pots , they shall be broken down ; for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	36	Nevertheless a fountain or pit , wherein there is plenty of water , shall be clean ; but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	37	And if any part of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown , it shall be clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	38	But if any water be put upon the seed and any part of their carcass fall thereon , it shall be unclean unto you .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	39	“ ‘ And if any beast of which ye may eat die , he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the evening .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	40	And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening . He also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	41	“ ‘ And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination ; it shall not be eaten .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	42	Whatsoever goeth upon the belly , and whatsoever goeth upon all fours , or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth , them ye shall not eat , for they are an abomination .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	43	Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	44	For I am the Lord your God . Ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves , and ye shall be holy , for I am holy ; neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	45	For I am the Lord who bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God . Ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
KJ21	Leviticus	11	46	“ ‘ This is the law of the beasts , and of the fowl , and of every living creature that moveth in the waters , and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth ,
KJ21	Leviticus	11	47	to make a difference between the unclean and the clean , and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten . ’ ”
KJ21	Leviticus	12	12	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Leviticus	12	2	“ Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , ‘ If a woman have conceived seed and borne a manchild , then she shall be unclean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	12	3	And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised .
KJ21	Leviticus	12	4	And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days . She shall touch no hallowed thing , nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purifying are fulfilled .
KJ21	Leviticus	12	5	But if she bear a maidchild , then she shall be unclean two weeks , as in her separation ; and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days .
KJ21	Leviticus	12	6	“ ‘ And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled , for a son or for a daughter , she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering , and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering , unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation unto the priest ,
KJ21	Leviticus	12	7	who shall offer it before the Lord and make an atonement for her ; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood . This is the law for her that hath borne a male or a female .
KJ21	Leviticus	12	8	And if she be not able to bring a lamb , then she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons , the one for the burnt offering and the other for a sin offering , and the priest shall make an atonement for her , and she shall be clean . ’ ”
KJ21	Leviticus	13	13	then the priest shall consider ; and behold , if the leprosy have covered all his flesh , he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague . It has all turned white ; he is clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	2	“ When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising , a scab , or bright spot , and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy , then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest or unto one of his sons the priests .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	3	And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh ; and when the hair in the plague has turned white and the plague in appearance be deeper than the skin of his flesh , it is a plague of leprosy ; and the priest shall look on him and pronounce him unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	4	If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh and in appearance be not deeper than the skin and the hair thereof be not turned white , then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	5	And the priest shall look on him the seventh day ; and behold , if the plague in its appearance is stayed and the plague spread not in the skin , then the priest shall shut him up seven days more .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	6	And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day ; and behold , if the plague be somewhat dark and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce him clean . It is but a scab , and he shall wash his clothes and be clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	7	But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin , after he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen by the priest again .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	8	And if the priest see that , behold , the scab spreadeth in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean ; it is leprosy .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	9	“ When the plague of leprosy is in a man , then he shall be brought unto the priest .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	10	And the priest shall see him ; and behold , if the rising be white in the skin and it has turned the hair white and there be living raw flesh in the rising ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	11	it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh ; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean and shall not shut him up , for he is unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	12	And if leprosy break out abroad in the skin and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot , wheresoever the priest looketh ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	14	But when raw flesh appeareth in him , he shall be unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	15	And the priest shall see the raw flesh and pronounce him to be unclean , for the raw flesh is unclean ; it is leprosy .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	16	Or if the raw flesh turn again and be changed unto white , he shall come unto the priest ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	17	and the priest shall see him ; and behold , if the plague be turned into white , then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague ; he is clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	18	“ The flesh also in which , even in the skin thereof , was a boil and it is healed ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	19	and in the place of the boil there be a white rising or a bright spot , white and somewhat reddish , and it be shown to the priest ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	20	and if , when the priest seeth it , behold , it is in appearance lower than the skin and the hair thereof is turned white , the priest shall pronounce him unclean ; it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	21	But if the priest look on it , and behold , there are no white hairs therein and if it is not lower than the skin , but is somewhat dark , then the priest shall shut him up seven days .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	22	And if it spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean ; it is a plague .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	23	But if the bright spot stay in his place and spread not , it is a burning boil ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	24	“ Or if there be any flesh in the skin whereof there is a hot burning , and the living flesh that burneth have a white bright spot , somewhat reddish or white ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	25	then the priest shall look upon it ; and behold , if the hair in the bright spot is turned white and it is in appearance deeper than the skin , it is a leprosy broken out of the burning . Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean ; it is the plague of leprosy .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	26	But if the priest look on it , and behold , there is no white hair in the bright spot and it is no lower than the other skin , but is somewhat dark , then the priest shall shut him up seven days .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	27	And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day ; and if it is spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean ; it is the plague of leprosy .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	28	And if the bright spot stay in his place and spread not in the skin , but it is somewhat dark , it is a rising from the burning ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean , for it is an inflammation from the burning .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	29	“ If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	30	then the priest shall see the plague ; and behold , if it be in appearance deeper than the skin and there is in it a yellow thin hair , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean ; it is a dry scall , even a leprosy upon the head or beard .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	31	And if the priest look on the plague of the scall , and behold , it is not in appearance deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it , then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	32	And on the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague ; and behold , if the scall spread not and there is in it no yellow hair and the scall is not in appearance deeper than the skin ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	33	he shall be shaved , but the scall shall he not shave ; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	34	And on the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall ; and behold , if the scall is not spread in the skin nor is in appearance deeper than the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him clean ; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	35	But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	36	then the priest shall look on him ; and behold , if the scall is spread in the skin , the priest shall not seek for yellow hair ; he is unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	37	But if the scall is in appearance stayed and there is black hair grown up therein , the scall is healed ; he is clean , and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	38	“ If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots , even white bright spots ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	39	then the priest shall look ; and behold , if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white , it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin ; he is clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	40	“ And the man whose hair has fallen off his head , he is bald , yet is he clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	41	And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , his forehead is bald , yet is he clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	42	And if there be in the bald head or bald forehead a white reddish sore , it is leprosy sprung up in his bald head or his bald forehead .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	43	Then the priest shall look upon it ; and behold , if the rising of the sore is reddish white in his bald head or in his bald forehead , as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	44	he is a leprous man ; he is unclean . The priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean ; his plague is on his head .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	45	“ And the leper in whom the plague is , his clothes shall be rent and his head bare , and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip and shall cry , ‘ Unclean , unclean. ’
KJ21	Leviticus	13	46	All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled ; he is unclean . He shall dwell alone ; outside the camp shall his habitation be .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	47	“ The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in , whether it be a woolen garment or a linen garment ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	48	whether it be in the warp or woof , of linen or of wool , whether in a skin or in any thing made of skin ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	49	and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the skin , either in the warp or in the woof or in any thing of skin , it is a plague of leprosy and shall be shown unto the priest .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	50	And the priest shall look upon the plague and shut up it that hath the plague seven days .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	51	And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day ; if the plague is spread in the garment , either in the warp or in the woof , or in a skin or in any work that is made of skin , the plague is a consuming leprosy ; it is unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	52	He shall therefore burn that garment , whether warp or woof , in wool or in linen , or any thing of skin wherein the plague is , for it is a consuming leprosy ; it shall be burned in the fire .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	53	“ And if the priest shall look , and behold , the plague is not spread in the garment , either in the warp or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ,
KJ21	Leviticus	13	54	then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is , and he shall shut it up seven days more .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	55	And the priest shall look on the plague after it is washed ; and behold , if the plague has not changed his color and the plague is not spread , it is unclean ; thou shalt burn it in the fire . It has eaten inward , whether it be bare within or without .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	56	And if the priest look , and behold , the plague is somewhat dark after the washing of it , then he shall rend it out of the garment , or out of the skin , or out of the warp , or out of the woof .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	57	And if it appear still in the garment , either in the warp or in the woof or in any thing of skin , it is a spreading plague ; thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire .
KJ21	Leviticus	13	58	And the garment , either warp or woof or whatsoever thing of skin it is which thou shalt wash , if the plague is departed from them , then it shall be washed the second time and shall be clean. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	13	59	This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen , either in the warp or woof , or any thing of skins , to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	14	And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering , and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	2	“ This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing : He shall be brought unto the priest .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	3	And the priest shall go forth out of the camp , and the priest shall look ; and behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ,
KJ21	Leviticus	14	4	then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	5	And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	6	As for the living bird , he shall take it , and the cedar wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	7	And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	8	And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes , and shave off all his hair , and wash himself in water , that he may be clean ; and after that he shall come into the camp , and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	9	But it shall be on the seventh day that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall shave off , and he shall wash his clothes ; also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	10	“ And on the eighth day he shall take two helambs without blemish and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish , and threetenths part of fine flour for a meat offering mingled with oil , and one log of oil .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	11	And the priest who maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean , and those things , before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	12	And the priest shall take one helamb and offer him for a trespass offering , and the log of oil , and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	13	And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering , in the holy place ; for as the sin offering is the priest ’ s , so is the trespass offering ; it is most holy .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	15	And the priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	16	And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord ;
KJ21	Leviticus	14	17	and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the blood of the trespass offering .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	18	And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest ’ s hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	19	And the priest shall offer the sin offering , and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness ; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	20	And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him , and he shall be clean .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	21	“ And if he be poor and can not get so much , then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved to make an atonement for him , and onetenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering , and a log of oil ,
KJ21	Leviticus	14	22	and two turtledoves or two young pigeons , such as he is able to get ; and the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	23	And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , before the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	24	And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering and the log of oil , and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	25	And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering , and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot ;
KJ21	Leviticus	14	26	and the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	27	And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the Lord ;
KJ21	Leviticus	14	28	and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	29	And the rest of the oil that is in the priest ’ s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed , to make an atonement for him before the Lord .

KJ21	Leviticus	14	31	even such as he is able to get — the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering , with the meat offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	32	This is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy , whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	14	33	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
KJ21	Leviticus	14	34	“ When ye have come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ,
KJ21	Leviticus	14	35	and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , ‘ It seemeth to me there is , as it were , a plague in the house , ’
KJ21	Leviticus	14	36	then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest go into it to see the plague , that all that is in the house be not made unclean ; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	37	And he shall look on the plague , and behold , if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks , greenish or reddish , which in appearance are lower than the wall ,
KJ21	Leviticus	14	38	then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house and shut up the house seven days .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	39	And the priest shall come again the seventh day and shall look ; and behold , if the plague is spread in the walls of the house ,
KJ21	Leviticus	14	40	then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is , and they shall cast them into an unclean place outside the city .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	41	And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about , and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off outside the city into an unclean place .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	42	And they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones , and he shall take other mortar and shall plaster the house .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	43	“ And if the plague come again and break out in the house , after he hath taken away the stones and after he hath scraped the house and after it is plastered ,
KJ21	Leviticus	14	44	then the priest shall come and look ; and behold , if the plague is spread in the house , it is a consuming leprosy in the house ; it is unclean .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	45	And he shall break down the house — the stones of it and the timber thereof and all the mortar of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	46	Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	47	And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes , and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	48	“ And if the priest shall come in and look upon it , and behold , the plague hath not spread in the house after the house was plastered , then the priest shall pronounce the house clean , because the plague is healed .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	49	And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop .
KJ21	Leviticus	14	50	And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water ;
KJ21	Leviticus	14	51	and he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water , and sprinkle the house seven times .

KJ21	Leviticus	14	53	but he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields , and make an atonement for the house ; and it shall be clean. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	14	54	This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy and scall ,
KJ21	Leviticus	14	55	and for the leprosy of a garment and of a house ,
KJ21	Leviticus	14	56	and for a rising and for a scab and for a bright spot ,
KJ21	Leviticus	14	57	to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean . This is the law of leprosy .

KJ21	Leviticus	17	12	Therefore I said unto the children of Israel , “ No soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	17	13	And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn among you , who hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten , he shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust .

KJ21	Leviticus	23	28	And ye shall do no work in that same day , for it is a Day of Atonement to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God .
KJ21	Leviticus	23	29	For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
KJ21	Leviticus	23	30	And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day , the same soul will I destroy from among his people .
KJ21	Leviticus	23	31	Ye shall do no manner of work ; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
KJ21	Leviticus	23	32	It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest , and ye shall afflict your souls . On the ninth day of the month at evening , from evening unto evening , shall ye celebrate your sabbath. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	23	33	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Leviticus	23	34	“ Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , ‘ The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	23	35	On the first day shall be a holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work therein .
KJ21	Leviticus	23	36	Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord . On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you , and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord . It is a solemn assembly , and ye shall do no servile work therein .
KJ21	Leviticus	23	37	“ ‘ These are the feasts of the Lord which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations , to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord , a burnt offering and a meat offering , a sacrifice and drink offerings , every thing upon his day ”
KJ21	Leviticus	23	38	besides the Sabbaths of the Lord , and besides your gifts , and besides all your vows , and besides all your freewill offerings which ye give unto the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	23	39	“ ‘ Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land , ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days ; on the first day shall be a sabbath , and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath .

KJ21	Leviticus	23	42	Ye shall dwell in booths seven days ; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths ,
KJ21	Leviticus	23	43	that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God. ’ ”
KJ21	Leviticus	23	44	And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	24	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Leviticus	24	2	“ Command the children of Israel that they bring unto thee pure olive oil , beaten for the light , to cause the lamps to burn continually .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	3	Outside the veil of the testimony , in the tabernacle of the congregation , shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the Lord continually ; it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	4	He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the Lord continually .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	5	“ And thou shalt take fine flour and bake twelve cakes thereof , twotenths part shall be in one cake .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	6	And thou shalt set them in two rows , six on a row , upon the pure table before the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	7	And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row , that it may be on the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	8	Every Sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord continually , being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	9	And it shall be Aaron ’ s and his sons ’ ; and they shall eat it in the holy place , for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire by a perpetual statute. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	24	10	And the son of an Israelite woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel ; and this son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	11	And the Israelite woman ’ s son blasphemed the name of the Lord and cursed . And they brought him unto Moses ( his mother ’ s name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan ) ;
KJ21	Leviticus	24	12	and they put him under guard , that the mind of the Lord might be shown them .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	13	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Leviticus	24	14	“ Bring forth him that hath cursed outside the camp ; and let all who heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	15	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , ‘ Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	16	And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord , he shall surely be put to death , and all the congregation shall certainly stone him . As well the stranger as he that is born in the land , when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord , shall be put to death .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	17	And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	18	And he that killeth a beast shall make it good , beast for beast .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	19	And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor , as he hath done , so shall it be done to him—
KJ21	Leviticus	24	20	breach for breach , eye for eye , tooth for tooth . As he hath caused a blemish in a man , so shall it be done to him again .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	21	And he that killeth a beast , he shall restore it ; and he that killeth a man , he shall be put to death .
KJ21	Leviticus	24	22	Ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger as for one of your own country ; for I am the Lord your God. ’ ”
KJ21	Leviticus	24	23	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel , that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp and stone him with stones . And the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	25	“ ‘ If thy brother waxeth poor and hath sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kin come to redeem it , then shall he redeem that which his brother sold .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	2	“ Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them : ‘ When ye come into the land which I give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	3	Six years thou shalt sow thy field , and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof ,
KJ21	Leviticus	25	4	but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the Lord ; thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	5	That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed ; for it is a year of rest unto the land .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	6	And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you : for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hired servant , and for thy stranger who sojourneth with thee ;
KJ21	Leviticus	25	7	and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	8	“ ‘ And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee , seven times seven years ; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	9	Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month ; on the Day of Atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	10	And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof . It shall be a jubilee unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	11	A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	12	For it is the jubilee ; it shall be holy unto you ; ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	13	“ ‘ In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	14	And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor or buyest aught of thy neighbor ’ s hand , ye shall not oppress one another .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	15	According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy from thy neighbor , and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	16	According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof , and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it ; for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	17	Ye shall not therefore oppress one another , but thou shalt fear thy God ; for I am the Lord your God .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	18	“ ‘ Therefore ye shall do My statutes , and keep My judgments and do them ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	19	And the land shall yield her fruit , and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	20	And if ye shall say , “ What shall we eat the seventh year ? Behold , we shall not sow nor gather in our increase. ”
KJ21	Leviticus	25	21	Then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for three years .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	22	And ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	23	The land shall not be sold for ever , for the land is Mine ; for ye are strangers and sojourners with Me .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	24	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	26	And if the man have none to redeem it , and he himself is able to redeem it ,
KJ21	Leviticus	25	27	then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it , that he may return unto his possession .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	28	But if he is not able to restore it to him , then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the Year of Jubilee ; and in the jubilee it shall go out , and he shall return unto his possession .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	29	“ ‘ And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold ; within a full year may he redeem it .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	30	And if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year , then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations ; it shall not go out in the jubilee .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	31	But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country ; they may be redeemed , and they shall go out in the jubilee .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	32	Notwithstanding , the cities of the Levites and the houses of the cities of their possession may the Levites redeem at any time .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	33	And if a man purchase from the Levites , then the house that was sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the Year of Jubilee ; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	34	But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold , for it is their perpetual possession .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	35	“ ‘ And if thy brother be waxed poor and hath fallen into ruin with thee , then thou shalt relieve him , yea , though he be a stranger or a sojourner , that he may live with thee .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	36	Take thou no interest from him or increase ; but fear thy God , that thy brother may live with thee .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	37	Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest , nor lend him thy victuals for increase .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	38	I am the Lord your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God .

KJ21	Leviticus	25	40	but as a hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the Year of Jubilee .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	41	And then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	42	For they are My servants , whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt ; they shall not be sold as bondmen .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	43	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor , but shalt fear thy God .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	44	Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids , whom thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen who are round about you . From them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	45	Moreover of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you , from them shall ye buy and from their families who are with you , whom they begot in your land ; and they shall be your possession .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	46	And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you , to inherit them for a possession . They shall be your bondmen for ever . But over your brethren , the children of Israel , ye shall not rule one over another with rigor .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	47	“ ‘ And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother who dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger ’ s family ,
KJ21	Leviticus	25	48	after he is sold he may be redeemed again . One of his brethren may redeem him :
KJ21	Leviticus	25	49	either his uncle or his uncle ’ s son may redeem him , or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him ; or if he is able , he may redeem himself .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	50	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the Year of Jubilee ; and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years , according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	51	If there be yet many years behind , according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	52	And if there remain but few years unto the Year of Jubilee , then he shall count with him , and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	53	And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him , and the other shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	54	And if he is not redeemed in these years , then he shall go out in the Year of Jubilee , both he and his children with him .
KJ21	Leviticus	25	55	For unto Me the children of Israel are servants . They are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
KJ21	Leviticus	26	26	And when I have broken the staff of your bread , ten women shall bake your bread in one oven , and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight ; and ye shall eat and not be satisfied .
KJ21	Leviticus	26	2	Ye shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary : I am the Lord .
KJ21	Leviticus	26	3	“ ‘ If ye walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and do them ,

KJ21	Leviticus	26	6	And I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid ; and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
KJ21	Leviticus	26	7	And ye shall chase your enemies , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
KJ21	Leviticus	26	8	And five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight ; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
KJ21	Leviticus	26	9	For I will have respect unto you , and make you fruitful and multiply you , and establish My covenant with you .
KJ21	Leviticus	26	10	And ye shall eat old store , and bring forth the old because of the new .
KJ21	Leviticus	26	11	And I will set My tabernacle among you , and My soul shall not abhor you .

KJ21	Leviticus	27	4	And if it be a female , then thy valuation shall be thirty shekels .
KJ21	Leviticus	27	5	And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old then thy valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels .
KJ21	Leviticus	27	6	And if it be from a month old even unto five years old , then thy valuation shall be for the male five shekels of silver , and for the female thy valuation shall be three shekels of silver .
KJ21	Leviticus	27	7	And if it be from sixty years old and above , if it be a male , then thy valuation shall be fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels .
KJ21	Leviticus	27	8	But if he be poorer than thy valuation , then he shall present himself before the priest and the priest shall value him ; according to his ability who vowed shall the priest value him .

KJ21	Numbers	4	49	According to the commandment of the Lord they were numbered by the hand of Moses , every one according to his service and according to his burden . Thus were they numbered by him , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Numbers	5	5	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	5	2	“ Command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper and every one who hath an issue and whosoever is defiled by the dead .
KJ21	Numbers	5	3	Both male and female shall ye put out . Outside the camp shall ye put them , that they defile not their camps in the midst whereof I dwell. ”
KJ21	Numbers	5	4	And the children of Israel did so , and put them out outside the camp ; as the Lord spoke unto Moses , so did the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	5	6	“ Speak unto the children of Israel : ‘ When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit to do a trespass against the Lord , and that person be guilty ,
KJ21	Numbers	5	7	then they shall confess their sin which they have done . And he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it a fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed .
KJ21	Numbers	5	8	But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto , let the trespass be recompensed unto the Lord , even to the priest , besides the ram of the atonement , whereby an atonement shall be made for him .
KJ21	Numbers	5	9	And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be his .
KJ21	Numbers	5	10	And every man ’ s hallowed things shall be his ; whatsoever any man giveth the priest , it shall be his. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	5	11	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	5	12	“ Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them : ‘ If any man ’ s wife go astray and commit a trespass against him ,
KJ21	Numbers	5	13	and a man lie with her carnally , and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept secret , and she be defiled and there be no witness against her , neither be she taken in the act ,
KJ21	Numbers	5	14	and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife , and she be defiled — or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife , and she be not defiled—
KJ21	Numbers	5	15	then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest . And he shall bring her offering for her , a tenth part of an ephah of barley meal . He shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon , for it is an offering of jealousy , an offering of memorial , bringing iniquity to remembrance .
KJ21	Numbers	5	16	“ ‘ And the priest shall bring her near , and set her before the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	5	17	And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel , and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water .
KJ21	Numbers	5	18	And the priest shall set the woman before the Lord , and uncover the woman ’ s head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the jealousy offering ; and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse .
KJ21	Numbers	5	19	And the priest shall charge her by an oath , and say unto the woman , “ If no man have lain with thee and if thou hast not gone astray to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse .
KJ21	Numbers	5	20	But if thou hast gone astray to another instead of thy husband , and if thou be defiled and some man have lain with thee besides thine husband ” —
KJ21	Numbers	5	21	then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing , and the priest shall say unto the woman — “ the Lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people , when the Lord doth make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to swell .
KJ21	Numbers	5	22	And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot. ” And the woman shall say , “ Amen , amen. ”
KJ21	Numbers	5	23	“ ‘ And the priest shall write these curses in a book , and he shall blot them out with the bitter water ;
KJ21	Numbers	5	24	and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse , and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter .
KJ21	Numbers	5	25	Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman ’ s hand , and shall wave the offering before the Lord and offer it upon the altar .
KJ21	Numbers	5	26	And the priest shall take a handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
KJ21	Numbers	5	27	And when he hath made her to drink the water , then it shall come to pass , if she be defiled and have done trespass against her husband , that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter , and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot ; and the woman shall be a curse among her people .
KJ21	Numbers	5	28	And if the woman be not defiled , but be clean , then she shall be free and shall conceive seed .
KJ21	Numbers	5	29	“ ‘ This is the law of jealousies , when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband and is defiled ,
KJ21	Numbers	5	30	or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him and he is jealous over his wife , and shall set the woman before the Lord , and the priest shall execute upon her all this law .
KJ21	Numbers	5	31	Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity , and this woman shall bear her iniquity . ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	6	6	All the days that he separateth himself unto the Lord he shall come near no dead body .
KJ21	Numbers	6	2	“ Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them : ‘ When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazirite , to separate themselves unto the Lord ,
KJ21	Numbers	6	3	he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink , and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink , neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes , nor eat moist grapes or dried .
KJ21	Numbers	6	4	All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree , from the kernels even to the husk .
KJ21	Numbers	6	5	“ ‘ All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head . Until the days be fulfilled in which he separateth himself unto the Lord , he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow .
KJ21	Numbers	6	7	He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother , for his brother or for his sister when they die , because the consecration of his God is upon his head .
KJ21	Numbers	6	8	All the days of his separation he is holy unto the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	6	9	And if any man die very suddenly by him , and he hath defiled the head of his consecration , then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing ; on the seventh day shall he shave it .
KJ21	Numbers	6	10	And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation ;
KJ21	Numbers	6	11	and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering , and make an atonement for him , because he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
KJ21	Numbers	6	12	And he shall consecrate unto the Lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering ; but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled .
KJ21	Numbers	6	13	“ ‘ And this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation are fulfilled : He shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation ,
KJ21	Numbers	6	14	and he shall offer his offering unto the Lord : one helamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering , and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering , and one ram without blemish for peace offerings ,
KJ21	Numbers	6	15	and a basket of unleavened bread , cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil , and their meat offering , and their drink offerings .
KJ21	Numbers	6	16	And the priest shall bring them before the Lord , and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering .
KJ21	Numbers	6	17	And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord , with the basket of unleavened bread . The priest shall offer also his meat offering and his drink offering .
KJ21	Numbers	6	18	And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings .
KJ21	Numbers	6	19	And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram , and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer , and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite after the hair of his separation is shaved .
KJ21	Numbers	6	20	And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord . This is holy for the priest , with the wave breast and heave shoulder . And after that the Nazirite may drink wine. ’
KJ21	Numbers	6	21	“ This is the law of the Nazirite who hath vowed , and of his offering unto the Lord for his separation , besides that which his hand shall get : according to the vow which he vowed , so he must do according to the law of his separation. ”
KJ21	Numbers	6	22	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	6	23	“ Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons , saying , ‘ In this way ye shall bless the children of Israel , saying unto them :
KJ21	Numbers	6	24	The Lord bless thee and keep thee ;
KJ21	Numbers	6	25	the Lord make His face shine upon thee , and be gracious unto thee ;
KJ21	Numbers	6	26	the Lord lift up His countenance upon thee , and give thee peace. ’
KJ21	Numbers	6	27	“ And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel , and I will bless them . ”
KJ21	Numbers	7	7	Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon , according to their service ;
KJ21	Numbers	7	2	that the princes of Israel , heads of the house of their fathers , who were the princes of the tribes and were over those who were numbered , offered .
KJ21	Numbers	7	3	And they brought their offering before the Lord : six covered wagons and twelve oxen — a wagon for two of the princes and for each one an ox ; and they brought them before the tabernacle .
KJ21	Numbers	7	4	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	7	5	“ Take it from them , that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation ; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites , to every man according to his service. ”
KJ21	Numbers	7	6	And Moses took the wagons and the oxen , and gave them unto the Levites .
KJ21	Numbers	7	8	and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari , according to their service , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
KJ21	Numbers	7	9	But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none , because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders .
KJ21	Numbers	7	10	And the princes offered for the dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes offered their offering before the altar .
KJ21	Numbers	7	11	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ They shall offer their offering , each prince on his day , for the dedicating of the altar. ”

KJ21	Numbers	8	16	For they are wholly given unto Me from among the children of Israel , instead of such as open every womb , even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel have I taken them unto Me .

KJ21	Numbers	8	23	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	8	24	“ This is what applies unto the Levites : From twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	8	25	And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof , and shall serve no more ,
KJ21	Numbers	8	26	but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation to keep the charge , and shall do no service . Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites concerning their charge . ”
KJ21	Numbers	9	9	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	9	2	“ Let the children of Israel also keep the Passover at his appointed season .
KJ21	Numbers	9	3	In the fourteenth day of this month at evening ye shall keep it in his appointed season . According to all the rites of it and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it. ”
KJ21	Numbers	9	4	And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover .
KJ21	Numbers	9	5	And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at evening in the Wilderness of Sinai . According to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so did the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	9	6	And there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man , so that they could not keep the Passover on that day ; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day .
KJ21	Numbers	9	7	And those men said unto him , “ We are defiled by the dead body of a man . Why are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in its appointed season among the children of Israel ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	9	8	And Moses said unto them , “ Stand still , and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you. ”
KJ21	Numbers	9	10	“ Speak unto the children of Israel , saying : ‘ If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body , or be in a journey afar off , yet he shall keep the Passover unto the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	9	11	The fourteenth day of the second month at evening they shall keep it , and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
KJ21	Numbers	9	12	They shall leave none of it unto the morning , nor break any bone of it . According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it .
KJ21	Numbers	9	13	But the man who is clean and is not on a journey , and forbeareth to keep the Passover , even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people , because he brought not the offering of the Lord in its appointed season . That man shall bear his sin .
KJ21	Numbers	9	14	And if a stranger shall sojourn among you , and will keep the Passover unto the Lord , according to the ordinance of the Passover and according to the manner thereof , so shall he do . Ye shall have one ordinance , both for the stranger and for him that was born in the land. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	9	15	And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up , the cloud covered the tabernacle , namely , the tent of the testimony ; and at evening there was upon the tabernacle , as it were , the appearance of fire until the morning .
KJ21	Numbers	9	16	So it was always : the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night .
KJ21	Numbers	9	17	And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed ; and in the place where the cloud stood still , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
KJ21	Numbers	9	18	At the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel journeyed , and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched camp . As long as the cloud stayed upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents ;
KJ21	Numbers	9	19	and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days , then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord and journeyed not .
KJ21	Numbers	9	20	And so it was , when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle , according to the commandment of the Lord they stayed in their tents , and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed .
KJ21	Numbers	9	21	And so it was , when the cloud tarried from evening unto the morning , and the cloud was taken up in the morning , then they journeyed . Whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up , they journeyed .
KJ21	Numbers	9	22	Or whether it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle , remaining thereon , the children of Israel remained in their tents and journeyed not ; but when it was taken up , they journeyed .
KJ21	Numbers	9	23	At the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents , and at the commandment of the Lord they journeyed . They kept the charge of the Lord , at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
KJ21	Numbers	10	10	Also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days , and in the beginnings of your months , ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings , that they may be to you for a memorial before your God : I am the Lord your God. ”
KJ21	Numbers	10	2	“ Make thee two trumpets of silver . Of a whole piece shalt thou make them , that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps .
KJ21	Numbers	10	3	And when they shall blow with them , all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	10	4	And if they blow but with one trumpet , then the princes , who are heads of the thousands of Israel , shall gather themselves unto thee .
KJ21	Numbers	10	5	When ye blow an alarm , then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward .
KJ21	Numbers	10	6	When ye blow an alarm the second time , then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey . They shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
KJ21	Numbers	10	7	But when the congregation is to be gathered together , ye shall blow , but ye shall not sound an alarm .
KJ21	Numbers	10	8	And the sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow with the trumpets ; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations .
KJ21	Numbers	10	9	And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy who oppresseth you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets ; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God , and ye shall be saved from your enemies .
KJ21	Numbers	10	11	And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle of the testimony .
KJ21	Numbers	10	12	And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the Wilderness of Sinai , and the cloud rested in the Wilderness of Paran .
KJ21	Numbers	10	13	And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
KJ21	Numbers	10	14	In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies ; and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab .
KJ21	Numbers	10	15	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar .
KJ21	Numbers	10	16	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon .
KJ21	Numbers	10	17	And the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari moved forward , bearing the tabernacle .
KJ21	Numbers	10	18	And the standard of the camp of Reuben moved forward according to their armies ; and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur .
KJ21	Numbers	10	19	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai .
KJ21	Numbers	10	20	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel .
KJ21	Numbers	10	21	And the Kohathites moved forward , bearing the sanctuary ; and the others set up the tabernacle for when they came .
KJ21	Numbers	10	22	And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim moved forward according to their armies ; and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud .
KJ21	Numbers	10	23	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur .
KJ21	Numbers	10	24	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni .
KJ21	Numbers	10	25	And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan moved forward , which was the rearmost of all the camps throughout their hosts ; and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai .
KJ21	Numbers	10	26	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran .
KJ21	Numbers	10	27	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan .
KJ21	Numbers	10	28	Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies when they moved forward .
KJ21	Numbers	10	29	And Moses said unto Hobab , the son of Reuel the Midianite , Moses ’ father-in-law : “ We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord said , ‘ I will give it to you. ’ Come thou with us , and we will do thee good ; for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel. ”
KJ21	Numbers	10	30	And he said unto him , “ I will not go , but I will depart to mine own land and to my kindred. ”
KJ21	Numbers	10	31	And he said , “ Leave us not , I pray thee , inasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness , and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes .
KJ21	Numbers	10	32	And it shall be , if thou go with us , yea , it shall be that what goodness the Lord shall do unto us , the same will we do unto thee. ”
KJ21	Numbers	10	33	And they departed from the mount of the Lord three days ’ journey , and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days ’ journey to search out a resting place for them .
KJ21	Numbers	10	34	And the cloud of the Lord was upon them by day when they went out of the camp .
KJ21	Numbers	10	35	And it came to pass , when the ark moved forward , that Moses said , “ Rise up , Lord , and let Thine enemies be scattered ; and let them that hate Thee flee before Thee. ”
KJ21	Numbers	10	36	And when it rested he said , “ Return , O Lord , unto the many thousands of Israel . ”
KJ21	Numbers	11	11	And Moses said unto the Lord , “ Why hast Thou afflicted Thy servant ? And why have I not found favor in Thy sight , that Thou layest the burden of all this people upon me ?
KJ21	Numbers	11	2	And the people cried unto Moses ; and when Moses prayed unto the Lord , the fire was quenched .
KJ21	Numbers	11	3	And he called the name of the place Taberah [ that is , A burning ] , because the fire of the Lord burned among them .
KJ21	Numbers	11	4	And the mixed multitude that was among them fell to lusting . And the children of Israel also wept again and said , “ Who shall give us flesh to eat ?
KJ21	Numbers	11	5	We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt freely , the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlic ;
KJ21	Numbers	11	6	but our soul is dried away . There is nothing at all besides this manna before our eyes. ”
KJ21	Numbers	11	7	And the manna was as coriander seed , and the color thereof as the color of bdellium .
KJ21	Numbers	11	8	And the people went about and gathered it , and ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in pans and made cakes of it ; and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil .
KJ21	Numbers	11	9	And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night , the manna fell upon it .
KJ21	Numbers	11	10	Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent . And the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly ; Moses also was displeased .
KJ21	Numbers	11	12	Have I conceived all this people ? Have I begotten them , that Thou shouldest say unto me , ‘ Carry them in thy bosom , as a nursing father beareth the sucking child , unto the land which Thou swearest unto their fathers ’ ?
KJ21	Numbers	11	13	From whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people ? For they weep unto me , saying , ‘ Give us flesh , that we may eat. ’
KJ21	Numbers	11	14	I am not able to bear all this people alone , because it is too heavy for me .
KJ21	Numbers	11	15	And if Thou deal thus with me , kill me , I pray Thee , out of hand , if I have found favor in Thy sight ; and let me not see my wretchedness ! ”
KJ21	Numbers	11	16	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them ; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
KJ21	Numbers	11	17	And I will come down and talk with thee there . And I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thyself alone .
KJ21	Numbers	11	18	And say thou unto the people : ‘ Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow , and ye shall eat flesh . For ye have wept in the ears of the Lord , saying , “ Who shall give us flesh to eat ? For it was well with us in Egypt. ” Therefore the Lord will give you flesh , and ye shall eat .
KJ21	Numbers	11	19	Ye shall not eat one day , nor two days , nor five days , neither ten days , nor twenty days ,
KJ21	Numbers	11	20	but even a whole month , until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you , because ye have despised the Lord who is among you , and have wept before Him , saying , “ Why came we forth out of Egypt ? ” ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	11	21	And Moses said , “ The people among whom I am are six hundred thousand footmen ; and Thou hast said , ‘ I will give them flesh , that they may eat a whole month. ’
KJ21	Numbers	11	22	Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice them ? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	11	23	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Has the Lord ’ S hand waxed short ? Thou shalt see now whether My word shall come to pass unto thee or not. ”
KJ21	Numbers	11	24	And Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord , and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tabernacle .
KJ21	Numbers	11	25	And the Lord came down in a cloud and spoke unto him , and took of the Spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders ; and it came to pass that , when the Spirit rested upon them , they prophesied , and did not cease .
KJ21	Numbers	11	26	But there remained two of the men in the camp : the name of the one was Eldad , and the name of the other Medad . And the Spirit rested upon them ; and they were of those who were written , but went not out unto the tabernacle ; and they prophesied in the camp .
KJ21	Numbers	11	27	And there ran a young man and told Moses , and said , “ Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. ”
KJ21	Numbers	11	28	And Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of Moses , one of his young men , answered and said , “ My lord Moses , forbid them ! ”
KJ21	Numbers	11	29	And Moses said unto him , “ Enviest thou for my sake ? Would God that all the Lord ’ S people were prophets , and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them ! ”
KJ21	Numbers	11	30	And Moses got him into the camp , he and the elders of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	11	31	And there went forth a wind from the Lord , and brought quails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , as it were a day ’ s journey on this side , and as it were a day ’ s journey on the other side round about the camp , and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth .
KJ21	Numbers	11	32	And the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day , and they gathered the quails . He that gathered least gathered ten homers , and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
KJ21	Numbers	11	33	And while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ere it was chewed , the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people , and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague .
KJ21	Numbers	11	34	And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah [ that is , The graves of lust ] , because there they buried the people who lusted .
KJ21	Numbers	11	35	And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth , and abode at Hazeroth .
KJ21	Numbers	12	12	Let her not be as one dead , of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother ’ s womb. ”
KJ21	Numbers	12	2	And they said , “ Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses ? Hath He not spoken also by us ? ” And the Lord heard it .
KJ21	Numbers	12	3	( Now the man Moses was very meek , above all the men who were upon the face of the earth . )
KJ21	Numbers	12	4	And the Lord spoke suddenly unto Moses and unto Aaron and unto Miriam : “ Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. ” And the three came out .
KJ21	Numbers	12	5	And the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam ; and they both came forth .
KJ21	Numbers	12	6	And He said , “ Hear now My words : If there be a prophet among you , I , the Lord , will make Myself known unto him in a vision , and will speak unto him in a dream .
KJ21	Numbers	12	7	My servant Moses is not so , who is faithful in all Mine house .
KJ21	Numbers	12	8	With him will I speak mouth to mouth , even plainly , and not in dark speeches ; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold . Why then were ye not afraid to speak against My servant Moses ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	12	9	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them , and He departed .
KJ21	Numbers	12	10	And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle . And behold , Miriam became leprous , white as snow ; and Aaron looked upon Miriam , and behold , she was leprous .
KJ21	Numbers	12	11	And Aaron said unto Moses , “ Alas , my lord , I beseech thee , lay not the sin upon us , wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned .
KJ21	Numbers	12	13	And Moses cried unto the Lord , saying , “ Heal her now , O God , I beseech Thee. ”
KJ21	Numbers	12	14	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ If her father had but spit in her face , should she not be ashamed seven days ? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days , and after that let her be received in again. ”
KJ21	Numbers	12	15	And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days , and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again .
KJ21	Numbers	12	16	And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth and pitched camp in the Wilderness of Paran .
KJ21	Numbers	13	13	of the tribe of Asher , Sethur the son of Michael ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	2	“ Send thou men , that they may search the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel . Of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man , every one a ruler among them. ”
KJ21	Numbers	13	3	And Moses by the commandment of the Lord sent them from the Wilderness of Paran . All those men were heads of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	13	4	And these were their names : of the tribe of Reuben , Shammua the son of Zaccur ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	5	of the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat the son of Hori ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	6	of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	7	of the tribe of Issachar , Igal the son of Joseph ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	8	of the tribe of Ephraim , Hoshea the son of Nun ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	9	of the tribe of Benjamin , Palti the son of Raphu ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	10	of the tribe of Zebulun , Gaddiel the son of Sodi ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	11	of the tribe of Joseph , namely , of the tribe of Manasseh , Gaddi the son of Susi ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	12	of the tribe of Dan , Ammiel the son of Gemalli ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	14	of the tribe of Naphtali , Nahbi the son of Vophsi ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	15	of the tribe of Gad , Geuel the son of Machi .
KJ21	Numbers	13	16	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land . And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun , Joshua .
KJ21	Numbers	13	17	And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said unto them , “ Get you up this way southward , and go up into the mountain .
KJ21	Numbers	13	18	And see the land , what it is , and the people who dwelleth therein , whether they be strong or weak , few or many ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	19	and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad , and what cities they be that they dwell in , whether in tents or in strongholds ;
KJ21	Numbers	13	20	and what the land is , whether it be fat or lean , whether there be wood therein or not . And be ye of good courage , and bring of the fruit of the land. ” Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes .
KJ21	Numbers	13	21	So they went up and searched the land from the Wilderness of Zin unto Rehob , as men come to Hamath .
KJ21	Numbers	13	22	And they ascended by the south and came unto Hebron where Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were . ( Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
KJ21	Numbers	13	23	And they came unto the brook of Eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bore it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs .
KJ21	Numbers	13	24	The place was called the Brook Eshcol , because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence .
KJ21	Numbers	13	25	And they returned from searching of the land after forty days .
KJ21	Numbers	13	26	And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of Paran to Kadesh , and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation , and showed them the fruit of the land .
KJ21	Numbers	13	27	And they told him , and said , “ We came unto the land whither thou sentest us , and surely it floweth with milk and honey ; and this is the fruit of it .
KJ21	Numbers	13	28	Nevertheless the people are strong who dwell in the land , and the cities are walled and very great ; and moreover we saw the children of Anak there .
KJ21	Numbers	13	29	The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South ; and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites dwell in the mountains ; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of the Jordan. ”
KJ21	Numbers	13	30	And Caleb stilled the people before Moses , and said , “ Let us go up at once and possess it , for we are well able to overcome it. ”
KJ21	Numbers	13	31	But the men who went up with him said , “ We are not able to go up against the people , for they are stronger than we. ”
KJ21	Numbers	13	32	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel , saying , “ The land , through which we have gone to search it , is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof , and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature .
KJ21	Numbers	13	33	And there we saw the giants , the sons of Anak , who come of the giants . And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers , and so we were in their sight . ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	14	and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land ; for they have heard that Thou , Lord , art among this people , that Thou , Lord , art seen face to face , and that Thy cloud standeth over them , and that Thou goest before them by daytime in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by night .
KJ21	Numbers	14	2	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron ; and the whole congregation said unto them , “ Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! Or would God we had died in this wilderness !
KJ21	Numbers	14	3	And why hath the Lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword , that our wives and our children should be a prey ? Were it not better for us to return into Egypt ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	4	And they said one to another , “ Let us make a captain , and let us return into Egypt. ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	14	6	And Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , who were of those who searched the land , rent their clothes ;
KJ21	Numbers	14	7	and they spoke unto all the company of the children of Israel , saying , “ The land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land .
KJ21	Numbers	14	8	If the Lord delight in us , then He will bring us into this land and give it to us , a land which floweth with milk and honey .
KJ21	Numbers	14	9	Only rebel not ye against the Lord , neither fear ye the people of the land , for they are bread for us . Their defense has departed from them , and the Lord is with us . Fear them not. ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	10	But all the congregation bade stone them with stones . And the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	14	11	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ How long will this people provoke Me ? And how long will it be ere they believe Me for all the signs which I have shown among them ?
KJ21	Numbers	14	12	I will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them , and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they. ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	13	And Moses said unto the Lord , “ Then the Egyptians shall hear it ( for Thou broughtest up this people in Thy might from among them ) ,
KJ21	Numbers	14	15	Now if Thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nations which have heard the fame of Thee will speak , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	14	16	‘ Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore unto them , therefore He hath slain them in the wilderness. ’
KJ21	Numbers	14	17	And now , I beseech Thee , let the power of my Lord be great , according as Thou hast spoken , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	14	18	‘ The Lord is longsuffering and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. ’
KJ21	Numbers	14	19	Pardon , I beseech Thee , the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of Thy mercy , and as Thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now. ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	20	And the Lord said , “ I have pardoned according to thy word ;
KJ21	Numbers	14	21	but as truly as I live , all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	14	22	Because all those men who have seen My glory and My miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted Me now these ten times and have not hearkened to My voice—
KJ21	Numbers	14	23	surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers , neither shall any of those who provoked Me see it .
KJ21	Numbers	14	24	But My servant Caleb , because he had another spirit with him and hath followed Me fully , him will I bring into the land whereinto he went , and his seed shall possess it. ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	25	( Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley . ) “ Tomorrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea. ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	26	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	14	27	“ How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who murmur against Me ? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel , which they murmur against Me .
KJ21	Numbers	14	28	Say unto them , ‘ As truly as I live , saith the Lord , as ye have spoken in Mine ears , so will I do to you .
KJ21	Numbers	14	29	Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness ; and all who were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , who have murmured against Me ,
KJ21	Numbers	14	30	doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein , save Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun .
KJ21	Numbers	14	31	But your little ones , whom ye said should be a prey , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have despised .
KJ21	Numbers	14	32	But as for you , your carcasses , they shall fall in this wilderness .
KJ21	Numbers	14	33	And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years and bear your whoredoms , until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness .
KJ21	Numbers	14	34	After the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even forty days , for each day a year , shall ye bear your iniquities , even forty years , and ye shall know My altering of My purpose .
KJ21	Numbers	14	35	I , the Lord , have said : I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me . In this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	36	And the men , whom Moses sent to search the land , who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land ,
KJ21	Numbers	14	37	even those men who brought up the evil report upon the land , died by the plague before the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	14	38	But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , who were of the men who went to search the land , lived still .
KJ21	Numbers	14	39	And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel , and the people mourned greatly .
KJ21	Numbers	14	40	And they rose up early in the morning and got them up into the top of the mountain , saying , “ Lo , we are here , and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised ; for we have sinned. ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	41	And Moses said , “ Why now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord ? But it shall not prosper .
KJ21	Numbers	14	42	Go not up , for the Lord is not among you , that ye be not smitten before your enemies .
KJ21	Numbers	14	43	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword . Because ye have turned away from the Lord , therefore the Lord will not be with you. ”
KJ21	Numbers	14	44	But they presumed to go up unto the hilltop . Nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp .
KJ21	Numbers	14	45	Then the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites who dwelt in that hill , and smote them and discomfited them , even unto Hormah .
KJ21	Numbers	15	15	One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and also for the stranger who sojourneth with you , an ordinance for ever in your generations . As ye are , so shall the stranger be before the Lord :
KJ21	Numbers	15	2	“ Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them : ‘ When ye have come into the land of your habitations , which I give unto you ,
KJ21	Numbers	15	3	and will make an offering by fire unto the Lord , a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in your solemn feasts , to make a sweet savor unto the Lord of the herd or of the flock ,
KJ21	Numbers	15	4	then shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering of a tenth part of flour mingled with a fourth part of a hin of oil .
KJ21	Numbers	15	5	And a fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb .
KJ21	Numbers	15	6	Or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenths part of flour mingled with a third part of a hin of oil .
KJ21	Numbers	15	7	And for a drink offering thou shalt offer a third part of a hin of wine for a sweet savor unto the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	15	8	And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vow , or peace offerings unto the Lord ,
KJ21	Numbers	15	9	then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenths part of flour mingled with half a hin of oil .
KJ21	Numbers	15	10	And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	15	11	“ ‘ Thus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a lamb or a kid .
KJ21	Numbers	15	12	According to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every one according to their number .
KJ21	Numbers	15	13	All who are born of the country shall do these things in this manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	15	14	And if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto the Lord , as ye do , so he shall do .
KJ21	Numbers	15	16	one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourneth with you. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	15	17	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	15	18	“ Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them : ‘ When ye come into the land whither I bring you ,
KJ21	Numbers	15	19	then it shall be that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up a heave offering unto the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	15	20	Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for a heave offering ; as ye do the heave offering of the threshing floor , so shall ye heave it .
KJ21	Numbers	15	21	Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord a heave offering in your generations .
KJ21	Numbers	15	22	And if ye have erred and not observed all these commandments which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses—
KJ21	Numbers	15	23	even all that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses , from the day that the Lord commanded Moses and henceforward among your generations—
KJ21	Numbers	15	24	then it shall be , if aught be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation , that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savor unto the Lord with his meat offering and his drink offering , according to the ordinance , and one kid of the goats for a sin offering .
KJ21	Numbers	15	25	And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them , for it is ignorance ; and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord , and their sin offering before the Lord , for their ignorance .
KJ21	Numbers	15	26	And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel and the stranger who sojourneth among them , seeing all the people were in ignorance .
KJ21	Numbers	15	27	“ ‘ And if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a shegoat of the first year for a sin offering .
KJ21	Numbers	15	28	And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul who sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord , to make an atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
KJ21	Numbers	15	29	Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourneth among them .
KJ21	Numbers	15	30	But the soul who doeth aught presumptuously , whether he be born in the land or a stranger , the same reproacheth the Lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
KJ21	Numbers	15	31	Because he hath despised the word of the Lord and hath broken His commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off . His iniquity shall be upon him. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	15	32	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man who gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day .
KJ21	Numbers	15	33	And those who found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron and unto all the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	15	34	And they put him under guard , because it was not declared what should be done to him .
KJ21	Numbers	15	35	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ The man shall be surely put to death . All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp. ”
KJ21	Numbers	15	36	And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones , and he died , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Numbers	15	37	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	15	38	“ Speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue .
KJ21	Numbers	15	39	And it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them , and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a whoring ,
KJ21	Numbers	15	40	that ye may remember and do all My commandments , and be holy unto your God .
KJ21	Numbers	15	41	I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God : I am the Lord your God . ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	16	And Moses said unto Korah , “ Be thou and all thy company before the Lord , thou and they and Aaron , tomorrow .
KJ21	Numbers	16	2	and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel , two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly , famous in the congregation , men of renown .
KJ21	Numbers	16	3	And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron , and said unto them , “ Ye take too much upon you , seeing all the congregation are holy , every one of them , and the Lord is among them . Why then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	4	And when Moses heard it , he fell upon his face ;
KJ21	Numbers	16	5	and he spoke unto Korah and unto all his company , saying , “ Even tomorrow the Lord will show who are His and who is holy , and will cause him to come near unto Him . Even him whom He hath chosen will He cause to come near unto Him .
KJ21	Numbers	16	6	This do : Take you censers , Korah and all his company ,
KJ21	Numbers	16	7	and put fire therein and put incense in them before the Lord tomorrow . And it shall be that the man whom the Lord doth choose , he shall be holy . Ye take too much upon you , ye sons of Levi. ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	8	And Moses said unto Korah , “ Hear , I pray you , ye sons of Levi :
KJ21	Numbers	16	9	Seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to Himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them ?
KJ21	Numbers	16	10	And He hath brought thee near to Him , and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee . And seek ye the priesthood also ?
KJ21	Numbers	16	11	For this cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the Lord . And what is Aaron , that ye murmur against him ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , who said , “ We will not come up .
KJ21	Numbers	16	13	Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness , unless thou make thyself altogether a prince over us ?
KJ21	Numbers	16	14	Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards . Wilt thou put out the eyes of these men ? We will not come up ! ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	15	And Moses was very wroth , and said unto the Lord , “ Respect not Thou their offering . I have not taken one ass from them , neither have I hurt one of them. ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	17	And take every man his censer and put incense in them , and bring ye before the Lord every man his censer , two hundred and fifty censers , thou also and Aaron , each of you his censer. ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	18	And they took every man his censer and put fire in them and laid incense thereon , and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron .
KJ21	Numbers	16	19	And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation ; and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	16	20	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	16	21	“ Separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may consume them in a moment. ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	22	And they fell upon their faces , and said , “ O God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wilt Thou be wroth with all the congregation ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	23	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	16	24	“ Speak unto the congregation , saying , ‘ Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	25	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram , and the elders of Israel followed him .
KJ21	Numbers	16	26	And he spoke unto the congregation , saying , “ Depart , I pray you , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consumed in all their sins. ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	27	So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram on every side ; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives and their sons and their little children .
KJ21	Numbers	16	28	And Moses said , “ Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works , for I have not done them of mine own mind .
KJ21	Numbers	16	29	If these men die the common death of all men , or if they be visited according to the visitation of all men , then the Lord hath not sent me .
KJ21	Numbers	16	30	But if the Lord make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them , and they go down alive into the pit , then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord. ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	31	And it came to pass , as he had made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground cleaved asunder that was under them ;
KJ21	Numbers	16	32	and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up , and their houses and all the men who appertained unto Korah , and all their goods .
KJ21	Numbers	16	33	They and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit , and the earth closed upon them ; and they perished from among the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	16	34	And all Israel who were round about them fled at the cry of them , for they said , “ Lest the earth swallow us up also ! ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	35	And there came out a fire from the Lord , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense .
KJ21	Numbers	16	36	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	16	37	“ Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , that he take up the censers out of the burning , and scatter thou the fire yonder , for they are hallowed .
KJ21	Numbers	16	38	The censers of these sinners against their own souls , let them make them into broad plates for a covering of the altar ; for they offered them before the Lord . Therefore they are hallowed , and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel. ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	39	And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers , wherewith those who were burned had offered , and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar
KJ21	Numbers	16	40	to be a memorial unto the children of Israel , that no stranger , who is not of the seed of Aaron , come near to offer incense before the Lord ; that he be not as Korah and as his company , as the Lord said to him by the hand of Moses .
KJ21	Numbers	16	41	But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , “ Ye have killed the people of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	42	And it came to pass , when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation ; and behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of the Lord appeared .
KJ21	Numbers	16	43	And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	16	44	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	16	45	“ Get you up from among this congregation , that I may consume them as in a moment. ” And they fell upon their faces .
KJ21	Numbers	16	46	And Moses said unto Aaron , “ Take a censer and put fire therein from the altar , and put on incense , and go quickly unto the congregation and make an atonement for them . For there has wrath gone out from the Lord ; the plague has begun. ”
KJ21	Numbers	16	47	And Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and behold , the plague had begun among the people . And he put on incense , and made an atonement for the people .
KJ21	Numbers	16	48	And he stood between the dead and the living ; and the plague was stayed .
KJ21	Numbers	16	49	Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred , besides those who died in the matter of Korah .
KJ21	Numbers	16	50	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the plague was stayed .
KJ21	Numbers	17	17	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	17	2	“ Speak unto the children of Israel , and take from every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers , from all their princes according to the house of their fathers , twelve rods . Write thou every man ’ s name upon his rod .
KJ21	Numbers	17	3	And thou shalt write Aaron ’ s name upon the rod of Levi , for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers .
KJ21	Numbers	17	4	And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the Testimony , where I will meet with you .
KJ21	Numbers	17	5	And it shall come to pass that the man ’ s rod , whom I shall choose , shall blossom ; and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the children of Israel , whereby they murmur against you. ”
KJ21	Numbers	17	6	And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel , and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece , for each prince one according to their fathers ’ houses , even twelve rods ; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
KJ21	Numbers	17	7	And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness .
KJ21	Numbers	17	8	And it came to pass that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness ; and behold , the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded , and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds .
KJ21	Numbers	17	9	And Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all the children of Israel ; and they looked , and took every man his rod .
KJ21	Numbers	17	10	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Bring Aaron ’ s rod again before the Testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels ; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from Me , that they die not. ”
KJ21	Numbers	17	11	And Moses did so ; as the Lord commanded him , so did he .
KJ21	Numbers	17	12	And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses , saying , “ Behold , we die , we perish , we all perish !
KJ21	Numbers	17	13	Whosoever cometh anywhere near unto the tabernacle of the Lord shall die . Shall we be consumed with dying ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	18	18	And the flesh of them shall be thine , as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine .
KJ21	Numbers	18	2	And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee ; but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness .
KJ21	Numbers	18	3	And they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tabernacle ; only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
KJ21	Numbers	18	4	And they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle ; and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
KJ21	Numbers	18	5	And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar , that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	18	6	And I , behold , I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel . To you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	18	7	Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest ’ s office for every thing of the altar and within the veil ; and ye shall serve . I have given your priest ’ s office unto you as a service of gift , and the stranger who cometh nigh shall be put to death. ”
KJ21	Numbers	18	8	And the Lord spoke unto Aaron : “ Behold , I also have given thee the charge of Mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel . Unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing , and to thy sons , by an ordinance for ever .
KJ21	Numbers	18	9	This shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire : every oblation of theirs , every meat offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs , which they shall render unto Me , shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons .
KJ21	Numbers	18	10	In the most holy place shalt thou eat it ; every male shall eat it . It shall be holy unto thee .
KJ21	Numbers	18	11	And this is thine : the heave offering of their gift , with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel . I have given them unto thee , and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee , by a statute for ever ; every one who is clean in thy house shall eat of it .
KJ21	Numbers	18	12	All the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine and of the wheat , the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the Lord , them have I given thee .
KJ21	Numbers	18	13	And whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the Lord , shall be thine . Every one who is clean in thine house shall eat of it .
KJ21	Numbers	18	14	Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine .
KJ21	Numbers	18	15	Every thing that openeth the womb in all flesh , which they bring unto the Lord , whether it be of men or beasts , shall be thine . Nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem , and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem .
KJ21	Numbers	18	16	And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem , according to thine estimation , for the money of five shekels , according to the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahs .
KJ21	Numbers	18	17	But the firstling of a cow , or the firstling of a sheep , or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem . They are holy . Thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar , and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savor unto the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	18	19	All the heave offerings of the holy things , which the children of Israel offer unto the Lord , have I given thee , and thy sons and thy daughters with thee , by a statute for ever . It is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee. ”
KJ21	Numbers	18	20	And the Lord spoke unto Aaron , “ Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land , neither shalt thou have any part among them : I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	18	21	And behold , I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve , even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	18	22	Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation , lest they bear sin and die .
KJ21	Numbers	18	23	But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they shall bear their iniquity . It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
KJ21	Numbers	18	24	But the tithes of the children of Israel , which they offer as a heave offering unto the Lord , I have given to the Levites to inherit . Therefore I have said unto them : ‘ Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	18	25	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	18	26	“ Thus speak unto the Levites and say unto them : ‘ When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then ye shall offer up a heave offering of it for the Lord , even a tenth part of the tithe .
KJ21	Numbers	18	27	And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshing floor and as the fullness of the wine press .
KJ21	Numbers	18	28	Thus ye also shall offer a heave offering unto the Lord of all your tithes , which ye receive from the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the Lord ’ S heave offering to Aaron the priest .
KJ21	Numbers	18	29	Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the Lord of all the best thereof , even the hallowed part thereof out of it. ’
KJ21	Numbers	18	30	Therefore thou shalt say unto them : ‘ When ye have offered the best thereof from it , then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor and as the increase of the wine press .
KJ21	Numbers	18	31	And ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households , for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	18	32	And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it , when ye have offered from it the best of it ; neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel , lest ye die . ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	19	19	And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day ; and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at evening .
KJ21	Numbers	19	2	“ This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded , saying : ‘ Speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein is no blemish and upon which never came a yoke .
KJ21	Numbers	19	3	And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest , that he may bring her forth outside the camp , and one shall slay her before his face .
KJ21	Numbers	19	4	And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times .
KJ21	Numbers	19	5	And one shall burn the heifer in his sight : her skin and her flesh and her blood , with her dung , shall he burn .
KJ21	Numbers	19	6	And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
KJ21	Numbers	19	7	Then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water ; and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the evening .
KJ21	Numbers	19	8	And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the evening .
KJ21	Numbers	19	9	And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up outside the camp in a clean place , and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation : it is a purification for sin .
KJ21	Numbers	19	10	And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening . And it shall be unto the children of Israel , and unto the stranger who sojourneth among them , for a statute for ever .
KJ21	Numbers	19	11	“ ‘ He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days .
KJ21	Numbers	19	12	He shall purify himself with the water on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean ; but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
KJ21	Numbers	19	13	Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man who is dead and purifieth not himself , defileth the tabernacle of the Lord , and that soul shall be cut off from Israel . Because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him , he shall be unclean ; his uncleanness is yet upon him .
KJ21	Numbers	19	14	“ ‘ This is the law when a man dieth in a tent : All who come into the tent , and all who are in the tent , shall be unclean seven days .
KJ21	Numbers	19	15	And every open vessel , which hath no covering bound upon it , is unclean .
KJ21	Numbers	19	16	And whosoever toucheth one who is slain with a sword in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
KJ21	Numbers	19	17	And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin , and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel .
KJ21	Numbers	19	18	And a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water , and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons who were there , and upon him that touched a bone or one slain or one dead or a grave .
KJ21	Numbers	19	20	“ ‘ But the man who shall be unclean and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation , because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the Lord . The water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him : he is unclean .
KJ21	Numbers	19	21	And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until evening .
KJ21	Numbers	19	22	And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean , and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until evening . ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	20	20	And he said , “ Thou shalt not go through. ” And Edom came out against him with many people and with a strong hand .
KJ21	Numbers	20	2	And there was no water for the congregation , and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron .
KJ21	Numbers	20	3	And the people chided Moses and spoke , saying , “ Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord !
KJ21	Numbers	20	4	And why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness , that we and our cattle should die there ?
KJ21	Numbers	20	5	And why have ye made us to come up out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place ? It is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates ; neither is there any water to drink. ”
KJ21	Numbers	20	6	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they fell upon their faces ; and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them .
KJ21	Numbers	20	7	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	20	8	“ Take the rod , and gather thou the assembly together , thou and Aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes ; and it shall give forth his water , and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock : so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. ”
KJ21	Numbers	20	9	And Moses took the rod from before the Lord , as He commanded him .
KJ21	Numbers	20	10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock , and he said unto them : “ Hear now , ye rebels ! Must we fetch you water out of this rock ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	20	11	And Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice ; and the water came out abundantly , and the congregation drank , and their beasts also .
KJ21	Numbers	20	12	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron : “ Because ye believed Me not , to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. ”
KJ21	Numbers	20	13	This is the water of Meribah [ that is , Strife ] , because the children of Israel strove with the Lord , and He was sanctified in them .
KJ21	Numbers	20	14	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom : “ Thus saith thy brother Israel : ‘ Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us ,
KJ21	Numbers	20	15	how our fathers went down into Egypt , and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time ; and the Egyptians vexed us and our fathers .
KJ21	Numbers	20	16	And when we cried unto the Lord , He heard our voice and sent an angel , and hath brought us forth out of Egypt . And behold , we are in Kadesh , a city in the uttermost of thy border .
KJ21	Numbers	20	17	Let us pass , I pray thee , through thy country . We will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards , neither will we drink of the water of the wells . We will go by the king ’ s highway ; we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy borders. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	20	18	And Edom said unto him : “ Thou shalt not pass by me , lest I come out against thee with the sword. ”
KJ21	Numbers	20	19	And the children of Israel said unto him , “ We will go by the highway ; and if I and my cattle drink of thy water , then I will pay for it . I will only , without doing any thing else , go through on my feet. ”
KJ21	Numbers	20	21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border . Therefore Israel turned away from him .
KJ21	Numbers	20	22	And the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , journeyed from Kadesh and came unto Mount Hor .
KJ21	Numbers	20	23	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor , by the border of the land of Edom , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	20	24	“ Aaron shall be gathered unto his people ; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel , because ye rebelled against My word at the water of Meribah .
KJ21	Numbers	20	25	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up unto Mount Hor .
KJ21	Numbers	20	26	And strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son ; and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there. ”
KJ21	Numbers	20	27	And Moses did as the Lord commanded , and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	20	28	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son ; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount . And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount ;
KJ21	Numbers	20	29	and when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they mourned for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	21	21	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	21	2	And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord , and said , “ If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities. ”
KJ21	Numbers	21	3	And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites , and they utterly destroyed them and their cities . And he called the name of the place Hormah [ that is , Utter Destruction ] .
KJ21	Numbers	21	4	And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea to compass the land of Edom , and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way .
KJ21	Numbers	21	5	And the people spoke against God and against Moses : “ Why have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ? For there is no bread , neither is there any water ; and our soul loatheth this light bread. ”
KJ21	Numbers	21	6	And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people , and they bit the people ; and many people of Israel died .
KJ21	Numbers	21	7	Therefore the people came to Moses and said , “ We have sinned , for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee . Pray unto the Lord , that He take away the serpents from us. ” And Moses prayed for the people .
KJ21	Numbers	21	8	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Make thee a fiery serpent , and set it upon a pole . And it shall come to pass that every one who is bitten , when he looketh upon it , shall live. ”
KJ21	Numbers	21	9	And Moses made a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole ; and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived .
KJ21	Numbers	21	10	And the children of Israel went forward , and pitched camp in Oboth .
KJ21	Numbers	21	11	And they journeyed from Oboth , and pitched at Ijeabarim , in the wilderness which is before Moab toward the sunrising .
KJ21	Numbers	21	12	From thence they removed , and pitched camp in the Valley of Zered .
KJ21	Numbers	21	13	From thence they removed , and pitched on the other side of Arnon , which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the border of the Amorites ; for Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
KJ21	Numbers	21	14	Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lord what He did in the Red Sea , and in the brooks of Arnon ,
KJ21	Numbers	21	15	and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar and lieth upon the border of Moab .
KJ21	Numbers	21	16	And from thence they went to Beer . That is the well whereof the Lord spoke unto Moses : “ Gather the people together , and I will give them water. ”
KJ21	Numbers	21	17	Then Israel sang this song : “ Spring up , O well ! Sing ye unto it !
KJ21	Numbers	21	18	The princes dug the well ; the nobles of the people dug it by the direction of the lawgiver , with their staves. ” And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah ,
KJ21	Numbers	21	19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel , and from Nahaliel to Bamoth ,
KJ21	Numbers	21	20	and from Bamoth in the valley that is in the country of Moab to the top of Pisgah , which looketh toward Jeshimon .
KJ21	Numbers	21	22	“ Let me pass through thy land . We will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards ; we will not drink of the waters of the well , but we will go along by the king ’ s highway until we be past thy borders. ”
KJ21	Numbers	21	23	And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border . But Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness ; and he came to Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	21	24	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok , even unto the children of Ammon ; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
KJ21	Numbers	21	25	And Israel took all these cities ; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon , and in all the villages thereof .
KJ21	Numbers	21	26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto Arnon .
KJ21	Numbers	21	27	Therefore those who speak in proverbs say : “ Come into Heshbon ; let the city of Sihon be built and prepared .
KJ21	Numbers	21	28	For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sihon . It hath consumed Ar of Moab , and the lords of the high places of Arnon .
KJ21	Numbers	21	29	Woe to thee , Moab ! Thou art undone , O people of Chemosh ! He hath given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity , unto Sihon king of the Amorites .
KJ21	Numbers	21	30	We have shot at them ; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon . And we have laid them waste even unto Nophah , which reacheth unto Medeba. ”
KJ21	Numbers	21	31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites .
KJ21	Numbers	21	32	And Moses sent to spy out Jazer ; and they took the villages thereof , and drove out the Amorites who were there .
KJ21	Numbers	21	33	And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan ; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he and all his people , to the battle at Edrei .
KJ21	Numbers	21	34	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Fear him not , for I have delivered him into thy hand , and all his people and his land . And thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon. ”
KJ21	Numbers	21	35	So they smote him , and his sons and all his people , until there was none left him alive ; and they possessed his land .
KJ21	Numbers	22	22	And God ’ s anger was kindled because he went , and the angel of the Lord stood in the way as an adversary against him . Now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
KJ21	Numbers	22	2	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
KJ21	Numbers	22	3	And Moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many , and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	22	4	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian , “ Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. ” And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time .
KJ21	Numbers	22	5	He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor , which is by the river of the land of the children of his people , to call him , saying , “ Behold , there is a people come out from Egypt . Behold , they cover the face of the earth , and they abide over against me .
KJ21	Numbers	22	6	Come now therefore , I pray thee , curse for me this people ; for they are too mighty for me . Perhaps I shall prevail , that we may smite them , and that I may drive them out of the land ; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed , and he whom thou cursest is cursed. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand , and they came unto Balaam and spoke unto him the words of Balak .
KJ21	Numbers	22	8	And he said unto them , “ Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word back , as the Lord shall speak unto me. ” And the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam .
KJ21	Numbers	22	9	And God came unto Balaam and said , “ What men are these with thee ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	10	And Balaam said unto God , “ Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , hath sent unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	22	11	‘ Behold , there is a people come out of Egypt , who covereth the face of the earth . Come now , curse them for me . Perhaps I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	12	And God said unto Balaam , “ Thou shalt not go with them . Thou shalt not curse the people , for they are blessed. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	13	And Balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of Balak , “ Get you into your land , for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	14	And the princes of Moab rose up , and they went unto Balak and said , “ Balaam refuseth to come with us. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	15	And Balak sent yet again princes , more , and more honorable than they .
KJ21	Numbers	22	16	And they came to Balaam and said to him , “ Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor : ‘ Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me ;
KJ21	Numbers	22	17	for I will promote thee unto very great honor , and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me . Come therefore , I pray thee , curse for me this people. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	18	And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak , “ If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I can not go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more .
KJ21	Numbers	22	19	Now therefore , I pray you , tarry ye also here this night , that I may know what more the Lord will say unto me. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	20	And God came unto Balaam at night and said unto him , “ If the men come to call thee , rise up and go with them ; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	21	And Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass , and went with the princes of Moab .
KJ21	Numbers	22	23	And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand . And the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field , and Balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way .
KJ21	Numbers	22	24	But the angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards , a wall being on this side and a wall on that side .
KJ21	Numbers	22	25	And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed Balaam ’ s foot against the wall ; and he smote her again .
KJ21	Numbers	22	26	And the angel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
KJ21	Numbers	22	27	And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she fell down under Balaam ; and Balaam ’ s anger was kindled , and he smote the ass with a staff .
KJ21	Numbers	22	28	And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass , and she said unto Balaam , “ What have I done unto thee , that thou hast smitten me these three times ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	29	And Balaam said unto the ass , “ Because thou hast mocked me . I would there were a sword in mine hand , for now would I kill thee. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	30	And the ass said unto Balaam , “ Am not I thine ass , upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day ? Was I ever wont to do so unto thee ? ” And he said , “ Nay. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	31	Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand ; and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
KJ21	Numbers	22	32	And the angel of the Lord said unto him , “ Why hast thou smitten thine ass these three times ? Behold , I went out to withstand thee , because thy way is perverse before me .
KJ21	Numbers	22	33	And the ass saw me , and turned from me these three times . Unless she had turned from me , surely now also I would have slain thee and saved her alive. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	34	And Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord , “ I have sinned , for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me . Now therefore , if it displease thee , I will get me back again. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	35	And the angel of the Lord said unto Balaam , “ Go with the men ; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that shalt thou speak. ” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
KJ21	Numbers	22	36	And when Balak heard that Balaam had come , he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab , which is in the border of Arnon , which is in the utmost border .
KJ21	Numbers	22	37	And Balak said unto Balaam , “ Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee ? Why camest thou not unto me ? Am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	38	And Balaam said unto Balak , “ Lo , I have come unto thee . Have I now any power at all to say anything ? The word that God putteth in my mouth , that shall I speak. ”
KJ21	Numbers	22	39	And Balaam went with Balak , and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth .
KJ21	Numbers	22	40	And Balak offered oxen and sheep , and sent some to Balaam and to the princes who were with him .
KJ21	Numbers	22	41	And it came to pass on the morrow that Balak took Balaam and brought him up into the high places of Baal , that thence he might see the utmost part of the people .
KJ21	Numbers	23	23	Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob , neither is there any divination against Israel . According to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , ‘ What hath God wrought ! ’
KJ21	Numbers	23	2	And Balak did as Balaam had spoken , and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram .
KJ21	Numbers	23	3	And Balaam said unto Balak , “ Stand by thy burnt offering , and I will go . Perhaps the Lord will come to meet me , and whatsoever He showeth me I will tell thee. ” And he went to a high place .
KJ21	Numbers	23	4	And God met Balaam ; and he said unto Him , “ I have prepared seven altars , and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram. ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	5	And the Lord put a word in Balaam ’ s mouth and said , “ Return unto Balak , and thus thou shalt speak. ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	6	And he returned unto him , and lo , he stood by his burnt sacrifice , he and all the princes of Moab .
KJ21	Numbers	23	7	And he took up his parable and said : “ Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram , out of the mountains of the east , saying , ‘ Come , curse for me Jacob , and come , defy Israel. ’
KJ21	Numbers	23	8	How shall I curse whom God hath not cursed ? Or how shall I defy whom the Lord hath not defied ?
KJ21	Numbers	23	9	For from the top of the rocks I see him , and from the hills I behold him ; lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
KJ21	Numbers	23	10	Who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? Let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his ! ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	11	And Balak said unto Balaam , “ What hast thou done unto me ? I took thee to curse mine enemies , and behold , thou hast blessed them altogether. ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	12	And he answered and said , “ Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my mouth ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	13	And Balak said unto him , “ Come , I pray thee , with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them . Thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all ; and curse them for me from thence. ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	14	And he brought him into the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , and built seven altars , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar .
KJ21	Numbers	23	15	And he said unto Balak , “ Stand here by thy burnt offering while I meet the Lord yonder. ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	16	And the Lord met Balaam , and put a word in his mouth and said , “ Go again unto Balak , and say thus. ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	17	And when he came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . And Balak said unto him , “ What hath the Lord spoken ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	18	And he took up his parable and said : “ Rise up , Balak , and hear ; hearken unto me , thou son of Zippor .
KJ21	Numbers	23	19	God is not a man , that He should lie ; neither the son of man , that He should repent . Hath He said , and shall He not do it ? Or hath He spoken , and shall He not make it good ?
KJ21	Numbers	23	20	Behold , I have received commandment to bless ; and He hath blessed , and I can not reverse it .
KJ21	Numbers	23	21	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob , neither hath He seen perverseness in Israel ; the Lord his God is with him , and the shout of a King is among them .
KJ21	Numbers	23	22	God brought them out of Egypt ; he hath , as it were , the strength of a unicorn .
KJ21	Numbers	23	24	Behold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion ; he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain. ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	25	And Balak said unto Balaam , “ Neither curse them at all , nor bless them at all. ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	26	But Balaam answered and said unto Balak , “ Told not I thee , saying , ‘ All that the Lord speaketh , that I must do ’ ? ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	27	And Balak said unto Balaam , “ Come , I pray thee , I will bring thee unto another place . Perhaps it will please God that thou mayest curse them for me from thence. ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	28	And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor , that looketh toward Jeshimon .
KJ21	Numbers	23	29	And Balaam said unto Balak , “ Build me here seven altars , and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. ”
KJ21	Numbers	23	30	And Balak did as Balaam had said , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar .
KJ21	Numbers	24	24	And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim , and shall afflict Asshur , and shall afflict Eber , and he also shall perish for ever. ”
KJ21	Numbers	24	2	And Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes ; and the Spirit of God came upon him .
KJ21	Numbers	24	3	And he took up his parable and said : “ Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said ,
KJ21	Numbers	24	4	he hath said , who heard the words of God , who saw the vision of the Almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open :
KJ21	Numbers	24	5	How goodly are thy tents , O Jacob , and thy tabernacles , O Israel !
KJ21	Numbers	24	6	As the valleys are they spread forth , as gardens by the river ’ s side , as the trees of lignaloes which the Lord hath planted , and as cedar trees beside the waters .
KJ21	Numbers	24	7	He shall pour the water out of his buckets , and his seed shall be in many waters ; and his king shall be higher than Agag , and his kingdom shall be exalted .
KJ21	Numbers	24	8	God brought him forth out of Egypt ; he hath , as it were , the strength of a unicorn . He shall eat up the nations his enemies , and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows .
KJ21	Numbers	24	9	He couched , he lay down as a lion . And as a great lion , who shall stir him up ? Blessed is he that blesseth thee , and cursed is he that curseth thee. ”
KJ21	Numbers	24	10	And Balak ’ s anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together ; and Balak said unto Balaam , “ I called thee to curse mine enemies , and behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
KJ21	Numbers	24	11	Therefore now flee thou to thy place . I thought to promote thee unto great honor , but lo , the Lord hath kept thee back from honor. ”
KJ21	Numbers	24	12	And Balaam said unto Balak , “ Spoke I not also to thy messengers whom thou sentest unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	24	13	‘ If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I can not go beyond the commandment of the Lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind ; but what the Lord saith , that will I speak ’ ?
KJ21	Numbers	24	14	And now , behold , I go unto my people . Come therefore , and I will warn thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days. ”
KJ21	Numbers	24	15	And he took up his parable and said : “ Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said ,
KJ21	Numbers	24	16	he hath said , who heard the words of God , and knew the knowledge of the Most High , who saw the vision of the Almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open :
KJ21	Numbers	24	17	I shall see Him , but not now ; I shall behold Him , but not nigh . There shall come a Star out of Jacob , and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel , and shall smite the corners of Moab and destroy all the children of Sheth .
KJ21	Numbers	24	18	And Edom shall be a possession ; Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies , and Israel shall do valiantly .
KJ21	Numbers	24	19	Out of Jacob shall come He that shall have dominion , and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city. ”
KJ21	Numbers	24	20	And when he looked on Amalek , he took up his parable and said : “ Amalek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever. ”
KJ21	Numbers	24	21	And he looked on the Kenites , and took up his parable and said : “ Strong is thy dwelling place , and thou puttest thy nest in a rock .
KJ21	Numbers	24	22	Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted , until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. ”
KJ21	Numbers	24	23	And he took up his parable and said : “ Alas , who shall live when God doeth this !
KJ21	Numbers	24	25	And Balaam rose up , and went and returned to his place ; and Balak also went his way .
KJ21	Numbers	25	25	And Israel abode in Shittim , and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab .
KJ21	Numbers	25	2	And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods , and the people ate and bowed down to their gods .
KJ21	Numbers	25	3	And Israel joined himself unto Baal of Peor , and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	25	4	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the Lord against the sun , that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel. ”
KJ21	Numbers	25	5	And Moses said unto the judges of Israel , “ Slay ye every one his men who were joined unto Baal of Peor. ”
KJ21	Numbers	25	6	And behold , one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel , who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	25	7	And when Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand ;
KJ21	Numbers	25	8	and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through , the man of Israel and the woman through her belly . So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	25	9	And those who died in the plague were twenty and four thousand .
KJ21	Numbers	25	10	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	25	11	“ Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , hath turned My wrath away from the children of Israel , while he was zealous for My sake among them , that I consumed not the children of Israel in My jealousy .
KJ21	Numbers	25	12	Therefore say : ‘ Behold , I give unto him My covenant of peace .
KJ21	Numbers	25	13	And he shall have it , and his seed after him , even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood , because he was zealous for his God , and made an atonement for the children of Israel. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	25	14	Now the name of the Israelite who was slain , even who was slain with the Midianite woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites .
KJ21	Numbers	25	15	And the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur . He was head over a people and of a chief housein Midian .
KJ21	Numbers	25	16	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	25	17	“ Vex the Midianites and smite them .
KJ21	Numbers	25	18	For they vex you with their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi , the daughter of a prince of Midian , their sister , who was slain in the day of the plague for Peor ’ s sake . ”

KJ21	Numbers	26	2	“ Take the count of all the congregation of the children of Israel from twenty years old and upward throughout their father ’ s house , all who are able to go to war in Israel. ”
KJ21	Numbers	26	3	And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	26	4	“ Take the count of the people from twenty years old and upward , ” as the Lord commanded Moses and the children of Israel who went forth out of the land of Egypt .

KJ21	Numbers	26	10	And the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up together with Korah when that company died , the time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men ; and they became a sign .

KJ21	Numbers	27	20	And thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him , that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient .
KJ21	Numbers	27	21	And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall ask counsel for him by the judgment of the Urim before the Lord . At his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he and all the children of Israel with him , even all the congregation. ”

KJ21	Numbers	30	3	“ If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord , and bind herself by a bond , being in her father ’ s house in her youth ,
KJ21	Numbers	30	4	and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul , and her father shall hold his peace with her , then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand .
KJ21	Numbers	30	5	But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth , not any of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand ; and the Lord shall forgive her , because her father disallowed her .
KJ21	Numbers	30	6	And if she had a husband , when she vowed or uttered aught out of her lips wherewith she bound her soul ,
KJ21	Numbers	30	7	and her husband heard it and held his peace with her in the day that he heard it , then her vows shall stand , and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
KJ21	Numbers	30	8	But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it , then he shall make her vow which she vowed , and that which she uttered with her lips wherewith she bound her soul , of no effect ; and the Lord shall forgive her .
KJ21	Numbers	30	9	But every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced , wherewith they have bound their souls , shall stand against her .
KJ21	Numbers	30	10	And if she vowed in her husband ’ s house , or bound her soul by a bond with an oath ,
KJ21	Numbers	30	11	and her husband heard it and held his peace with her and disallowed her not , then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .

KJ21	Numbers	31	3	And Moses spoke unto the people , saying , “ Arm some of yourselves unto the war , and let them go against the Midianites and avenge the Lord on Midian .
KJ21	Numbers	31	4	From every tribe a thousand , throughout all the tribes of Israel , shall ye send to the war. ”
KJ21	Numbers	31	5	So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
KJ21	Numbers	31	6	And Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe — them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the war , with the holy instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
KJ21	Numbers	31	7	And they warred against the Midianites , as the Lord commanded Moses ; and they slew all the males .
KJ21	Numbers	31	8	And they slew the kings of Midian besides the rest of those who were slain , namely : Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , five kings of Midian . Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword .
KJ21	Numbers	31	9	And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captive , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods .
KJ21	Numbers	31	10	And they burned all their cities wherein they dwelt and all their goodly strongholds with fire .
KJ21	Numbers	31	11	And they took all the spoil and all the prey , both of men and of beasts .
KJ21	Numbers	31	12	And they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto Moses and Eleazar the priest , and unto the congregation of the children of Israel , unto the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by the Jordan near Jericho .
KJ21	Numbers	31	13	And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them outside the camp .
KJ21	Numbers	31	14	And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host , with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds , who came from the battle .
KJ21	Numbers	31	15	And Moses said unto them , “ Have ye saved all the women alive ?
KJ21	Numbers	31	16	Behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor , and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	31	17	Now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who hath known a man by lying with him .
KJ21	Numbers	31	18	But all the women children , who have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
KJ21	Numbers	31	19	And abide ye outside the camp seven days . Whosoever hath killed any person , and whosoever hath touched any slain , purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day .
KJ21	Numbers	31	20	And purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins , and all work of goats ’ hair , and all things made of wood. ”
KJ21	Numbers	31	21	And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war who went to the battle , “ This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses :
KJ21	Numbers	31	22	Only the gold , and the silver , the brass , the iron , the tin , and the lead ,
KJ21	Numbers	31	23	every thing that may abide the fire , ye shall make it go through the fire , and it shall be clean ; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation . And all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water .
KJ21	Numbers	31	24	And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean , and afterward ye shall come into the camp. ”
KJ21	Numbers	31	25	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	31	26	“ Take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of beast , thou and Eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation ;
KJ21	Numbers	31	27	and divide the prey into two parts , between those who took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the congregation .
KJ21	Numbers	31	28	And levy a tribute unto the Lord on the men of war who went out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the beeves , and of the asses , and of the sheep .
KJ21	Numbers	31	29	Take it from their half , and give it unto Eleazar the priest for a heave offering of the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	31	30	And of the children of Israel ’ s half , thou shalt take one portion of fifty , of the persons , of the beeves , of the asses , and of the flocks , of all manner of beasts , and give them unto the Levites , who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Numbers	31	32	And the booty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
KJ21	Numbers	31	33	and threescore and twelve thousand beeves ,
KJ21	Numbers	31	34	and threescore and one thousand asses ,
KJ21	Numbers	31	35	and thirty and two thousand persons in all , of women who had not known a man by lying with him .
KJ21	Numbers	31	36	And the half , which was the portion of those who went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep ;
KJ21	Numbers	31	37	and the Lord ’ S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen .
KJ21	Numbers	31	38	And the beeves were thirty and six thousand , of which the Lord ’ S tribute was threescore and twelve .
KJ21	Numbers	31	39	And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred , of which the Lord ’ S tribute was threescore and one .
KJ21	Numbers	31	40	And the persons were sixteen thousand , of which the Lord ’ S tribute was thirty and two persons .
KJ21	Numbers	31	41	And Moses gave the tribute which was the Lord ’ S heave offering unto Eleazar the priest , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Numbers	31	42	And of the children of Israel ’ s half , which Moses divided from the men who warred
KJ21	Numbers	31	43	( now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep ,
KJ21	Numbers	31	44	and thirty and six thousand beeves ,
KJ21	Numbers	31	45	and thirty thousand asses and five hundred ,
KJ21	Numbers	31	46	and sixteen thousand persons ) ,
KJ21	Numbers	31	47	even of the children of Israel ’ s half , Moses took one portion of fifty , both of man and of beast , and gave them unto the Levites , who kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Numbers	31	48	And the officers who were over thousands of the host , the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds , came near Moses ;
KJ21	Numbers	31	49	and they said unto Moses , “ Thy servants have taken the count of the men of war who are under our charge , and there lacketh not one man of us .
KJ21	Numbers	31	50	We have therefore brought an oblation for the Lord , what every man hath gotten , of jewels of gold , chains , and bracelets , rings , earrings , and tablets , to make an atonement for our souls before the Lord. ”
KJ21	Numbers	31	51	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them , even all wrought jewels .
KJ21	Numbers	31	52	And all the gold from the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels .
KJ21	Numbers	31	53	( For the men of war had taken spoil , every man for himself . )
KJ21	Numbers	31	54	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation for a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	32	32	We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan , that the possession of our inheritance on this side of the Jordan may be ours. ”
KJ21	Numbers	32	2	the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke unto Moses and to Eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	32	3	“ Ataroth , and Dibon , and Jazer , and Nimrah , and Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Shebam , and Nebo , and Beon ,
KJ21	Numbers	32	4	even the country which the Lord smote before the congregation of Israel , is a land for cattle , and thy servants have cattle. ”
KJ21	Numbers	32	5	Therefore , said they , “ If we have found grace in thy sight , let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession , and bring us not over the Jordan. ”
KJ21	Numbers	32	6	And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben , “ Shall your brethren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
KJ21	Numbers	32	7	And why discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them ?
KJ21	Numbers	32	8	Thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land .
KJ21	Numbers	32	9	For when they went up unto the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them .
KJ21	Numbers	32	10	And the Lord ’ S anger was kindled the same time , and He swore , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	32	11	‘ Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt , from twenty years old and upward , shall see the land which I swore unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , because they have not wholly followed Me ,
KJ21	Numbers	32	12	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun ; for they have wholly followed the Lord. ’
KJ21	Numbers	32	13	And the Lord ’ S anger was kindled against Israel , and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was consumed .
KJ21	Numbers	32	14	And behold , ye have risen up in your fathers ’ stead , an increase of sinful men , to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	32	15	For if ye turn away from after Him , He will yet again leave them in the wilderness , and ye shall destroy all this people. ”
KJ21	Numbers	32	16	And they came near unto him and said , “ We will build sheepfolds here for our flocks and cities for our little ones ,
KJ21	Numbers	32	17	but we ourselves will go ready and armed before the children of Israel until we have brought them unto their place ; and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
KJ21	Numbers	32	18	We will not return unto our houses until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance .
KJ21	Numbers	32	19	For we will not inherit with them on yonder side of the Jordan or forward , because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward. ”
KJ21	Numbers	32	20	And Moses said unto them , “ If ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the Lord to war ,
KJ21	Numbers	32	21	and will go all of you armed over the Jordan before the Lord , until He hath driven out His enemies from before Him
KJ21	Numbers	32	22	and the land be subdued before the Lord , then afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the Lord and before Israel , and this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
KJ21	Numbers	32	23	But if ye will not do so , behold , ye have sinned against the Lord ; and be sure your sin will find you out .
KJ21	Numbers	32	24	Build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep , and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. ”
KJ21	Numbers	32	25	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke unto Moses , saying , “ Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth .
KJ21	Numbers	32	26	Our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of Gilead ;
KJ21	Numbers	32	27	but thy servants will pass over , every man armed for war , before the Lord to battle , as my lord saith. ”
KJ21	Numbers	32	28	So concerning them , Moses commanded Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	32	29	And Moses said unto them , “ If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan , every man armed for battle before the Lord and the land shall be subdued before you , then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession .
KJ21	Numbers	32	30	But if they will not pass over with you armed , they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan. ”
KJ21	Numbers	32	31	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , “ As the Lord hath said unto thy servants , so will we do .
KJ21	Numbers	32	33	And Moses gave unto them , even to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land with the cities thereof in the borders , even the cities of the country round about .
KJ21	Numbers	32	34	And the children of Gad built Dibon , and Ataroth , and Aroer ,
KJ21	Numbers	32	35	and Atroth , Shophan , and Jazer , and Jogbehah ,
KJ21	Numbers	32	36	and Bethnimrah , and Bethharan , fortified cities , and folds for sheep .
KJ21	Numbers	32	37	And the children of Reuben built Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Kirjathaim ,
KJ21	Numbers	32	38	and Nebo , and Baalmeon ( their names being changed ) , and Shibmah , and gave other names unto the cities which they built .
KJ21	Numbers	32	39	And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it , and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it .
KJ21	Numbers	32	40	And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh , and he dwelt therein .
KJ21	Numbers	32	41	And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof , and called them Havothjair .
KJ21	Numbers	32	42	And Nobah went and took Kenath and the villages thereof , and called it Nobah , after his own name .
KJ21	Numbers	33	33	And they went from Horhagidgad and pitched in Jotbathah .

KJ21	Numbers	33	4	for the Egyptians buried all their firstborn , whom the Lord had smitten among them . Upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments .
KJ21	Numbers	33	5	And the children of Israel removed from Rameses and pitched camp in Succoth .
KJ21	Numbers	33	6	And they departed from Succoth and pitched in Etham , which is in the edge of the wilderness .

KJ21	Numbers	33	9	And they removed from Marah and came unto Elim ; and in Elim were twelve fountains of water and threescore and ten palm trees , and they pitched there .

KJ21	Numbers	33	39	And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died on Mount Hor .
KJ21	Numbers	33	40	And King Arad the Canaanite , who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .

KJ21	Numbers	33	48	And they departed from the mountains of Abarim and pitched in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho .
KJ21	Numbers	33	49	And they pitched by the Jordan , from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab .
KJ21	Numbers	33	50	And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	33	51	“ Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them : ‘ When ye have passed over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
KJ21	Numbers	33	52	then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their idols , and destroy all their molten images , and quite pluck down all their high places .
KJ21	Numbers	33	53	And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein , for I have given you the land to possess it .
KJ21	Numbers	33	54	And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families ; and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance , and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance . Every man ’ s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth , according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit .
KJ21	Numbers	33	55	But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you , then it shall come to pass that those who ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides , and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell .
KJ21	Numbers	33	56	Moreover it shall come to pass that I shall do unto you as I thought to do unto them . ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	34	34	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	34	2	“ Command the children of Israel , and say unto them : ‘ When ye come into the land of Canaan ( this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan with the borders thereof ) ,
KJ21	Numbers	34	3	then your south quarter shall be from the Wilderness of Zin along by the border of Edom ; and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the Salt Sea eastward .
KJ21	Numbers	34	4	And your border shall turn from the south to the Ascent of Akrabbim and pass on to Zin ; and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea , and shall go on to Hazaraddar and pass on to Azmon .
KJ21	Numbers	34	5	And the border shall pass around from Azmon unto the River of Egypt , and the limits of it shall be at the Sea .
KJ21	Numbers	34	6	“ ‘ And as for the western border , ye shall even have the Great Sea for a border . This shall be your west border .
KJ21	Numbers	34	7	“ ‘ And this shall be your north border : from the Great Sea ye shall designate for you Mount Hor ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	8	from Mount Hor ye shall designate your border unto the entrance of Hamath ; and the limits of the border shall be to Zedad ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	9	and the border shall go on to Ziphron , and the limits of it shall be at Hazarenan . This shall be your north border .
KJ21	Numbers	34	10	“ ‘ And ye shall designate your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	11	and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall descend and shall reach unto the side of the Sea of Chinnereth eastward ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	12	and the border shall go down to the Jordan , and the limits of it shall be at the Salt Sea . This shall be your land with the borders thereof round about. ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	34	13	And Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , “ This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot , which the Lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes and to the halftribe .
KJ21	Numbers	34	14	For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers , and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers , have received their inheritance ; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance .
KJ21	Numbers	34	15	The two tribes and the halftribe have received their inheritance on this side of the Jordan near Jericho eastward , toward the sunrising. ”
KJ21	Numbers	34	16	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	34	17	“ These are the names of the men who shall divide the land unto you : Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun .
KJ21	Numbers	34	18	And ye shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the land by inheritance .
KJ21	Numbers	34	19	And the names of the men are these : of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	20	and of the tribe of the children of Simeon , Shemuel the son of Ammihud ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	21	of the tribe of Benjamin , Elidad the son of Chislon ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	22	and the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan , Bukki the son of Jogli ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	23	the princes of the children of Joseph : for the tribe of the children of Manasseh , Hanniel the son of Ephod ,
KJ21	Numbers	34	24	and the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim , Kemuel the son of Shiphtan ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	25	and the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun , Elizaphan the son of Parnach ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	26	and the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar , Paltiel the son of Azzan ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	27	and the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher , Ahihud the son of Shelomi ;
KJ21	Numbers	34	28	and the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali , Pedahel the son of Ammihud. ”
KJ21	Numbers	34	29	These are they whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan .
KJ21	Numbers	35	35	And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	35	2	“ Command the children of Israel that they give unto the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them .
KJ21	Numbers	35	3	And the cities shall they have to dwell in , and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle and for their goods and for all their beasts .
KJ21	Numbers	35	4	And the suburbs of the cities , which ye shall give unto the Levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about .
KJ21	Numbers	35	5	And ye shall measure from outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits , and on the south side two thousand cubits , and on the west side two thousand cubits , and on the north side two thousand cubits ; and the city shall be in the midst . This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities .
KJ21	Numbers	35	6	And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge which ye shall appoint for the manslayer , that he may flee thither ; and to them ye shall add forty and two cities .
KJ21	Numbers	35	7	So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities ; these shall ye give with their suburbs .
KJ21	Numbers	35	8	And the cities which ye shall give shall be from the possession of the children of Israel . From those who have many ye shall give many , but from those who have few ye shall give few . Every one shall give from his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth. ”
KJ21	Numbers	35	9	And the Lord spoke unto Moses , saying ,
KJ21	Numbers	35	10	“ Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them : ‘ When ye have come over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
KJ21	Numbers	35	11	then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you , that the slayer may flee thither who killeth any person unawares .
KJ21	Numbers	35	12	And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger , that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation in judgment .
KJ21	Numbers	35	13	And of these cities which ye shall give , six cities shall ye have for refuge .
KJ21	Numbers	35	14	Ye shall give three cities on this side of the Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan , which shall be cities of refuge .
KJ21	Numbers	35	15	These six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them , that every one who killeth any person unawares may flee thither .
KJ21	Numbers	35	16	“ ‘ And if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
KJ21	Numbers	35	17	And if he smite him with throwing a stone wherewith he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
KJ21	Numbers	35	18	Or if he smite him with a hand weapon of wood wherewith he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
KJ21	Numbers	35	19	The avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer ; when he meeteth him , he shall slay him .
KJ21	Numbers	35	20	But if he thrust him out of hatred , or hurl at him by lying in wait so that he die ,
KJ21	Numbers	35	21	or in enmity smite him with his hand so that he die , he that smote him shall surely be put to death , for he is a murderer : the avenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him .
KJ21	Numbers	35	22	“ ‘ But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity , or have cast upon him anything without lying in wait ,
KJ21	Numbers	35	23	or with any stone wherewith a man may die , seeing him not and casting it upon him so that he die , and was not his enemy neither sought his harm ,
KJ21	Numbers	35	24	then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments .
KJ21	Numbers	35	25	And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood , and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge whither he had fled ; and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil .
KJ21	Numbers	35	26	But if the slayer shall at any time come outside the border of the city of his refuge whither he had fled ,
KJ21	Numbers	35	27	and the avenger of blood find him outside the borders of the city of his refuge , and the avenger of blood kill the slayer , he shall not be guilty of blood ,
KJ21	Numbers	35	28	because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest ; but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
KJ21	Numbers	35	29	“ ‘ So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
KJ21	Numbers	35	30	Whoso killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses ; but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
KJ21	Numbers	35	31	Moreover ye shall take no payment for the life of a murderer who is deserving of death , but he shall be surely put to death .
KJ21	Numbers	35	32	And ye shall take no payment for him that has fled to the city of his refuge , that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest .
KJ21	Numbers	35	33	So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are ; for blood defileth the land , and the land can not be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
KJ21	Numbers	35	34	Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit wherein I dwell ; for I , the Lord , dwell among the children of Israel . ’ ”
KJ21	Numbers	36	36	And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near and spoke before Moses and before the princes , the chief fathers of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Numbers	36	2	And they said , “ The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel , and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
KJ21	Numbers	36	3	And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel , then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers , and shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance .
KJ21	Numbers	36	4	And when the Jubilee of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. ”
KJ21	Numbers	36	5	And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord , saying , “ The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well .
KJ21	Numbers	36	6	This is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , ‘ Let them marry whom they think best ; only , within the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry. ’
KJ21	Numbers	36	7	So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe , for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
KJ21	Numbers	36	8	And every daughter who possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be the wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers .
KJ21	Numbers	36	9	Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe , but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance. ”
KJ21	Numbers	36	10	Even as the Lord commanded Moses , so did the daughters of Zelophehad ;
KJ21	Numbers	36	11	for Mahlal , Tirzah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Noah , the daughters of Zelophehad , were married unto their fathers ’ brothers ’ sons .
KJ21	Numbers	36	12	And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
KJ21	Numbers	36	13	These are the commandments and the judgments which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	1	These are the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness , in the plain opposite the Red Sea , between Paran , and Tophel , and Laban , and Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	2	( There are eleven days ’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea . )
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	3	And it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	4	after he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites , who dwelt in Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	5	On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this law , saying ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	6	“ The Lord our God spoke unto us in Horeb , saying : ’ Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	7	Turn you and take your journey , and go to the mount of the Amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto , in the plain , in the hills and in the vale , and in the South and by the seaside , to the land of the Canaanites and unto Lebanon , unto the great river , the River Euphrates .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	8	Behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give unto them and to their seed after them. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	9	“ And I spoke unto you at that time , saying , ‘ I am not able to bear you myself alone .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	10	The Lord your God hath multiplied you , and behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	11	( The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and bless you as He hath promised you ! )
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	12	How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	13	Take you wise men of understanding , and known among your tribes , and I will make them rulers over you. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	14	And ye answered me and said , ‘ The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	15	So I took the chief of your tribes , wise men and known , and made them heads over you , captains over thousands and captains over hundreds , and captains over fifties and captains over tens , and officers among your tribes .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	16	And I charged your judges at that time , saying , ‘ Hear the causes between your brethren , and judge righteously between every man and his brother and the stranger who is with him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	17	Ye shall not respect persons in judgment , but ye shall hear the small as well as the great . Ye shall not be afraid of the face of man , for the judgment is God ’ s . And the cause that is too hard for you , bring it unto me and I will hear it. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	18	And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	19	“ And when we departed from Horeb , we went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites , as the Lord our God commanded us ; and we came to Kadeshbarnea .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	20	And I said unto you , ‘ Ye have come unto the mountain of the Amorites , which the Lord our God doth give unto us .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	21	Behold , the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee . Go up and possess it , as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee ; fear not , neither be discouraged. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	22	“ And ye came near unto me , every one of you , and said , ‘ We will send men before us , and they shall search us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	23	And the saying pleased me well ; and I took twelve men of you , one from a tribe .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	24	And they turned and went up into the mountain , and came unto the Valley of Eshcol and searched it out .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	25	And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , ‘ It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	26	“ Notwithstanding , ye would not go up , but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	27	and ye murmured in your tents and said , ‘ Because the Lord hated us , He hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	28	Whither shall we go up ? Our brethren have discouraged our heart , saying , “ The people are greater and taller than we ; the cities are great and walled up to heaven , and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there. ” ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	29	Then I said unto you , ‘ Dread not , neither be afraid of them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	30	The Lord your God who goeth before you , He shall fight for you according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	31	and in the wilderness where thou hast seen how the Lord thy God bore thee , as a man doth bear his son , in all the way that ye went until ye came into this place. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	32	Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	33	who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents , in fire by night to show you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	34	“ And the Lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth , and swore , saying ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	35	‘ Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which I swore to give unto your fathers ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	36	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh ; he shall see it , and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon , and to his children , because he hath wholly followed the Lord. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	37	Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , saying , ‘ Thou also shalt not go in thither .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	38	But Joshua the son of Nun , who standeth before thee , he shall go in thither . Encourage him , for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	39	Moreover your little ones , who ye said should be a prey , and your children , who in that day had no knowledge between good and evil , they shall go in thither ; and unto them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	40	But as for you , turn you , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	41	“ Then ye answered and said unto me , ‘ We have sinned against the Lord . We will go up and fight , according to all that the Lord our God commanded us. ’ And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war , ye were ready to go up onto the hill .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	42	And the Lord said unto me , ‘ Say unto them : Go not up , neither fight , for I am not among you , lest ye be smitten before your enemies. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	43	So I spoke unto you , and ye would not hear , but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord , and went presumptuously up onto the hill .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	44	And the Amorites , who dwelt in that mountain , came out against you and chased you as bees do , and destroyed you in Seir , even unto Hormah .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	45	And ye returned and wept before the Lord ; but the Lord would not hearken to your voice , nor give ear unto you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	1	46	So ye abode in Kadesh many days , according unto the days that ye abode there .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	2	And the Lord spoke unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	3	‘ Ye have compassed this mountain long enough ; turn you northward .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	4	And command thou the people , saying , “ Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir ; and they shall be afraid of you . Take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	5	Meddle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth , because I have given Mount Seir unto Esau for a possession .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	6	Ye shall buy meat from them with money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water from them with money , that ye may drink .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	7	For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand . He knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness . These forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee ; thou hast lacked nothing. ” ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	8	And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau , who dwelt in Seir , through the way of the plain from Elath and from Eziongaber , we turned and passed by the way of the Wilderness of Moab .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	9	“ And the Lord said unto me , ‘ Distress not the Moabites , neither contend with them in battle ; for I will not give thee of their land for a possession , because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	10	( The Emim dwelt therein in times past , a people great and many and tall as the Anakim ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	11	who also were accounted giants , as the Anakim , but the Moabites call them Emim .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	12	The Horim also dwelt in Seir aforetime , but the children of Esau succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them , and dwelt in their stead , as Israel did unto the land of his possession which the Lord gave unto them . )
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	13	‘ Now rise up , ’ said I , ‘ and get you over the Brook Zered. ’ And we went over the Brook Zered .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	14	And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea until we had come over the Brook Zered was thirty and eight years , until all the generation of the men of war were wasted from among the host , as the Lord swore unto them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	15	For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them to destroy them from among the host until they were consumed .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	16	“ So it came to pass , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	17	that the Lord spoke unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	18	‘ Thou art to pass over through Ar , the border of Moab , this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	19	And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon , distress them not nor meddle with them ; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession , because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	20	( That also was accounted a land of giants . Giants dwelt therein in olden times ; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	21	a people great and many and tall , as the Anakim . But the Lord destroyed them before them ; and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	22	as He did to the children of Esau , who dwelt in Seir , when He destroyed the Horim from before them ; and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead even unto this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	23	And the Avim who dwelt in Hazerim , even unto Gaza , the Caphtorim , who came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them and dwelt in their stead . )
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	24	‘ Rise ye up , take your journey and pass over the River Arnon . Behold , I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land . Begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	25	This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations who are under the whole heaven , who shall hear report of thee , and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	26	“ And I sent messengers out of the Wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace , saying ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	27	‘ Let me pass through thy land . I will go along by the high way ; I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	28	Thou shalt sell me meat for money , that I may eat , and give me water for money , that I may drink . I will pass through only on my feet ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	29	as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did unto me , until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which the Lord our God giveth us. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him , for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate , that He might deliver him into thy hand , as appeareth this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	31	And the Lord said unto me , ‘ Behold , I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to thee : begin to possess , that thou mayest inherit his land. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	32	Then Sihon came out against us , he and all his people , to fight at Jahaz .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	33	And the Lord our God delivered him before us ; and we smote him , and his sons and all his people .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	34	And we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones of every city ; we left none to remain .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	35	Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	36	From Aroer , which is by the brink of the River of Arnon , and from the city that is by the river , even unto Gilead , there was not one city too strong for us ; the Lord our God delivered all unto us .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	2	37	Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not , nor unto any place of the River Jabbok , nor unto the cities in the mountains , nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbade us .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	3	So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also , the king of Bashan , and all his people ; and we smote him until none was left to him remaining .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	2	And the Lord said unto me , ‘ Fear him not ; for I will deliver him and all his people and his land into thy hand , and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	4	And we took all his cities at that time ; there was not a city which we took not from them : threescore cities , all the region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	5	All these cities were fortified with high walls , gates , and bars , besides unwalled towns a great many .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	6	And we utterly destroyed them , as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon , utterly destroying the men , women , and children of every city .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	7	But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a prey to ourselves .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	8	And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side of the Jordan , from the River of Arnon unto Mount Hermon
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	9	( which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion , and the Amorites call it Senir ) ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	10	all the cities of the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , unto Salchah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	11	For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron . ( Is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon ? ) Nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it , according to the cubit of a man .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	12	“ And this land , which we possessed at that time , from Aroer , which is by the River Arnon , and half Mount Gilead and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	13	And the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , being the kingdom of Og , gave I unto the halftribe of Manasseh : all the region of Argob , with all Bashan , which was called the land of giants .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	14	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the borders of Geshuri and Maachathi , and called them after his own name , Bashanhavothjair , unto this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	15	And I gave Gilead unto Machir .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	16	And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the River Arnon half the valley , and the border even unto the River Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	17	the plain also , and the Jordan and the border thereof , from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain , even the Salt Sea , under Pisgah eastward .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	18	“ And I commanded you at that time , saying , ‘ The Lord your God hath given you this land to possess it . Ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel , all who are meet for the war .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	19	But your wives and your little ones and your cattle ( for I know that ye have much cattle ) shall abide in your cities which I have given you ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	20	until the Lord shall have given rest unto your brethren as well as unto you , and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God hath given them beyond the Jordan ; and then shall ye return every man unto his possession which I have given you. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	21	And I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , ‘ Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings ; so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	22	Ye shall not fear them , for the Lord your God He shall fight for you. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	23	“ And I besought the Lord at that time , saying ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	24	‘ O Lord God , Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness and Thy mighty hand ; for what God is there in heaven or in earth who can do according to Thy works and according to Thy might ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	25	I pray Thee , let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan , that goodly mountain , and Lebanon. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	26	But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes , and would not hear me . And the Lord said unto me : ‘ Let it suffice thee : speak no more unto Me of this matter .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	27	Get thee up onto the top of Pisgah , and lift up thine eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward , and behold it with thine eyes ; for thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	28	But charge Joshua , and encourage him and strengthen him ; for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	3	29	So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	4	But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	2	Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you , neither shall ye diminish aught from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	3	Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baalpeor ; for all the men who followed Baalpeor , the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	5	Behold , I have taught you statutes and judgments , even as the Lord my God commanded me , that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	6	Keep therefore and do them ; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations who shall hear all these statutes , and say , ‘ Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	7	For what nation is there so great , who hath God so nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	8	And what nation is there so great , that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which I set before you this day ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	9	“ Only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently , lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen , and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life ; but teach them to thy sons and thy sons ’ sons ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	10	especially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb , when the Lord said unto me , ‘ Gather Me the people together , and I will make them hear My words , that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they shall live upon the earth , and that they may teach their children. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	11	And ye came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven , with darkness , clouds , and thick darkness .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	12	And the Lord spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire . Ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no similitude ; only ye heard a voice .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	13	And He declared unto you His covenant , which He commanded you to perform , even Ten Commandments ; and He wrote them upon two tablets of stone .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	14	And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	15	“ Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ( for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire ) ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	16	lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image : the similitude of any figure , the likeness of male or female ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	17	the likeness of any beast that is on the earth , the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	18	the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	19	and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven , and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars , even all the host of heaven , shouldest be driven to worship them and serve them , which the Lord thy God hath imparted unto all nations under the whole heaven .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	20	But the Lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to be unto Him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	21	Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , and swore that I should not go over the Jordan , and that I should not go in unto that good land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	22	But I must die in this land , I must not go over the Jordan ; but ye shall go over and possess that good land .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	23	Take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God which He made with you , and make yourselves a graven image or the likeness of any thing which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	24	For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire , even a jealous God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	25	“ When thou shalt beget children and children ’ s children , and ye shall have remained long in the land , and shall corrupt yourselves , and make a graven image or the likeness of any thing , and shall do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God to provoke Him to anger ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to possess it ; ye shall not prolong your days upon it , but shall utterly be destroyed .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	27	And the Lord shall scatter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen whither the Lord shall lead you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	28	And there ye shall serve gods , the work of men ’ s hands , wood and stone , which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	29	But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God , thou shalt find Him , if thou seek Him with all thy heart and with all thy soul .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	30	When thou art in tribulation and all these things have come upon thee , even in the latter days , if thou turn to the Lord thy God and shalt be obedient unto His voice
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	31	( for the Lord thy God is a merciful God ) , He will not forsake thee , neither destroy thee , nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which He swore unto them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	32	“ For ask now of the days that are past , which were before thee , since the day that God created man upon the earth , and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is , or hath been heard like it ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	33	Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as thou hast heard , and live ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	34	Or hath God deigned to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation by temptations , by signs , and by wonders , and by war , and by a mighty hand , and by a stretched out arm , and by great terrors , according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	35	Unto thee it was shown , that thou mightest know that the Lord He is God : there is none else besides Him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	36	Out of heaven He made thee to hear His voice , that He might instruct thee ; and upon earth He showed thee His great fire , and thou heardest His words out of the midst of the fire .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	37	And because He loved thy fathers , therefore He chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in His sight with His mighty power out of Egypt
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	38	to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art , to bring thee in , to give thee their land for an inheritance , as it is this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	39	Know therefore this day , and consider it in thine heart , that the Lord He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath : there is none else .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	40	Thou shalt keep therefore His statutes and His commandments which I command thee this day , that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth , which the Lord thy God giveth thee , for ever. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	41	Then Moses set apart three cities on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrising ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	42	that the slayer might flee thither who should kill his neighbor unawares , and hated him not in times past , and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	43	namely : Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country of the Reubenites , and Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites , and Golan in Bashan of the Manassites .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	44	And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	45	These are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which Moses spoke unto the children of Israel after they came forth out of Egypt ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	46	on this side of the Jordan in the valley opposite Bethpeor , in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon , whom Moses and the children of Israel smote after they had come forth out of Egypt .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	47	And they possessed his land and the land of Og king of Bashan , two kings of the Amorites , who were on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrising ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	48	from Aroer , which is by the bank of the River Arnon , even unto Mount Sion , which is Hermon ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	4	49	and all the plain on this side of the Jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the plain , under the springs of Pisgah .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	5	( I stood between the Lord and you at that time to show you the word of the Lord , for ye were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mount ) , saying :
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	2	The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	3	The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	4	The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	6	“ ‘ I am the Lord thy God , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	7	“ ‘ Thou shalt have no other gods before Me .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	8	Thou shalt not make thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the waters beneath the earth .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	9	Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them , nor serve them ; for I , the Lord thy God , am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	10	and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	11	“ ‘ Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain , for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	12	“ ‘ Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	13	Six days thou shalt labor and do all thy work ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	14	but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God : In it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , nor thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thine ox , nor thine ass , nor any of thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates , that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	15	And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt , and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm ; therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	16	“ ‘ Honor thy father and thy mother , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee , that thy days may be prolonged , and that it may go well with thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	17	“ ‘ Thou shalt not kill .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	18	“ ‘ Neither shalt thou commit adultery .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	19	“ ‘ Neither shalt thou steal .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	20	“ ‘ Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	21	“ ‘ Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor ’ s wife , neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor ’ s house , his field , or his manservant , or his maidservant , his ox , or his ass , or any thing that is thy neighbor ’ s. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	22	“ These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with a great voice ; and He added no more . And He wrote them on two tablets of stone , and delivered them unto me .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	23	And it came to pass , when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness ( for the mountain did burn with fire ) , that ye came near unto me , even all the heads of your tribes and your elders .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	24	And ye said , ‘ Behold , the Lord our God hath shown us His glory and His greatness , and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire . We have seen this day that God doth talk with man , and he liveth .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	25	Now therefore why should we die ? For this great fire will consume us ; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more , then we shall die .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	26	For who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	27	Go thou near and hear all that the Lord our God shall say ; and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee , and we will hear it and do it. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	28	“ And the Lord heard the voice of your words when ye spoke unto me ; and the Lord said unto me : ‘ I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken unto thee . They have well said all that they have spoken .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	29	O that there were such a heart in them , that they would fear Me and keep all My commandments always , that it might be well with them and with their children for ever !
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	30	Go , say to them , “ Get you into your tents again. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	31	But as for thee , stand thou here by Me , and I will speak unto thee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	32	“ Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded you ; ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	5	33	Ye shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	6	And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	2	that thou mightest fear the Lord thy God , to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son ’ s son , all the days of thy life , and that thy days may be prolonged .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	3	Hear therefore , O Israel , and observe to do it , that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase mightily , as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee , in the land that floweth with milk and honey .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	4	“ Hear , O Israel : The Lord our God is one Lord .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	5	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	7	and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children , and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way , and when thou liest down and when thou risest up .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	8	And thou shalt bind them as a sign upon thine hand , and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	9	And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	10	“ And it shall be , when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which He swore unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give thee great and goodly cities which thou built not ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	11	and houses full of all good things which thou filled not , and wells dug which thou dug not , vineyards and olive trees which thou planted not , when thou shalt have eaten and be full ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	12	then beware lest thou forget the Lord who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	13	Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God , and serve Him , and shalt swear by His name .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	14	Ye shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the people who are round about you
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	15	( for the Lord thy God is a jealous God among you ) , lest the anger of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	16	“ Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God , as ye tempted Him in Massah .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	17	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God , and His testimonies , and His statutes which He hath commanded thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	18	And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord , that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the Lord swore unto thy fathers ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	19	to cast out all thine enemies from before thee , as the Lord hath spoken .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	20	“ And when thy son asketh thee in time to come , saying , ‘ What mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the Lord our God hath commanded you ? ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	21	then thou shalt say unto thy son : ‘ We were Pharaoh ’ s bondmen in Egypt ; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	22	And the Lord showed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his household , before our eyes ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	23	and He brought us out from thence , that He might bring us in , to give us the land which He swore unto our fathers .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	24	And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes , to fear the Lord our God , for our good always , that He might preserve us alive , as it is at this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	6	25	And it shall be our righteousness , if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God , as He hath commanded us . ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	7	The Lord did not set His love upon you nor choose you because ye were more in number than any people , for ye were the fewest of all people ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	2	and when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee , thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them . Thou shalt make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	3	Neither shalt thou make marriages with them . Thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	4	for they will turn away thy son from following Me , that they may serve other gods . So will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you and destroy thee suddenly .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	5	But thus shall ye deal with them : ye shall destroy their altars , and break down their images , and cut down their Asherah poles , and burn their graven images with fire .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	6	“ For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God ; the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto Himself , above all people that are upon the face of the earth .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	8	but because the Lord loved you , and because He would keep the oath which He had sworn unto your fathers , hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	9	Know therefore that the Lord thy God , He is God , the faithful God , who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	10	and repayeth them that hate Him to their face , to destroy them . He will not be slack to him that hateth Him ; He will repay him to his face .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	11	Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which I command thee this day , to do them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	12	“ Therefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgments and keep and do them , that the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which He swore unto thy fathers .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	13	And He will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee ; He will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land , thy corn and thy wine and thine oil , the increase of thy cattle and the flocks of thy sheep , in the land which He swore unto thy fathers to give thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	14	Thou shalt be blessed above all people . There shall not be male or female barren among you or among your cattle .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	15	And the Lord will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee , but will lay them upon all those who hate thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	16	And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them ; neither shalt thou serve their gods , for that will be a snare unto thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	17	“ If thou shalt say in thine heart , ‘ These nations are more than I . How can I dispossess them ? ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	18	thou shalt not be afraid of them , but shalt well remember what the Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh and unto all Egypt—
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	19	the great temptations which thine eyes saw , and the signs , and the wonders , and the mighty hand , and the stretched out arm —whereby the Lord thy God brought thee out . So shall the Lord thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	20	Moreover the Lord thy God will send the hornet among them , until those who are left and hide themselves from thee be destroyed .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	21	Thou shalt not be frightened at them ; for the Lord thy God is among you , a mighty God and fearsome .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	22	And the Lord thy God will put out those nations before thee little by little ; thou mayest not consume them at once , lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	23	But the Lord thy God shall deliver them unto thee , and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	24	And He shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven . There shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	25	The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire . Thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be snared therein ; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	7	26	Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house , lest thou be a cursed thing like it ; but thou shalt utterly detest it , and thou shalt utterly abhor it , for it is a cursed thing .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	8	a land of wheat , and barley , and vines , and fig trees , and pomegranates , a land of olive oil , and honey ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	2	And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness , to humble thee and to prove thee , to know what was in thine heart , whether thou wouldest keep His commandments or not .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	3	And He humbled thee , and suffered thee to hunger , and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not , neither did thy fathers know , that He might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	4	Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee , neither did thy foot swell these forty years .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	5	Thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son , so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	6	Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in His ways and to fear Him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	7	For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land , a land of brooks of water , of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	9	a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness . Thou shalt not lack any thing in it ; a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	10	When thou hast eaten and art full , then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which He hath given thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	11	“ Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping His commandments and His judgments and His statutes which I command thee this day ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	12	lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	13	and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply , and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied , and all that thou hast is multiplied ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	14	then thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God , who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	15	who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness , wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought , where there was no water , who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	16	who fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not , that He might humble thee and that He might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	17	and thou say in thine heart , ‘ My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	18	But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God ; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth , that He may establish His covenant which He swore unto thy fathers , as it is this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	19	And it shall be , if thou at all forget the Lord thy God and walk after other gods , and serve them and worship them , I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	8	20	As the nations which the Lord destroyeth before your face , so shall ye perish , because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	9	When I had gone up into the mount to receive the tablets of stone , even the tablets of the covenant which the Lord made with you , then I abode on the mount forty days and forty nights ; I neither ate bread nor drank water .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	2	a people great and tall , the children of the Anakim , whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say , ‘ Who can stand before the children of Anak ! ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	3	Understand therefore this day that the Lord thy God is He who goeth over before thee as a consuming fire . He shall destroy them , and He shall bring them down before thy face : so shalt thou drive them out and destroy them quickly , as the Lord hath said unto thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	4	Speak not thou in thine heart , after the Lord thy God hath cast them out from before thee , saying , ‘ For my righteousness the Lord hath brought me in to possess this land ’ ; but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord doth drive them out from before thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	5	Not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart dost thou go to possess their land , but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee , and that He may perform the word which the Lord swore unto thy fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	6	“ Understand , therefore , that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness , for thou art a stiffnecked people .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	7	Remember , and forget not , how thou provoked the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness . From the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt until ye came unto this place , ye have been rebellious against the Lord .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	8	Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath , so that the Lord was so angry with you as to have destroyed you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	10	And the Lord delivered unto me two tablets of stone written with the finger of God , and on them was written according to all the words which the Lord spoke with you on the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	11	And it came to pass , at the end of forty days and forty nights , that the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone , even the tablets of the covenant .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	12	And the Lord said unto me , ‘ Arise , get thee down quickly from hence , for thy people whom thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves . They have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them : they have made them a molten image. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	13	“ Furthermore the Lord spoke unto me , saying , ‘ I have seen this people , and behold , it is a stiffnecked people .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	14	Let Me alone , that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven ; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	15	So I turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire ; and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	16	And I looked , and behold , ye had sinned against the Lord your God , and had made you a molten calf . Ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	17	And I took the two tablets , and cast them out of my two hands , and broke them before your eyes .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	18	And I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights as at the first ; I neither ate bread nor drank water , because of all your sins which ye sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord to provoke Him to anger .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	19	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith the Lord was wroth against you to destroy you . But the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	20	And the Lord was very angry with Aaron so as to have destroyed him , and I prayed for Aaron also the same time .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	21	And I took your sin , the calf which ye had made , and burned it with fire and stamped it and ground it very small , even until it was as small as dust ; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	22	“ And at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibrothhattaavah ye provoked the Lord to wrath .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	23	Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadeshbarnea , saying , ‘ Go up and possess the land which I have given you , ’ then ye rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God , and ye believed Him not nor hearkened to His voice .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	24	Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	25	“ Thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights , as I fell down at the first , because the Lord had said He would destroy you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	26	I prayed therefore unto the Lord , and said : ‘ O Lord God , destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance whom Thou hast redeemed through Thy greatness , whom Thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	27	Remember Thy servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness nor to their sin ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	28	lest the land whence Thou broughtest us out say , “ Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which He promised them , and because He hated them , He hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	9	29	Yet they are Thy people and Thine inheritance , whom Thou broughtest out by Thy mighty power and by Thy stretched out arm . ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	10	“ And I stayed on the mount , according to the first time , forty days and forty nights ; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also , and the Lord would not destroy thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	2	And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which thou didst break , and thou shalt put them in the ark. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	3	And I made an ark of shittim wood and hewed two tablets of stone like unto the first , and went up onto the mount , having the two tablets in mine hand .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	4	And He wrote on the tablets , according to the first writing , the Ten Commandments , which the Lord spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly ; and the Lord gave them unto me .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	5	And I turned myself and came down from the mount , and put the tablets in the ark which I had made ; and there they be , as the Lord commanded me. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	6	( And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera . There Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest ’ s office in his stead .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	7	From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah , and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah , a land of rivers of waters .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	8	At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord , to stand before the Lord to minister unto Him , and to bless in His name , unto this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	9	Therefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren ; the Lord is his inheritance , according as the Lord thy God promised him . )
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	11	And the Lord said unto me , ‘ Arise , take thy journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land which I swore unto their fathers to give unto them. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	12	“ And now , Israel , what doth the Lord thy God require of thee , but to fear the Lord thy God , to walk in all His ways , and to love Him , and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	13	to keep the commandments of the Lord and His statutes which I command thee this day for thy good ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	14	Behold , the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the Lord ’ S thy God , the earth also , with all that therein is .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	15	Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them ; and He chose their seed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	16	Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart , and be no more stiffnecked .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	17	For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords , a great God , a mighty and a fearsome , who regardeth not persons nor taketh reward .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	18	He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow , and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	19	Love ye therefore the stranger , for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	20	Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God ; Him shalt thou serve , and to Him shalt thou cleave and swear by His name .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	21	He is thy praise , and He is thy God , who hath done for thee these great and fearsome things which thine eyes have seen .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	10	22	Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons , and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	11	But the land , whither ye go to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys , and drinketh water of the rain of heaven ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	2	And know ye this day , for I speak not with your children , who have not known and who have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God , His greatness , His mighty hand , and His stretched out arm ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	3	and His miracles , and His acts , which He did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt and unto all His land ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	4	and what He did unto the army of Egypt , unto their horses and to their chariots : how He made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how the Lord hath destroyed them unto this day ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	5	and what He did unto you in the wilderness until ye came into this place ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	6	and what He did unto Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , the son of Reuben : how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up , and their households and their tents and all the substance that was in their possession , in the midst of all Israel—
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	7	but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which He did .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	8	“ Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land whither ye go to possess it ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	9	and that ye may prolong your days in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	10	For the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , is not as the land of Egypt from whence ye came out , where thou sowed thy seed and watered it with thy foot , as a garden of herbs .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	12	a land which the Lord thy God careth for . The eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	13	“ And it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	14	that ‘ I will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	15	And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle , that thou mayest eat and be full. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	16	Take heed to yourselves , that your heart be not deceived , and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	17	and then the Lord ’ S wrath be kindled against you , and He shut up the heaven , that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit , and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	18	“ Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul , and bind them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as frontlets between your eyes .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	19	And ye shall teach them to your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down and when thou risest up .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	20	And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine house and upon thy gates ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	21	that your days may be multiplied , and the days of your children , in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them , as the days of heaven upon the earth .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	22	For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you to do them — to love the Lord your God , to walk in all His ways , and to cleave unto Him—
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	23	then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you , and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	24	Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness and Lebanon , from the river , the River Euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea shall your borders be .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	25	There shall no man be able to stand before you ; for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as He hath said unto you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	26	“ Behold , I set before you this day a blessing and a curse :
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	27	a blessing , if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this day ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	28	and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods which ye have not known .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	29	And it shall come to pass , when the Lord thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon Mount Gerizim and the curse upon Mount Ebal .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	30	Are they not on the other side of the Jordan , by the way where the sun goeth down , in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal , beside the plains of Moreh ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	31	For ye shall pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you , and ye shall possess it and dwell therein .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	11	32	And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	12	And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God , ye , and your sons , and your daughters , and your menservants , and your maidservants , and the Levite who is within your gates , forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	2	Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	3	And ye shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their Asherah poles with fire ; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	4	Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	5	But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put His name there , even unto His habitation shall ye seek , and thither thou shalt come .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	6	And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and heave offerings of your hand , and your vows , and your freewill offerings , and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	7	And there ye shall eat before the Lord your God , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto , ye and your households , wherein the Lord thy God hath blessed thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	8	Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatsoever being right in his own eyes .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	9	For ye have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	10	But when ye go over the Jordan and dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit , and when He giveth you rest from all your enemies round about , so that ye dwell in safety ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	11	then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause His name to dwell there . Thither shall ye bring all that I command you : your burnt offerings and your sacrifices , your tithes and the heave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the Lord .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	13	Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	14	but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	15	“ Notwithstanding , thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after , according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which He hath given thee ; the unclean and the clean may eat thereof , as of the roebuck and as of the hart .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	16	Only ye shall not eat the blood ; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	17	Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn , or of thy wine , or of thy oil , or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock , nor any of thy vows which thou vowest , nor thy freewill offerings or heave offering of thine hand .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	18	But thou must eat them before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the Levite who is within thy gates ; and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	19	Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	20	“ When the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy border as He hath promised thee , and thou shalt say , ‘ I will eat flesh , ’ because thy soul longeth to eat flesh , thou mayest eat flesh , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	21	If the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to put His name there be too far from thee , then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which the Lord hath given thee , as I have commanded thee , and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	22	Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat them ; the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	23	Only be sure that thou eat not the blood ; for the blood is the life , and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	24	Thou shalt not eat it ; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	25	Thou shalt not eat it , that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	26	Only thy holy things which thou hast , and thy vows , thou shalt take and go unto the place which the Lord shall choose .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	27	And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the Lord thy God ; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the Lord thy God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	28	Observe and hear all these words which I command thee , that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee for ever , when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	29	“ When the Lord thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee whither thou goest to possess them , and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their land ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	30	take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them , after they are destroyed from before thee , and that thou inquire not after their gods , saying , ‘ How did these nations serve their gods ? Even so will I do likewise. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	31	Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God , for every abomination to the Lord which He hateth have they done unto their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters they have burned in the fire to their gods .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	12	32	“ What thing soever I command you , observe to do it . Thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	13	‘ Certain men , the children of Belial , have gone out from among you and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city , saying , “ Let us go and serve other gods , ” which ye have not known , ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	2	and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spoke unto thee , saying , ‘ Let us go after other gods which thou hast not known , and let us serve them , ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	3	thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams ; for the Lord your God is proving you to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	4	Ye shall walk after the Lord your God , and fear Him , and keep His commandments , and obey His voice , and ye shall serve Him and cleave unto Him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	5	And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death , because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in . So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	6	“ If thy brother , the son of thy mother , or thy son , or thy daughter , or the wife of thy bosom , or thy friend who is as thine own soul , entice thee secretly , saying , ‘ Let us go and serve other gods , ’ which thou hast not known , thou nor thy fathers
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	7	( namely , of the gods of the people which are round about you , nigh unto thee or far off from thee , from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth ) ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	8	thou shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him , neither shall thine eye pity him , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal him ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	9	but thou shalt surely kill him . Thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	10	And thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die , because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	11	And all Israel shall hear and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	12	“ If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities , which the Lord thy God hath given thee to dwell there , saying ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	14	then shalt thou inquire , and make a search and ask diligently ; and behold , if it be truth and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought among you ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	15	thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and the cattle thereof , with the edge of the sword .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	16	And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof , and shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof every whit for the Lord thy God . And it shall be a heap for ever ; it shall not be built again .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	17	And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand , that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger , and show thee mercy and have compassion upon thee and multiply thee , as He hath sworn unto thy fathers ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	13	18	when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God to keep all His commandments which I command thee this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	14	and every raven after his kind ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	2	For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God , and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto Himself above all the nations that are upon the earth .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	3	“ Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	4	These are the beasts which ye shall eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	5	the hart , and the roebuck , and the fallow deer , and the wild goat , and the pygarg , and the wild ox , and the chamois .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	6	And every beast that parteth the hoof and cleaveth the cleft into two claws and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	7	Nevertheless , these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the cloven hoof : the camel , and the hare , and the coney ; for they chew the cud , but divide not the hoof ; therefore they are unclean unto you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	8	And the swine , because it divideth the hoof , yet cheweth not the cud , it is unclean unto you ; ye shall not eat of their flesh , nor touch their dead carcasses .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	9	“ These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters : all that have fins and scales shall ye eat .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	10	And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat ; it is unclean unto you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	11	“ Of all clean birds ye shall eat .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	12	But these are they of which ye shall not eat : the eagle , and ossifrage , and the osprey ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	13	and the glede , and the kite , and the vulture after his kind ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	15	and the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	16	the little owl , and the great owl , and the swan ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	17	and the pelican , and the giereagle , and the cormorant ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	19	And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you : they shall not be eaten .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	20	But of all clean fowls ye may eat .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	21	“ Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself . Thou shalt give it unto the stranger who is in thy gates , that he may eat it , or thou mayest sell it unto an alien ; for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God . “ Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother ’ s milk .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	22	“ Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed that the field bringeth forth year by year .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	23	And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God , in the place which He shall choose to place His name there , the tithe of thy corn , of thy wine and of thine oil , and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks , that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	24	And if the way be too long for thee , so that thou art not able to carry it , or if the place be too far from thee which the Lord thy God shall choose to set His name there , when the Lord thy God hath blessed thee ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	25	then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God shall choose .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	26	And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after : for oxen , or for sheep , or for wine , or for strong drink , or for whatsoever thy soul desireth ; and thou shalt eat there before the Lord thy God , and thou shalt rejoice , thou and thine household .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	27	And the Levite that is within thy gates , thou shalt not forsake him , for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	28	“ At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	14	29	And the Levite ( because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee ) , and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , who are within thy gates , shall come and shall eat and be satisfied , that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt , and the Lord thy God redeemed thee : therefore I command thee this thing today .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	2	And this is the manner of the release : Every creditor who lendeth aught unto his neighbor shall release it . He shall not exact it from his neighbor or from his brother , because it is called the Lord ’ S release .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	3	From a foreigner thou mayest exact it again ; but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	4	save when there shall be no poor among you . For the Lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	5	only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	6	For the Lord thy God blesseth thee as He promised thee ; and thou shalt lend unto many nations , but thou shalt not borrow ; and thou shalt reign over many nations , but they shall not reign over thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	7	“ If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	8	but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	9	Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart , saying , ‘ The seventh year , the year of release , is at hand , ’ and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother and thou givest him nought , and he cry unto the Lord against thee , and it be sin unto thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	10	Thou shalt surely give him , and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him , because for this thing the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	11	for the poor shall never cease out of the land . Therefore I command thee , saying : ‘ Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy needy in thy land. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	12	“ And if thy brother , a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman , be sold unto thee and serve thee six years , then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	13	And when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	14	Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy wine press . From that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee , thou shalt give unto him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	16	And it shall be , if he say unto thee , ‘ I will not go away from thee , ’ because he loveth thee and thine house , because he is well with thee ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	17	then thou shalt take an awl and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	18	It shall not seem hard unto thee when thou sendest him away free from thee , for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee in serving thee six years ; and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	19	“ All the firstling males that come from thy herd and from thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the Lord thy God ; thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock , nor shear the firstling of thy sheep .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	20	Thou shalt eat it before the Lord thy God year by year inthe place which the Lord shall choose , thou and thy household .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	21	And if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame orblind or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	22	Thou shalt eat it within thy gates ; the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike , as the roebuck and as the hart .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	15	23	Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof ; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	16	Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which He shall choose : in the Feast of Unleavened Bread , and in the Feast of Weeks , and in the Feast of Tabernacles . And they shall not appear before the Lord empty ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	2	Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the Lord shall choose to place His name there .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	3	Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it . Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith , even the bread of affliction ; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste , that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	4	And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy borders seven days , neither shall there anything of the flesh , which thou sacrificed the first day at evening , remain all night until the morning .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	5	Thou mayest not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	6	but at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place His name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the Passover at evening , at the going down of the sun , at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	7	And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , and thou shalt turn in the morning and go unto thy tents .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	8	Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God . Thou shalt do no work therein .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	9	“ Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	10	And thou shalt keep the Feast of Weeks unto the Lord thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand , which thou shalt give unto the Lord thy God according as the Lord thy God hath blessed thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	11	And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God — thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the Levite who is within thy gates , and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , who are among you — in the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to place His name there .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	12	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt , and thou shalt observe and do these statutes .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	13	“ Thou shalt observe the Feast of Tabernacles seven days , after thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	14	and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the Levite , the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , who are within thy gates .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	15	Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose . Because the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase and in all the works of thine hands , therefore thou shalt surely rejoice .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	17	every man shall give as he is able , according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which He hath given thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	18	“ Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee , throughout thy tribes ; and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	19	Thou shalt not wrest judgment ; thou shalt not respect persons , neither take a bribe ; for a bribe doth blind the eyes of the wise and pervert the words of the righteous .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	20	That which is altogether just shalt thou follow , that thou mayest live and inherit the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	21	“ Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the Lord thy God which thou shalt make thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	16	22	Neither shalt thou set thee up any image , which the Lord thy God hateth .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	17	Neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart turn not away ; neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	2	“ If there be found among you , within any of thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee , man or woman who hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord thy God in transgressing His covenant ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	3	and hath gone and served other gods and worshiped them , either the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven , which I have not commanded ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	4	and it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it and inquired diligently , and behold , it be true and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought in Israel ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	5	then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman who has committed that wicked thing unto thy gates , even that man or that woman , and shalt stone them with stones till they die .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	6	At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is worthy of death be put to death , but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	7	The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hands of all the people . So thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	8	“ If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within thy gates , then shalt thou arise and get thee up into the place which the Lord thy God shall choose ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	9	and thou shalt come unto the priests , the Levites , and unto the judge who shall be in those days , and inquire ; and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	10	And thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall show thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	11	According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee , thou shalt do . Thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall show thee to the right hand nor to the left .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	12	And the man who will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest who standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die ; and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	13	And all the people shall hear , and fear , and do no more presumptuously .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	14	“ When thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee , and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , ‘ I will set a king over me like all the nations that are about me , ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	15	thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose . One from among thy brethren shalt thou set as king over thee ; thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , who is not thy brother .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	16	But he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt to the end that he should multiply horses , forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you , ‘ Ye shall henceforth return no more that way. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	18	“ And it shall be , when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book from that which is before the priests the Levites .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	19	And it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life , that he may learn to fear the Lord his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	17	20	that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren , and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left , to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he and his children , in the midst of Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	18	I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren like unto thee , and will put My words in His mouth ; and He shall speak unto them all that I shall command Him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	2	Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren ; the Lord is their inheritance , as He hath said unto them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	3	“ And this shall be the priest ’ s due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep ; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the maw .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	4	The firstfruit also of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the first of the fleece of thy sheep , shalt thou give him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	5	For the Lord thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes to stand to minister in the name of the Lord , him and his sons for ever .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	6	“ And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel where he sojourned , and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the Lord shall choose ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	7	then he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God as all his brethren the Levites do , who stand there before the Lord .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	8	They shall have like portions to eat , besides that which cometh from the sale of his patrimony .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	9	“ When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	10	There shall not be found among you any one who maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , or who useth divination , or an observer of times , or an enchanter , or a witch ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	11	or a charmer , or a consulter with familiar spirits , or a wizard , or a necromancer .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	12	For all who do these things are an abomination unto the Lord , and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	13	Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	14	For these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto observers of times and unto diviners ; but as for thee , the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	15	“ The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee , from thy brethren , like unto me . Unto Him ye shall hearken ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	16	according to all that thou desired of the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , ‘ Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	17	And the Lord said unto me : ‘ They have well spoken that which they have spoken .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	19	And it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto My words which He shall speak in My name , I will require it of him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	20	But the prophet who shall presume to speak a word in My name which I have not commanded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other gods , even that prophet shall die. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	21	And if thou say in thine heart , ‘ How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken ? ’ —
KJ21	Deuteronomy	18	22	when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord , if the thing follow not nor come to pass , that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken , but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously ; thou shalt not be afraid of him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	19	then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother ; so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	2	thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	3	Thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the borders of thy land , which the Lord thy God giveth thee to inherit , into three parts , that every slayer may flee thither .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	4	“ And this is the case of the slayer who shall flee thither , that he may live : Whoso killeth his neighbor ignorantly , whom he hated not in time past—
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	5	as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood , and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree , and the head slippeth from the helve and lighteth upon his neighbor , so that he die — he shall flee unto one of those cities and live ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	6	lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him , because the way is long , and slay him , whereas he was not worthy of death , inasmuch as he hated him not in time past .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	7	Therefore I command thee , saying , ‘ Thou shalt separate three cities for thee. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	8	And if the Lord thy God enlarge thy border , as He hath sworn unto thy fathers , and give thee all the land which He promised to give unto thy fathers ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	9	if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them , which I command thee this day — to love the Lord thy God and to walk ever in His ways — then shalt thou add three cities more for thee besides these three ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	10	that innocent blood be not shed in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	11	“ But if any man hate his neighbor , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him and smite him mortally , so that he die , and he fleeth into one of these cities ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	12	then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence , and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	13	Thine eye shall not pity him , but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	14	“ Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor ’ s landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	15	“ One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin , in any sin that he sinneth . By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be established .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	16	If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	17	then both the men involved in the controversy shall stand before the Lord , before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	18	and the judges shall make diligent inquisition . And behold , if the witness be a false witness and hath testified falsely against his brother ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	20	And those who remain shall hear and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	19	21	And thine eye shall not pity ; but life shall go for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	20	Only the trees which thou knowest are not trees for meat , thou shalt destroy and cut them down ; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee , until it be subdued .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	2	And it shall be , when ye have come nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	3	and shall say unto them , ‘ Hear , O Israel : Ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies . Let not your hearts faint ; fear not and do not tremble , neither be ye terrified because of them ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	5	And the officers shall speak unto the people , saying , ‘ What man is there who hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it ? Let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	6	And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yet eaten of it ? Let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	7	And what man is there who hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her ? Let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle and another man take her. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	8	And the officers shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , ‘ What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted ? Let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren ’ s heart faint as well as his heart. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	9	And it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people , that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	10	“ When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	11	And it shall be , if it make thee an answer of peace and open unto thee , then it shall be that all the people who are found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	12	And if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	13	And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	14	But the women and the little ones , and the cattle and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies which the Lord thy God hath given thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	15	Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	16	But of the cities of these people which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	17	but thou shalt utterly destroy them , namely : the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	18	that they teach you not to do according to all their abominations which they have done unto their gods , so ye should sin against the Lord your God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	20	19	“ When thou shalt besiege a city a long time , in making war against it to take it , thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an ax against them , for thou mayest eat of them ; and thou shalt not cut them down to employ them in the seige , for the tree of the field is man ’ s life .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	21	And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , so that he die . So shalt thou put evil away from among you , and all Israel shall hear and fear .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	2	then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth , and they shall measure the distance unto the cities which are round about him that is slain .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	3	And it shall be that the city which is next unto the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take a heifer which hath not been worked and which hath not drawn in the yoke ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	4	and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley , which is neither eared nor sown , and shall strike off the heifer ’ s neck there in the valley .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	5	And the priests , the sons of Levi , shall come near , for them the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister unto Him and to bless in the name of the Lord ; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	6	And all the elders of that city who are next unto the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	7	And they shall answer and say , ‘ Our hands have not shed this blood , neither have our eyes seen it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	8	Be merciful , O Lord , unto Thy people Israel , whom Thou hast redeemed , and lay not innocent blood unto Thy people of Israel ’ s charge. ’ And the blood shall be forgiven them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	9	So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	10	“ When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies , and the Lord thy God hath delivered them into thine hands and thou hast taken them captive ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	11	and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and hast a desire unto her , that thou wouldest have her for thy wife ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	12	then thou shalt bring her home to thine house . And she shall shave her head and pare her nails ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	13	and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her , and shall remain in thine house and bewail her father and her mother a full month . And after that thou shalt go in unto her and be her husband , and she shall be thy wife .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	14	And it shall be , if thou have no delight in her , then thou shalt let her go whither she will , but thou shalt not sell her at all for money ; thou shalt not make merchandise of her , because thou hast humbled her .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	15	“ If a man have two wives , one beloved and another hated , and they have borne him children , both the beloved and the hated , and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	16	then it shall be , when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated , who is indeed the firstborn .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	17	But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated as the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath , for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the firstborn is his .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	18	“ If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother , and who , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	19	then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city and unto the gate of his place .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	20	And they shall say unto the elders of his city , ‘ This , our son , is stubborn and rebellious ; he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton and a drunkard. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	22	“ And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he is to be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	21	23	his body shall not remain all night upon the tree , but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day ( for he that is hanged is accursed of God ) , that thy land be not defiled which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	22	“ If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman and the woman ; so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	2	And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee , or if thou know him not , then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house , and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it , and thou shalt restore it to him again .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	3	In like manner shalt thou do with his ass ; and so shalt thou do with his raiment and with all lost things of thy brother ’ s , which he hath lost and thou hast found , shalt thou do likewise ; thou mayest not hide thyself .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	4	Thou shalt not see thy brother ’ s ass or his ox fall down by the way , and hide thyself from them ; thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	5	“ The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman ’ s garment ; for all who do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	6	“ If a bird ’ s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree or on the ground , whether there be young ones or eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	7	but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go and take the young to thee , that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	8	“ When thou buildest a new house , then thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof , that thou bring not blood upon thine house if any man fall from thence .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	9	“ Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds , lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown and the fruit of thy vineyard be defiled .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	10	“ Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	11	“ Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts , as of woolen and linen together .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	12	“ Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture wherewith thou coverest thyself .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	13	“ If any man take a wife and go in unto her , and hate her ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	14	and give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an evil name upon her and say , ‘ I took this woman , and when I came to her I found her not a maid , ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	15	then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel ’ s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	16	And the damsel ’ s father shall say unto the elders , ‘ I gave my daughter unto this man for a wife , and he hateth her ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	17	and lo , he hath given occasions of speech against her , saying , “ I found not thy daughter a maid , ” and yet these are the tokens of my daughter ’ s virginity. ’ And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	18	And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	19	and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them unto the father of the damsel , because he hath brought an evil name upon a virgin of Israel . And she shall be his wife ; he may not put her away all his days .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	20	But if this thing be true , and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	21	then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father ’ s house , and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die , because she hath wrought folly in Israel , to play the whore in her father ’ s house ; so shalt thou put evil away from among you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	23	“ If a damsel who is a virgin be betrothed unto a husband , and a man find her in the city and lie with her ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	24	then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city , and ye shall stone them with stones , that they die — the damsel , because she cried not , being in the city , and the man , because he hath humbled his neighbor ’ s wife ; so thou shalt put away evil from among you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	25	“ But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field , and the man force her and lie with her , then the man only that lay with her shall die .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	26	But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death . For as when a man riseth against his neighbor and slayeth him , even so is this matter ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	27	for he found her in the field , and the betrothed damsel cried , and there was none to save her .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	28	“ If a man find a damsel who is a virgin who is not betrothed , and lay hold on her and lie with her , and they be found ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	29	then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel ’ s father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hath humbled her , he may not put her away all his days .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	22	30	“ A man shall not take his father ’ s wife , nor uncover his father ’ s skirt .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	23	That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform , even a freewill offering , according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy God , which thou hast promised with thy mouth .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	2	A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the Lord .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	3	An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord ; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the Lord for ever ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	4	because they met you not with bread and with water in the way when ye came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor , of Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	5	Nevertheless the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam , but the Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee , because the Lord thy God loved thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	6	Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	7	“ Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite , for he is thy brother . Thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian , because thou wast a stranger in his land .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	8	The children who are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the Lord in their third generation .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	9	“ When the host goeth forth against thine enemies , then keep thyself from every wicked thing .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	10	“ If there be among you any man that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night , then shall he go abroad out of the camp ; he shall not come within the camp .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	11	But it shall be , when evening cometh on , he shall wash himself with water ; and when the sun is down he shall come into the camp again .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	12	“ Thou shalt have a place also outside the camp whither thou shalt go forth abroad .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	13	And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon ; and it shall be , when thou wilt ease thyself abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	14	For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp to deliver thee and to give up thine enemies before thee ; therefore shall thy camp be holy , that He see no unclean thing in thee and turn away from thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	15	“ Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant who has escaped from his master unto thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	16	He shall dwell with thee , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates where it is good for him . Thou shalt not oppress him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	17	“ There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel , nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	18	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow , for even both these are abomination unto the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	19	“ Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother , interest of money , interest of victuals , interest of any thing that is lent upon interest .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	20	Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon interest , but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest , that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	21	“ When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God , thou shalt not be slack to pay it ; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee , and it would be sin in thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	22	But if thou shalt forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	24	“ When thou comest into thy neighbor ’ s vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes to thy fill at thine own pleasure , but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	23	25	When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbor , then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand , but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbor ’ s standing corn .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	24	“ When a man hath taken a wife and married her , and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes because he hath found some uncleanness in her , then let him write her a bill of divorcement , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	2	And when she has departed out of his house , she may go and be another man ’ s wife .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	3	And if the latter husband hate her and write her a bill of divorcement , and putteth it in her hand and sendeth her out of his house , or if the latter husband die who took her to be his wife ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	4	her former husband who sent her away may not take her again to be his wife after she is defiled ; for that is abomination before the Lord , and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	5	“ When a man hath taken a new wife , he shall not go out to war , neither shall he be charged with any business ; but he shall be free at home one year , and shall cheer up his wife whom he hath taken .

KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	7	“ If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel , and maketh merchandise of him or selleth him , then that thief shall die ; and thou shalt put evil away from among you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	8	“ Take heed in the plague of leprosy , that thou observe diligently and do according to all that the priests , the Levites , shall teach you ; as I commanded them , so ye shall observe to do .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	9	Remember what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam on the way after ye had come forth out of Egypt .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	10	“ When thou dost lend thy brother any thing , thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	11	Thou shalt stand abroad , and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	12	And if the man be poor , thou shalt not sleep with his pledge .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	13	In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment and bless thee ; and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	14	“ Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy , whether he be of thy brethren or of thy strangers who are in thy land within thy gates .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	15	At his day thou shalt give him his hire , neither shall the sun go down upon it ; for he is poor and setteth his heart upon it , lest he cry against thee unto the Lord , and it be sin unto thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	16	“ The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	17	“ Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger nor of the fatherless , nor take a widow ’ s raiment in pledge ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	18	but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt , and the Lord thy God redeemed thee thence . Therefore I command thee to do this thing .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	19	“ When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field and hast forgotten a sheaf in the field , thou shalt not go again to fetch it ; it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow , that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	20	When thou beatest thine olive tree , thou shalt not go over the boughs again ; it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	21	When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward ; it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	24	22	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt . Therefore I command thee to do this thing .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	25	“ If there be a controversy between men and they come unto judgment , that the judges may judge them , then they shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	2	And it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	3	Forty stripes he may give him , and no more , lest , if he should exceed and beat him above these with many stripes , then thy brother should seem vile unto thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	4	“ Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	5	“ If brethren dwell together , and one of them die and have no child , the wife of the dead shall not marry outside unto a stranger ; her husband ’ s brother shall go in unto her , and take her to him for a wife , and perform the duty of a husband ’ s brother unto her .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	6	And it shall be that the firstborn whom she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	7	And if the man like not to take his brother ’ s wife , then let his brother ’ s wife go up to the gate unto the elders , and say , ‘ My husband ’ s brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel . He will not perform the duty of my husband ’ s brother. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	8	Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak unto him ; and if he stand by it and say , ‘ I like not to take her , ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	9	then shall his brother ’ s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders , and loose his shoe from off his foot , and spit in his face , and shall answer and say , ‘ So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother ’ s house. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	10	And his name shall be called in Israel , ‘ The house of him that hath his shoe loosed. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	11	“ When men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draweth near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him , and putteth forth her hand and taketh him by the secret parts ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	12	then thou shalt cut off her hand ; thine eye shall not pity her .

KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	14	Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures , a great and a small .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	15	But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight , a perfect and just measure shalt thou have , that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	16	For all who do such things and all who do unrighteously are an abomination unto the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	17	“ Remember what Amalek did unto thee on the way , when ye had come forth out of Egypt ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	18	how he met thee on the way and smote the hindmost of thee , even all who were feeble behind thee , when thou wast faint and weary ; and he feared not God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	25	19	Therefore it shall be , when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about , in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it , that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven ; thou shalt not forget it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	26	“ And it shall be , when thou art come in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and possessest it and dwellest therein ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	2	that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth , which thou shalt bring from thy land that the Lord thy God giveth thee , and shalt put it in a basket and shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place His name there .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	3	And thou shalt go unto the priest who shall be in those days , and say unto him , ‘ I profess this day unto the Lord thy God , that I have come unto the country which the Lord swore unto our fathers to give us. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	4	And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand , and set it down before the altar of the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	5	“ And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God : ‘ A Syrian ready to perish was my father ; and he went down into Egypt and sojourned there with a few , and became there a nation , great , mighty , and populous .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	6	And the Egyptians evilly treated us and afflicted us , and laid upon us hard bondage .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	7	And when we cried unto the Lord God of our fathers , the Lord heard our voice , and looked on our affliction and our labor and our oppression .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	8	And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great fearsomeness , and with signs and with wonders ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	9	and He hath brought us into this place and hath given us this land , even a land that floweth with milk and honey .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	10	And now , behold , I have brought the firstfruits of the land which Thou , O Lord , hast given me. ’ And thou shalt set it before the Lord thy God , and worship before the Lord thy God ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	11	and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee and unto thine house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger who is among you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	12	“ When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year , which is the year of tithing , and hast given it unto the Levite , the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , that they may eat within thy gates and be filled ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	13	then thou shalt say before the Lord thy God : ‘ I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house , and also have given them unto the Levite and unto the stranger , to the fatherless , and to the widow , according to all Thy commandments which Thou hast commanded me . I have not transgressed Thy commandments , neither have I forgotten them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	14	I have not eaten thereof in my mourning , neither have I taken away aught thereof for any unclean use , nor given aught thereof for the dead ; but I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my God and have done according to all that Thou hast commanded me .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	15	Look down from Thy holy habitation , from heaven , and bless Thy people Israel and the land which Thou hast given us as Thou swore unto our fathers , a land that floweth with milk and honey. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	16	“ This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments ; thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart and with all thy soul .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	17	Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God , and to walk in His ways , and to keep His statutes and His commandments and His judgments , and to hearken unto His voice .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	18	And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be His peculiar people , as He hath promised thee , and that thou shouldest keep all His commandments ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	26	19	and to make thee high above all nations which He hath made in praise and in name and in honor , and that thou mayest be a holy people unto the Lord thy God , as He hath spoken . ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	27	And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people , saying , “ Keep all the commandments which I command you this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	2	And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over the Jordan unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaster them with plaster .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	3	And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when thou art passed over , that thou mayest go in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee , a land that floweth with milk and honey , as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	4	Therefore it shall be when ye have gone over the Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , on Mount Ebal , and thou shalt plaster them with plaster .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	5	And there shalt thou build an altar unto the Lord thy God , an altar of stones . Thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	6	Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of whole stones , and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	7	And thou shalt offer peace offerings , and shalt eat there , and rejoice before the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	8	And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	9	And Moses and the priests , the Levites , spoke unto all Israel , saying , “ Take heed and hearken , O Israel : This day thou art become the people of the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	10	Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord thy God , and do His commandments and His statutes which I command thee this day. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	11	And Moses charged the people the same day , saying ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	12	“ These shall stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people when ye have come over the Jordan : Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Joseph , and Benjamin .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	13	And these shall stand upon Mount Ebal to curse : Reuben , Gad , and Asher , and Zebulun , Dan , and Naphtali .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	14	And the Levites shall speak , and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice :
KJ21	Deuteronomy	27	15	“ ‘ Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image , an abomination unto the Lord , the work of the hands of the craftsman , and putteth it in a secret place. ’ And all the people shall answer and say , ‘ Amen. ’

KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	28	The Lord shall smite thee with madness , and blindness , and astonishment of heart ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	2	and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God :
KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	3	“ Blessed shalt thou be in the city , and blessed shalt thou be in the field .

KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	60	Moreover He will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt which thou wast afraid of , and they shall cleave unto thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	61	Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law , them will the Lord bring upon thee until thou be destroyed .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	62	And ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude , because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	63	“ And it shall come to pass that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you , so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you and to bring you to nought ; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	64	And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other gods , which neither thou nor thy fathers have known , even wood and stone .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	65	And among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest ; but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart and failing of eyes and sorrow of mind .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	66	And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee ; and thou shalt fear day and night , and shalt have no assurance of thy life .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	67	In the morning thou shalt say , ‘ Would God it were evening ! ’ and at evening thou shalt say , ‘ Would God it were morning ! ’ for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	28	68	And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships by the way whereof I spoke unto thee , ‘ Thou shalt see it no more again. ’ And there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen , and no man shall buy you . ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	29	“ The secret things belong unto the Lord our God ; but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever , that we may do all the words of this law .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	2	And Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them , “ Ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	3	the great temptations which thine eyes have seen , the signs , and those great miracles .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	4	Yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	5	And I have led you forty years in the wilderness . Your clothes have not waxed old upon you , and thy shoe has not waxed old upon thy foot .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	6	Ye have not eaten bread , neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink , that ye might know that I am the Lord your God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	7	And when ye came unto this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us unto battle , and we smote them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	8	And we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the halftribe of Manasseh .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	9	Keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them , that ye may prosper in all that ye do .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	10	“ Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God— your captains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	11	your little ones , your wives , and thy stranger that is in thy camp , from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water—
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	12	that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the Lord thy God , and into His oath , which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	13	that He may establish thee today for a people unto Himself , and that He may be unto thee a God , as He hath said unto thee and as He hath sworn unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	14	“ Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	15	but with him that standeth here with us this day before the Lord our God , and also with him that is not here with us this day
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	16	( for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt , and how we came through the nations which ye passed by ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	17	and ye have seen their abominations and their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them ) ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	18	lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe , whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God to go and serve the gods of these nations , lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	19	and it come to pass , when he heareth the words of this curse , that he bless himself in his heart , saying , ‘ I shall have peace , though I walk in the imagination of mine heart ’ —to add drunkenness to thirst .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	20	The Lord will not spare him , but then the anger of the Lord and His jealousy shall smoke against that man , and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him , and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	21	And the Lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Law ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	22	so that the generation to come of your children who shall rise up after you , and the stranger who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the Lord hath laid upon it ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	23	and that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning , that it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein , like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboiim , which the Lord overthrew in His anger and in His wrath—
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	24	even all nations shall say , ‘ Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land ? What meaneth the heat of this great anger ? ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	25	Then men shall say , ‘ Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers , which He made with them when He brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	26	for they went and served other gods and worshiped them , gods whom they knew not and whom He had not given unto them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	27	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land , to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	29	28	and the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	30	“ And it shall come to pass , when all these things have come upon thee , the blessing and the curse which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	2	and shalt return unto the Lord thy God and shalt obey His voice according to all that I command thee this day , thou and thy children , with all thine heart and with all thy soul ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	3	that then the Lord thy God will return thee from captivity and have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	4	If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven , from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee , and from thence will He fetch thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	5	And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and He will do thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	6	And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of thy seed , to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul , that thou mayest live .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	7	And the Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee , who persecuted thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	8	And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord , and do all His commandments which I command thee this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	9	And the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy land , for good . For the Lord will again rejoice over thee for good , as He rejoiced over thy fathers ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	10	if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this Book of the Law , and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	11	“ For this commandment which I command thee this day , it is not hidden from thee , neither is it far off .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	12	It is not in heaven , that thou shouldest say , ‘ Who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us , that we may hear it and do it ? ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	13	Neither is it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , ‘ Who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us , that we may hear it and do it ? ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	14	But the word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	15	“ See , I have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	16	in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God , to walk in His ways , and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments , that thou mayest live and multiply ; and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	17	But if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear , but shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	18	I declare unto you this day that ye shall surely perish , and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over the Jordan to go to possess it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	19	I call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing . Therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may live ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	30	20	that thou mayest love the Lord thy God , and that thou mayest obey His voice , and that thou mayest cleave unto Him ; for He is thy life and the length of thy days , that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swore unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give them . ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	31	And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	2	And he said unto them : “ I am a hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in . Also the Lord hath said unto me , ‘ Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	3	The Lord thy God , He will go over before thee , and He will destroy these nations from before thee , and thou shalt possess them ; and Joshua , he shall go over before thee , as the Lord hath said .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	4	And the Lord shall do unto them as He did to Sihon and to Og , kings of the Amorites , and unto the land of those whom He destroyed .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	5	And the Lord shall give them up before your face , that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	6	Be strong and of good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them ; for the Lord thy God , He it is who doth go with thee . He will not fail thee nor forsake thee. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	7	And Moses called unto Joshua and said unto him in the sight of all Israel , “ Be strong and of good courage ; for thou must go with this people unto the land which the Lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them , and thou shalt cause them to inherit it .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	8	And the Lord , He it is who doth go before thee . He will be with thee , He will not fail thee , neither forsake thee . Fear not , neither be dismayed. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	9	And Moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests , the sons of Levi , who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and unto all the elders of Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	10	And Moses commanded them , saying , “ At the end of every seven years , in the solemnity of the year of release , in the Feast of Tabernacles ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	11	when all Israel has come to appear before the Lord thy God in the place which He shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	12	Gather the people together — men , and women , and children , and thy stranger who is within thy gates — that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the Lord your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	13	and that their children , who have not known any thing , may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	14	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Behold , thy days approach that thou must die . Call Joshua , and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation , that I may give him a charge. ” And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	15	And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud , and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	16	And the Lord said unto Moses , “ Behold , thou shalt sleep with thy fathers ; and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them , and will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	17	Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day , and I will forsake them , and I will hide My face from them , and they shall be devoured ; and many evils and troubles shall befall them , so that they will say in that day , ‘ Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us ? ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	18	And I will surely hide My face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought , in that they are turned unto other gods .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	19	Now therefore write ye this song for you , and teach it to the children of Israel . Put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	20	For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore unto their fathers , that floweth with milk and honey , and they shall have eaten and filled themselves and waxed fat , then will they turn unto other gods and serve them , and provoke Me and break My covenant .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	21	And it shall come to pass , when many evils and troubles have befallen them , that this song shall testify against them as a witness ; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed . For I know their imagination and that which they go about , even now , before I have brought them into the land which I swore. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	22	Moses therefore wrote this song the same day , and taught it to the children of Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	23	And He gave Joshua , the son of Nun , a charge and said , “ Be strong and of good courage ; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore unto them , and I will be with thee. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	24	And it came to pass , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book until they were finished ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	25	that Moses commanded the Levites , who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord , saying ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	26	“ Take this Book of the Law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God , that it may be there for a witness against thee ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	27	for I know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck . Behold , while I am yet alive with you this day , ye have been rebellious against the Lord . And how much more after my death ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	28	Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to record against them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	29	For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you . And evil will befall you in the latter days , because ye will do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	31	30	And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were ended :
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	32	For their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah ; their grapes are grapes of gall , their clusters are bitter .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	2	My doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distill as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the showers upon the grass .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	3	Because I will proclaim the name of the Lord , ascribe ye greatness unto our God .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	4	“ He is the Rock , His work is perfect ; for all His ways are judgment , a God of truth and without iniquity ; just and right is He .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	5	They have corrupted themselves ; their spot is not the spot of His children ; they are a perverse and crooked generation .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	6	“ Do ye thus requite the Lord , O foolish people and unwise ? Is not He thy father that hath bought thee ? Hath He not made thee and established thee ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	7	Remember the days of old ; consider the years of many generations . Ask thy father , and he will show thee , thy elders , and they will tell thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	8	When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance , when He separated the sons of Adam , He set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	9	For the Lord ’ S portion is His people ; Jacob is the lot of His inheritance .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	10	“ He found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness ; He led him about , He instructed him , He kept him as the apple of His eye .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	11	As an eagle stirreth up her nest , fluttereth over her young , spreadeth abroad her wings , taketh them , beareth them on her wings ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	12	so the Lord alone did lead him , and there was no strange god with him .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and He made him to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ;
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	14	butter of cows and milk of sheep , with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of Bashan , and goats , with the fat of kidneys of wheat ; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	15	“ But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked ; thou hast waxed fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fatness . Then he forsook God who made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	16	They provoked Him to jealousy with strange gods ; with abominations provoked they Him to anger .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	17	They sacrificed unto devils , not to God , to gods whom they knew not , to new gods that came newly up , whom your fathers feared not .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	18	Of the Rock that begot thee thou art unmindful , and hast forgotten God that formed thee .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	19	“ And when the Lord saw it , He abhorred them , because of the provoking of His sons and of His daughters .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	20	And He said : ‘ I will hide My face from them , I will see what their end shall be ; for they are a very froward generation , children in whom is no faith .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	21	They have moved Me to jealousy with that which is not God ; they have provoked Me to anger with their vanities . And I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people ; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	22	For a fire is kindled in Mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	23	“ ‘ I will heap mischiefs upon them ; I will spend Mine arrows upon them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	24	They shall be burned with hunger , and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction ; I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them , with the poison of serpents of the dust .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	25	The sword without and terror within shall destroy both the young man and the virgin , the suckling also with the man of gray hairs .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	26	I said I would scatter them into corners , I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	27	were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , “ Our hand is high ; and the Lord hath not done all this. ” ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	28	“ For they are a nation void of counsel , neither is there any understanding in them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	29	O that they were wise , that they understood this , that they would consider their latter end !
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	30	How should one chase a thousand , and two put ten thousand to flight , unless their Rock had sold them , and the Lord had shut them up ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	31	For their rock is not as our Rock , even our enemies themselves being judges .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	33	Their wine is the poison of dragons , and the cruel venom of asps .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	34	“ ‘ Is not this laid up in store with Me , and sealed up among My treasures ?
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	35	To Me belongeth vengeance and recompense ; their foot shall slide in due time ; for the day of their calamity is at hand , and the things that shall come upon them make haste. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	36	“ For the Lord shall judge His people and repent for His servants , when He seeth that their power is gone and there is none shut up or left .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	37	And He shall say : ’ Where are their gods , their rock in whom they trusted ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	38	which ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings ? Let them rise up and help you , and be your protection .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	39	“ ‘ See now that I , even I , am He , and there is no god besides Me . I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal ; neither is there any that can deliver out of My hand .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	40	For I lift up My hand to heaven and say : I live for ever .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	41	If I whet My glittering sword and Mine hand take hold on judgment , I will render vengeance to Mine enemies and will reward them that hate Me .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	42	I will make Mine arrows drunk with blood , and My sword shall devour flesh , and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives , from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	43	“ Rejoice , O ye nations , with His people ; for He will avenge the blood of His servants , and will render vengeance to His adversaries , and will be merciful unto His land and to His people. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	44	And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he and Joshua the son of Nun .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	45	And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	46	and he said unto them : “ Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day , which ye shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	47	For it is not a vain thing for you , because it is your life ; and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	48	And the Lord spoke unto Moses that selfsame day , saying ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	49	“ Get thee up into this mountain Abarim , unto Mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab that is opposite Jericho , and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	50	And die on the mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto thy people , as Aaron thy brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered unto his people ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	51	because ye trespassed against Me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin , because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	32	52	Yet thou shalt see the land before thee , but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel . ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	33	And this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	2	And he said : “ The Lord came from Sinai , and rose up from Seir unto them . He shined forth from Mount Paran , and He came with ten thousands of saints ; from His right hand went a fiery law for them .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	3	Yea , He loved the people ; all His saints are in Thy hand ; and they sat down at Thy feet ; every one shall receive of Thy words .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	4	Moses commanded us a law , even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	5	And he was king in Jeshurun , when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	6	“ Let Reuben live , and not die , and let not his men be few. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	7	And this is the blessing of Judah ; and he said : “ Hear , Lord , the voice of Judah , and bring him unto his people ; let his hands be sufficient for him , and be Thou a help to him from his enemies. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	8	And of Levi he said : “ Let Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one , whom Thou didst prove at Massah , and with whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	9	who said unto his father and to his mother , ‘ I have not seen him ’ ; neither did he acknowledge his brethren , nor knew his own children ; for they have observed Thy word , and kept Thy covenant .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	10	They shall teach Jacob Thy judgments and Israel Thy law ; they shall put incense before Thee and whole burnt sacrifice upon Thine altar .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	11	Bless , Lord , his substance , and accept the work of his hands ; smite through the loins of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not again. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	12	And of Benjamin he said : “ The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by Him ; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long , and he shall dwell between His shoulders. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	13	And of Joseph he said : “ Blessed of the Lord be his land , for the precious things of heaven , for the dew , and for the deep that coucheth beneath ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	14	and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun , and for the precious things put forth by the moon ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	15	and for the chief things of the ancient mountains , and for the precious things of the lasting hills ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	16	and for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof , and for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush . Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph , and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	17	His glory is like the firstling of his bullock , and his horns are like the horns of unicorns . With them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth ; and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim , and they are the thousands of Manasseh. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	18	And of Zebulun he said : “ Rejoice , Zebulun , in thy going out , and , Issachar , in thy tents .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	19	They shall call the people unto the mountain ; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness ; for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of treasures hid in the sand. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	20	And of Gad he said : “ Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad ; he dwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm with the crown of the head .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	21	And he provided the first part for himself , because there , in a portion of the lawgiver , was he seated . And he came with the heads of the people ; he executed the justice of the Lord and His judgments with Israel. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	22	And of Dan he said : “ Dan is a lion ’ s whelp ; he shall leap from Bashan. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	23	And of Naphtali he said : “ O Naphtali , satisfied with favor and full with the blessing of the Lord , possess thou the west and the south. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	24	And of Asher he said : “ Let Asher be blessed with children ; let him be acceptable to his brethren , and let him dip his foot in oil .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	25	Thy shoes shall be iron and brass ; and as thy days , so shall thy strength be .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	26	“ There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun , who rideth upon the heaven to thy help and in His excellency on the sky .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	27	The eternal God is thy refuge , and underneath are the everlasting arms ; and He shall thrust out the enemy from before thee , and shall say , ‘ Destroy them. ’
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	28	Israel then shall dwell in safety alone ; the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also his heavens shall drop down dew .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	33	29	Happy art thou , O Israel ! Who is like unto thee , O people saved by the Lord , the shield of thy help , and who is the sword of thy excellency ! And thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee , and thou shalt tread upon their high places . ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	34	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is opposite Jericho . And the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	2	and all Naphtali , and the land of Ephraim , and Manasseh , and all the land of Judah unto the utmost sea ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	3	and the South , and the plain of the Valley of Jericho , the city of palm trees , as far as Zoar .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	4	And the Lord said unto him , “ This is the land which I swore unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , saying , ‘ I will give it unto thy seed. ’ I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes , but thou shalt not go over thither. ”
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	5	So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of the Lord .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	6	And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab , over against Bethpeor ; but no man knoweth of his sepulcher unto this day .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	7	And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died ; his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	8	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days ; so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	9	And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom , for Moses had laid his hands upon him . And the children of Israel hearkened unto him , and did as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	10	And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses , whom the Lord knew face to face ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	11	in all the signs and the wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt , to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land ,
KJ21	Deuteronomy	34	12	and in all that mighty hand , and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	1	1	Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord , it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of Nun , Moses ’ minister , saying ,
KJ21	Joshua	1	2	“ Moses My servant is dead . Now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , thou and all this people , unto the land which I give to them , even to the children of Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	1	3	Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have I given unto you , as I said unto Moses .
KJ21	Joshua	1	4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river , the River Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
KJ21	Joshua	1	5	There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life . As I was with Moses , so I will be with thee : I will not fail thee nor forsake thee .
KJ21	Joshua	1	6	Be strong and of a good courage , for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swore unto their fathers to give them .
KJ21	Joshua	1	7	Only be thou strong and very courageous , that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law , which Moses My servant commanded thee . Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left , that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest .
KJ21	Joshua	1	8	This Book of the Law shall not depart out of thy mouth , but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein . For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
KJ21	Joshua	1	9	Have not I commanded thee ? Be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed , for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. ”
KJ21	Joshua	1	10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people , saying ,
KJ21	Joshua	1	11	“ Pass through the host and command the people , saying , ‘ Prepare you victuals , for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it. ’ ”
KJ21	Joshua	1	12	And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh spoke Joshua , saying ,
KJ21	Joshua	1	13	“ Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , saying , ‘ The Lord your God hath given you rest and hath given you this land. ’
KJ21	Joshua	1	14	Your wives , your little ones , and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan . But ye shall pass before your brethren armed , all the mighty men of valor , and help them
KJ21	Joshua	1	15	until the Lord shall have given your brethren rest , as He hath given you , and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God giveth them . Then ye shall return unto the land of your possession and enjoy it , which Moses the Lord ’ S servant gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrising. ”
KJ21	Joshua	1	16	And they answered Joshua , saying , “ All that thou commandest us we will do , and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go .
KJ21	Joshua	1	17	According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things , so will we hearken unto thee ; only the Lord thy God be with thee , as He was with Moses .
KJ21	Joshua	1	18	Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him , he shall be put to death . Only be strong and of a good courage . ”
KJ21	Joshua	2	2	And it was told the king of Jericho , saying , “ Behold , there came men in hither tonight of the children of Israel to search out the country. ”
KJ21	Joshua	2	3	And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab , saying , “ Bring forth the men who have come to thee , who have entered into thine house , for they have come to search out all the country. ”
KJ21	Joshua	2	4	And the woman took the two men and hid them , and said thus , “ There came men unto me , but I knew not from whence they came .
KJ21	Joshua	2	5	And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . Whither the men went I know not . Pursue after them quickly , for ye shall overtake them. ”
KJ21	Joshua	2	6	But she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof .
KJ21	Joshua	2	7	And the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan unto the fords ; and as soon as those who pursued after them had gone out , they shut the gate .
KJ21	Joshua	2	8	And before they lay down , she came up unto them upon the roof ,
KJ21	Joshua	2	9	and she said unto the men , “ I know that the Lord hath given you the land , and that your terror has fallen upon us , and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you .
KJ21	Joshua	2	10	For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when ye came out of Egypt , and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan , Sihon and Og , whom ye utterly destroyed .
KJ21	Joshua	2	11	And as soon as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you ; for the Lord your God , He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath .
KJ21	Joshua	2	12	Now therefore , I pray you , swear unto me by the Lord , since I have shown you kindness , that ye will also show kindness unto my father ’ s house , and give me a true token ,
KJ21	Joshua	2	13	and that ye will save alive my father and my mother , and my brethren and my sisters , and all that they have , and deliver our lives from death. ”
KJ21	Joshua	2	14	And the men answered her , “ Our life for yours , if ye utter not this our business . And it shall be , when the Lord hath given us the land , that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. ”
KJ21	Joshua	2	15	Then she let them down by a cord through the window , for her house was upon the town wall , and she dwelt upon the wall .
KJ21	Joshua	2	16	And she said unto them , “ Get you to the mountain , lest the pursuers meet you ; and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers have returned , and afterward may ye go your way. ”
KJ21	Joshua	2	17	And the men said unto her , “ We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear .
KJ21	Joshua	2	18	Behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by ; and thou shalt bring thy father , and thy mother , and thy brethren , and all thy father ’ s household home unto thee .
KJ21	Joshua	2	19	And it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street , his blood shall be upon his head , and we will be guiltless ; and whosoever shall be with thee in the house , his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him .
KJ21	Joshua	2	20	And if thou utter this our business , then we will be free of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. ”
KJ21	Joshua	2	21	And she said , “ According unto your words , so be it. ” And she sent them away , and they departed ; and she bound the scarlet line in the window .
KJ21	Joshua	2	22	And they went and came unto the mountain , and abode there three days until the pursuers had returned ; and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
KJ21	Joshua	2	23	So the two men returned and descended from the mountain , and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun , and told him all things that befell them .
KJ21	Joshua	2	24	And they said unto Joshua , “ Truly the Lord hath delivered into our hands all the land , for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us . ”
KJ21	Joshua	3	3	and they commanded the people , saying , “ When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place and go after it .
KJ21	Joshua	3	2	And it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host ,
KJ21	Joshua	3	4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it , about two thousand cubits by measure . Come not near unto it , that ye may know the way by which ye must go , for ye have not passed this way heretofore. ”
KJ21	Joshua	3	5	And Joshua said unto the people , “ Sanctify yourselves , for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you. ”
KJ21	Joshua	3	6	And Joshua spoke unto the priests , saying , “ Take up the ark of the covenant , and pass over before the people. ” And they took up the ark of the covenant , and went before the people .
KJ21	Joshua	3	7	And the Lord said unto Joshua , “ This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel , that they may know that as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee .
KJ21	Joshua	3	8	And thou shalt command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant , saying , ‘ When ye have come to the brink of the water of the Jordan , ye shall stand still in the Jordan. ’ ”
KJ21	Joshua	3	9	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel , “ Come hither , and hear the words of the Lord your God. ”
KJ21	Joshua	3	10	And Joshua said , “ Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that He will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites .
KJ21	Joshua	3	11	Behold , the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan .
KJ21	Joshua	3	12	Now therefore , take for yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
KJ21	Joshua	3	13	And it shall come to pass , as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the Lord , the Lord of all the earth , shall rest in the waters of the Jordan , that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above ; and they shall stand up in a heap. ”
KJ21	Joshua	3	14	And it came to pass , when the people removed from their tents to pass over the Jordan , and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people ,
KJ21	Joshua	3	15	and as those who bore the ark had come unto the Jordan , and the feet of the priests who bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water ( for the Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest ) ,
KJ21	Joshua	3	16	that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far from the city Adam , that is beside Zaretan . And those who came down toward the sea of the plain , even the Salt Sea , failed and were cut off ; and the people passed over right against Jericho .
KJ21	Joshua	3	17	And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan , and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground , until all the people had passed clean over the Jordan .
KJ21	Joshua	4	4	Then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
KJ21	Joshua	4	2	“ Take you twelve men out of the people , out of every tribe a man ,
KJ21	Joshua	4	3	and command ye them , saying , ‘ Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan , from the place where the priests ’ feet stood firm , twelve stones ; and ye shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where ye shall lodge this night. ’ ”
KJ21	Joshua	4	5	And Joshua said unto them , “ Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan , and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder , according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel ,
KJ21	Joshua	4	6	that this may be a sign among you , that when your children ask their fathers in time to come , saying , ‘ What mean ye by these stones ? ’
KJ21	Joshua	4	7	then ye shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord : when it passed over the Jordan , the waters of the Jordan were cut off . And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. ”
KJ21	Joshua	4	8	And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded , and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan , as the Lord spoke unto Joshua , according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel , and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged , and laid them down there .
KJ21	Joshua	4	9	And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood ; and they are there unto this day .
KJ21	Joshua	4	10	For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to speak unto the people , according to all that Moses commanded Joshua ; and the people hastened and passed over .
KJ21	Joshua	4	11	And it came to pass , when all the people had clean passed over , that the ark of the Lord passed over , and the priests , in the presence of the people .
KJ21	Joshua	4	12	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spoke unto them .
KJ21	Joshua	4	13	About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the Lord unto battle to the plains of Jericho .
KJ21	Joshua	4	14	On that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
KJ21	Joshua	4	15	And the Lord spoke unto Joshua , saying ,
KJ21	Joshua	4	16	“ Command the priests who bear the ark of the Testimony that they come up out of the Jordan. ”
KJ21	Joshua	4	17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests , saying , “ Come ye up out of the Jordan. ”
KJ21	Joshua	4	18	And it came to pass , when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord had come up out of the midst of the Jordan , and the soles of the priests ’ feet were lifted up unto the dry land , that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all his banks , as they did before .
KJ21	Joshua	4	19	And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho .
KJ21	Joshua	4	20	And those twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan did Joshua set up in Gilgal .
KJ21	Joshua	4	21	And he spoke unto the children of Israel , saying , “ When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come , saying , ‘ What mean these stones ? ’
KJ21	Joshua	4	22	then ye shall let your children know , saying , ‘ Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. ’
KJ21	Joshua	4	23	For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you until ye had passed over , as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea , which He dried up from before us until we had gone over ,
KJ21	Joshua	4	24	that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord , that it is mighty , that ye might fear the Lord your God for ever . ”
KJ21	Joshua	5	5	Now all the people who came out were circumcised ; but all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circumcised .
KJ21	Joshua	5	2	At that time the Lord said unto Joshua , “ Make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time. ”
KJ21	Joshua	5	3	And Joshua made him sharp knives , and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins [ or , Gibeahhaaraloth ] .
KJ21	Joshua	5	4	And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise : All the people who came out of Egypt who were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt .
KJ21	Joshua	5	6	For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people who were men of war , who came out of Egypt , were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord . Unto these the Lord swore that He would not show them the land which the Lord swore unto their fathers that He would give us , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
KJ21	Joshua	5	7	And their children , whom He raised up in their stead , them Joshua circumcised ; for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them on the way .
KJ21	Joshua	5	8	And it came to pass , when they had done circumcising all the people , that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole .
KJ21	Joshua	5	9	And the Lord said unto Joshua , “ This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. ” Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal [ that is , Rolling ] unto this day .
KJ21	Joshua	5	10	And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal , and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho .
KJ21	Joshua	5	11	And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the Passover , unleavened cakes and parched corn on the selfsame day .
KJ21	Joshua	5	12	And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land ; neither had the children of Israel manna any more , but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
KJ21	Joshua	5	13	And it came to pass , when Joshua was by Jericho , that he lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , there stood a man opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand ; and Joshua went unto him and said unto him , “ Art thou for us , or for our adversaries ? ”
KJ21	Joshua	5	14	And he said , “ Nay , but as captain of the host of the Lord have I now come. ” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped , and said unto him , “ What saith my lord unto his servant ? ”
KJ21	Joshua	5	15	And the captain of the Lord ’ S host said unto Joshua , “ Loose thy shoe from off thy foot , for the place whereon thou standest is holy. ” And Joshua did so .
KJ21	Joshua	6	6	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said unto them , “ Take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams ’ horns before the ark of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Joshua	6	2	And the Lord said unto Joshua , “ See , I have given into thine hand Jericho , and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor .
KJ21	Joshua	6	3	And ye shall compass the city , all ye men of war , and go round about the city once . Thus shalt thou do six days .
KJ21	Joshua	6	4	And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams ’ horns ; and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times , and the priests shall blow with the trumpets .
KJ21	Joshua	6	5	And it shall come to pass , when they make a long blast with the ram ’ s horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet , that all the people shall shout with a great shout ; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat , and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him. ”
KJ21	Joshua	6	7	And he said unto the people , “ Pass on , and compass the city , and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Joshua	6	8	And it came to pass , when Joshua had spoken unto the people , that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ’ horns passed on before the Lord and blew with the trumpets ; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them .
KJ21	Joshua	6	9	And the armed men went before the priests who blew with the trumpets , and the rearward came after the ark , the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets .
KJ21	Joshua	6	10	And Joshua had commanded the people , saying , “ Ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice , neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout . Then shall ye shout. ”
KJ21	Joshua	6	11	So the ark of the Lord compassed the city , going about it once ; and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp .
KJ21	Joshua	6	12	And Joshua rose early in the morning , and the priests took up the ark of the Lord .
KJ21	Joshua	6	13	And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams ’ horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets ; and the armed men went before them , but the rearward came after the ark of the Lord , the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets .
KJ21	Joshua	6	14	And the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp . So they did six days .
KJ21	Joshua	6	15	And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early , about the dawning of the day , and compassed the city in the same manner seven times . Only on that day they compassed the city seven times .
KJ21	Joshua	6	16	And it came to pass at the seventh time , when the priests blew with the trumpets , Joshua said unto the people , “ Shout ! For the Lord hath given you the city .
KJ21	Joshua	6	17	And the city shall be accursed , even it and all who are therein , to the Lord . Only Rahab the harlot shall live , she and all who are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
KJ21	Joshua	6	18	And ye , in all ways keep yourselves from the accursed thing , lest ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing , and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it .
KJ21	Joshua	6	19	But all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the Lord . They shall come into the treasury of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Joshua	6	20	So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets . And it came to pass , when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout , that the wall fell down flat , so that the people went up into the city , every man straight before him ; and they took the city .
KJ21	Joshua	6	21	And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox and sheep and ass , with the edge of the sword .
KJ21	Joshua	6	22	But Joshua had said unto the two men who had spied out the country , “ Go into the harlot ’ s house , and bring out from thence the woman and all that she hath , as ye swore unto her. ”
KJ21	Joshua	6	23	And the young men who were spies went in and brought Rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kindred and left them outside the camp of Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	6	24	And they burned the city with fire and all that was therein . Only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Joshua	6	25	And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive , and her father ’ s household and all that she had ; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day , because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
KJ21	Joshua	6	26	And Joshua adjured them at that time , saying , “ Cursed be the man before the Lord who riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho . He shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn , and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it. ”
KJ21	Joshua	6	27	So the Lord was with Joshua , and his fame was noised throughout all the country .
KJ21	Joshua	7	7	And Joshua said , “ Alas , O Lord God , why hast Thou at all brought this people over the Jordan , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us ? Would to God we had been content and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan !
KJ21	Joshua	7	2	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is beside Bethaven on the east side of Bethel , and spoke unto them , saying , “ Go up and view the country. ” And the men went up and viewed Ai .
KJ21	Joshua	7	3	And they returned to Joshua and said unto him , “ Let not all the people go up , but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai ; and make not all the people to labor thither , for they are but few. ”
KJ21	Joshua	7	4	So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men , and they fled before the men of Ai .
KJ21	Joshua	7	5	And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men , for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim and smote them in their going down . Therefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water .
KJ21	Joshua	7	6	And Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the Lord until the eventide , he and the elders of Israel , and put dust upon their heads .
KJ21	Joshua	7	8	O Lord , what shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies !
KJ21	Joshua	7	9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it , and shall environ us round and cut off our name from the earth . And what wilt Thou do unto Thy great name ? ”
KJ21	Joshua	7	10	And the Lord said unto Joshua , “ Get thee up . Why liest thou thus upon thy face ?
KJ21	Joshua	7	11	Israel hath sinned , and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them ; for they have even taken of the accursed thing , and have also stolen and dissembled also ; and they have put it even among their own stuff .
KJ21	Joshua	7	12	Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies , but turned their backs before their enemies , because they were accursed . Neither will I be with you any more , unless ye destroy the accursed from among you .
KJ21	Joshua	7	13	Up , sanctify the people and say , ‘ Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow , for thus saith the Lord God of Israel : There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee , O Israel . Thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you .
KJ21	Joshua	7	14	In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes ; and it shall be that the tribe which the Lord taketh shall come according to the families thereof , and the family which the Lord shall take shall come by households , and the household which the Lord shall take shall come man by man .
KJ21	Joshua	7	15	And it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire , he and all that he hath , because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord , and because he hath wrought folly in Israel. ’ ”
KJ21	Joshua	7	16	So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes , and the tribe of Judah was taken ;
KJ21	Joshua	7	17	and he brought the family of Judah , and he took the family of the Zarhites ; and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man , and Zabdi was taken ;
KJ21	Joshua	7	18	and he brought his household man by man , and Achan the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was taken .
KJ21	Joshua	7	19	And Joshua said unto Achan , “ My son , give , I pray thee , glory to the Lord God of Israel and make confession unto Him . And tell me now what thou hast done ; hide it not from me. ”
KJ21	Joshua	7	20	And Achan answered Joshua and said , “ Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel , and thus and thus have I done :
KJ21	Joshua	7	21	When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonian garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight , then I coveted them and took them ; and behold , they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it. ”
KJ21	Joshua	7	22	So Joshua sent messengers , and they ran unto the tent ; and behold , it was hid in his tent , and the silver under it .
KJ21	Joshua	7	23	And they took them out of the midst of the tent , and brought them unto Joshua and unto all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
KJ21	Joshua	7	24	And Joshua , and all Israel with him , took Achan the son of Zerah , and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold , and his sons and his daughters , and his oxen and his asses and his sheep , and his tent and all that he had ; and they brought them unto the Valley of Achor .
KJ21	Joshua	7	25	And Joshua said , “ Why hast thou troubled us ? The Lord shall trouble thee this day. ” And all Israel stoned him with stones , and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones .
KJ21	Joshua	7	26	And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day . So the Lord turned from the fierceness of His anger . Therefore the name of that place was called the Valley of Achor [ that is , Trouble ] unto this day .
KJ21	Joshua	8	8	And it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire . According to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do . See , I have commanded you. ”
KJ21	Joshua	8	2	And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king . Only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take for booty unto yourselves . Lay thee an ambush for the city behind it. ”
KJ21	Joshua	8	3	So Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up against Ai ; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor , and sent them away by night .
KJ21	Joshua	8	4	And he commanded them , saying , “ Behold , ye shall lie in wait against the city , even behind the city . Go not very far from the city , but be ye all ready ;
KJ21	Joshua	8	5	and I and all the people who are with me will approach unto the city . And it shall come to pass , when they come out against us as at the first , that we will flee before them
KJ21	Joshua	8	6	( for they will come out after us ) till we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , ‘ They flee before us , as at the first. ’ Therefore we will flee before them .
KJ21	Joshua	8	7	Then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city , for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand .
KJ21	Joshua	8	9	Joshua therefore sent them forth ; and they went to lie in ambush , and stayed between Bethel and Ai , on the west side of Ai ; but Joshua lodged that night among the people .
KJ21	Joshua	8	10	And Joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people , and went up , he and the elders of Israel , before the people to Ai .
KJ21	Joshua	8	11	And all the people , even the people of war who were with him , went up and drew nigh , and came before the city and pitched camp on the north side of Ai . Now there was a valley between them and Ai .
KJ21	Joshua	8	12	And he took about five thousand men and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai , on the west side of the city .
KJ21	Joshua	8	13	And when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city and those lying in wait on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
KJ21	Joshua	8	14	And it came to pass , when the king of Ai saw it , that they hastened and rose up early ; and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle , he and all his people , at a time appointed before the plain ; but he knew not that there lay an ambush against him behind the city .
KJ21	Joshua	8	15	And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them , and fled by the way of the wilderness .
KJ21	Joshua	8	16	And all the people who were in Ai were called together to pursue after them , and they pursued after Joshua and were drawn away from the city .
KJ21	Joshua	8	17	And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who went not out after Israel ; and they left the city open and pursued after Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	8	18	And the Lord said unto Joshua , “ Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai , for I will give it into thine hand. ” And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city .
KJ21	Joshua	8	19	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand ; and they entered into the city and took it , and hastened and set the city on fire .
KJ21	Joshua	8	20	And when the men of Ai looked behind them , they saw , and behold , the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven , and they had no power to flee this way or that way ; and the people who fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers .
KJ21	Joshua	8	21	And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again and slew the men of Ai .
KJ21	Joshua	8	22	And the others issued out of the city against them ; so they were in the midst of Israel , some on this side and some on that side . And they smote them , so that they let none of them remain or escape ;
KJ21	Joshua	8	23	and the king of Ai they took alive , and brought him to Joshua .
KJ21	Joshua	8	24	And it came to pass , when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field , in the wilderness wherein they chased them , and when they had all fallen on the edge of the sword until they were consumed , that all the Israelites returned unto Ai and smote it with the edge of the sword .
KJ21	Joshua	8	25	And so it was that all who fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of Ai .
KJ21	Joshua	8	26	For Joshua drew not his hand back , wherewith he stretched out the spear , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
KJ21	Joshua	8	27	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the Lord which He commanded Joshua .
KJ21	Joshua	8	28	And Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap for ever , even a desolation unto this day .
KJ21	Joshua	8	29	And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide ; and as soon as the sun was down , Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city , and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remaineth unto this day .
KJ21	Joshua	8	30	Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in Mount Ebal ,
KJ21	Joshua	8	31	as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses : “ an altar of whole stones over which no man hath lifted up any iron. ” And they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord , and sacrificed peace offerings .
KJ21	Joshua	8	32	And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the Law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	8	33	And all Israel , and their elders and officers and their judges , stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests , the Levites , who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord , the stranger as well as he that was born among them — half of them over against Mount Gerizim and half of them over against Mount Ebal , as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before , that they should bless the people of Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	8	34	And afterward he read all the words of the law , the blessings and cursings , according to all that is written in the Book of the Law .
KJ21	Joshua	8	35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel , with the women and the little ones and the strangers who walked among them .
KJ21	Joshua	9	9	And they said unto him , “ From a very far country thy servants have come because of the name of the Lord thy God ; for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in Egypt ,
KJ21	Joshua	9	2	that they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel with one accord .
KJ21	Joshua	9	3	And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai ,
KJ21	Joshua	9	4	they worked cunningly , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wineskins , old and rent and bound up ,
KJ21	Joshua	9	5	and old and patched shoes upon their feet , and old garments upon them ; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy .
KJ21	Joshua	9	6	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal , and said unto him and to the men of Israel , “ We have come from a far country . Now therefore make ye a league with us. ”
KJ21	Joshua	9	7	And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites , “ Perhaps ye dwell among us . Then how shall we make a league with you ? ”
KJ21	Joshua	9	8	And they said unto Joshua , “ We are thy servants. ” And Joshua said unto them , “ Who are ye ? And from whence come ye ? ”
KJ21	Joshua	9	10	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan — to Sihon king of Heshbon , and to Og king of Bashan , who was at Ashtaroth .
KJ21	Joshua	9	11	Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us , saying , ‘ Take provisions with you for the journey , and go to meet them and say unto them , “ We are your servants . Therefore now make ye a league with us. ” ’
KJ21	Joshua	9	12	This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry and it is moldy .
KJ21	Joshua	9	13	And these skins of wine which we filled were new , and behold , they are rent ; and these our garments and our shoes have become old by reason of the very long journey. ”
KJ21	Joshua	9	14	And the men took of their provisions , and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord .
KJ21	Joshua	9	15	And Joshua made peace with them , and made a league with them to let them live ; and the princes of the congregation swore unto them .
KJ21	Joshua	9	16	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbors and that they dwelt among them .
KJ21	Joshua	9	17	And the children of Israel journeyed and came unto their cities on the third day . Now their cities were Gibeon , and Chephirah , and Beeroth , and Kirjathjearim .
KJ21	Joshua	9	18	And the children of Israel smote them not , because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel . And all the congregation murmured against the princes .
KJ21	Joshua	9	19	But all the princes said unto all the congregation , “ We have sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel . Now therefore we may not touch them .
KJ21	Joshua	9	20	This we will do to them : we will even let them live , lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore unto them. ”
KJ21	Joshua	9	21	And the princes said unto them , “ Let them live , but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation , as the princes had promised them. ”
KJ21	Joshua	9	22	And Joshua called for them , and he spoke unto them , saying , “ Why have ye beguiled us , saying , ‘ We are very far from you , ’ when ye dwell among us ?
KJ21	Joshua	9	23	Now therefore ye are cursed , and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God. ”
KJ21	Joshua	9	24	And they answered Joshua and said , “ Because it was certainly told thy servants how the Lord thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you , therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you , and have done this thing .
KJ21	Joshua	9	25	And now , behold , we are in thine hand : as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us , do. ”
KJ21	Joshua	9	26	And so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they slew them not .
KJ21	Joshua	9	27	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord , even unto this day , in the place which He should choose .
KJ21	Joshua	10	10	And the Lord discomfited them before Israel , and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron , and smote them to Azekah and unto Makkedah .
KJ21	Joshua	10	2	that they feared greatly because Gibeon was a great city , as one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than Ai and all the men thereof were mighty .
KJ21	Joshua	10	3	Therefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron , and unto Piram king of Jarmuth , and unto Japhia king of Lachish , and unto Debir king of Eglon , saying ,
KJ21	Joshua	10	4	“ Come up unto me and help me , that we may smite Gibeon ; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. ”
KJ21	Joshua	10	5	Therefore the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon , gathered themselves together and went up , they and all their hosts , and encamped before Gibeon and made war against it .
KJ21	Joshua	10	6	And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal , saying , “ Slacken not thy hand from thy servants . Come up to us quickly , and save us and help us ; for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us. ”
KJ21	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua ascended from Gilgal , he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valor .
KJ21	Joshua	10	8	And the Lord said unto Joshua , “ Fear them not , for I have delivered them into thine hand . There shall not a man of them stand before thee. ”
KJ21	Joshua	10	9	Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly , and went up from Gilgal all night .
KJ21	Joshua	10	11	And it came to pass , as they fled from before Israel and were at the descent of Bethhoron , that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah , and they died . There were more who died with hailstones than those whom the children of Israel slew with the sword .
KJ21	Joshua	10	12	Then spoke Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel , and he said in the sight of Israel : “ Sun , stand thou still upon Gibeon ; and thou , moon , in the Valley of Aijalon. ”
KJ21	Joshua	10	13	And the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies . Is not this written in the Book of Jasher ? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven , and hastened not to go down for about a whole day .
KJ21	Joshua	10	14	And there was no day like that before it or after it , that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man ; for the Lord fought for Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	10	15	And Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , unto the camp to Gilgal .
KJ21	Joshua	10	16	But these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah .
KJ21	Joshua	10	17	And it was told Joshua , saying , “ The five kings are found hidden in a cave at Makkedah. ”
KJ21	Joshua	10	18	And Joshua said , “ Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave , and set men by it to keep them .
KJ21	Joshua	10	19	And stay ye not , but pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them . Permit them not to enter into their cities , for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand. ”
KJ21	Joshua	10	20	And it came to pass , when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they were consumed , that the rest who remained of them entered into fortified cities .
KJ21	Joshua	10	21	And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace . None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	10	22	Then said Joshua , “ Open the mouth of the cave , and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave. ”
KJ21	Joshua	10	23	And they did so , and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
KJ21	Joshua	10	24	And it came to pass , when they brought out those kings unto Joshua , that Joshua called for all the men of Israel , and said unto the captains of the men of war who went with him , “ Come near , put your feet upon the necks of these kings. ” And they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them .
KJ21	Joshua	10	25	And Joshua said unto them , “ Fear not , nor be dismayed . Be strong and of good courage , for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight. ”
KJ21	Joshua	10	26	And afterward Joshua smote them and slew them , and hanged them on five trees ; and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening .
KJ21	Joshua	10	27	And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun that Joshua commanded , and they took them down off the trees and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid , and laid great stones in the cave ’ s mouth , which remain until this very day .
KJ21	Joshua	10	28	And that day Joshua took Makkedah , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof he utterly destroyed — them and all the souls who were therein . He let none remain , and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho .
KJ21	Joshua	10	29	Then Joshua passed from Makkedah , and all Israel with him , unto Libnah , and fought against Libnah .
KJ21	Joshua	10	30	And the Lord delivered it also , and the king thereof , into the hand of Israel . And he smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls who were therein . He let none remain in it , but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho .
KJ21	Joshua	10	31	And Joshua passed from Libnah , and all Israel with him , unto Lachish , and encamped against it and fought against it .
KJ21	Joshua	10	32	And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls who were therein , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
KJ21	Joshua	10	33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish ; and Joshua smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining .
KJ21	Joshua	10	34	And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon , and all Israel with him ; and they encamped against it , and fought against it .
KJ21	Joshua	10	35	And they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls who were therein he utterly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
KJ21	Joshua	10	36	And Joshua went up from Eglon , and all Israel with him , unto Hebron ; and they fought against it .
KJ21	Joshua	10	37	And they took it and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and all the souls who were therein . He left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon , but destroyed it utterly and all the souls who were therein .
KJ21	Joshua	10	38	And Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to Debir , and fought against it .
KJ21	Joshua	10	39	And he took it , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof ; and they smote them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls who were therein . He left none remaining . As he had done to Hebron , so he did to Debir and to the king thereof , as he had done also to Libnah and to her king .
KJ21	Joshua	10	40	So Joshua smote all the country of the hills , and of the south and of the vale and of the springs , and all their kings . He left none remaining , but utterly destroyed all that breathed , as the Lord God of Israel commanded .
KJ21	Joshua	10	41	And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza , and all the country of Goshen , even unto Gibeon .
KJ21	Joshua	10	42	And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time , because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	10	43	And Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , unto the camp to Gilgal .
KJ21	Joshua	11	11	And they smote all the souls who were therein with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them . There was not any left to breathe ; and he burned Hazor with fire .
KJ21	Joshua	11	2	and to the kings who were on the north of the mountains and of the plains south of Chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the borders of Dor on the west ,
KJ21	Joshua	11	3	and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the mountains , and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah .
KJ21	Joshua	11	4	And they went out , they and all their hosts with them , many people , even as the sand that is upon the seashore in multitude , with horses and chariots very many .
KJ21	Joshua	11	5	And when all these kings were assembled together , they came and pitched camp together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	11	6	And the Lord said unto Joshua , “ Be not afraid because of them , for tomorrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel . Thou shalt hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire. ”
KJ21	Joshua	11	7	So Joshua came , and all the people of war with him , against them by the waters of Merom suddenly , and they fell upon them .
KJ21	Joshua	11	8	And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel , who smote them and chased them unto Great Sidon , and unto Misrephothmaim [ or , Burning of waters ] , and unto the Valley of Mizpeh eastward ; and they smote them until they left them none remaining .
KJ21	Joshua	11	9	And Joshua did unto them as the Lord bade him : he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire .
KJ21	Joshua	11	10	And Joshua at that time turned back and took Hazor , and smote the king thereof with the sword ; for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms .
KJ21	Joshua	11	12	And all the cities of those kings , and all the kings of them , did Joshua take and smote them with the edge of the sword ; and he utterly destroyed them , as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded .
KJ21	Joshua	11	13	But as for the cities that stood still in their strength , Israel burned none of them , save Hazor only . That did Joshua burn .
KJ21	Joshua	11	14	And all the spoil of these cities , and the cattle , the children of Israel took for booty unto themselves ; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them , neither left they any to breathe .
KJ21	Joshua	11	15	As the Lord commanded Moses His servant , so did Moses command Joshua , and so did Joshua . He left nothing undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Joshua	11	16	So Joshua took all that land : the hills , and all the south country , and all the land of Goshen , and the valley , and the plain , and the mountain of Israel , and the valley of the same ,
KJ21	Joshua	11	17	even from Mount Halak , that goeth up to Seir , even unto Baalgad in the Valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon . And all their kings he took , and smote them and slew them .
KJ21	Joshua	11	18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings .
KJ21	Joshua	11	19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , save the Hivites , the inhabitants of Gibeon . All others they took in battle .
KJ21	Joshua	11	20	For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts , that they should come against Israel in battle , that He might destroy them utterly and that they might have no favor , but that He might destroy them , as the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	Joshua	11	21	And at that time came Joshua and cut off the Anakim from the mountains : from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the mountains of Judah , and from all the mountains of Israel . Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities .
KJ21	Joshua	11	22	There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel ; only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , there remained .
KJ21	Joshua	11	23	So Joshua took the whole land , according to all that the Lord said unto Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . And the land rested from war .
KJ21	Joshua	12	12	the king of Eglon , one ; the king of Gezer , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	2	Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer , which is upon the bank of the River Arnon , from the middle of the river , and from half of Gilead , even unto the River Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ,
KJ21	Joshua	12	3	and from the plain to the Sea of Chinneroth on the east , and unto the sea of the plain , even the Salt Sea on the east , the way to Bethjeshimoth , and from the south , under Ashdothpisgah ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	4	and the territory of Og king of Bashan , who was of the remnant of the giants , who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
KJ21	Joshua	12	5	and reigned in Mount Hermon and in Salcah and in all Bashan , unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites , and half of Gilead , the border of Sihon king of Heshbon .
KJ21	Joshua	12	6	These Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smote ; and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites and the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh .
KJ21	Joshua	12	7	And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side of the Jordan on the west , from Baalgad in the Valley of Lebanon even unto the Mount Halak that goeth up to Seir , which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions ,
KJ21	Joshua	12	8	in the mountains and in the valleys and in the plains , and in the springs and in the wilderness and in the south country — the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites :
KJ21	Joshua	12	9	the king of Jericho , one ; the king of Ai , which is beside Bethel , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	10	the king of Jerusalem , one ; the king of Hebron , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	11	the king of Jarmuth , one ; the king of Lachish , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	13	the king of Debir , one ; the king of Geder , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	14	the king of Hormah , one ; the king of Arad , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	15	the king of Libnah , one ; the king of Adullam , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	16	the king of Makkedah , one ; the king of Bethel , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	17	the king of Tappuah , one ; the king of Hepher , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	18	the king of Aphek , one ; the king of Lasharon , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	19	the king of Madon , one ; the king of Hazor , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	20	the king of Shimronmeron , one ; the king of Achshaph , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	21	the king of Taanach , one ; the king of Megiddo , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	22	the king of Kedesh , one ; the king of Jokneam of Carmel , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	23	the king of Dor in the province of Dor , one ; the king of the nations of Gilgal , one ;
KJ21	Joshua	12	24	the king of Tirzah , one — all the kings thirty and one .
KJ21	Joshua	13	13	Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites nor the Maachathites , but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day .
KJ21	Joshua	13	2	This is the land that yet remaineth : all the borders of the Philistines and all Geshuri ,
KJ21	Joshua	13	3	from Sihor , which is before Egypt , even unto the borders of Ekron northward , which is counted as Canaanite ; five lords of the Philistines — the Gazathites , and the Ashdothites , the Ashkelonites , the Gittites , and the Ekronites ; also the Avites ;
KJ21	Joshua	13	4	from the south , all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians , unto Aphek , to the borders of the Amorites ;
KJ21	Joshua	13	5	and the land of the Gebalites , and all Lebanon , toward the sunrising , from Baalgad under Mount Hermon unto the entrance into Hamath .
KJ21	Joshua	13	6	All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim , and all the Sidonians , them will I drive out from before the children of Israel . Only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance , as I have commanded thee .
KJ21	Joshua	13	7	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes and the halftribe of Manasseh ” —
KJ21	Joshua	13	8	with whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of the Lord gave them :
KJ21	Joshua	13	9	from Aroer that is upon the bank of the River Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon ;
KJ21	Joshua	13	10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , unto the border of the children of Ammon ;
KJ21	Joshua	13	11	and Gilead , and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites , and all Mount Hermon , and all Bashan unto Salcah ;
KJ21	Joshua	13	12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan , who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei , who remained of the remnant of the giants ; for these did Moses smite and cast them out .
KJ21	Joshua	13	14	Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance ; the sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance , as He said unto them .
KJ21	Joshua	13	15	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families .
KJ21	Joshua	13	16	And their border was from Aroer , that is on the bank of the River Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by Medeba ;
KJ21	Joshua	13	17	Heshbon and all her cities that are in the plain : Dibon , and Bamothbaal , and Bethbaalmeon ,
KJ21	Joshua	13	18	and Jahazah , and Kedemoth , and Mephaath ,
KJ21	Joshua	13	19	and Kirjathaim , and Sibmah , and Zarethshahar on the mount of the valley ,
KJ21	Joshua	13	20	and Bethpeor , and Ashdothpisgah , and Bethjeshimoth ,
KJ21	Joshua	13	21	and all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian : Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , who were dukes of Sihon dwelling in the country .
KJ21	Joshua	13	22	Balaam also the son of Beor , the soothsayer , did the children of Israel slay with the sword among those who were slain by them .
KJ21	Joshua	13	23	And the border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan and the border thereof . This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families , the cities and the villages thereof .
KJ21	Joshua	13	24	And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad , even unto the children of Gad according to their families .
KJ21	Joshua	13	25	And their border was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , unto Aroer that is before Rabbah ;
KJ21	Joshua	13	26	and from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh , and Betonim , and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir ;
KJ21	Joshua	13	27	and in the valley , Betharam , and Bethnimrah , and Succoth , and Zaphon , the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon , the Jordan and his border , even unto the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth on the other side of the Jordan eastward .
KJ21	Joshua	13	28	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families , the cities and their villages .
KJ21	Joshua	13	29	And Moses gave inheritance unto the halftribe of Manasseh ; and this was the possession of the halftribe of the children of Manasseh by their families :
KJ21	Joshua	13	30	and their border was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , threescore cities ;
KJ21	Joshua	13	31	and half of Gilead , and Ashtaroth , and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan , were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh , even to one half of the children of Machir by their families .
KJ21	Joshua	13	32	These are the countries which Moses distributed for inheritance in the plains of Moab on the other side of the Jordan , by Jericho eastward .
KJ21	Joshua	13	33	But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance : the Lord God of Israel was their inheritance , as He said unto them .
KJ21	Joshua	14	14	Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day , because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	14	2	By lot was their inheritance , as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses , for the nine tribes and for the halftribe .
KJ21	Joshua	14	3	For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a halftribe on the other side of the Jordan ; but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them ,
KJ21	Joshua	14	4	for the children of Joseph were two tribes : Manasseh and Ephraim . Therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land , save cities to dwell in , with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance .
KJ21	Joshua	14	5	As the Lord commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did ; and they divided the land .
KJ21	Joshua	14	6	Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal ; and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him , “ Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea .
KJ21	Joshua	14	7	Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
KJ21	Joshua	14	8	Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt , but I wholly followed the Lord my God .
KJ21	Joshua	14	9	And Moses swore on that day , saying , ‘ Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children ’ s for ever , because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God. ’
KJ21	Joshua	14	10	And now , behold , the Lord hath kept me alive , as He said , these forty and five years , even since the Lord spoke this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness ; and now , lo , I am this day fourscore and five years old .
KJ21	Joshua	14	11	As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now for war , both to go out and to come in .
KJ21	Joshua	14	12	Now therefore give me this mountain whereof the Lord spoke in that day , for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there , and that the cities were great and fortified . If it so be that the Lord will be with me , then I shall be able to drive them out , as the Lord said. ”
KJ21	Joshua	14	13	And Joshua blessed him , and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance .
KJ21	Joshua	14	15	And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba , which Arba was a great man among the Anakim . And the land had rest from war .
KJ21	Joshua	15	15	And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir ( and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher ) .
KJ21	Joshua	15	2	And their south border was from the shore of the Salt Sea , from the bay that looketh southward .
KJ21	Joshua	15	3	And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea , and passed along to Hezron , and went up to Adar , and went around to Karkaa .
KJ21	Joshua	15	4	From thence it passed toward Azmon and went out unto the river of Egypt ; and the borders of that region were at the sea : this shall be your south border .
KJ21	Joshua	15	5	And the east border was the Salt Sea , even unto the end of the Jordan . And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of the Jordan .
KJ21	Joshua	15	6	And the border went up to Bethhogla and passed along by the north of Betharabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ;
KJ21	Joshua	15	7	and the border went up toward Debir from the Valley of Achor , and so northward looking toward Gilgal , that is before the ascent to Adummim , which is on the south side of the river ; and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh , and the boundaries thereof were at Enrogel .
KJ21	Joshua	15	8	And the border went up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite ( the same is Jerusalem ) ; and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the Valley of Hinnom westward , which is at the end of the Valley of the Giants northward .
KJ21	Joshua	15	9	And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron ; and the border was drawn to Baalah , which is Kirjathjearim .
KJ21	Joshua	15	10	And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto Mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of Mount Jearim , which is Chesalon on the north side , and went down to Bethshemesh , and passed on to Timnah .
KJ21	Joshua	15	11	And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward ; and the border was drawn to Shicron , and passed along to Mount Baalah , and went out unto Jabneel ; and the limit of the border was at the sea .
KJ21	Joshua	15	12	And the west border was to the Great Sea and the coast thereof . This is the border of the children of Judah round about according to their families .
KJ21	Joshua	15	13	And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah , according to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua , even the city of Arba ( Arba was the father of Anak ) , which city is Hebron .
KJ21	Joshua	15	14	And Caleb drove from thence the three sons of Anak : Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai , the children of Anak .
KJ21	Joshua	15	16	And Caleb said , “ He that smiteth Kirjathsepher and taketh it , to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife. ”
KJ21	Joshua	15	17	And Othniel the son of Kenaz , the brother of Caleb , took it ; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife .
KJ21	Joshua	15	18	And it came to pass , as she came unto him , that she moved him to ask of her father a field ; and she alighted from her ass , and Caleb said unto her , “ What wouldest thou ? ”
KJ21	Joshua	15	19	She answered , “ Give me a blessing , for thou hast given me a south land . Give me also springs of water. ” And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs .
KJ21	Joshua	15	20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families :
KJ21	Joshua	15	21	And the outermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom southward were Kabzeel , and Eder , and Jagur ,

KJ21	Joshua	15	57	Kain , Gibeah , and Timnah : ten cities with their villages ;
KJ21	Joshua	15	58	Halhul , Bethzur , and Gedor ,
KJ21	Joshua	15	59	and Maarath , and Bethanoth , and Eltekon : six cities with their villages ;
KJ21	Joshua	15	60	Kirjathbaal ( which is Kirjathjearim ) , and Rabbah : two cities with their villages ;
KJ21	Joshua	15	61	in the wilderness : Betharabah , Middin , and Secacah ,
KJ21	Joshua	15	62	and Nibshan , and the City of Salt , and Engedi ; six cities with their villages .
KJ21	Joshua	15	63	As for the Jebusites , the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah could not drive them out ; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day .
KJ21	Joshua	16	16	And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from the Jordan by Jericho , unto the water of Jericho on the east , to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout Mount Bethel ,
KJ21	Joshua	16	2	and goeth out from Bethel to Luz , and passeth along unto the borders of the Archites to Ataroth ,
KJ21	Joshua	16	3	and goeth down westward to the border of the Japhletites , unto the border of Bethhoron the Nether and to Gezer ; and the boundaries thereof are at the sea .
KJ21	Joshua	16	4	So the children of Joseph , Manasseh , and Ephraim took their inheritance .
KJ21	Joshua	16	5	And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus : even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar , unto Bethhoron the Upper .
KJ21	Joshua	16	6	And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethath on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh , and passed by it on the east to Janohah ;
KJ21	Joshua	16	7	and it went down from Janohah to Ataroth and to Naarah , and came to Jericho and went out at the Jordan .
KJ21	Joshua	16	8	The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the River Kanah ; and the boundaries thereof were at the sea . This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families .
KJ21	Joshua	16	9	And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
KJ21	Joshua	16	10	And they drove not out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer , but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day and serve under tribute .
KJ21	Joshua	17	17	And Joshua spoke unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , “ Thou art a great people and hast great power . Thou shalt not have one lot only ;
KJ21	Joshua	17	2	There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families : for the children of Abiezer , and for the children of Helek , and for the children of Asriel , and for the children of Shechem , and for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida . These were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families .
KJ21	Joshua	17	3	But Zelophehad the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons but daughters ; and these are the names of his daughters : Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
KJ21	Joshua	17	4	And they came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun and before the princes , saying , “ The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. ” Therefore according to the commandment of the Lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father .
KJ21	Joshua	17	5	And there fell ten portions to Manasseh , besides the land of Gilead and Bashan , which were on the other side of the Jordan ,
KJ21	Joshua	17	6	because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons ; and the rest of Manasseh ’ s sons had the land of Gilead .
KJ21	Joshua	17	7	And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath , that lieth before Shechem ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah .
KJ21	Joshua	17	8	Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah , but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim .
KJ21	Joshua	17	9	And the border descended unto the River Kanah , southward of the river . These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh . The border of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river , and the boundaries of it were at the sea .
KJ21	Joshua	17	10	Southward it was Ephraim ’ s , and northward it was Manasseh ’ s , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in Asher on the north and in Issachar on the east .
KJ21	Joshua	17	11	And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns , and Ibleam and her towns , and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns , even three countries .
KJ21	Joshua	17	12	Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities , but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
KJ21	Joshua	17	13	Yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel waxed strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute , but did not utterly drive them out .
KJ21	Joshua	17	14	And the children of Joseph spoke unto Joshua , saying , “ Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , forasmuch as the Lord hath blessed me hitherto ? ”
KJ21	Joshua	17	15	And Joshua answered them , “ If thou be a great people , then get thee up to the wood country and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants , if Mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee. ”
KJ21	Joshua	17	16	And the children of Joseph said , “ The hill is not enough for us ; and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron , both those who are of Bethshean and her towns , and those who are of the Valley of Jezreel. ”
KJ21	Joshua	17	18	but the mountain shall be thine , for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down . And the boundaries of it shall be thine ; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites , though they have iron chariots and though they be strong . ”
KJ21	Joshua	18	18	and passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward , and went down unto Arabah .
KJ21	Joshua	18	2	And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes , which had not yet received their inheritance .
KJ21	Joshua	18	3	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel , “ How long are ye slack to go to possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers hath given you ?
KJ21	Joshua	18	4	Appoint from among you three men for each tribe , and I will send them ; and they shall rise and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
KJ21	Joshua	18	5	And they shall divide it into seven parts : Judah shall abide in their border on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their borders on the north .
KJ21	Joshua	18	6	Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts and bring the description hither to me , that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord our God .
KJ21	Joshua	18	7	But the Levites have no part among you , for the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance . And Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan on the east , which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them. ”
KJ21	Joshua	18	8	And the men arose and went away ; and Joshua charged those who went to describe the land , saying , “ Go , and walk through the land and describe it , and come again to me , that I may here cast lots for you before the Lord in Shiloh. ”
KJ21	Joshua	18	9	And the men went and passed through the land and described it by cities into seven parts in a book , and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh .
KJ21	Joshua	18	10	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord , and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions .
KJ21	Joshua	18	11	And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families ; and the borders of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
KJ21	Joshua	18	12	And their border on the north side was from the Jordan ; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side , and went up through the mountains westward ; and the boundaries thereof were at the Wilderness of Bethaven .
KJ21	Joshua	18	13	And the border went over from thence toward Luz , to the side of Luz ( which is Bethel ) , southward ; and the border descended to Atarothadar , near the hill that lieth on the south side of the Nether Bethhoron .
KJ21	Joshua	18	14	And the border was drawn thence and compassed the corner of the sea southward , from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward ; and the boundaries thereof were at Kirjathbaal , which is Kirjathjearim , a city of the children of Judah : this was the west quarter .
KJ21	Joshua	18	15	And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim , and the border went out on the west and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah .
KJ21	Joshua	18	16	And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the Valley of the Son of Hinnom and which is in the Valley of the Giants on the north , and descended to the Valley of Hinnom , to the side of the Jebusites on the south , and descended to Enrogel ;
KJ21	Joshua	18	17	and was drawn from the north , and went forth to Enshemesh , and went forth toward Geliloth , which is over against the ascent of Adummim , and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
KJ21	Joshua	18	19	And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward ; and the boundaries of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea at the south end of the Jordan : this was the south border .
KJ21	Joshua	18	20	And the Jordan was the border of it on the east side . This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin by the borders thereof round about , according to their families .
KJ21	Joshua	18	21	Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho , and Bethhoglah , and the Valley of Keziz ,
KJ21	Joshua	18	22	and Betharabah , and Zemaraim , and Bethel ,
KJ21	Joshua	18	23	and Avim , and Parah , and Ophrah ,
KJ21	Joshua	18	24	and Chepharhaammonai , and Ophni , and Gaba : twelve cities with their villages ;
KJ21	Joshua	18	25	Gibeon , and Ramah , and Beeroth ,
KJ21	Joshua	18	26	and Mizpeh , and Chephirah , and Mozah ,
KJ21	Joshua	18	27	and Rekem , and Irpeel , and Taralah ,
KJ21	Joshua	18	28	and Zelah , Eleph , and Jebus ( which is Jerusalem ) , Gibeath , and Kirjath : fourteen cities with their villages . This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
KJ21	Joshua	19	19	and Hapharaim , and Shion , and Anaharath ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	2	And they had in their inheritance Beersheba ( or Sheba ) , and Moladah ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	3	and Hazarshual , and Balah , and Ezem ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	4	and Eltolad , and Bethul , and Hormah ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	5	and Ziklag , and Bethmarcaboth , and Hazarsusah ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	6	and Bethlebaoth , and Sharuhen : thirteen cities and their villages ;
KJ21	Joshua	19	7	Ain , Rimmon , and Ether , and Ashan : four cities and their villages ;
KJ21	Joshua	19	8	and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalathbeer , Ramah of the South . This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families .
KJ21	Joshua	19	9	Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon , for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them . Therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them .
KJ21	Joshua	19	10	And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families , and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid .
KJ21	Joshua	19	11	And their border went up toward the sea , and Maralah , and reached to Dabbasheth , and reached to the river that is before Jokneam ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	12	and turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor , and then goeth out to Daberath , and goeth up to Japhia ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	13	and from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher , to Ittahkazin , and goeth out to Rimmon to Neah .

KJ21	Joshua	19	15	and Kattath , and Nahallal , and Shimron , and Idalah , and Bethlehem : twelve cities with their villages .
KJ21	Joshua	19	16	This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families , these cities with their villages .
KJ21	Joshua	19	17	And the fourth lot came out to Issachar , for the children of Issachar according to their families .
KJ21	Joshua	19	18	And their border was toward Jezreel , and Chesulloth , and Shunem ,

KJ21	Joshua	19	22	And the border reacheth to Tabor , and Shahazimah , and Bethshemesh , and the boundaries of their border were at the Jordan : sixteen cities with their villages .
KJ21	Joshua	19	23	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families , the cities and their villages .
KJ21	Joshua	19	24	And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families .
KJ21	Joshua	19	25	And their border was Helkath , and Hali , and Beten , and Achshaph ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	26	and Alammelech , and Amad , and Mishal ; and reacheth to Carmel westward , and to Shihorlibnath ;
KJ21	Joshua	19	27	and turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon , and reacheth to Zebulun , and to the Valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek , and Neiel , and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	28	and Ebron , and Rehob , and Hammon , and Kanah , even unto Great Sidon .
KJ21	Joshua	19	29	And then the border turneth to Ramah , and to the stronghold city of Tyre ; and the border turneth to Hosah , and the boundaries thereof are at the sea from the border to Achzib ;
KJ21	Joshua	19	30	Ummah also , and Aphek , and Rehob : twenty and two cities with their villages .
KJ21	Joshua	19	31	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
KJ21	Joshua	19	32	The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali , even for the children of Naphtali according to their families .
KJ21	Joshua	19	33	And their border was from Heleph , from Allon to Zaanannim , and Adami , Nekeb , and Jabneel , unto Lakkum ; and the boundaries thereof were at the Jordan .
KJ21	Joshua	19	34	And then the border turneth westward to Aznothtabor , and goeth out from thence to Hukkok , and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side , and reacheth to Asher on the west side , and to Judah upon the Jordan toward the sunrising .
KJ21	Joshua	19	35	And the fortified cities are Ziddim , Zer , and Hammath , Rakkath , and Chinnereth ,

KJ21	Joshua	19	42	and Shaalabbin , and Aijalon , and Jethlah ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	43	And Elon , and Timnah , and Ekron ,

KJ21	Joshua	19	45	and Jehud , and Beneberak , and Gathrimmon ,
KJ21	Joshua	19	46	and Mejarkon , and Rakkon , with the border before Joppa .
KJ21	Joshua	19	47	And the border of the children of Dan went out too little for them . Therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem , and took it and smote it with the edge of the sword , and possessed it and dwelt therein , and called Leshem , Dan , after the name of Dan their father .
KJ21	Joshua	19	48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
KJ21	Joshua	19	49	When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their borders , the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them .
KJ21	Joshua	19	50	According to the word of the Lord they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnathserah in Mount Ephraim ; and he built the city and dwelt therein .
KJ21	Joshua	19	51	These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the Lord , at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation . So they made an end of dividing the country .
KJ21	Joshua	20	20	The Lord also spoke unto Joshua , saying ,
KJ21	Joshua	20	2	“ Speak to the children of Israel , saying , ‘ Appoint out for you cities of refuge , whereof I spoke unto you by the hand of Moses ,
KJ21	Joshua	20	3	that the slayer who killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither ; and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood .
KJ21	Joshua	20	4	And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city , they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place , that he may dwell among them .
KJ21	Joshua	20	5	And if the avenger of blood pursue after him , then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand , because he smote his neighbor unwittingly and hated him not beforehand .
KJ21	Joshua	20	6	And he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment , and until the death of the high priest who shall be in those days . Then shall the slayer return and come unto his own city and unto his own house , unto the city from whence he fled. ’ ”
KJ21	Joshua	20	7	And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in Mount Naphtali , and Shechem in Mount Ephraim , and Kirjatharba ( which is Hebron ) in the mountain of Judah .
KJ21	Joshua	20	8	And on the other side of the Jordan by Jericho eastward , they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain from the tribe of Reuben , and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad , and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh .
KJ21	Joshua	20	9	These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourneth among them , that whosoever killeth any person unawares might flee thither , and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stood before the congregation .
KJ21	Joshua	21	21	For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in Mount Ephraim to be a city of refuge for the slayer , and Gezer with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	2	And they spoke unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan , saying , “ The Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in , with the suburbs thereof for our cattle. ”
KJ21	Joshua	21	3	And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance , at the commandment of the Lord , these cities and their suburbs :
KJ21	Joshua	21	4	And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites . And the children of Aaron the priest , who were of the Levites , had by lot from the tribe of Judah , and from the tribe of Simeon , and from the tribe of Benjamin thirteen cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	5	And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim , and from the tribe of Dan , and from the halftribe of Manasseh ten cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	6	And the children of Gershon had by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar , and from the tribe of Asher , and from the tribe of Naphtali , and from the halftribe of Manasseh in Bashan thirteen cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	7	The children of Merari by their families had from the tribe of Reuben , and from the tribe of Gad , and from the tribe of Zebulun twelve cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	8	And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs , as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses .
KJ21	Joshua	21	9	And they gave from the tribe of the children of Judah , and from the tribe of the children of Simeon these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	10	which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi , had , for theirs was the first lot .
KJ21	Joshua	21	11	And they gave them the city of Arba ( the father of Anak ) , which city is Hebron , in the hill country of Judah , with the suburbs thereof round about it .
KJ21	Joshua	21	12	But the fields of the city and the villages thereof gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession .
KJ21	Joshua	21	13	Thus they gave to the children of Aaron , the priest , Hebron with her suburbs to be a city of refuge for the slayer , and Libnah with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	14	and Jattir with her suburbs , and Eshtemoa with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	15	and Holon with her suburbs , and Debir with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	16	and Ain with her suburbs , and Juttah with her suburbs , and Bethshemesh with her suburbs : nine cities from those two tribes .
KJ21	Joshua	21	17	And from the tribe of Benjamin , Gibeon with her suburbs , Geba with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	18	Anathoth with her suburbs , and Almon with her suburbs : four cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	19	All the cities of the children of Aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
KJ21	Joshua	21	20	And the families of the children of Kohath , the Levites who remained of the children of Kohath , even they had the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim .
KJ21	Joshua	21	22	and Kibzaim with her suburbs , and Bethhoron with her suburbs : four cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	23	And from the tribe of Dan , Eltekeh with her suburbs , Gibbethon with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	24	Aijalon with her suburbs , Gathrimmon with her suburbs : four cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	25	And from the halftribe of Manasseh , Tanach with her suburbs , and Gathrimmon with her suburbs : two cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	26	All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath who remained .
KJ21	Joshua	21	27	And unto the children of Gershon , of the families of the Levites , from the other halftribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and Beeshterah with her suburbs : two cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	28	And from the tribe of Issachar , Kishion with her suburbs , Daberath with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	29	Jarmuth with her suburbs , Engannim with her suburbs : four cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	30	And from the tribe of Asher , Mishal with her suburbs , Abdon with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	31	Helkath with her suburbs , and Rehob with her suburbs : four cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	32	And from the tribe of Naphtali , Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs to be a city of refuge for the slayer , and Hammothdor with her suburbs , and Kartan with her suburbs : three cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	33	All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
KJ21	Joshua	21	34	And unto the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , from the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with her suburbs , and Kartah with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	35	Dimnah with her suburbs , Nahalal with her suburbs : four cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	36	And from the tribe of Reuben , Bezer with her suburbs , and Jahazah with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	37	Kedemoth with her suburbs , and Mephaath with her suburbs : four cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	38	And from the tribe of Gad , Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs to be a city of refuge for the slayer , and Mahanaim with her suburbs ,
KJ21	Joshua	21	39	Heshbon with her suburbs , Jazer with her suburbs : four cities in all .
KJ21	Joshua	21	40	So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families , who were remaining of the families of the Levites , were by their lot twelve cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	41	All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs .
KJ21	Joshua	21	42	These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them ; thus were all these cities .
KJ21	Joshua	21	43	And the Lord gave unto Israel all the land which He swore to give unto their fathers ; and they possessed it and dwelt therein .
KJ21	Joshua	21	44	And the Lord gave them rest round about , according to all that He swore unto their fathers . And there stood not a man of all their enemies before them ; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand .
KJ21	Joshua	21	45	There failed not aught of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel . All came to pass .
KJ21	Joshua	22	22	“ The Lord God of gods , the Lord God of gods , He knoweth , and Israel he shall know ! If it be in rebellion or if in transgression against the Lord ( save us not this day )
KJ21	Joshua	22	2	and said unto them , “ Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you .
KJ21	Joshua	22	3	Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day , but have kept the charge of the commandment of the Lord your God .
KJ21	Joshua	22	4	And now the Lord your God hath given rest unto your brethren , as He promised them . Therefore now return ye , and get you unto your tents and unto the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the other side of the Jordan .
KJ21	Joshua	22	5	But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord charged you : to love the Lord your God , and to walk in all His ways , and to keep His commandments , and to cleave unto Him , and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul. ”
KJ21	Joshua	22	6	So Joshua blessed them and sent them away , and they went unto their tents .
KJ21	Joshua	22	7	Now to one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan , but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side of the Jordan westward . And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents , then he blessed them
KJ21	Joshua	22	8	and he spoke unto them , saying , “ Return with much riches unto your tents , and with very much cattle , with silver , and with gold , and with brass , and with iron , and with very much raiment . Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. ”
KJ21	Joshua	22	9	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh returned , and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan , to go unto the country of Gilead to the land of their possession , which they possessed according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
KJ21	Joshua	22	10	And when they came unto the borders of the Jordan that are in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan , a great altar to see to .
KJ21	Joshua	22	11	And the children of Israel heard say : “ Behold , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan in the borders of the Jordan , at the passage of the children of Israel. ”
KJ21	Joshua	22	12	And when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh to go up to war against them .
KJ21	Joshua	22	13	And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben and to the children of Gad and to the halftribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest
KJ21	Joshua	22	14	and with him ten princes , of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel ; and each one was a head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	22	15	And they came unto the children of Reuben and to the children of Gad and to the halftribe of Manasseh , unto the land of Gilead , and they spoke with them , saying ,
KJ21	Joshua	22	16	“ Thus saith the whole congregation of the Lord : ‘ What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that ye have built yourselves an altar , that ye might rebel this day against the Lord ?
KJ21	Joshua	22	17	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we are not cleansed until this day , although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord ,
KJ21	Joshua	22	18	but that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord ? And it will be , seeing ye rebel today against the Lord , that tomorrow He will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	22	19	Notwithstanding , if the land of your possession be unclean , then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the Lord wherein the Lord ’ S tabernacle dwelleth , and take possession among us ; but rebel not against the Lord , nor rebel against us in building yourselves an altar besides the altar of the Lord our God .
KJ21	Joshua	22	20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing , and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel ? And that man perished not alone in his iniquity. ’ ”
KJ21	Joshua	22	21	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
KJ21	Joshua	22	23	that we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offerings thereon , let the Lord Himself require it .
KJ21	Joshua	22	24	And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , ‘ In time to come your children might speak unto our children , saying , “ What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
KJ21	Joshua	22	25	For the Lord hath made the Jordan a border between us and you , ye children of Reuben and children of Gad . Ye have no part in the Lord. ” So shall your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord. ’
KJ21	Joshua	22	26	Therefore we said , ‘ Let us now prepare to build us an altar , not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice ,
KJ21	Joshua	22	27	but that it may be a witness between us and you and our generations after us , that we might do the service of the Lord before Him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings , that your children may not say to our children in time to come , “ Ye have no part in the Lord. ” ’
KJ21	Joshua	22	28	Therefore we said that it shall be , when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come , that we may say again , ‘ Behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord which our fathers made , not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices , but it is a witness between us and you. ’
KJ21	Joshua	22	29	God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord and turn this day from following the Lord to build an altar for burnt offerings , for meat offerings , or for sacrifices , besides the altar of the Lord our God that is before His tabernacle. ”
KJ21	Joshua	22	30	And when Phinehas the priest and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke , it pleased them .
KJ21	Joshua	22	31	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben and to the children of Gad and to the children of Manasseh : “ This day we perceive that the Lord is among us , because ye have not committed this trespass against the Lord . Now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Joshua	22	32	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben and from the children of Gad out of the land of Gilead unto the land of Canaan to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
KJ21	Joshua	22	33	And the thing pleased the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel blessed God , and did not intend to go up against them in battle to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt .
KJ21	Joshua	22	34	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed [ that is , A witness ] , “ For it shall be a witness between us that the Lord is God . ”
KJ21	Joshua	23	23	And it came to pass , a long time after the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about , that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age .
KJ21	Joshua	23	2	And Joshua called for all Israel , and for their elders , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers , and said unto them , “ I am old and stricken in age .
KJ21	Joshua	23	3	And ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these nations because of you , for the Lord your God is He that hath fought for you .
KJ21	Joshua	23	4	Behold , I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes , from the Jordan , with all the nations that I have cut off , even unto the Great Sea westward .
KJ21	Joshua	23	5	And the Lord your God , He shall expel them from before you and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall possess their land , as the Lord your God hath promised unto you .
KJ21	Joshua	23	6	Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses , that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left ;
KJ21	Joshua	23	7	that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you , neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause any to swear by them , neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them .
KJ21	Joshua	23	8	But cleave unto the Lord your God , as ye have done unto this day .
KJ21	Joshua	23	9	For the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong ; but as for you , no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day .
KJ21	Joshua	23	10	One man of you shall chase a thousand ; for the Lord your God , He it is that fighteth for you , as He hath promised you .
KJ21	Joshua	23	11	Take good heed therefore unto yourselves , that ye love the Lord your God .
KJ21	Joshua	23	12	Or else , if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them and go in unto them and they to you ,
KJ21	Joshua	23	13	know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you , but they shall be snares and traps unto you and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes , until ye perish from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you .
KJ21	Joshua	23	14	“ And behold , this day I am going the way of all the earth . And ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spoke concerning you : all have come to pass unto you , and not one thing hath failed thereof .
KJ21	Joshua	23	15	Therefore it shall come to pass that , as all good things have come upon you which the Lord your God promised you , so shall the Lord bring upon you all evil things until He have destroyed you from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you :
KJ21	Joshua	23	16	when ye have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God which He commanded you , and have gone and served other gods and bowed yourselves to them , then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against you , and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which He hath given unto you . ”
KJ21	Joshua	24	24	And the people said unto Joshua , “ The Lord our God will we serve , and His voice will we obey. ”
KJ21	Joshua	24	2	And Joshua said unto all the people , “ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : ‘ Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the river in old time , even Terah , the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor ; and they served other gods .
KJ21	Joshua	24	3	And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac .
KJ21	Joshua	24	4	And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau ; and I gave unto Esau Mount Seir to possess it , but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
KJ21	Joshua	24	5	I sent Moses also and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did among them ; and afterward I brought you out .
KJ21	Joshua	24	6	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt ; and ye came unto the sea , and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red Sea .
KJ21	Joshua	24	7	And when they cried unto the Lord , He put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea upon them and covered them . And your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt ; and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season .
KJ21	Joshua	24	8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites , who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan . And they fought with you ; and I gave them into your hand , that ye might possess their land , and I destroyed them from before you .
KJ21	Joshua	24	9	Then Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , arose and warred against Israel , and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you .
KJ21	Joshua	24	10	But I would not hearken unto Balaam . Therefore he blessed you still ; so I delivered you out of his hand .
KJ21	Joshua	24	11	And ye went over the Jordan and came unto Jericho ; and the men of Jericho fought against you — the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites . And I delivered them into your hand .
KJ21	Joshua	24	12	And I sent the hornet before you which drove them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites , but not with thy sword nor with thy bow .
KJ21	Joshua	24	13	And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor and cities which ye built not , and ye dwell in them . Of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. ’
KJ21	Joshua	24	14	“ Now therefore , fear the Lord , and serve Him in sincerity and in truth ; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river and in Egypt , and serve ye the Lord .
KJ21	Joshua	24	15	And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord , choose you this day whom ye will serve , whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the river , or the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell . But as for me and my house , we will serve the Lord. ”
KJ21	Joshua	24	16	And the people answered and said , “ God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods ;
KJ21	Joshua	24	17	for the Lord our God , He it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage , and who did those great signs in our sight , and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed .
KJ21	Joshua	24	18	And the Lord drove out from before us all the people , even the Amorites who dwelt in the land . Therefore will we also serve the Lord , for He is our God. ”
KJ21	Joshua	24	19	And Joshua said unto the people , “ Ye can not serve the Lord , for He is a holy God ; He is a jealous God ; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins :
KJ21	Joshua	24	20	if ye forsake the Lord and serve strange gods , then He will turn and do you hurt , and consume you after He hath done you good. ”
KJ21	Joshua	24	21	And the people said unto Joshua , “ Nay ; but we will serve the Lord. ”
KJ21	Joshua	24	22	And Joshua said unto the people , “ Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen for yourselves the Lord to serve Him. ” And they said , “ We are witnesses. ”
KJ21	Joshua	24	23	“ Now therefore put away , ” said he , “ the strange gods which are among you , and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel. ”
KJ21	Joshua	24	25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day , and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem .
KJ21	Joshua	24	26	And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God , and took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord .
KJ21	Joshua	24	27	And Joshua said unto all the people , “ Behold , this stone shall be a witness unto us , for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which He spoke unto us . It shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny your God. ”
KJ21	Joshua	24	28	So Joshua let the people depart , every man unto his inheritance .
KJ21	Joshua	24	29	And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being a hundred and ten years old .
KJ21	Joshua	24	30	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah , which is in Mount Ephraim , on the north side of the Hill of Gaash .
KJ21	Joshua	24	31	And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and who had known all the works of the Lord , that He had done for Israel .
KJ21	Joshua	24	32	And the bones of Joseph , which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt , buried they in Shechem , in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver . And it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph .
KJ21	Joshua	24	33	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died ; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son , which was given him in Mount Ephraim .
KJ21	Judges	1	1	Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the Lord , saying , “ Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first , to fight against them ? ”
KJ21	Judges	1	2	And the Lord said , “ Judah shall go up . Behold , I have delivered the land into his hand. ”
KJ21	Judges	1	3	And Judah said unto Simeon his brother , “ Come up with me into my allotment , that we may fight against the Canaanites ; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. ” So Simeon went with him .
KJ21	Judges	1	4	And Judah went up ; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand , and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men .
KJ21	Judges	1	5	And they found Adonibezek in Bezek ; and they fought against him , and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
KJ21	Judges	1	6	But Adonibezek fled ; and they pursued after him and caught him , and cut off his thumbs and his great toes .
KJ21	Judges	1	7	And Adonibezek said , “ Threescore and ten kings , having their thumbs and their great toes cut off , gathered their meat under my table . As I have done , so God hath requited me. ” And they brought him to Jerusalem , and there he died .
KJ21	Judges	1	8	Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem , and had taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire .
KJ21	Judges	1	9	And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountain and in the South and in the valley .
KJ21	Judges	1	10	And Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron ( now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba ) , and they slew Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai .
KJ21	Judges	1	11	And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir ( and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher ) .
KJ21	Judges	1	12	And Caleb said , “ He that smiteth Kirjathsepher and taketh it , to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife. ”
KJ21	Judges	1	13	And Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s younger brother , took it ; and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife .
KJ21	Judges	1	14	And it came to pass , when she came to him , that she moved him to ask of her father a field ; and she alighted from her ass , and Caleb said unto her , “ What wilt thou ? ”
KJ21	Judges	1	15	And she said unto him , “ Give me a blessing , for thou hast given me a south land . Give me also springs of water. ” And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs .
KJ21	Judges	1	16	And the children of the Kenite , Moses ’ father-in-law , went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah , which lieth in the south of Arad ; and they went and dwelt among the people .
KJ21	Judges	1	17	And Judah went with Simeon his brother , and they slew the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it . And the name of the city was called Hormah .
KJ21	Judges	1	18	Also Judah took Gaza with the regions thereof , and Ashkelon with the regions thereof , and Ekron with the region thereof .
KJ21	Judges	1	19	And the Lord was with Judah ; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain , but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron .
KJ21	Judges	1	20	And they gave Hebron unto Caleb , as Moses said ; and he expelled from thence the three sons of Anak .
KJ21	Judges	1	21	And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem , but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day .
KJ21	Judges	1	22	And the house of Joseph , they also went up against Bethel ; and the Lord was with them .
KJ21	Judges	1	23	And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel . ( Now the name of the city before was Luz . )
KJ21	Judges	1	24	And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city , and they said unto him , “ Show us , we pray thee , the entrance into the city , and we will show thee mercy. ”
KJ21	Judges	1	25	And when he showed them the entrance into the city , they smote the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let go the man and all his family .
KJ21	Judges	1	26	And the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city , and called the name thereof Luz , which is the name thereof unto this day .
KJ21	Judges	1	27	Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns , nor Taanach and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
KJ21	Judges	1	28	And it came to pass , when Israel was strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute , and did not utterly drive them out .
KJ21	Judges	1	29	Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer , but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them .
KJ21	Judges	1	30	Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron nor the inhabitants of Nahalol , but the Canaanites dwelt among them and became tributaries .
KJ21	Judges	1	31	Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco , nor the inhabitants of Sidon , nor of Ahlab , nor of Achzib , nor of Helbah , nor of Aphik , nor of Rehob ;
KJ21	Judges	1	32	but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land , for they did not drive them out .
KJ21	Judges	1	33	Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh nor the inhabitants of Bethanath , but he dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land . Nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them .
KJ21	Judges	1	34	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain , for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley .
KJ21	Judges	1	35	But the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres in Aijalon and in Shaalbim ; yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became tributaries .
KJ21	Judges	1	36	And the border of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim , from the rock and upward .
KJ21	Judges	2	2	And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their altars. ’ But ye have not obeyed My voice . Why have ye done this ?
KJ21	Judges	2	3	Therefore I also said , ‘ I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thorns in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare unto you. ’ ”
KJ21	Judges	2	4	And it came to pass , when the angel of the Lord spoke these words unto all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice and wept .
KJ21	Judges	2	5	And they called the name of that place Bochim [ that is , Weepers ] , and they sacrificed there unto the Lord .
KJ21	Judges	2	6	And when Joshua had let the people go , the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land .
KJ21	Judges	2	7	And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord that He did for Israel .
KJ21	Judges	2	8	And Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being a hundred and ten years old .
KJ21	Judges	2	9	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres , in the mount of Ephraim , on the north side of the hill Gaash .
KJ21	Judges	2	10	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers , and there arose another generation after them who knew not the Lord nor yet the works which He had done for Israel .
KJ21	Judges	2	11	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord , and served the Baalim .
KJ21	Judges	2	12	And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , the gods of the people who were round about them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the Lord to anger .
KJ21	Judges	2	13	And they forsook the Lord and served Baal and Ashtaroth .
KJ21	Judges	2	14	And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel ; and He delivered them into the hands of despoilers who despoiled them , and He sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
KJ21	Judges	2	15	Whithersoever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for evil , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworn unto them ; and they were greatly distressed .
KJ21	Judges	2	16	Nevertheless the Lord raised up judges , who delivered them out of the hand of those who despoiled them .
KJ21	Judges	2	17	And yet they would not hearken unto their judges , but they went a whoring after other gods , and bowed themselves unto them . They turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in , obeying the commandments of the Lord ; but they did not so .
KJ21	Judges	2	18	And when the Lord raised them up judges , then the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge ; for the Lord was moved to repent because of their groanings by reason of those who oppressed them and vexed them .
KJ21	Judges	2	19	And it came to pass , when the judge was dead , that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods , to serve them and to bow down unto them . They ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way .
KJ21	Judges	2	20	And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel ; and He said , “ Because this people hath transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers , and have not hearkened unto My voice ,
KJ21	Judges	2	21	I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died ,
KJ21	Judges	2	22	that through them I may test Israel , whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein , as their fathers did keep it , or not. ”
KJ21	Judges	2	23	Therefore the Lord left those nations without driving them out hastily , neither delivered He them into the hand of Joshua .
KJ21	Judges	3	3	namely : five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon , from Mount Baalhermon unto the entrance of Hamath .
KJ21	Judges	3	2	( only so that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war , at least such as before knew nothing thereof ) ,
KJ21	Judges	3	4	And they were to test Israel by them , to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord , which He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses .
KJ21	Judges	3	5	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites , Hittites , and Amorites , and Perizzites , and Hivites , and Jebusites .
KJ21	Judges	3	6	And they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their daughters to their sons , and served their gods .
KJ21	Judges	3	7	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord , and forgot the Lord their God , and served the Baalim and the Asherahs .
KJ21	Judges	3	8	Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and He sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim , king of Mesopotamia ; and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years .
KJ21	Judges	3	9	And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel who delivered them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s younger brother .
KJ21	Judges	3	10	And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him , and he judged Israel and went out to war ; and the Lord delivered Chushanrishathaim , king of Mesopotamia , into his hand . And his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim ;
KJ21	Judges	3	11	and the land had rest forty years , and Othniel the son of Kenaz died .
KJ21	Judges	3	12	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord ; and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord .
KJ21	Judges	3	13	And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek , and went and smote Israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
KJ21	Judges	3	14	So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years .
KJ21	Judges	3	15	But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised them up a deliverer , Ehud the son of Gera , a Benjamite , a man lefthanded ; and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab .
KJ21	Judges	3	16	But Ehud made himself a dagger which had two edges , of a cubit length ; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh .
KJ21	Judges	3	17	And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab . And Eglon was a very fat man .
KJ21	Judges	3	18	And when he had made an end of offering the present , he sent away the people who bore the present .
KJ21	Judges	3	19	But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal and said , “ I have a secret errand unto thee , O king , ” who said , “ Keep silence ! ” And all who stood by him went out from him .
KJ21	Judges	3	20	And Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlor , which he had for himself alone . And Ehud said , “ I have a message from God unto thee. ” And he arose out of his seat .
KJ21	Judges	3	21	And Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly .
KJ21	Judges	3	22	And the haft also went in after the blade , and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out .
KJ21	Judges	3	23	Then Ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the parlor upon him , and locked them .
KJ21	Judges	3	24	When he had gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parlor were locked , they said , “ Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. ”
KJ21	Judges	3	25	And they tarried till they were ashamed ; and behold , he opened not the doors of the parlor . Therefore they took a key and opened them ; and behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
KJ21	Judges	3	26	And Ehud escaped while they tarried , and passed beyond the quarries and escaped unto Seirah .
KJ21	Judges	3	27	And it came to pass , when he had come , that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim ; and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount , and he before them .
KJ21	Judges	3	28	And he said unto them , “ Follow after me , for the Lord hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. ” And they went down after him , and took the fords of the Jordan toward Moab , and suffered not a man to pass over .
KJ21	Judges	3	29	And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , all lusty and all men of valor ; and there escaped not a man .
KJ21	Judges	3	30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel . And the land had rest fourscore years .
KJ21	Judges	3	31	And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath , who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad ; and he also delivered Israel .
KJ21	Judges	4	4	And Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lapidoth , judged Israel at that time .
KJ21	Judges	4	2	And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan , who reigned in Hazor , the captain of whose host was Sisera , who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles .
KJ21	Judges	4	3	And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord ; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron , and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	4	5	And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in Mount Ephraim , and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
KJ21	Judges	4	6	And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali , and said unto him , “ Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded , saying , ‘ Go and draw near Mount Tabor , and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun ;
KJ21	Judges	4	7	and I will draw unto thee Sisera , the captain of Jabin ’ s army , with his chariots and his multitude to the River Kishon ; and I will deliver him into thine hand ’ ? ”
KJ21	Judges	4	8	And Barak said unto her , “ If thou wilt go with me , then I will go ; but if thou wilt not go with me , then I will not go. ”
KJ21	Judges	4	9	And she said , “ I will surely go with thee . Notwithstanding , the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor , for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. ” And Deborah arose , and went with Barak to Kedesh .
KJ21	Judges	4	10	And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh , and he went up with ten thousand men at his heels ; and Deborah went up with him .
KJ21	Judges	4	11	( Now Heber the Kenite , who was of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses , had severed himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim , which is by Kedesh . )
KJ21	Judges	4	12	And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor .
KJ21	Judges	4	13	And Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon .
KJ21	Judges	4	14	And Deborah said unto Barak , “ Up ! For this is the day in which the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand . Has not the Lord gone out before thee ? ” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor , and ten thousand men after him .
KJ21	Judges	4	15	And the Lord discomfited Sisera and all his chariots and all his host with the edge of the sword before Barak , so that Sisera alighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feet .
KJ21	Judges	4	16	But Barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto Harosheth of the Gentiles ; and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword , and there was not a man left .
KJ21	Judges	4	17	However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite , for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
KJ21	Judges	4	18	And Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said unto him , “ Turn in , my lord , turn in to me . Fear not. ” And when he had turned in unto her into the tent , she covered him with a mantle .
KJ21	Judges	4	19	And he said unto her , “ Give me , I pray thee , a little water to drink ; for I am thirsty. ” And she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
KJ21	Judges	4	20	Again he said unto her , “ Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man doth come and inquire of thee and say , ‘ Is there any man here ? ’ that thou shalt say , ‘ No. ’ ”
KJ21	Judges	4	21	Then Jael , Heber ’ s wife , took a nail of the tent and took a hammer in her hand , and went softly unto him and smote the nail into his temples , and fastened it into the ground ; for he was fast asleep and weary . So he died .
KJ21	Judges	4	22	And behold , as Barak pursued Sisera , Jael came out to meet him and said unto him , “ Come , and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. ” And when he came into her tent , behold , Sisera lay dead , and the nail was in his temples .
KJ21	Judges	4	23	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	4	24	And the hand of the children of Israel prospered , and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
KJ21	Judges	5	5	The mountains melted from before the Lord , even that Sinai , from before the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	5	2	“ Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel , when the people willingly offered themselves .
KJ21	Judges	5	3	“ Hear , O ye kings ; give ear , O ye princes . I , even I , will sing unto the Lord ; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	5	4	“ Lord , when Thou wentest out of Seir , when Thou marched out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled and the heavens dropped , the clouds also dropped water .
KJ21	Judges	5	6	“ In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were unoccupied , and the travelers walked through byways .
KJ21	Judges	5	7	The inhabitants of the villages ceased , they ceased in Israel , until I , Deborah , arose , I arose a mother in Israel .
KJ21	Judges	5	8	They chose new gods ; then was war in the gates . Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel ?
KJ21	Judges	5	9	My heart is toward the governors of Israel that offered themselves willingly among the people . Bless ye the Lord .
KJ21	Judges	5	10	“ Speak , ye that ride on white asses , ye that sit in judgment and walk by the way .
KJ21	Judges	5	11	They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water , there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord , even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of His villages in Israel . Then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates .
KJ21	Judges	5	12	“ Awake , awake , Deborah ! Awake , awake , utter a song ! Arise , Barak , and lead thy captivity captive , thou son of Abinoam .
KJ21	Judges	5	13	“ Then He made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people ; the Lord made me have dominion over the mighty .
KJ21	Judges	5	14	Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek ; after thee , Benjamin , among thy people ; out of Machir came down governors , and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
KJ21	Judges	5	15	And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah , even Issachar , and also Barak ; he was sent on foot into the valley . In the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart .
KJ21	Judges	5	16	Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds , to hear the bleatings of the flocks ? In the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart .
KJ21	Judges	5	17	Gilead abode beyond the Jordan ; and why did Dan remain in ships ? Asher continued on the seashore and abode in his sheltered coves .
KJ21	Judges	5	18	Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeopardized their lives unto the death in the high places of the field .
KJ21	Judges	5	19	“ The kings came and fought ; then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo ; they took no gain of money .
KJ21	Judges	5	20	They fought from heaven ; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera .
KJ21	Judges	5	21	The river of Kishon swept them away , that ancient river , the river Kishon . O my soul , thou hast trodden down strength !
KJ21	Judges	5	22	Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the prancings , the prancings of their mighty ones .
KJ21	Judges	5	23	“ ‘ Curse ye Meroz , ’ said the angel of the Lord ; ‘ curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof , because they came not to the help of the Lord , to the help of the Lord against the mighty. ’
KJ21	Judges	5	24	“ Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be ; blessed shall she be above women in the tent .
KJ21	Judges	5	25	He asked water , and she gave him milk ; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish .
KJ21	Judges	5	26	She put her hand to the nail , and her right hand to the workmen ’ s hammer . And with the hammer she smote Sisera ; she smote off his head , when she had pierced and stricken through his temples .
KJ21	Judges	5	27	At her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down ; at her feet he bowed , he fell ; where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
KJ21	Judges	5	28	“ The mother of Sisera looked out at a window , and cried through the lattice : ‘ Why is his chariot so long in coming ? Why tarry the wheels of his chariots ? ’
KJ21	Judges	5	29	Her wise ladies answered her , yea , she returned answer to herself :
KJ21	Judges	5	30	‘ Have they not sped ? Have they not divided the prey : to every man a damsel or two , to Sisera a prey of divers colors , a prey of divers colors of needlework , of divers colors of needlework on both sides , meet for the necks of them that take the spoil ? ’
KJ21	Judges	5	31	“ So let all Thine enemies perish , O Lord ! But let them that love Him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. ” And the land had rest forty years .
KJ21	Judges	6	6	And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites , and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord .
KJ21	Judges	6	2	And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel ; and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made for themselves the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds .
KJ21	Judges	6	3	And so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the East , even they came up against them .
KJ21	Judges	6	4	And they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto Gaza , and left no sustenance for Israel , neither sheep nor ox nor ass .
KJ21	Judges	6	5	For they came up with their cattle and their tents , and they came as grasshoppers for multitude , for both they and their camels were without number ; and they entered into the land to destroy it .
KJ21	Judges	6	7	And it came to pass , when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites ,
KJ21	Judges	6	8	that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , who said unto them , “ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
KJ21	Judges	6	9	and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you , and drove them out from before you , and gave you their land .
KJ21	Judges	6	10	And I said unto you : ‘ I am the Lord your God . Fear not the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell. ’ But ye have not obeyed My voice. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	11	And there came an angel of the Lord , and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite ; and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the Midianites .
KJ21	Judges	6	12	And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him , “ The Lord is with thee , thou mighty man of valor. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	13	And Gideon said unto him , “ Oh my lord , if the Lord be with us , why then has all this befallen us ? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us of , saying , ‘ Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt ? ’ But now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	14	And the Lord looked upon him , and said , “ Go in this thy might , and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites . Have not I sent thee ? ”
KJ21	Judges	6	15	And he said unto Him , “ Oh my Lord , with what shall I save Israel ? Behold , my family is poor in Manasseh , and I am the least in my father ’ s house. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	16	And the Lord said unto him , “ Surely I will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	17	And he said unto Him , “ If now I have found grace in Thy sight , then show me a sign that Thou talkest with me .
KJ21	Judges	6	18	Depart not hence , I pray Thee , until I come unto Thee and bring forth my present and set it before Thee. ” And He said , “ I will tarry until thou come again. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	19	And Gideon went in , and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour . The flesh he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it .
KJ21	Judges	6	20	And the angel of God said unto him , “ Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes , and lay them upon this rock , and pour out the broth. ” And he did so .
KJ21	Judges	6	21	Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand , and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes ; and there rose up fire out of the rock , and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes . Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight .
KJ21	Judges	6	22	And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord , Gideon said , “ Alas , O Lord God ! For I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	23	And the Lord said unto him , “ Peace be unto thee ; fear not : thou shalt not die. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	24	Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovahshalom [ that is , The Lord send peace ] . Unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
KJ21	Judges	6	25	And it came to pass the same night , that the Lord said unto him , “ Take thy father ’ s young bullock , even the second bullock of seven years old , and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath , and cut down the Asherah pole that is by it ;
KJ21	Judges	6	26	and build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock in the ordered place , and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the Asherah pole which thou shalt cut down. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the Lord had said unto him . And so it was , because he feared his father ’ s household and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , so that he did it by night .
KJ21	Judges	6	28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was cast down and the Asherah pole was cut down that was by it , and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built .
KJ21	Judges	6	29	And they said one to another , “ Who hath done this thing ? ” And when they inquired and asked , they said , “ Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	30	Then the men of the city said unto Joash , “ Bring out thy son , that he may die , because he hath cast down the altar of Baal and because he hath cut down the Asherah pole that was by it. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	31	And Joash said unto all who stood against him , “ Will ye plead for Baal ? Will ye save him ? He that will plead for him , let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning . If he be a god , let him plead for himself , because one hath cast down his altar. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	32	Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal , saying , “ Let Baal plead against him , because he hath thrown down his altar. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the East were gathered together , and went over and pitched camp in the Valley of Jezreel .
KJ21	Judges	6	34	But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon , and he blew a trumpet ; and the Abiezrites were gathered after him .
KJ21	Judges	6	35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh , who also were gathered after him ; and he sent messengers unto Asher and unto Zebulun and unto Naphtali , and they came up to meet them .
KJ21	Judges	6	36	And Gideon said unto God , “ If Thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as Thou hast said—
KJ21	Judges	6	37	behold , I will put a fleece of wool on the floor ; and if the dew be on the fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall I know that Thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as Thou hast said. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	38	And it was so ; for he rose up early on the morrow , and thrust the fleece together , and wrung the dew out of the fleece , a bowl full of water .
KJ21	Judges	6	39	And Gideon said unto God , “ Let not Thine anger be hot against me , and I will speak but this once . Let me prove , I pray Thee , but this once with the fleece : Let it now be dry only upon the fleece , and upon all the ground let there be dew. ”
KJ21	Judges	6	40	And God did so that night ; for it was dry upon the fleece only , and there was dew on all the ground .
KJ21	Judges	7	7	And the Lord said unto Gideon , “ By the three hundred men who lapped will I save you and deliver the Midianites into thine hand , and let all the other people go every man unto his place. ”
KJ21	Judges	7	2	And the Lord said unto Gideon , “ The people who are with thee are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands , lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me , saying , ‘ Mine own hand hath saved me. ’
KJ21	Judges	7	3	Now therefore go , proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , ‘ Whosoever is fearful and afraid , let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead. ’ ” And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand , and there remained ten thousand .
KJ21	Judges	7	4	And the Lord said unto Gideon , “ The people are yet too many . Bring them down unto the water , and I will try them for thee there . And it shall be that of whom I say unto thee , ‘ This shall go with thee , ’ the same shall go with thee ; and of whomsoever I say unto thee , ‘ This shall not go with thee , ’ the same shall not go. ”
KJ21	Judges	7	5	So he brought down the people unto the water ; and the Lord said unto Gideon , “ Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth , him shalt thou set by himself ; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink. ”
KJ21	Judges	7	6	And the number of those who lapped , putting their hand to their mouth , was three hundred men ; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water .
KJ21	Judges	7	8	So the people took victuals in their hand , and their trumpets ; and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent , and retained those three hundred men . And the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley .
KJ21	Judges	7	9	And it came to pass the same night that the Lord said unto him , “ Arise , get thee down unto the host , for I have delivered it into thine hand .
KJ21	Judges	7	10	But if thou fear to go down , go thou with Purah thy servant down to the host ,
KJ21	Judges	7	11	and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. ” Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outside of the armed men who were in the host .
KJ21	Judges	7	12	And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the East lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand by the seaside for multitude .
KJ21	Judges	7	13	And when Gideon had come , behold , there was a man who told a dream unto his fellow , and said , “ Behold , I dreamed a dream ; and lo , a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian and came unto a tent , and smote it so that it fell , and overturned it so that the tent lay flat. ”
KJ21	Judges	7	14	And his fellow answered and said , “ This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash , a man of Israel , for into his hand hath God delivered Midian and all the host. ”
KJ21	Judges	7	15	And it was so , when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof , that he worshiped , and returned into the host of Israel and said , “ Arise , for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian. ”
KJ21	Judges	7	16	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trumpet in every man ’ s hand , with empty pitchers and lamps within the pitchers .
KJ21	Judges	7	17	And he said unto them , “ Look on me and do likewise ; and behold , when I come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that as I do , so shall ye do .
KJ21	Judges	7	18	When I blow with a trumpet , I and all that are with me , then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say , ‘ The sword of the Lord and of Gideon ! ’ ”
KJ21	Judges	7	19	So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch , and they had but newly set the watch ; and they blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands .
KJ21	Judges	7	20	And the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers , and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands to blow therewith , and they cried , “ The sword of the Lord and of Gideon ! ”
KJ21	Judges	7	21	And they stood every man in his place round about the camp , and all the host ran and cried and fled .
KJ21	Judges	7	22	And the three hundred blew the trumpets ; and the Lord set every man ’ s sword against his fellow , even throughout all the host ; and the host fled to Bethshittah towards Zererah and to the border of Abelmeholah unto Tabbath .
KJ21	Judges	7	23	And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali and out of Asher and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after the Midianites .
KJ21	Judges	7	24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all Mount Ephraim , saying , “ Come down against the Midianites , and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and the Jordan. ” Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together , and took the waters unto Bethbarah and the Jordan .
KJ21	Judges	7	25	And they took two princes of the Midianites , Oreb and Zeeb ; and they slew Oreb upon the rock of Oreb , and Zeeb they slew at the wine press of Zeeb , and pursued Midian , and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan .
KJ21	Judges	8	8	And he went up thence to Penuel and spoke unto them likewise , and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him .
KJ21	Judges	8	2	And he said unto them , “ What have I done now in comparison with you ? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer ?
KJ21	Judges	8	3	God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb . And what was I able to do in comparison with you ? ” Then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that .
KJ21	Judges	8	4	And Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over , he and the three hundred men who were with him , faint , yet pursuing them .
KJ21	Judges	8	5	And he said unto the men of Succoth , “ Give , I pray you , loaves of bread unto the people who follow me , for they are faint , and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna , kings of Midian. ”
KJ21	Judges	8	6	And the princes of Succoth said , “ Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thine army ? ”
KJ21	Judges	8	7	And Gideon said , “ Therefore when the Lord hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand , then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. ”
KJ21	Judges	8	9	And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel , saying , “ When I come again in peace , I will break down this tower. ”
KJ21	Judges	8	10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the East ; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword .
KJ21	Judges	8	11	And Gideon went up by the way of those who dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and smote the host ; for the host was secure .
KJ21	Judges	8	12	And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled , he pursued after them and took the two kings of Midian , Zebah and Zalmunna , and discomfited all the host .
KJ21	Judges	8	13	And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up ,
KJ21	Judges	8	14	and caught a young man of the men of Succoth and inquired of him ; and he wrote down for him the princes of Succoth and the elders thereof , even threescore and seventeen men .
KJ21	Judges	8	15	And he came unto the men of Succoth and said , “ Behold Zebah and Zalmunna , with whom ye did upbraid me , saying , ‘ Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thy men who are weary ? ’ ”
KJ21	Judges	8	16	And he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he taught the men of Succoth .
KJ21	Judges	8	17	And he beat down the tower of Penuel , and slew the men of the city .
KJ21	Judges	8	18	Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna , “ What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor ? ” And they answered , “ As thou art , so were they ; each one resembled the children of a king. ”
KJ21	Judges	8	19	And he said , “ They were my brethren , even the sons of my mother . As the Lord liveth , if ye had saved them alive , I would not slay you. ”
KJ21	Judges	8	20	And he said unto Jether his firstborn , “ Up , and slay them. ” But the youth drew not his sword ; for he feared , because he was yet a youth .
KJ21	Judges	8	21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said , “ Rise thou , and fall upon us ; for as the man is , so is his strength. ” And Gideon arose and slew Zebah and Zalmunna , and took away the ornaments that were on their camels ’ necks .
KJ21	Judges	8	22	Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon , “ Rule thou over us , both thou and thy son and thy son ’ s son also ; for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian. ”
KJ21	Judges	8	23	And Gideon said unto them , “ I will not rule over you , neither shall my son rule over you : the Lord shall rule over you. ”
KJ21	Judges	8	24	And Gideon said unto them , “ I would make a request of you , that ye would give me every man the earrings from his spoil. ” ( For they had golden earrings , because they were Ishmaelites . )
KJ21	Judges	8	25	And they answered , “ We will willingly give them. ” And they spread a garment , and cast therein every man the earrings from his spoil .
KJ21	Judges	8	26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold , besides ornaments and collars and purple raiment that were on the kings of Midian , and besides the chains that were about their camels ’ necks .
KJ21	Judges	8	27	And Gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city , even in Ophrah . And all Israel went thither a whoring after it , which thing became a snare unto Gideon and to his house .
KJ21	Judges	8	28	Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon .
KJ21	Judges	8	29	And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house .
KJ21	Judges	8	30	And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten , for he had many wives .
KJ21	Judges	8	31	And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son , whose name he called Abimelech .
KJ21	Judges	8	32	And Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age , and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
KJ21	Judges	8	33	And it came to pass , as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again and went a whoring after the Baalim , and made Baalberith their god .
KJ21	Judges	8	34	And the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side ;
KJ21	Judges	8	35	neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal ( namely , Gideon ) , according to all the goodness which he had shown unto Israel .
KJ21	Judges	9	9	But the olive tree said unto them , ‘ Should I leave my fatness , withwhich by me they honor God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ? ’
KJ21	Judges	9	2	“ Speak , I pray you , in the ears of all the men of Shechem : ‘ Which is better for you , either that all the sons of Jerubbaal , which are threescore and ten persons , reign over you , or that one reign over you ? ’ Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh. ”
KJ21	Judges	9	3	And his mother ’ s brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words ; and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech , for they said , “ He is our brother. ”
KJ21	Judges	9	4	And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith , with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons , who followed him .
KJ21	Judges	9	5	And he went unto his father ’ s house at Ophrah and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal , being threescore and ten persons , upon one stone . Notwithstanding , yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left , for he hid himself .
KJ21	Judges	9	6	And all the men of Shechem gathered together , and all the house of Bethmillo , and went and made Abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem .
KJ21	Judges	9	7	And when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice and cried , and said unto them , “ Hearken unto me , ye men of Shechem , that God may hearken unto you .
KJ21	Judges	9	8	The trees went forth once to anoint a king over them ; and they said unto the olive tree , ‘ Reign thou over us. ’
KJ21	Judges	9	10	And the trees said to the fig tree , ‘ Come thou , and reign over us. ’
KJ21	Judges	9	11	But the fig tree said unto them , ‘ Should I forsake my sweetness and my good fruit , and go to be promoted over the trees ? ’
KJ21	Judges	9	12	Then said the trees unto the vine , ‘ Come thou , and reign over us. ’
KJ21	Judges	9	13	And the vine said unto them , ‘ Should I leave my wine , which cheereth God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ? ’
KJ21	Judges	9	14	Then said all the trees unto the bramble , ‘ Come thou , and reign over us. ’
KJ21	Judges	9	15	And the bramble said unto the trees , ‘ If in truth ye anoint me king over you , then come and put your trust in my shadow ; and if not , let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon. ’
KJ21	Judges	9	16	“ Now therefore , if ye have done truly and sincerely in that ye have made Abimelech king , and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands
KJ21	Judges	9	17	( for my father fought for you , and ventured his life far , and delivered you out of the hand of Midian ;
KJ21	Judges	9	18	and ye have risen up against my father ’ s house this day and have slain his sons , threescore and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his maidservant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ) ,
KJ21	Judges	9	19	if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then rejoice ye in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you .
KJ21	Judges	9	20	But if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and devour the men of Shechem and the house of Bethmillo ; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from the house of Bethmillo , and devour Abimelech. ”
KJ21	Judges	9	21	And Jotham ran away and fled , and went to Beer and dwelt there for fear of Abimelech his brother .
KJ21	Judges	9	22	When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel ,
KJ21	Judges	9	23	then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech ,
KJ21	Judges	9	24	that the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come , and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother , who slew them , and upon the men of Shechem , who aided him in the killing of his brethren .
KJ21	Judges	9	25	And the men of Shechem set liersinwait for him in the top of the mountains , and they robbed all who came along that way by them ; and it was told Abimelech .
KJ21	Judges	9	26	And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren and went over to Shechem , and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him .
KJ21	Judges	9	27	And they went out into the fields , and gathered their vineyards , and trod the grapes , and made merry , and went into the house of their god , and ate and drank and cursed Abimelech .
KJ21	Judges	9	28	And Gaal the son of Ebed said , “ Who is Abimelech , and who is Shechem , that we should serve him ? Is not he the son of Jerubbaal , and Zebul his officer ? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem . For why should we serve him ?
KJ21	Judges	9	29	And would to God this people were under my hand ! Then would I remove Abimelech. ” And he said to Abimelech , “ Increase thine army , and come out ! ”
KJ21	Judges	9	30	And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , his anger was kindled .
KJ21	Judges	9	31	And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily , saying , “ Behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren have come to Shechem ; and behold , they fortify the city against thee .
KJ21	Judges	9	32	Now therefore , up by night , thou and the people who are with thee , and lie in wait in the field .
KJ21	Judges	9	33	And it shall be that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , thou shalt rise early and set upon the city ; and behold , when he and the people who are with him come out against thee , then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion. ”
KJ21	Judges	9	34	And Abimelech rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they lay in wait against Shechem in four companies .
KJ21	Judges	9	35	And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city ; and Abimelech rose up , and the people who were with him , from lying in wait .
KJ21	Judges	9	36	And when Gaal saw the people , he said to Zebul , “ Behold , there come people down from the top of the mountains. ” And Zebul said unto him , “ Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men. ”
KJ21	Judges	9	37	And Gaal spoke again and said , “ See , there come people down by the middle of the land , and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim. ”
KJ21	Judges	9	38	Then said Zebul unto him , “ Where now is thy mouth , wherewith thou saidst , ‘ Who is Abimelech , that we should serve him ? ’ Are not these the people whom thou hast despised ? Go out , I pray now , and fight with them. ”
KJ21	Judges	9	39	And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem , and fought with Abimelech .
KJ21	Judges	9	40	And Abimelech chased him , and he fled before him ; and many were overthrown and wounded , even unto the entrance of the gate .
KJ21	Judges	9	41	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah ; and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren , that they should not dwell in Shechem .
KJ21	Judges	9	42	And it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out into the field , and they told Abimelech .
KJ21	Judges	9	43	And he took the people and divided them into three companies , and lay in wait in the field , and looked , and behold , the people had come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them and smote them .
KJ21	Judges	9	44	And Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city ; and the two other companies ran upon all the people who were in the fields and slew them .
KJ21	Judges	9	45	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and slew the people who were therein , and beat down the city and sowed it with salt .
KJ21	Judges	9	46	And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that , they entered into a stronghold of the house of the god Berith .
KJ21	Judges	9	47	And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together .
KJ21	Judges	9	48	And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon , he and all the people who were with him ; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees , and took it and laid it on his shoulder , and said unto the people who were with him , “ What ye have seen me do , make haste and do as I have done. ”
KJ21	Judges	9	49	And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and followed Abimelech , and put them to the stronghold , and set the stronghold on fire upon them , so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
KJ21	Judges	9	50	Then went Abimelech to Thebez , and encamped against Thebez and took it .
KJ21	Judges	9	51	But there was a strong tower within the city , and thither fled all the men and women and all those of the city , and shut it to them and went up to the top of the tower .
KJ21	Judges	9	52	And Abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it , and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
KJ21	Judges	9	53	And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech ’ s head and broke his skull .
KJ21	Judges	9	54	Then he called hastily unto the young man , his armorbearer , and said unto him , “ Draw thy sword and slay me , that men say not of me , ‘ A woman slew him. ’ ” And his young man thrust him through , and he died .
KJ21	Judges	9	55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , they departed every man unto his place .
KJ21	Judges	9	56	Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech , which he did unto his father in slaying his seventy brethren .
KJ21	Judges	9	57	And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned upon their heads , and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .
KJ21	Judges	10	10	And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , saying , “ We have sinned against Thee , both because we have forsaken our God and also served the Baalim. ”
KJ21	Judges	10	2	And he judged Israel twenty and three years , and died and was buried in Shamir .
KJ21	Judges	10	3	And after him arose Jair , a Gileadite , and judged Israel twenty and two years .
KJ21	Judges	10	4	And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty ass colts ; and they had thirty cities , which are called Havothjair [ the villages of Jair ] unto this day , which are in the land of Gilead .
KJ21	Judges	10	5	And Jair died , and was buried in Camon .
KJ21	Judges	10	6	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord , and served the Baalim , and Ashtaroth , and the gods of Syria , and the gods of Sidon , and the gods of Moab , and the gods of the children of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines , and forsook the Lord and served not Him .
KJ21	Judges	10	7	And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the children of Ammon .
KJ21	Judges	10	8	And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel eighteen years — all the children of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites , which is in Gilead .
KJ21	Judges	10	9	Moreover the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim , so that Israel was sore distressed .
KJ21	Judges	10	11	And the Lord said unto the children of Israel , “ Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites , from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines ?
KJ21	Judges	10	12	The Sidonians also and the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you ; and ye cried to Me , and I delivered you out of their hand .
KJ21	Judges	10	13	Yet ye have forsaken Me and served other gods : therefore I will deliver you no more .
KJ21	Judges	10	14	Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen . Let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. ”
KJ21	Judges	10	15	And the children of Israel said unto the Lord , “ We have sinned ! Do Thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto Thee . Deliver us only , we pray Thee , this day. ”
KJ21	Judges	10	16	And they put away the strange gods from among them and served the Lord ; and His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	10	17	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead . And the children of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in Mizpah .
KJ21	Judges	10	18	And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another , “ What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon ? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . ”
KJ21	Judges	11	11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and captain over them ; and Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpah .
KJ21	Judges	11	2	And Gilead ’ s wife bore him sons ; and his wife ’ s sons grew up , and they thrust out Jephthah and said unto him , “ Thou shalt not inherit in our father ’ s house , for thou art the son of a strange woman. ”
KJ21	Judges	11	3	Then Jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of Tob ; and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah , and went out with him .
KJ21	Judges	11	4	And it came to pass in process of time that the children of Ammon made war against Israel .
KJ21	Judges	11	5	And it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob .
KJ21	Judges	11	6	And they said unto Jephthah , “ Come , and be our captain , that we may fight with the children of Ammon. ”
KJ21	Judges	11	7	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead , “ Did not ye hate me , and expel me out of my father ’ s house ? And why have ye come unto me now when ye are in distress ? ”
KJ21	Judges	11	8	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , “ Therefore we turn again to thee now , that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of Ammon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. ”
KJ21	Judges	11	9	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead , “ If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon , and the Lord deliver them before me , shall I be your head ? ”
KJ21	Judges	11	10	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , “ The Lord be witness between us if we do not so , according to thy words. ”
KJ21	Judges	11	12	And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon , saying , “ What hast thou to do with me , that thou hast come against me to fight in my land ? ”
KJ21	Judges	11	13	And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah , “ Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt , from Arnon even unto Jabbok and unto the Jordan . Now therefore restore those lands again peaceably. ”
KJ21	Judges	11	14	And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon ,
KJ21	Judges	11	15	and said unto him , “ Thus saith Jephthah : Israel took not away the land of Moab , nor the land of the children of Ammon ;
KJ21	Judges	11	16	but when Israel came up from Egypt , and walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea and came to Kadesh ,
KJ21	Judges	11	17	then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom , saying , ‘ Let me , I pray thee , pass through thy land. ’ But the king of Edom would not hearken thereto . And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab , but he would not consent ; and Israel abode in Kadesh .
KJ21	Judges	11	18	Then they went along through the wilderness , and compassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab , and came by the east side of the land of Moab and pitched camp on the other side of Arnon , but came not within the border of Moab ; for Arnon was the border of Moab .
KJ21	Judges	11	19	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon ; and Israel said unto him , ‘ Let us pass , we pray thee , through thy land into my place. ’
KJ21	Judges	11	20	But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his borders ; but Sihon gathered all his people together and pitched camp in Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
KJ21	Judges	11	21	And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they smote them . So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites , the inhabitants of that country .
KJ21	Judges	11	22	And they possessed all the borders of the Amorites , from Arnon even unto Jabbok and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan .
KJ21	Judges	11	23	“ So now the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel . And shouldest thou possess it ?
KJ21	Judges	11	24	Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess ? So whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us , them will we possess .
KJ21	Judges	11	25	And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? Did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them
KJ21	Judges	11	26	while Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns , and in Aroer and her towns , and in all the cities that are along by the borders of Arnon , three hundred years ? Why therefore did ye not recover them within that time ?
KJ21	Judges	11	27	Therefore I have not sinned against thee , but thou doest me wrong to war against me . The Lord , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. ”
KJ21	Judges	11	28	However the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him .
KJ21	Judges	11	29	Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpah of Gilead ; and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon .
KJ21	Judges	11	30	And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord , and said , “ If Thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands ,
KJ21	Judges	11	31	then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , shall surely be the Lord ’ S , and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. ”
KJ21	Judges	11	32	So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them , and the Lord delivered them into his hands .
KJ21	Judges	11	33	And he smote them from Aroer even till thou come to Minnith , even twenty cities , and unto the plain of the vineyards with a very great slaughter . Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	11	34	And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house , and behold , his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances ; and she was his only child . Besides her he had neither son nor daughter .
KJ21	Judges	11	35	And it came to pass , when he saw her , that he rent his clothes and said , “ Alas , my daughter ! Thou hast brought me very low , and thou art one of them that trouble me ; for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord , and I can not go back. ”
KJ21	Judges	11	36	And she said unto him , “ My father , if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord , do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth , forasmuch as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies , even of the children of Ammon. ”
KJ21	Judges	11	37	And she said unto her father , “ Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity , I and my fellows. ”
KJ21	Judges	11	38	And he said , “ Go. ” And he sent her away for two months ; and she went with her companions , and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains .
KJ21	Judges	11	39	And it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed ; and she knew no man . And it was a custom in Israel
KJ21	Judges	11	40	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year .
KJ21	Judges	12	12	And Elon the Zebulonite died , and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun .
KJ21	Judges	12	2	And Jephthah said unto them , “ I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon ; and when I called you , ye delivered me not out of their hands .
KJ21	Judges	12	3	And when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands and passed over against the children of Ammon , and the Lord delivered them into my hand . Why then have ye come up unto me this day to fight against me ? ”
KJ21	Judges	12	4	Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim ; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim , because they said , “ Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites. ”
KJ21	Judges	12	5	And the Gileadites seized the passages of the Jordan before the Ephraimites ; and it was so , that when those Ephraimites who had escaped said , “ Let me go over , ” that the men of Gilead said unto him , “ Art thou an Ephraimite ? ” If he said , “ Nay , ”
KJ21	Judges	12	6	then said they unto him , “ Say now Shibboleth. ” And he said “ Sibboleth , ” for he could not frame to pronounce it right . Then they took him and slew him at the passages of the Jordan ; and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand .
KJ21	Judges	12	7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years . Then died Jephthah the Gileadite , and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead .
KJ21	Judges	12	8	And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel .
KJ21	Judges	12	9	And he had thirty sons , and thirty daughters whom he sent abroad , and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons . And he judged Israel seven years .
KJ21	Judges	12	10	Then died Ibzan , and was buried at Bethlehem .
KJ21	Judges	12	11	And after him Elon , a Zebulonite , judged Israel ; and he judged Israel ten years .
KJ21	Judges	12	13	And after him Abdon the son of Hillel , a Pirathonite , judged Israel .
KJ21	Judges	12	14	And he had forty sons and thirty grandsons , who rode on threescore and ten ass colts ; and he judged Israel eight years .
KJ21	Judges	12	15	And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the mount of the Amalekites .
KJ21	Judges	13	13	And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah , “ Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware .
KJ21	Judges	13	2	And there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren and bore not .
KJ21	Judges	13	3	And the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her , “ Behold now , thou art barren and bearest not ; but thou shalt conceive and bear a son .
KJ21	Judges	13	4	Now therefore beware , I pray thee , and drink not wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing .
KJ21	Judges	13	5	For , lo , thou shalt conceive and bear a son ; and no razor shall come on his head , for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb . And he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. ”
KJ21	Judges	13	6	Then the woman came and told her husband , saying , “ A man of God came unto me , and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God , very fearsome ; but I asked him not from whence he was , neither told he me his name .
KJ21	Judges	13	7	But he said unto me , ‘ Behold , thou shalt conceive and bear a son . And now drink no wine nor strong drink , neither eat any unclean thing ; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death. ’ ”
KJ21	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah entreated the Lord , and said , “ O my Lord , let the man of God which Thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. ”
KJ21	Judges	13	9	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah , and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field ; but Manoah her husband was not with her .
KJ21	Judges	13	10	And the woman made haste and ran , and showed her husband and said unto him , “ Behold , the man hath appeared unto me , that came unto me the other day. ”
KJ21	Judges	13	11	And Manoah arose and went after his wife , and came to the man and said unto him , “ Art thou the man that spokest unto the woman ? ” And he said , “ I am. ”
KJ21	Judges	13	12	And Manoah said , “ Now let thy words come to pass . How shall we order the child , and how shall we do unto him ? ”
KJ21	Judges	13	14	She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing . All that I commanded her let her observe. ”
KJ21	Judges	13	15	And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord , “ I pray thee , let us detain thee until we shall have made ready a kid for thee. ”
KJ21	Judges	13	16	And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah , “ Though thou detain me , I will not eat of thy bread ; and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the Lord. ” For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord .
KJ21	Judges	13	17	And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord , “ What is thy name , that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honor ? ”
KJ21	Judges	13	18	And the angel of the Lord said unto him , “ Why askest thou thus after my name , seeing it is secret ? ”
KJ21	Judges	13	19	So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering , and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord ; and the angel did wondrously , and Manoah and his wife looked on .
KJ21	Judges	13	20	For it came to pass , when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar , that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar . And Manoah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
KJ21	Judges	13	21	But the angel of the Lord appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife . Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord .
KJ21	Judges	13	22	And Manoah said unto his wife , “ We shall surely die , because we have seen God. ”
KJ21	Judges	13	23	But his wife said unto him , “ If the Lord were pleased to kill us , He would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands , neither would He have shown us all these things nor would He , as at this time , have told us such things as these. ”
KJ21	Judges	13	24	And the woman bore a son , and called his name Samson ; and the child grew , and the Lord blessed him .
KJ21	Judges	13	25	And the Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol .
KJ21	Judges	14	14	And he said unto them , “ Out of the eater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness. ” And they could not in three days expound the riddle .
KJ21	Judges	14	2	And he came up and told his father and his mother , and said , “ I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines . Now therefore get her for me for a wife. ”
KJ21	Judges	14	3	Then his father and his mother said unto him , “ Is there not a woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my people , that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines ? ” And Samson said unto his father , “ Get her for me , for she pleaseth me well. ”
KJ21	Judges	14	4	But his father and his mother knew not that it was because of the Lord , and that He sought an occasion against the Philistines . For at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel .
KJ21	Judges	14	5	Then went Samson and his father and his mother down to Timnah , and came to the vineyards of Timnah ; and behold , a young lion roared against him .
KJ21	Judges	14	6	And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a kid , and he had nothing in his hand ; but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
KJ21	Judges	14	7	And he went down and talked with the woman , and she pleased Samson well .
KJ21	Judges	14	8	And after a time he returned to take her , and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion ; and behold , there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion .
KJ21	Judges	14	9	And he took thereof in his hands and went on eating , and came to his father and mother ; and he gave to them , and they ate . But he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion .
KJ21	Judges	14	10	So his father went down unto the woman ; and Samson made there a feast , for so used the young men to do .
KJ21	Judges	14	11	And it came to pass , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
KJ21	Judges	14	12	And Samson said unto them , “ I will now put forth a riddle unto you . If ye can with certainty explain it to me within the seven days of the feast and find it out , then I will give you thirty shirts and thirty changes of garments ;
KJ21	Judges	14	13	but if ye can not explain it to me , then shall ye give me thirty shirts and thirty changes of garments. ” And they said unto him , “ Put forth thy riddle , that we may hear it. ”
KJ21	Judges	14	15	And it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto Samson ’ s wife , “ Entice thy husband , that he may explain unto us the riddle , lest we burn thee and thy father ’ s house with fire . Have ye called us to take what we have ? Is it not so ? ”
KJ21	Judges	14	16	And Samson ’ s wife wept before him , and said , “ Thou dost but hate me , and lovest me not . Thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people , and hast not told it me. ” And he said unto her , “ Behold , I have not told it to my father nor my mother , and shall I tell it to thee ? ”
KJ21	Judges	14	17	And she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted . And it came to pass on the seventh day that he told her , because she pressed sorely upon him ; and she told the riddle to the children of her people .
KJ21	Judges	14	18	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down : “ What is sweeter than honey ? And what is stronger than a lion ? ” And he said unto them , “ If ye had not plowed with my heifer , ye would not have found out my riddle. ”
KJ21	Judges	14	19	And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him ; and he went down to Ashkelon , and slew thirty men of them and took their apparel , and gave changes of garments unto those who expounded the riddle . And his anger was kindled , and he went up to his father ’ s house .
KJ21	Judges	14	20	But Samson ’ s wife was given to his companion , whom he had used as his friend .
KJ21	Judges	15	15	And he found a new jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand and took it , and slew a thousand men therewith .
KJ21	Judges	15	2	And her father said , “ I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her . Therefore I gave her to thy companion . Is not her younger sister fairer than she ? Take her , I pray thee , instead of her. ”
KJ21	Judges	15	3	And Samson said concerning them , “ Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines , though I do them a displeasure. ”
KJ21	Judges	15	4	And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes , and took firebrands , and turned tail to tail , and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails .
KJ21	Judges	15	5	And when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines , and burned up both the shocks and also the standing corn , with the vineyards and olives .
KJ21	Judges	15	6	Then the Philistines said , “ Who hath done this ? ” And they answered , “ Samson , the son-in-law of the Timnite , because he had taken his wife and given her to his companion. ” And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire .
KJ21	Judges	15	7	And Samson said unto them , “ Though ye have done this , yet will I be avenged of you , and after that I will cease ” ;
KJ21	Judges	15	8	and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter . And he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock of Etam .
KJ21	Judges	15	9	Then the Philistines went up and pitched camp in Judah , and spread themselves in Lehi .
KJ21	Judges	15	10	And the men of Judah said , “ Why have ye come up against us ? ” And they answered , “ To bind Samson have we come up , to do to him as he hath done to us. ”
KJ21	Judges	15	11	Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock of Etam , and said to Samson , “ Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us ? What is this that thou hast done unto us ? ” And he said unto them , “ As they did unto me , so have I done unto them. ”
KJ21	Judges	15	12	And they said unto him , “ We have come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. ” And Samson said unto them , “ Swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves. ”
KJ21	Judges	15	13	And they spoke unto him , saying , “ No , but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hand ; but surely we will not kill thee. ” And they bound him with two new cords , and brought him up from the rock .
KJ21	Judges	15	14	And when he came unto Lehi , the Philistines shouted against him . And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him ; and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burned with fire , and his bands loosed from off his hands .
KJ21	Judges	15	16	And Samson said , “ With the jawbone of an ass , heaps upon heaps , with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men. ”
KJ21	Judges	15	17	And it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand , and called that place Ramathlehi [ that is , The lifting up of the jawbone ] .
KJ21	Judges	15	18	And he was sore athirst , and called on the Lord and said , “ Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of Thy servant . And now shall I die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ? ”
KJ21	Judges	15	19	But God cleaved a hollow place that was in the jaw , and there came water thereout ; and when he had drunk , his spirit came again and he revived . Therefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore [ that is , The well of him that called or cried ] , which is in Lehi unto this day .
KJ21	Judges	15	20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years .
KJ21	Judges	16	16	And it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him , so that his soul was vexed unto death ,
KJ21	Judges	16	2	And it was told the Gazites , saying , “ Samson has come hither. ” And they compassed him in , and lay in wait for him all night in the gate of the city , and were quiet all the night , saying , “ In the morning when it is day , we shall kill him. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	3	And Samson lay till midnight , and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts , and went away with them , bar and all , and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before Hebron .
KJ21	Judges	16	4	And it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
KJ21	Judges	16	5	And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her and said unto her , “ Entice him , and see wherein his great strength lieth and by what means we may prevail against him , that we may bind him to afflict him ; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	6	And Delilah said to Samson , “ Tell me , I pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	7	And Samson said unto her , “ If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried , then shall I be weak and be as another man. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
KJ21	Judges	16	9	Now there were men lying in wait , abiding with her in the chamber . And she said unto him , “ The Philistines be upon thee , Samson. ” And he broke the withes as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire . So his strength was not known .
KJ21	Judges	16	10	And Delilah said unto Samson , “ Behold , thou hast mocked me and told me lies . Now tell me , I pray thee , wherewith thou mightest be bound. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	11	And he said unto her , “ If they bind me fast with new ropes wherewith work hath not been done , then shall I be weak and be as another man. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	12	Delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him therewith , and said unto him , “ The Philistines be upon thee , Samson. ” And there were liersinwait abiding in the chamber . And he broke them from off his arms like a thread .
KJ21	Judges	16	13	And Delilah said unto Samson , “ Hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies . Tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. ” And he said unto her , “ If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	14	And she fastened it with the pin , and said unto him , “ The Philistines be upon thee , Samson. ” And he awakened out of his sleep , and went away with the pin of the beam and with the web .
KJ21	Judges	16	15	And she said unto him , “ How canst thou say , ‘ I love thee , ’ when thine heart is not with me ? Thou hast mocked me these three times , and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	17	that he told her all his heart and said unto her , “ There hath not come a razor upon mine head , for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my mother ’ s womb . If I be shaven , then my strength will go from me , and I shall become weak and be like any other man. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	18	And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart , she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines , saying , “ Come up this once , for he hath shown me all his heart. ” Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand .
KJ21	Judges	16	19	And she made him sleep upon her knees . And she called for a man , and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to afflict him , and his strength went from him .
KJ21	Judges	16	20	And she said , “ The Philistines be upon thee , Samson. ” And he awoke out of his sleep and said , “ I will go out as at other times before , and shake myself. ” And he knew not that the Lord had departed from him .
KJ21	Judges	16	21	But the Philistines took him and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he did grinding in the prison house .
KJ21	Judges	16	22	However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven .
KJ21	Judges	16	23	Then the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god and to rejoice , for they said , “ Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand ! ”
KJ21	Judges	16	24	And when the people saw him , they praised their god ; for they said , “ Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country who slew many of us. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	25	And it came to pass , when their hearts were merry , that they said , “ Call for Samson , that he may make sport for us. ” And they called for Samson out of the prison house , and they made sport of him and they set him between the pillars .
KJ21	Judges	16	26	And Samson said unto the lad who held him by the hand , “ Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth , that I may lean upon them. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	27	Now the house was full of men and women , and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women who beheld while they made sport of Samson .
KJ21	Judges	16	28	And Samson called unto the Lord and said , “ O Lord God , remember me , I pray Thee , and strengthen me , I pray Thee , only this once , O God , that I may be at once avenged on the Philistines for my two eyes. ”
KJ21	Judges	16	29	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was borne up , the one with his right hand and the other with his left .
KJ21	Judges	16	30	And Samson said , “ Let me die with the Philistines. ” And he bowed himself with all his might ; and the house fell upon the lords , and upon all the people who were therein . So the dead which he slew at his death were more than those whom he slew in his life .
KJ21	Judges	16	31	Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and took him , and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying place of Manoah his father . And he judged Israel twenty years .
KJ21	Judges	17	17	And there was a man of Mount Ephraim , whose name was Micah .
KJ21	Judges	17	2	And he said unto his mother , “ The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee , about which thou cursed and spokest of also in mine ears , behold , the silver is with me ; I took it. ” And his mother said , “ Blessed be thou of the Lord , my son. ”
KJ21	Judges	17	3	And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother , his mother said , “ I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the Lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image . Now therefore I will restore it unto thee. ”
KJ21	Judges	17	4	Yet he restored the money unto his mother . And his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a founder , who made thereof a graven image and a molten image ; and they were in the house of Micah .
KJ21	Judges	17	5	And the man Micah had a house of gods , and made an ephod and teraphim , and consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest .
KJ21	Judges	17	6	( In those days there was no king in Israel , but every man did that which was right in his own eyes . )
KJ21	Judges	17	7	And there was a young man out of Bethlehem in Judah of the family of Judah , who was a Levite , and he sojourned there .
KJ21	Judges	17	8	And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place ; and he came to Mount Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he journeyed .
KJ21	Judges	17	9	And Micah said unto him , “ From whence comest thou ? ” And he said unto him , “ I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah , and I go to sojourn where I may find a place. ”
KJ21	Judges	17	10	And Micah said unto him , “ Dwell with me and be unto me a father and a priest , and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year , and a suit of apparel and thy victuals. ” So the Levite went in .
KJ21	Judges	17	11	And the Levite was content to dwell with the man , and the young man was unto him as one of his sons .
KJ21	Judges	17	12	And Micah consecrated the Levite ; and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of Micah .
KJ21	Judges	17	13	Then said Micah , “ Now know I that the Lord will do me good , seeing I have a Levite as my priest . ”
KJ21	Judges	18	18	And these went into Micah ’ s house and fetched the carved image , the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image . Then said the priest unto them , “ What do ye ? ”
KJ21	Judges	18	2	And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their borders , men of valor from Zorah and from Eshtaol , to spy out the land and to search it . And they said unto them , “ Go , search the land , ” who , when they came to Mount Ephraim to the house of Micah , they lodged there .
KJ21	Judges	18	3	When they were by the house of Micah , they knew the voice of the young man , the Levite ; and they turned in thither and said unto him , “ Who brought thee hither ? And what makest thou in this place ? And what hast thou here ? ”
KJ21	Judges	18	4	And he said unto them , “ Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me and hath hired me , and I am his priest. ”
KJ21	Judges	18	5	And they said unto him , “ Ask counsel , we pray thee , of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous. ”
KJ21	Judges	18	6	And the priest said unto them , “ Go in peace . Your way wherein ye go is before the Lord. ”
KJ21	Judges	18	7	Then the five men departed and came to Laish , and saw the people who were therein , how they dwelt free from care , after the manner of the Sidonians , quiet and secure . And there was no magistrate in the land who might put them to shame in any thing , and they were far from the Sidonians and had no business with any man .
KJ21	Judges	18	8	And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol ; and their brethren said unto them , “ What say ye ? ”
KJ21	Judges	18	9	And they said , “ Arise , that we may go up against them ; for we have seen the land , and behold , it is very good . And are ye still ? Be not slothful to go and to enter to possess the land .
KJ21	Judges	18	10	When ye go , ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large land . For God hath given it into your hands , a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth. ”
KJ21	Judges	18	11	And there went from thence of the family of the Danites , out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol , six hundred men appointed with weapons of war .
KJ21	Judges	18	12	And they went up and pitched camp in Kirjathjearim in Judah . Therefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day ; behold , it is behind Kirjathjearim .
KJ21	Judges	18	13	And they passed from thence unto Mount Ephraim and came unto the house of Micah .
KJ21	Judges	18	14	Then answered the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish , and said unto their brethren , “ Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod and teraphim , and a graven image and a molten image ? Now therefore consider what ye have to do. ”
KJ21	Judges	18	15	And they turned in that direction , and came to the house of the young man , the Levite , even unto the house of Micah , and saluted him .
KJ21	Judges	18	16	And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
KJ21	Judges	18	17	And the five men who went to spy out the land went up and came in thither , and took the graven image and the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image ; and the priest stood in the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men who were appointed with weapons of war .
KJ21	Judges	18	19	And they said unto him , “ Hold thy peace . Lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us , and be to us a father and a priest . Is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man , or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel ? ”
KJ21	Judges	18	20	And the priest ’ s heart was glad ; and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image , and went in the midst of the people .
KJ21	Judges	18	21	So they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the cattle and their baggage in front of them .
KJ21	Judges	18	22	And when they were a good way from the house of Micah , the men who were in the houses near to Micah ’ s house were gathered together and overtook the children of Dan .
KJ21	Judges	18	23	And they cried unto the children of Dan ; and they turned their faces and said unto Micah , “ What aileth thee , that thou comest with such a company ? ”
KJ21	Judges	18	24	And he said , “ Ye have taken away my gods which I made and the priest , and ye have gone away . And what have I more ? And what is this that ye say unto me , ‘ What aileth thee ? ’ ”
KJ21	Judges	18	25	And the children of Dan said unto him , “ Let not thy voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the lives of thy household. ”
KJ21	Judges	18	26	And the children of Dan went their way ; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back unto his house .
KJ21	Judges	18	27	And they took the things which Micah had made and the priest whom he had , and came unto Laish , unto a people who were at quiet and secure ; and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire .
KJ21	Judges	18	28	And there was no deliverer , because it was far from Sidon , and they had no business with any man ; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob . And they built a city and dwelt therein ;
KJ21	Judges	18	29	and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel . However , the name of the city was Laish at the first .
KJ21	Judges	18	30	And the children of Dan set up the graven image ; and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Manasseh , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
KJ21	Judges	18	31	And they set up for themselves Micah ’ s graven image which he made , all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh .
KJ21	Judges	19	19	Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses , and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young man who is with thy servants . There is no want of any thing. ”
KJ21	Judges	19	2	And his concubine played the whore against him , and went away from him unto her father ’ s house to Bethlehem in Judah , and was there four whole months .
KJ21	Judges	19	3	And her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto her and to bring her back , having his servant with him and a couple of asses . And she brought him into her father ’ s house ; and when the father of the damsel saw him , he rejoiced to meet him .
KJ21	Judges	19	4	And his father-in-law , the damsel ’ s father , entertained him , and he tarried with him three days ; so they ate and drank and lodged there .
KJ21	Judges	19	5	And it came to pass on the fourth day , when they arose early in the morning , that he rose up to depart ; and the damsel ’ s father said unto his son-in-law , “ Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go your way. ”
KJ21	Judges	19	6	And they sat down and ate and drank both of them together ; for the damsel ’ s father had said unto the man , “ Be content , I pray thee , and tarry all night , and let thine heart be merry. ”
KJ21	Judges	19	7	And when the man rose up to depart , his father-in-law urged him ; therefore he lodged there again .
KJ21	Judges	19	8	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart ; and the damsel ’ s father said , “ Comfort thine heart , I pray thee. ” And they tarried until afternoon , and they ate both of them .
KJ21	Judges	19	9	And when the man rose up to depart , he and his concubine and his servant , his father-in-law , the damsel ’ s father , said unto him , “ Behold , now the day draweth toward evening . I pray you tarry all night . Behold , the day groweth to an end . Lodge here , that thine heart may be merry ; and tomorrow get you early on your way , that thou mayest go home. ”
KJ21	Judges	19	10	But the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came opposite Jebus , which is Jerusalem . And there were with him two asses saddled . His concubine also was with him .
KJ21	Judges	19	11	And when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said unto his master , “ Come , I pray thee , and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it. ”
KJ21	Judges	19	12	And his master said unto him , “ We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger that is not of the children of Israel . We will pass over to Gibeah. ”
KJ21	Judges	19	13	And he said unto his servant , “ Come , and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night , in Gibeah or in Ramah. ”
KJ21	Judges	19	14	And they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah , which belongeth to Benjamin .
KJ21	Judges	19	15	And they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in Gibeah ; and when he went in , he sat down in a street of the city , for there was no man who took them into his house for lodging .
KJ21	Judges	19	16	And behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening , who was also of Mount Ephraim ; and he sojourned in Gibeah , but the men of the place were Benjamites .
KJ21	Judges	19	17	And when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city ; and the old man said , “ Whither goest thou ? And from whence comest thou ? ”
KJ21	Judges	19	18	And he said unto him , “ We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the side of Mount Ephraim ; from thence am I . And I went to Bethlehem in Judah , but I am now going to the house of the Lord ; and there is no man who receiveth me to his house .
KJ21	Judges	19	20	And the old man said , “ Peace be with thee . Howsoever , let all thy wants lie upon me . Only lodge not in the street. ”
KJ21	Judges	19	22	Now as they were making their hearts merry , behold , the men of the city , certain sons of Belial , beset the house round about and beat at the door , and spoke to the master of the house , the old man , saying , “ Bring forth the man who came into thine house , that we may know him. ”
KJ21	Judges	19	23	And the man , the master of the house , went out unto them and said unto them , “ Nay , my brethren ! Nay , I pray you , do not so wickedly ! Seeing that this man has come into mine house , do not this folly .
KJ21	Judges	19	24	Behold , here is my daughter , a maiden , and his concubine . Them I will bring out now , and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth good unto you ; but unto this man do not so vile a thing ! ”
KJ21	Judges	19	25	But the men would not hearken to him . So the man took his concubine and brought her forth unto them , and they knew her and abused her all the night until the morning ; and when the day began to spring , they let her go .
KJ21	Judges	19	26	Then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man ’ s house where her lord was , till it was light .
KJ21	Judges	19	27	And her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and behold , the woman , his concubine , had fallen down at the door of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
KJ21	Judges	19	28	And he said unto her , “ Up , and let us be going. ” But none answered . Then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up and went unto his place .
KJ21	Judges	19	29	And when he had come into his house , he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her , together with her bones , into twelve pieces , and sent her into all the regions of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	19	30	And it was so , that all who saw it said , “ There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day . Consider it , take counsel , and speak your minds . ”
KJ21	Judges	20	20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin , and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah .
KJ21	Judges	20	2	And the chief of all the people , even of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen who drew the sword .
KJ21	Judges	20	3	( Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . ) Then said the children of Israel , “ Tell us , how was this wickedness ? ”
KJ21	Judges	20	4	And the Levite , the husband of the woman who was slain , answered and said , “ I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin , I and my concubine , to lodge .
KJ21	Judges	20	5	And the men of Gibeah rose against me , and beset the house round about upon me by night , and thought to have slain me ; and my concubine have they forced , so that she is dead .
KJ21	Judges	20	6	And I took my concubine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel ; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel .
KJ21	Judges	20	7	Behold , ye are all children of Israel . Give here your advice and counsel. ”
KJ21	Judges	20	8	And all the people arose as one man , saying , “ We will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
KJ21	Judges	20	9	But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah : We will go up by lot against it ;
KJ21	Judges	20	10	and we will take ten men out of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel , and a hundred out of a thousand , and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victuals for the people , that they may do , when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin , according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel. ”
KJ21	Judges	20	11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
KJ21	Judges	20	12	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , “ What wickedness is this that is done among you ?
KJ21	Judges	20	13	Now therefore , deliver us the men , the children of Belial , who are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel. ” But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren , the children of Israel ;
KJ21	Judges	20	14	but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	20	15	And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men who drew the sword , besides the inhabitants of Gibeah , who were numbered seven hundred chosen men .
KJ21	Judges	20	16	Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men , lefthanded . Every one could sling stones at a hairbreadth and not miss .
KJ21	Judges	20	17	And the men of Israel , besides Benjamin , were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword . All these were men of war .
KJ21	Judges	20	18	And the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God , and asked counsel of God and said , “ Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin ? ” And the Lord said , “ Judah shall go up first. ”
KJ21	Judges	20	19	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah .
KJ21	Judges	20	21	And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men .
KJ21	Judges	20	22	And the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves and set up again in battle array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
KJ21	Judges	20	23	And the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until evening , and asked counsel of the Lord , saying , “ Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin , my brother ? ” And the Lord said , “ Go up against him. ”
KJ21	Judges	20	24	And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day .
KJ21	Judges	20	25	And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
KJ21	Judges	20	26	Then all the children of Israel and all the people went up , and came unto the house of God and wept , and sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
KJ21	Judges	20	27	And the children of Israel inquired of the Lord ( for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days ,
KJ21	Judges	20	28	and Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , stood before it in those days ) , saying , “ Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin , my brother , or shall I cease ? ” And the Lord said , “ Go up , for tomorrow I will deliver them into thine hand. ”
KJ21	Judges	20	29	And Israel set liersinwait round about Gibeah .
KJ21	Judges	20	30	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
KJ21	Judges	20	31	And the children of Benjamin went out against the people , and were drawn away from the city ; and they began to smite some of the people and kill , as at other times , in the highways ( of which one goeth up to the house of God and the other to Gibeah in the field ) , about thirty men of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	20	32	And the children of Benjamin said , “ They are smitten down before us , as at the first. ” But the children of Israel said , “ Let us flee and draw them from the city unto the highways. ”
KJ21	Judges	20	33	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place , and put themselves in array at Baaltamar ; and the liersinwait of Israel came forth out of their places , even out of the meadows of Gibeah .
KJ21	Judges	20	34	And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was sore ; but they knew not that evil was near them .
KJ21	Judges	20	35	And the Lord smote Benjamin before Israel ; and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men ; all these drew the sword .
KJ21	Judges	20	36	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten ; for the men of Israel gave way to the Benjamites , because they trusted in the liersinwait whom they had set against Gibeah .
KJ21	Judges	20	37	And the liersinwait hastened and rushed upon Gibeah ; and the liersinwait drew themselves along , and smote all the city with the edge of the sword .
KJ21	Judges	20	38	Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liersinwait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city .
KJ21	Judges	20	39	And when the men of Israel retired in the battle , Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons ; for they said , “ Surely they are smitten down before us , as in the first battle. ”
KJ21	Judges	20	40	But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them , and behold , the flame of the city ascended up to heaven .
KJ21	Judges	20	41	And when the men of Israel turned again , the men of Benjamin were amazed ; for they saw that evil had come upon them .
KJ21	Judges	20	42	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness , but the battle overtook them ; and those who came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them .
KJ21	Judges	20	43	Thus they enclosed the Benjamites round about , and chased them and trod them down with ease opposite Gibeah toward the sunrising .
KJ21	Judges	20	44	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men . All these were men of valor .
KJ21	Judges	20	45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon ; and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men , and pursued hard after them unto Gidom and slew two thousand men of them .
KJ21	Judges	20	46	So all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men who drew the sword . All these were men of valor .
KJ21	Judges	20	47	But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon , and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months .
KJ21	Judges	20	48	And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword , as well the men of every city and the beast , and all that came to hand . Also they set on fire all the cities that they came to .
KJ21	Judges	21	21	and see . And behold , if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances , then come ye out of the vineyards and catch you every man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh , and go to the land of Benjamin .
KJ21	Judges	21	2	And the people came to the house of God , and remained there till evening before God , and lifted up their voices and wept sorely ,
KJ21	Judges	21	3	and said , “ O Lord God of Israel , why has this come to pass in Israel , that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel ? ”
KJ21	Judges	21	4	And it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early and built there an altar , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
KJ21	Judges	21	5	And the children of Israel said , “ Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who came not up with the congregation unto the Lord ? ” For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the Lord to Mizpah , saying , “ He shall surely be put to death. ”
KJ21	Judges	21	6	And the children of Israel repented for Benjamin their brother and said , “ There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
KJ21	Judges	21	7	What shall we do for wives for those who remain , seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them from our daughters for wives ? ”
KJ21	Judges	21	8	And they said , “ What one is there of the tribes of Israel who came not up to Mizpah to the Lord ? ” And behold , there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly .
KJ21	Judges	21	9	For the people were numbered , and behold , there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there .
KJ21	Judges	21	10	And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the most valiant and commanded them , saying , “ Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword , along with the women and the children .
KJ21	Judges	21	11	And this is the thing that ye shall do : Ye shall utterly destroy every male and every woman that hath lain with a man. ”
KJ21	Judges	21	12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins who had known no man by lying with any male ; and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
KJ21	Judges	21	13	And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon and to proclaim peace unto them .
KJ21	Judges	21	14	And Benjamin came again at that time , and they gave them wives whom they had saved alive from the women of Jabeshgilead ; and yet so they sufficed them not .
KJ21	Judges	21	15	And the people repented for Benjamin , because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	21	16	Then the elders of the congregation said , “ What shall we do for wives for those who remain , seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin ? ”
KJ21	Judges	21	17	And they said , “ There must be an inheritance for those who have escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel .
KJ21	Judges	21	18	However that be , we may not give them wives from our daughters ; for the children of Israel have sworn , saying , ‘ Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin. ’ ”
KJ21	Judges	21	19	Then they said , “ Behold , there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel , on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah. ”
KJ21	Judges	21	20	Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin , saying , “ Go and lie in wait in the vineyards ,
KJ21	Judges	21	22	And it shall be , when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain , that we will say unto them , ‘ Be favorable unto them for our sakes , because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war ; for ye did not give unto them at this time , that ye should be guilty. ’ ”
KJ21	Judges	21	23	And the children of Benjamin did so , and took for themselves wives according to their number from those who danced whom they caught ; and they went and returned unto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and dwelt in them .
KJ21	Judges	21	24	And the children of Israel departed from thence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family ; and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance .
KJ21	Judges	21	25	In those days there was no king in Israel ; every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
KJ21	Ruth	1	1	Now it came to pass , in the days when the judges ruled , that there was a famine in the land . And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab , he and his wife and his two sons .
KJ21	Ruth	1	2	And the name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi , and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion , Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah . And they came into the country of Moab , and continued there .
KJ21	Ruth	1	3	And Elimelech , Naomi ’ s husband , died ; and she was left , and her two sons .
KJ21	Ruth	1	4	And they took themselves wives of the women of Moab : the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth . And they dwelt there about ten years .
KJ21	Ruth	1	5	And Mahlon and Chilion died also , both of them ; and the woman was left without her two sons and her husband .
KJ21	Ruth	1	6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law , that she might return from the country of Moab , for she had heard in the country of Moab how the Lord had visited His people in giving them bread .
KJ21	Ruth	1	7	Therefore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters-in-law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah .
KJ21	Ruth	1	8	And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law , “ Go , return each to your mother ’ s house . The Lord deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead and with me .
KJ21	Ruth	1	9	The Lord grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband. ” Then she kissed them , and they lifted up their voice and wept .
KJ21	Ruth	1	10	And they said unto her , “ Surely we will return with thee unto thy people. ”
KJ21	Ruth	1	11	And Naomi said , “ Turn back , my daughters . Why will ye go with me ? Are there yet any more sons in my womb , that they may be your husbands ?
KJ21	Ruth	1	12	Turn back , my daughters , go your way ; for I am too old to have a husband . If I should say I have hope , if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons ,
KJ21	Ruth	1	13	would ye tarry for them until they were grown ? Would ye refrain for them from having husbands ? Nay , my daughters , for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me. ”
KJ21	Ruth	1	14	And they lifted up their voice and wept again ; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law , but Ruth cleaved unto her .
KJ21	Ruth	1	15	And she said , “ Behold , thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her gods . Return thou after thy sister-in-law. ”
KJ21	Ruth	1	16	And Ruth said : “ Entreat me not to leave thee , or to return from following after thee ; for whither thou goest , I will go , and where thou lodgest , I will lodge . Thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God .
KJ21	Ruth	1	17	Where thou diest will I die , and there will I be buried ; the Lord do so to me , and more also , if aught but death part thee and me. ”
KJ21	Ruth	1	18	When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her , then she left off speaking unto her .
KJ21	Ruth	1	19	So the two went until they came to Bethlehem . And it came to pass , when they had come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved concerning them ; and they said , “ Is this Naomi ? ”
KJ21	Ruth	1	20	And she said unto them , “ Call me not Naomi [ that is , Pleasant ] . Call me Mara [ that is , Bitter ] , for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me .
KJ21	Ruth	1	21	I went out full , and the Lord hath brought me home again empty . Why then call ye me Naomi , seeing the Lord hath testified against me and the Almighty hath afflicted me ? ”
KJ21	Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her , who returned out of the country of Moab ; and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
KJ21	Ruth	2	2	And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi , “ Let me now go to the field , and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. ” And she said unto her , “ Go , my daughter. ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	3	And she went , and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers ; and she happened to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
KJ21	Ruth	2	4	And behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said unto the reapers , “ The Lord be with you. ” And they answered him , “ The Lord bless thee. ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	5	Then said Boaz unto his servant who was set over the reapers , “ Whose damsel is this ? ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	6	And the servant who was set over the reapers answered and said , “ It is the Moabite damsel who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab .
KJ21	Ruth	2	7	And she said , ‘ I pray you , let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. ’ So she came and hath continued even from the morning until now , except she tarried a little in the house. ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	8	Then said Boaz unto Ruth , “ Hearest thou not , my daughter ? Go not to glean in another field , neither go from hence , but abide here fast by my maidens .
KJ21	Ruth	2	9	Let thine eyes be on the field that they reap , and go thou after them . Have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee ? And when thou art athirst , go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn. ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	10	Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , “ Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take notice of me , seeing I am a stranger ? ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	11	And Boaz answered and said unto her , “ It hath fully been shown to me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband , and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity , and hast come unto a people whom thou knewest not heretofore .
KJ21	Ruth	2	12	The Lord recompense thy work , and a full reward be given thee from the Lord God of Israel , under whose wings thou hast come to trust. ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	13	Then she said , “ Let me find favor in thy sight , my lord ; for thou hast comforted me , and thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid , though I am not like unto one of thine handmaidens. ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	14	And Boaz said unto her , “ At mealtime come thou hither , and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. ” And she sat beside the reapers ; and he passed to her parched corn , and she ate and was sufficed , and left .
KJ21	Ruth	2	15	And when she had risen up to glean , Boaz commanded his young men , saying , “ Let her glean even among the sheaves , and reproach her not .
KJ21	Ruth	2	16	And let fall also some of the handfuls purposely for her ; and leave them , that she may glean them , and rebuke her not. ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until evening , and beat out what she had gleaned ; and it was about an ephah of barley .
KJ21	Ruth	2	18	And she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned ; and she brought it forth and gave to her what she had reserved after she was sufficed .
KJ21	Ruth	2	19	And her mother-in-law said unto her , “ Where hast thou gleaned today ? And where wroughtest thou ? Blessed be he that took notice of thee. ” And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked , and said , “ The man ’ s name with whom I wrought today is Boaz. ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	20	And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law , “ Blessed be he of the Lord , who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. ” And Naomi said unto her , “ The man is near of kin unto us , one of our next kinsmen. ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	21	And Ruth the Moabitess said , “ He said unto me also , ‘ Thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest. ’ ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	22	And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law , “ It is good , my daughter , that thou go out with his maidens , that they meet thee not in any other field. ”
KJ21	Ruth	2	23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest , and dwelt with her mother-in-law .
KJ21	Ruth	3	3	Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee , and put thy raiment upon thee , and get thee down to the floor ; but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking .
KJ21	Ruth	3	2	And now is not Boaz of our kindred , with whose maidens thou wast ? Behold , he winnoweth barley tonight at the threshing floor .
KJ21	Ruth	3	4	And it shall be , when he lieth down , that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie ; and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet , and lay thee down , and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. ”
KJ21	Ruth	3	5	And she said unto her , “ All that thou sayest unto me I will do. ”
KJ21	Ruth	3	6	And she went down unto the floor , and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her .
KJ21	Ruth	3	7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn ; and she came softly , and uncovered his feet and laid herself down .
KJ21	Ruth	3	8	And it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid , and turned himself ; and behold , a woman lay at his feet .
KJ21	Ruth	3	9	And he said , “ Who art thou ? ” And she answered , “ I am Ruth , thine handmaid . Spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid , for thou art a near kinsman. ”
KJ21	Ruth	3	10	And he said , “ Blessed be thou of the Lord , my daughter ; for thou hast shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning , inasmuch as thou followed not young men , whether poor or rich .
KJ21	Ruth	3	11	And now , my daughter , fear not . I will do for thee all that thou requirest , for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman .
KJ21	Ruth	3	12	And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman ; however that be , there is a kinsman nearer than I .
KJ21	Ruth	3	13	Tarry this night , and it shall be in the morning , that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman , well . Let him do the kinsman ’ s part . But if he will not do the part of a kinsman for thee , then will I do the part of a kinsman for thee , as the Lord liveth . Lie down until the morning. ”
KJ21	Ruth	3	14	And she lay at his feet until the morning ; and she rose up before one could know another . And he said , “ Let it not be known that a woman came unto the floor. ”
KJ21	Ruth	3	15	Also he said , “ Bring the veil that thou hast upon thee and hold it. ” And when she held it , he measured six measures of barley , and laid it on her ; and she went into the city .
KJ21	Ruth	3	16	And when she came to her mother-in-law , she said , “ Who art thou , my daughter ? ” And she told her all that the man had done to her .
KJ21	Ruth	3	17	And she said , “ These six measures of barley gave he me ; for he said to me , ‘ Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law. ’ ”
KJ21	Ruth	3	18	Then said she , “ Sit still , my daughter , until thou know how the matter will fall ; for the man will not be in rest until he hath finished the thing this day . ”
KJ21	Ruth	4	4	And I thought to advise thee , saying , ‘ Buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people . If thou wilt redeem it , redeem it . But if thou wilt not redeem it , then tell me , that I may know ; for there is none to redeem it besides thee , and I am after thee. ’ ” And he said , “ I will redeem it. ”
KJ21	Ruth	4	2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , “ Sit ye down here. ” And they sat down .
KJ21	Ruth	4	3	And he said unto the kinsman , “ Naomi , who hath come again out of the country of Moab , selleth a parcel of land which was our brother Elimelech ’ s .
KJ21	Ruth	4	5	Then said Boaz , “ What day thou buyest the field from the hand of Naomi , thou must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. ”
KJ21	Ruth	4	6	And the kinsman said , “ I can not redeem it for myself , lest I mar mine own inheritance . Redeem thou my right for thyself , for I can not redeem it. ”
KJ21	Ruth	4	7	Now this was the manner in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging , to confirm all things : a man plucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbor ; and this was a testimony in Israel .
KJ21	Ruth	4	8	Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz , “ Buy it for thyself. ” So he drew off his shoe .
KJ21	Ruth	4	9	And Boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people , “ Ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech ’ s and all that was Chilion ’ s and Mahlon ’ s from the hand of Naomi .
KJ21	Ruth	4	10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of Mahlon , have I purchased to be my wife , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance , that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place . Ye are witnesses this day. ”
KJ21	Ruth	4	11	And all the people who were at the gate and the elders , said , “ We are witnesses . The Lord make the woman who hath come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah , which two built the house of Israel ; and do thou worthily in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem .
KJ21	Ruth	4	12	And let thy house be like the house of Perez , whom Tamar bore unto Judah , of the seed which the Lord shall give thee by this young woman. ”
KJ21	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth , and she was his wife ; and when he went in unto her , the Lord gave her conception and she bore a son .
KJ21	Ruth	4	14	And the women said unto Naomi , “ Blessed be the Lord , who hath not left thee this day without a kinsman , that his name may be famous in Israel .
KJ21	Ruth	4	15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age ; for thy daughter-in-law who loveth thee , who is better to thee than seven sons , hath borne him. ”
KJ21	Ruth	4	16	And Naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom , and became nurse unto it .
KJ21	Ruth	4	17	And the women , her neighbors , gave it a name , saying , “ There is a son born to Naomi ” ; and they called his name Obed . He is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
KJ21	Ruth	4	18	Now these are the generations of Perez : Perez begot Hezron ,
KJ21	Ruth	4	19	and Hezron begot Ram , and Ram begot Amminadab ;
KJ21	Ruth	4	20	and Amminadab begot Nahshon , and Nahshon begot Salmon ;
KJ21	Ruth	4	21	and Salmon begot Boaz , and Boaz begot Obed ;
KJ21	Ruth	4	22	and Obed begot Jesse , and Jesse begot David .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	1	Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim , of Mount Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephraimite .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	2	And he had two wives : the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of the other Peninnah . And Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	3	And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh . And the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , the priests of the Lord , were there .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	4	And when the time was that Elkanah offered , he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters , portions .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	5	But unto Hannah he gave a double portion , for he loved Hannah ; but the Lord had shut up her womb .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	6	And her adversary also provoked her sorely to make her fret , because the Lord had shut up her womb .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	7	And as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the Lord , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept and did not eat .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	8	Then said Elkanah her husband to her , “ Hannah , why weepest thou ? And why eatest thou not ? And why is thy heart grieved ? Am not I better to thee than ten sons ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	9	So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk . ( Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord . )
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	10	And she was in bitterness of soul , and prayed unto the Lord and wept sorely .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	11	And she vowed a vow and said , “ O Lord of hosts , if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thine handmaid , and remember me and not forget Thine handmaid , but wilt give unto Thine handmaid a manchild , then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life , and there shall no razor come upon his head. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	12	And it came to pass , as she continued praying before the Lord , that Eli observed her mouth .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	13	Now Hannah spoke in her heart ; only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard . Therefore Eli thought she had been drunken .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	14	And Eli said unto her , “ How long wilt thou be drunken ? Put away thy wine from thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	15	And Hannah answered and said , “ No , my lord , I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit . I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but have poured out my soul before the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	16	Count not thine handmaid as a daughter of Belial , for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	17	Then Eli answered and said , “ Go in peace ; and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of Him. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	18	And she said , “ Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. ” So the woman went her way and ate , and her countenance was no more sad .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	19	And they rose up in the morning early and worshiped before the Lord , and returned and came to their house at Ramah . And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife , and the Lord remembered her .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	20	Therefore it came to pass , when the time had come about after Hannah had conceived , that she bore a son and called his name Samuel [ that is , Asked of God ] , saying , “ Because I have asked him of the Lord. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	21	And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	22	But Hannah went not up ; for she said unto her husband , “ I will not go up until the child is weaned , and then I will bring him , that he may appear before the Lord and there abide for ever. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	23	And Elkanah her husband said unto her , “ Do what seemeth to thee good . Tarry until thou have weaned him , only the Lord establish His word. ” So the woman remained , and gave her son suck until she weaned him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	24	And when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine , and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh ; and the child was young .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	25	And they slew a bullock , and brought the child to Eli .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	26	And she said , “ Oh my lord , as thy soul liveth , my lord , I am the woman who stood by thee here , praying unto the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	27	For this child I prayed , and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of Him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	1	28	Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord ; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord. ” And he worshiped the Lord there .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	2	There is none holy as the Lord , for there is none besides Thee ; neither is there any rock like our God .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	3	Talk no more so exceeding proudly ; let not arrogance come out of your mouth ; for the Lord is a God of knowledge , and by Him actions are weighed .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	4	“ The bows of the mighty men are broken , and they that stumbled are girded with strength .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	5	They that were full have hired out themselves for bread , and they that were hungry ceased hungering , so that the barren hath borne seven , and she that hath many children is waxed feeble .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	6	“ The Lord killeth and maketh alive ; He bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	7	The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich ; He bringeth low and lifteth up .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	8	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust , and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill , to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory . For the pillars of the earth are the Lord ’ S , and He hath set the world upon them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	9	“ He will keep the feet of His saints , and the wicked shall be silent in darkness ; for by strength shall no man prevail .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	10	The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces ; out of heaven shall He thunder upon them . The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth ; and He shall give strength unto His king and exalt the horn of His anointed. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	11	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house . And the child ministered unto the Lord before Eli the priest .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	12	Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial ; they knew not the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	13	And the priests ’ custom with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice , the priest ’ s servant came , while the flesh was boiling , with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	14	And he struck it into the pan or kettle , or caldron or pot ; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself . So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites who came thither .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	15	Also before they burned the fat , the priest ’ s servant came and said to the man who sacrificed , “ Give flesh to roast for the priest ; for he will not have boiled flesh from thee , but raw. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	16	And if any man said unto him , “ Let them not fail to burn the fat presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth , ” then he would answer him , “ Nay , but thou shalt give it to me now ; and if not , I will take it by force. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	17	Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord , for men abhorred the offering of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	18	But Samuel ministered before the Lord , being a child , girded with a linen ephod .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	19	Moreover his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	20	And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife , and said , “ The Lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the Lord. ” And they went unto their own home .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	21	And the Lord visited Hannah , so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters . And the child Samuel grew before the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	22	Now Eli was very old , and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel , and how they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	23	And he said unto them , “ Why do ye such things ? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	24	Nay , my sons ; for it is no good report that I hear . Ye make the Lord ’ S people to transgress .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	25	If one man sin against another , the judge shall judge him . But if a man sin against the Lord , who shall entreat for him ? ” Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father , because the Lord would slay them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	26	And the child Samuel grew on , and was in favor both with the Lord and also with men .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	27	And there came a man of God unto Eli and said unto him , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh ’ s house ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	28	And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest , to offer upon Mine altar , to burn incense , to wear an ephod before Me ? And did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire from the children of Israel ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	29	Why kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering which I have commanded in My habitation , and honorest thy sons above Me , to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people ? ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	30	Therefore the Lord God of Israel saith : ‘ I said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before Me for ever. ’ But now the Lord saith , ‘ Be it far from Me ; for them that honor Me I will honor , and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	31	Behold , the days come that I will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy father ’ s house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	32	And thou shalt see an enemy in My habitation , in all the wealth which God shall give Israel ; and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	33	And the man of thine , whom I shall not cut off from Mine altar , shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart ; and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	34	And this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas : in one day they shall die , both of them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	35	And I will raise Me up a faithful priest who shall do according to that which is in Mine heart and in My mind ; and I will build him a sure house , and he shall walk before Mine anointed for ever .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	2	36	And it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thine house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread , and shall say , “ Put me , I pray thee , into one of the priests ’ offices , that I may eat a piece of bread . ” ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	3	and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was , and Samuel was lying down to sleep ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	2	And it came to pass at that time , when Eli was lying down in his place , and his eyes began to wax dim so that he could not see ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	4	that the Lord called Samuel ; and he answered , “ Here am I. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	5	And he ran unto Eli and said , “ Here am I , for thou called me. ” And he said , “ I called not ; lie down again. ” And he went and lay down .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	6	And the Lord called yet again , “ Samuel. ” And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said , “ Here am I , for thou didst call me. ” And he answered , “ I called not , my son ; lie down again. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	7	Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord , neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	8	And the Lord called Samuel again the third time . And he arose and went to Eli and said , “ Here am I , for thou didst call me. ” And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	9	Therefore Eli said unto Samuel , “ Go , lie down ; and it shall be , if He call thee , that thou shalt say , ‘ Speak , Lord , for Thy servant heareth. ’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	10	And the Lord came and stood , and called as at other times , “ Samuel , Samuel. ” Then Samuel answered , “ Speak , for Thy servant heareth. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	11	And the Lord said to Samuel , “ Behold , I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of every one who heareth it shall tingle .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	12	In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house . When I begin , I will also make an end ;
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	13	for I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth , because his sons made themselves vile , and he restrained them not .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	14	And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli ’ s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering , for ever. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	15	And Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of the Lord . And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	16	Then Eli called Samuel and said , “ Samuel , my son. ” And he answered , “ Here am I. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	17	And he said , “ What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee ? I pray thee , hide it not from me . God do so to thee , and more also , if thou hide any word from me of all the things that He said unto thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	18	And Samuel told him every whit , and hid nothing from him . And he said , “ It is the Lord . Let Him do what seemeth to Him good. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	19	And Samuel grew , and the Lord was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	20	And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	3	21	And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh , for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	4	So the people sent to Shiloh , that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts , which dwelleth between the cherubims ; and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there with the ark of the covenant of God .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	2	And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel ; and when they joined battle , Israel was smitten before the Philistines , and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	3	And when the people had come into the camp , the elders of Israel said , “ Why hath the Lord smitten us today before the Philistines ? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us , that when it cometh among us , it may save us out of the hand of our enemies. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	5	And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	6	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , “ What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews ? ” And they understood that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	7	And the Philistines were afraid , for they said , “ God has come into the camp ! ” And they said , “ Woe unto us ! For there hath not been such a thing heretofore .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	8	Woe unto us ! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	9	Be strong , and acquit yourselves like men , O ye Philistines , that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews , as they have been to you . Acquit yourselves like men , and fight ! ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	10	And the Philistines fought , and Israel was smitten , and they fled every man into his tent ; and there was a very great slaughter , for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	11	And the ark of God was taken ; and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were slain .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	12	And there ran a man of Benjamin from the army , and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	13	And when he came , lo , Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching ; for his heart trembled for the ark of God . And when the man came into the city and told it , all the city cried out .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	14	And when Eli heard the noise of the crying , he said , “ What meaneth the noise of this tumult ? ” And the man came in hastily and told Eli .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	15	Now Eli was ninety and eight years old , and his eyes were dim so that he could not see .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	16	And the man said unto Eli , “ I am he that came from the army , and I fled today from the army. ” And he said , “ What is done there , my son ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	17	And the messenger answered and said , “ Israel has fled before the Philistines , and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people ; and thy two sons also , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead , and the ark of God is taken. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	18	And it came to pass , when he made mention of the ark of God , that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate , and his neck broke and he died ; for he was an old man , and heavy . And he had judged Israel forty years .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	19	And his daughter-in-law , Phinehas ’ wife , was with child , soon to be delivered . And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken , and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead , she bowed herself and travailed , for her pains came upon her .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	20	And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said unto her , “ Fear not , for thou hast borne a son. ” But she answered not , neither did she regard it .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	21	And she named the child Ichabod [ that is , Where is the glory ? ] , saying , “ The glory has departed from Israel ” —because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	4	22	And she said , “ The glory has departed from Israel , for the ark of God is taken . ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon ’ s house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	2	When the Philistines took the ark of God , they brought it into the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	3	And when those of Ashdod arose early on the morrow , behold , Dagon had fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord . And they took Dagon and set him in his place again .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	4	And when they arose early on the morrow morning , behold , Dagon had fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord ; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold ; only the stump of Dagon was left to him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	6	But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon those of Ashdod , and He destroyed them and smote them with hemorrhoids , even Ashdod and the borders thereof .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	7	And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so , they said , “ The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us , for his hand is sore upon us and upon Dagon our god. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	8	They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them and said , “ What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel ? ” And they answered , “ Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. ” And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	9	And it was so that , after they had carried it about , the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction ; and He smote the men of the city , both small and great , and they had hemorrhoids in their secret parts .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	10	Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron . And it came to pass , as the ark of God came to Ekron , that the Ekronites cried out , saying , “ They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us to slay us and our people. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	11	So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said , “ Send away the ark of the God of Israel , and let it go again to his own place , that it slay us not , and our people. ” For there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city ; the hand of God was very heavy there .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	5	12	And the men who died not were smitten with the hemorrhoids ; and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	6	Why then do ye harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts ? When he had wrought wonderfully among them , did they not let the people go , and they departed ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , “ What shall we do to the ark of the Lord ? Tell us how we shall send it to his place. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	3	And they said , “ If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel , send it not empty ; but in any wise return him a trespass offering . Then ye shall be healed , and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	4	Then said they , “ What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him ? ” They answered , “ Five golden hemorrhoids and five golden mice , according to the number of the lords of the Philistines ; for one plague was on you all and on your lords .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	5	Therefore ye shall make images of your hemorrhoids and images of your mice that mar the land , and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel . Perhaps he will lighten his hand from you and from your gods and from your land .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	7	Now therefore make a new cart , and take two milk cows on which there hath come no yoke , and tie the cows to the cart and bring their calves home from them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	8	And take the ark of the Lord and lay it upon the cart ; and put the jewels of gold , which ye return to him for a trespass offering , in a coffer by the side thereof ; and send it away , that it may go .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	9	And see : If it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh , then he hath done us this great evil . But if not , then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us ; it was a chance that happened to us. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	10	And the men did so ; and took two milk cows and tied them to the cart , and shut up their calves at home .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	11	And they laid the ark of the Lord upon the cart , and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their hemorrhoids .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	12	And the cows took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh , and went along the highway , lowing as they went , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	13	And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley ; and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark , and rejoiced to see it .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	14	And the cart came into the field of Joshua , a Bethshemite , and stood there where there was a great stone . And they cleaved the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering unto the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	15	And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the coffer that was with it , wherein the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone ; and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	16	And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it , they returned to Ekron the same day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	17	And these are the golden hemorrhoids which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the Lord : for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Ashkelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ;
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	18	and the golden mice , according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords , both of fortified cities and of country villages , even unto the great stone of Abel whereon they set down the ark of the Lord , which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua , the Bethshemite .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	19	And He smote the men of Bethshemesh , because they had looked into the ark of the Lord ; even He smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men . And the people lamented because the Lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	20	And the men of Bethshemesh said , “ Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God ? And to whom shall He go up from us ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	6	21	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim , saying , “ The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord . Come ye down and fetch it up to you . ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	7	And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . And when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	2	And it came to pass , while the ark remained in Kirjathjearim , that the time was long , for it was twenty years ; and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	3	And Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel , saying , “ If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts , then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you , and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve Him only ; and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	4	Then the children of Israel put away the Baalim and Ashtaroth , and served the Lord only .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	5	And Samuel said , “ Gather all Israel to Mizpah , and I will pray for you unto the Lord. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	6	And they gathered together at Mizpah , and drew water and poured it out before the Lord , and fasted on that day , and said there , “ We have sinned against the Lord. ” And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	8	And the children of Israel said to Samuel , “ Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us , that He will save us out of the hand of the Philistines. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	9	And Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the Lord ; and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel , and the Lord heard him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	10	And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel ; but the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines and discomfited them , and they were smitten before Israel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah , and pursued the Philistines and smote them until they came under Bethcar .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	12	Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen , and called the name of it Ebenezer [ that is , The stone of help ] , saying , “ Hitherto hath the Lord helped us. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	13	So the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more into the border of Israel ; and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	14	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel , from Ekron even unto Gath ; and the borders thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines . And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	15	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	16	And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah , and judged Israel in all those places .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	7	17	And his return was to Ramah , for there was his house ; and there he judged Israel , and there he built an altar unto the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	8	According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day , wherewith they have forsaken Me and served other gods , so do they also unto thee .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	2	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel , and the name of his second , Abijah ; they were judges in Beersheba .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	3	And his sons walked not in his ways , but turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted judgment .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together , and came to Samuel at Ramah
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	5	and said unto him , “ Behold , thou art old , and thy sons walk not in thy ways . Now make us a king to judge us , like all the nations. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	6	But the thing displeased Samuel when they said , “ Give us a king to judge us. ” And Samuel prayed unto the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	7	And the Lord said unto Samuel , “ Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee ; for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected Me , that I should not reign over them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	9	Now therefore hearken unto their voice . However , yet protest solemnly unto them and show them the ways of the king that shall reign over them. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	10	And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people who asked of him a king .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	11	And he said , “ This will be the manner of the king who shall reign over you : He will take your sons and appoint them for himself , for his chariots and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	12	And he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties , and will set them to till his ground and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	13	And he will take your daughters to be confectioners and to be cooks and to be bakers .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	14	And he will take your fields and your vineyards and your olive yards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	15	And he will take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards , and give to his officers and to his servants .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	16	And he will take your menservants , and your maidservants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his work .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	17	He will take a tenth of your sheep ; and ye shall be his servants .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	18	And ye shall cry out on that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you ; and the Lord will not hear you in that day. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	19	Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel , and they said , “ Nay ; but we will have a king over us ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	20	that we also may be like all the nations , and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	21	And Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he recounted them in the ears of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	8	22	And the Lord said to Samuel , “ Hearken unto their voice , and make them a king. ” And Samuel said unto the men of Israel , “ Go ye every man unto his city . ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	9	( Before this in Israel , when a man went to inquire of God , thus he spoke : “ Come , and let us go to the seer ” ; for he that is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer . )
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	2	And he had a son , whose name was Saul , a choice young man , and a goodly ; and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he . From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	3	And the asses of Kish , Saul ’ s father , were lost . And Kish said to Saul his son , “ Take now one of the servants with thee , and arise , go seek the asses. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	4	And he passed through Mount Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalisha , but they found them not . Then they passed through the land of Shaalim , and there they were not ; and he passed through the land of the Benjamites , but they found them not .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	5	And when they had come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant who was with him , “ Come , and let us return , lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for us. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	6	And he said unto him , “ Behold now , there is in this city a man of God , and he is an honorable man . All that he saith cometh surely to pass . Now let us go thither . Perhaps he can show us our way that we should go. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	7	Then said Saul to his servant , “ But behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? For the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of God . What have we ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	8	And the servant answered Saul again and said , “ Behold , I have here at hand a fourth part of a shekel of silver . That will I give to the man of God to tell us our way. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	10	Then said Saul to his servant , “ Well said ; come , let us go. ” So they went unto the city where the man of God was .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	11	And as they went up the hill to the city , they found young maidens going out to draw water , and said unto them , “ Is the seer here ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	12	And they answered them and said , “ He is ; behold , he is before you . Make haste now , for he came today to the city ; for there is a sacrifice of the people today on the high place .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	13	As soon as ye have come into the city , ye shall straightway find him before he go up to the high place to eat ; for the people will not eat until he come , because he doth bless the sacrifice ; and afterwards they eat that are bidden . Now therefore get you up , for about this time ye shall find him. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	14	And they went up into the city ; and when they had come into the city , behold , Samuel came out toward them to go up to the high place .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	15	Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	16	“ Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin , and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over My people Israel , that he may save My people out of the hand of the Philistines ; for I have looked upon My people , because their cry has come unto Me. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	17	And when Samuel saw Saul , the Lord said unto him , “ Behold the man whom I spoke to thee of ! This same shall reign over My people. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	18	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , “ Tell me , I pray thee , where the seer ’ s house is. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	19	And Samuel answered Saul and said , “ I am the seer . Go up before me unto the high place ; for ye shall eat with me today , and tomorrow I will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	20	And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago , set not thy mind on them , for they are found . And on whom is all the desire of Israel ? Is it not on thee and on all thy father ’ s house ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	21	And Saul answered and said , “ Am not I a Benjamite , of the smallest of the tribes of Israel , and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin ? Why then speakest thou so to me ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	22	And Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall , and made them sit in the chiefest place among those who were bidden , who were about thirty persons .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	23	And Samuel said unto the cook , “ Bring the portion which I gave thee , of which I said unto thee , ‘ Set it by thee. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	24	And the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it , and set it before Saul . And Samuel said , “ Behold that which is left ! Set it before thee and eat ; for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said , ‘ I have invited the people. ’ ” So Saul ate with Samuel that day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	25	And when they had come down from the high place into the city , Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	26	And they arose early . And it came to pass about the dawn of the day that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , “ Up , that I may send thee away. ” And Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	9	27	And as they were going down to the end of the city , Samuel said to Saul , “ Bid the servant pass on before us. ” ( And he passed on . ) “ But stand thou still a while , that I may show thee the word of God . ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	10	And when they came thither to the hill , behold , a company of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came upon him , and he prophesied among them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	2	When thou art departed from me today , then thou shalt find two men by Rachel ’ s sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah ; and they will say unto thee , ‘ The asses which thou wentest to seek are found . And lo , thy father hath left the care of the asses and sorroweth for you , saying , “ What shall I do for my son ? ” ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	3	Then shalt thou go on forward from thence , and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor ; and there shall meet thee three men going up to God at Bethel , one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	4	And they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread , which thou shalt receive from their hands .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	5	After that thou shalt come to the hill of God , where is the garrison of the Philistines ; and it shall come to pass , when thou art come thither to the city , that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a taboret and a pipe and a harp before them ; and they shall prophesy .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	6	And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	7	And let it be , when these signs have come unto thee , that thou do as the occasion serve thee ; for God is with thee .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	8	And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal ; and behold , I will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings . Seven days shalt thou tarry , till I come to thee and show thee what thou shalt do. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	9	And it was so that , when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , God gave him another heart ; and all those signs came to pass that day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	11	And it came to pass when all who knew him before saw that , behold , he prophesied among the prophets , then the people said one to another , “ What is this that has come unto the son of Kish ? Is Saul also among the prophets ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	12	And one of the same place answered and said , “ But who is their father ? ” Therefore it became a proverb : “ Is Saul also among the prophets ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	13	And when he had made an end of prophesying , he came to the high place .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	14	And Saul ’ s uncle said unto him and to his servant , “ Whither went ye ? ” And he said , “ To seek the asses ; and when we saw that they were nowhere , we came to Samuel. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	15	And Saul ’ s uncle said , “ Tell me , I pray thee , what Samuel said unto you. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	16	And Saul said unto his uncle , “ He told us plainly that the asses were found. ” But of the matter of the kingdom , whereof Samuel spoke , he told him not .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	17	And Samuel called the people together unto the Lord at Mizpah ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	18	and said unto the children of Israel , “ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : ‘ I brought up Israel out of Egypt , and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and from them that oppressed you. ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	19	And ye have this day rejected your God , who Himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations , and ye have said unto Him , ‘ Nay , but set a king over us. ’ Now therefore present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	20	And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near , the tribe of Benjamin was taken .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	21	When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Matri was taken , and Saul the son of Kish was taken ; and when they sought him , he could not be found .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	22	Therefore they inquired of the Lord further if the man should yet come thither . And the Lord answered , “ Behold , he hath hid himself among the supplies. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	23	And they ran and fetched him thence ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	24	And Samuel said to all the people , “ See ye him whom the Lord hath chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ? ” And all the people shouted and said , “ God save the king ! ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	25	Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the Lord . And Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	26	And Saul also went home to Gibeah . And there went with him a band of men , whose hearts God had touched .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	10	27	But the children of Belial said , “ How shall this man save us ? ” And they despised him , and brought him no presents . But he held his peace .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	11	And it was so on the morrow , that Saul put the people in three companies ; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch , and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day ; and it came to pass that those who remained were scattered , so that two of them were not left together .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	2	And Nahash the Ammonite answered them , “ On this condition will I make a covenant with you : that I may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	3	And the elders of Jabesh said unto him , “ Give us seven days ’ respite , that we may send messengers unto all the regions of Israel . And then , if there be no man to save us , we will come out to thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	4	Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people , and all the people lifted up their voices and wept .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	5	And behold , Saul came after the herd out of the field ; and Saul said , “ What aileth the people that they weep ? ” And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	6	And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings , and his anger was kindled greatly .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	7	And he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces , and sent them throughout all the regions of Israel by the hands of messengers , saying , “ Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel , so shall it be done unto his oxen. ” And the fear of the Lord fell on the people , and they came out with one consent .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	8	And when he numbered them in Bezek , the children of Israel were three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	9	And they said unto the messengers who came , “ Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead , ‘ Tomorrow , by the time the sun is hot , ye shall have help. ’ ” And the messengers came and showed it to the men of Jabesh , and they were glad .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said , “ Tomorrow we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	12	And the people said unto Samuel , “ Who is he that said , ‘ Shall Saul reign over us ? ’ Bring the men , that we may put them to death. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	13	And Saul said , “ There shall not a man be put to death this day , for today the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	14	Then said Samuel to the people , “ Come , and let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	11	15	And all the people went to Gilgal , and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal . And there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the Lord ; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	12	And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , ye said unto me , ‘ Nay , but a king shall reign over us , ’ when the Lord your God was your king .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	2	and now , behold , the king walketh before you . And I am old and grayheaded , and behold , my sons are with you ; and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	3	Behold , here I am ! Witness against me before the Lord and before His anointed . Whose ox have I taken , or whose ass have I taken ? Or whom have I defrauded ? Whom have I oppressed , or from whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith ? And I will restore it to you. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	4	And they said , “ Thou hast not defrauded us , nor oppressed us , neither hast thou taken aught from any man ’ s hand. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	5	And he said unto them , “ The Lord is witness against you , and His anointed is witness this day , that ye have not found aught in my hand. ” And they answered , “ He is witness. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	6	And Samuel said unto the people , “ It is the Lord who advanced Moses and Aaron , and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	7	Now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the Lord concerning all the righteous acts of the Lord which He did to you and to your fathers .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	8	When Jacob had come into Egypt and your fathers cried unto the Lord , then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron , who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	9	And when they forgot the Lord their God , He sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	10	And they cried unto the Lord and said , ‘ We have sinned , because we have forsaken the Lord and have served the Baalim and Ashtaroth ; but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve Thee. ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	11	And the Lord sent Jerubbaal , and Bedan , and Jephthah , and Samuel , and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side , and ye dwelt safe .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	13	Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have desired ! And behold , the Lord hath set a king over you .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	14	If ye will fear the Lord and serve Him and obey His voice and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall both ye and also the king who reigneth over you continue following the Lord your God .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	15	But if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fathers .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	16	Now therefore stand and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	17	Is it not wheat harvest today ? I will call unto the Lord , and He shall send thunder and rain , that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the Lord , in asking for yourselves a king. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	18	So Samuel called unto the Lord , and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day ; and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	19	And all the people said unto Samuel , “ Pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God , that we die not . For we have added unto all our sins this evil : to ask for us a king. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	20	And Samuel said unto the people , “ Fear not . Ye have done all this wickedness ; yet turn not aside from following the Lord , but serve the Lord with all your heart .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	21	And turn ye not aside ; for then should ye go after vain things which can not profit nor deliver , for they are vain .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	22	For the Lord will not forsake His people for His great name ’ s sake , because it hath pleased the Lord to make you His people .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	23	Moreover as for me , God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you ; but I will teach you the good and the right way .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	24	Only fear the Lord , and serve Him in truth with all your heart ; for consider what great things He hath done for you .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	12	25	But if ye shall still do wickedly , ye shall be consumed , both ye and your king . ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	13	And Samuel said to Saul , “ Thou hast done foolishly . Thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God which He commanded thee , for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	2	Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel , whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and on Mount Bethel , and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin ; and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	3	And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba , and the Philistines heard of it . And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land , saying , “ Let the Hebrews hear ! ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	4	And all Israel heard it said that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines , and that Israel also was held in abomination by the Philistines . And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	5	And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude . And they came up and pitched camp in Michmash , eastward from Bethaven .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	7	And some of the Hebrews went over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead . As for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	8	And he tarried seven days , according to the set time that Samuel had appointed ; but Samuel came not to Gilgal , and the people were scattered from him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	9	And Saul said , “ Bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings. ” And he offered the burnt offering .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	10	And it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might salute him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	11	And Samuel said , “ What hast thou done ? ” And Saul said , “ Because I saw that the people were scattered from me , and that thou camest not within the days appointed , and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	12	therefore said I , ‘ The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal , and I have not made supplication unto the Lord. ’ I forced myself therefore , and offered a burnt offering. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	14	But now thy kingdom shall not continue . The Lord hath sought Him a man after His own heart , and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over His people , because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	15	And Samuel arose , and went up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin . And Saul numbered the people who were present with him , about six hundred men .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	16	And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them abode in Gibeah of Benjamin ; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	17	And the despoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah , unto the land of Shual ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	18	and another company turned the way to Bethhoron , and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	19	Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel ; for the Philistines said , “ Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	20	But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen every man his plowshare and his coulter and his ax and his mattock .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	21	Yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes , and to sharpen the goads .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	22	So it came to pass on the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan , but with Saul and with Jonathan his son were they found .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	13	23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	14	And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within , as it were , a half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	2	And Saul tarried in the outermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron . And the people who were with him were about six hundred men ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	3	and Ahijah the son of Ahitub , Ichabod ’ s brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the Lord ’ S priest in Shiloh , wearing an ephod . And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	4	And between the passages , by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines ’ garrison , there was a sharp rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side ; and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	5	The forefront of the one was situated northward over against Michmash and the other southward over against Gibeah .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	6	And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor , “ Come , and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised . It may be that the Lord will work for us , for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	7	And his armorbearer said unto him , “ Do all that is in thine heart . Turn thee ; behold , I am with thee , according to thy heart. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	8	Then said Jonathan , “ Behold , we will pass over unto these men , and we will disclose ourselves unto them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they say thus unto us , ‘ Tarry until we come to you , ’ then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	10	But if they say thus , ‘ Come up unto us , ’ then we will go up ; for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand , and this shall be a sign unto us. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	11	And both of them revealed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines ; and the Philistines said , “ Behold , the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	12	And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer , and said , “ Come up to us , and we will show you a thing. ” And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer , “ Come up after me , for the Lord hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	13	And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet , and his armorbearer after him . And they fell before Jonathan , and his armorbearer slew after him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	15	And there was trembling in the host , in the field , and among all the people . The garrison and the despoilers also trembled , and the earth quaked ; so it was a very great trembling .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked ; and behold , the multitude melted away , and they went on beating down one another .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	17	Then said Saul unto the people who were with him , “ Number now , and see who is gone from us. ” And when they had numbered , behold , Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	18	And Saul said unto Ahijah , “ Bring hither the ark of God. ” For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	19	And it came to pass , while Saul talked unto the priest , that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased ; and Saul said unto the priest , “ Withdraw thine hand. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	20	And Saul and all the people who were with him assembled themselves , and they came to the battle ; and behold , every man ’ s sword was against his fellow , and there was a very great discomfiture .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	21	Moreover the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before that time , who went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	22	Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves on Mount Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	23	So the Lord saved Israel that day , and the battle passed over unto Bethaven .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	24	And the men of Israel were distressed that day , for Saul had adjured the people , saying , “ Cursed be the man who eateth any food until evening , that I may be avenged on mine enemies. ” So none of the people tasted any food .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	25	And all they of the land came to a woods , and there was honey upon the ground .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	26	And when the people had come into the woods , behold , the honey dropped ; but no man put his hand to his mouth , for the people feared the oath .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	27	But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath . Therefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth , and his eyes were enlightened .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	28	Then answered one of the people and said , “ Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath , saying , ‘ Cursed be the man who eateth any food this day. ’ ” And the people were faint .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	29	Then said Jonathan , “ My father hath troubled the land . See , I pray you , how mine eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this honey .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	30	How much more , if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found ? For would there not have been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	31	And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon ; and the people were very faint .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	32	And the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep and oxen and calves , and slew them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	33	Then they told Saul , saying , “ Behold , the people sin against the Lord in that they eat with the blood. ” And he said , “ Ye have transgressed ! Roll a great stone unto me this day. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	34	And Saul said , “ Disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them , ‘ Bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep , and slay them here and eat ; and sin not against the Lord in eating with the blood. ’ ” And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night , and slew them there .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	35	And Saul built an altar unto the Lord ; the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	36	And Saul said , “ Let us go down after the Philistines by night and despoil them until the morning light , and let us not leave a man of them. ” And they said , “ Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. ” Then said the priest , “ Let us draw near hither unto God. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	37	And Saul asked counsel of God : “ Shall I go down after the Philistines ? Wilt Thou deliver them into the hand of Israel ? ” But He answered him not that day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	38	And Saul said , “ Draw ye near hither , all the chief of the people , and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	39	For , as the Lord liveth who saveth Israel , though it be in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die. ” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	40	Then said he unto all Israel , “ Be ye on one side , and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. ” And the people said unto Saul , “ Do what seemeth good unto thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	41	Therefore Saul said unto the Lord God of Israel , “ Give a perfect lot. ” And Saul and Jonathan were taken , but the people escaped .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	42	And Saul said , “ Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. ” And Jonathan was taken .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	43	Then Saul said to Jonathan , “ Tell me what thou hast done. ” And Jonathan told him and said , “ I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand , and lo , I must die. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	44	And Saul answered , “ God do so and more also ; for thou shalt surely die , Jonathan. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	45	And the people said unto Saul , “ Shall Jonathan die , who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel ? God forbid ! As the Lord liveth , there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground , for he hath wrought with God this day. ” So the people rescued Jonathan , that he died not .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	46	Then Saul went up from following the Philistines , and the Philistines went to their own place .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	47	So Saul took the kingship over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side : against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines ; and whithersoever he turned himself , he vexed them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	48	And he gathered a host and smote the Amalekites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishui and Malchishua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn , Merab , and the name of the younger , Michal .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	50	And the name of Saul ’ s wife was Ahinoam , the daughter of Ahimaaz ; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner , the son of Ner , Saul ’ s uncle .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	51	And Kish was the father of Saul , and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	14	52	And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul ; and when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man , he took him unto him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	15	And Saul said , “ They have brought them from the Amalekites ; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God , and the rest we have utterly destroyed. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	2	Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ I remember that which Amalek did to Israel , how he lay in wait for him on the way when he came up from Egypt .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	3	Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have , and spare them not ; but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	4	And Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim , two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	5	And Saul came to a city of Amalek , and lay in wait in the valley .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	6	And Saul said unto the Kenites , “ Go , depart , get you down from among the Amalekites , lest I destroy you with them ; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. ” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	7	And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur , which is over against Egypt .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	8	And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive , and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	9	But Saul and the people spared Agag , and the best of the sheep and of the oxen , and of the fatlings and the lambs , and all that was good , and would not utterly destroy them ; but every thing that was vile and refuse , that they destroyed utterly .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	10	Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	11	“ I repent that I have set up Saul to be king , for he has turned back from following Me and hath not performed My commandments. ” And it grieved Samuel , and he cried unto the Lord all night .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	12	And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning , it was told Samuel , saying , “ Saul came to Carmel , and behold , he set him up a place , and has gone about and passed on and gone down to Gilgal. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	13	And Samuel came to Saul ; and Saul said unto him , “ Blessed be thou of the Lord . I have performed the commandment of the Lord. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	14	And Samuel said , “ What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which I hear ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	16	Then Samuel said unto Saul , “ Stay , and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. ” And he said unto him , “ Say on. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	17	And Samuel said , “ When thou wast little in thine own sight , wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel , and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	18	And the Lord sent thee on a journey and said , ‘ Go , and utterly destroy the sinners , the Amalekites , and fight against them until they be consumed. ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	19	Why then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord , but didst leap upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the Lord ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	20	And Saul said unto Samuel , “ Yea , I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me , and have brought Agag the king of Amalek , and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	21	But the people took of the spoil , sheep and oxen , the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed , to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	22	And Samuel said , “ Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord ? Behold , to obey is better than sacrifice , and to hearken than the fat of rams .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	23	For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft , and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry . Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord , He hath also rejected thee from being king. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	24	And Saul said unto Samuel , “ I have sinned ; for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and thy words , because I feared the people and obeyed their voice .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	25	Now therefore , I pray thee , pardon my sin , and return with me , that I may worship the Lord. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	26	And Samuel said unto Saul , “ I will not return with thee ; for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord , and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	27	And as Samuel turned about to go away , he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle , and it rent .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	28	And Samuel said unto him , “ The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day , and hath given it to a neighbor of thine , who is better than thou .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	29	And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent ; for He is not a man , that He should repent. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	30	Then he said , “ I have sinned ; yet honor me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people and before Israel , and return with me , that I may worship the Lord thy God. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Samuel turned back after Saul , and Saul worshiped the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	32	Then said Samuel , “ Bring ye hither to me Agag , the king of the Amalekites. ” And Agag came unto him charily ; and Agag said , “ Surely the bitterness of death is past. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	33	And Samuel said , “ As thy sword hath made women childless , so shall thy mother be childless among women. ” And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	34	Then Samuel went to Ramah ; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	15	35	And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death . Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul ; and the Lord repented that He had made Saul king over Israel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	16	Let our lord now command thy servants , who are before thee , to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp ; and it shall come to pass , when the evil spirit from God is upon thee , that he shall play with his hand , and thou shalt be well. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	2	And Samuel said , “ How can I go ? If Saul hear it , he will kill me. ” And the Lord said , “ Take a heifer with thee , and say , ‘ I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	3	And call Jesse to the sacrifice , and I will show thee what thou shalt do ; and thou shalt anoint unto Me him whom I name unto thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	4	And Samuel did that which the Lord spoke , and came to Bethlehem . And the elders of the town trembled at his coming , and said , “ Comest thou peaceably ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	5	And he said , “ Peaceably ; I have come to sacrifice unto the Lord . Sanctify yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice. ” And he sanctified Jesse and his sons , and called them to the sacrifice .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	6	And it came to pass , when they had come , that he looked on Eliab and said , “ Surely the Lord ’ S anointed is before Him. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	7	But the Lord said unto Samuel , “ Look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature , because I have refused him ; for the Lord seeth not as man seeth . For man looketh on the outward appearance , but the Lord looketh on the heart. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	8	Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel . And he said , “ Neither hath the Lord chosen this. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	9	Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by . And he said , “ Neither hath the Lord chosen this. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	10	Again , Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel . And Samuel said unto Jesse , “ The Lord hath not chosen these. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	11	And Samuel said unto Jesse , “ Are here all thy children ? ” And he said , “ There remaineth yet the youngest , and behold , he keepeth the sheep. ” And Samuel said unto Jesse , “ Send and fetch him , for we will not sit down till he come hither. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	12	And he sent , and brought him in . Now he was ruddy , and altogether of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look upon . And the Lord said , “ Arise , anoint him ; for this is he. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren ; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward . So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	14	But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul , and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	15	And Saul ’ s servants said unto him , “ Behold now , an evil spirit from God troubleth thee .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	17	And Saul said unto his servants , “ Provide me now a man whocan play well , and bring him to me. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	18	Then answered one of the servants and said , “ Behold , I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing , and a mighty valiant man , and a man of war , and prudent in matters , and a comely person , and the Lord is with him. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	19	Therefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse and said , “ Send me David thy son , who is with the sheep. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	20	And Jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid , and sent them by David his son unto Saul .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	21	And David came to Saul and stood before him ; and he loved him greatly , and he became his armorbearer .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	22	And Saul sent to Jesse , saying , “ Let David , I pray thee , stand before me , for he hath found favor in my sight. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	16	23	And it came to pass , when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul , that David took a harp and played with his hand ; so Saul was refreshed and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	17	And Jesse said unto David his son , “ Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves , and run to the camp to thy brethren ;
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and pitched camp by the Valley of Elah , and set up in battle array against the Philistines .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	3	And the Philistines stood on a mountain on one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side , and there was a valley between them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	4	And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath , of Gath , whose height was six cubits and a span .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	5	And he had a helmet of brass upon his head , and he was armed with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	6	And he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a buckler of brass between his shoulders .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	7	And the staff of his spear was like a weaver ’ s beam , and his spear ’ s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron ; and one bearing a shield went before him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	8	And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them , “ Why have ye come out to set up in battle array ? Am not I a Philistine , and ye servants to Saul ? Choose you a man for you , and let him come down to me .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	9	If he be able to fight with me and to kill me , then will we be your servants ; but if I prevail against him and kill him , then shall ye be our servants and serve us. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	10	And the Philistine said , “ I defy the armies of Israel this day ! Give me a man , that we may fight together ! ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	11	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine , they were dismayed and greatly afraid .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	12	Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah whose name was Jesse and who had eight sons ; and Jesse went among men as an old man in the days of Saul .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	13	And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle ; and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next unto him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	14	And David was the youngest ; and the three eldest followed Saul ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	15	but David went and returned from Saul to feed his father ’ s sheep at Bethlehem .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	16	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening , and presented himself forty days .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	18	and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand , and look how thy brethren fare , and take their pledge. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	19	Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	20	And David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper , and took and went as Jesse had commanded him ; and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and was shouting for the battle .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	21	For Israel and the Philistines had set up in battle array , army against army .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	22	And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran unto the army , and came and saluted his brethren .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	23	And as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the armies of the Philistines , and spoke according to the same words ; and David heard them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	24	And all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him and were sore afraid .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	25	And the men of Israel said , “ Have ye seen this man who has come up ? Surely , to defy Israel has he come up ; and it shall be that the man who killeth him , the king will enrich him with great riches , and will give him his daughter , and make his father ’ s house free in Israel. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	26	And David spoke to the men who stood by him , saying , “ What shall be done to the man who killeth this Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel ? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	27	And the people answered him in this manner , saying , “ So shall it be done to the man who killeth him. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	28	And Eliab , his eldest brother , heard when he spoke unto the men ; and Eliab ’ s anger was kindled against David and he said , “ Why camest thou down hither ? And with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness ? I know thy pride and the willfulness of thine heart , for thou hast come down that thou mightest see the battle. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	29	And David said , “ What have I now done ? Is there not a cause ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	30	And he turned from him toward another and spoke in the same manner ; and the people answered him again in the former manner .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	31	And when the words were heard which David spoke , they recounted them before Saul ; and he sent for him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	32	And David said to Saul , “ Let no man ’ s heart fail because of him . Thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	33	And Saul said to David , “ Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him ; for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	34	And David said unto Saul , “ Thy servant kept his father ’ s sheep , and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock ;
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	35	and I went out after him and smote him , and delivered it out of his mouth . And when he arose against me , I caught him by his beard and smote him , and slew him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	36	Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear ; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them , seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	37	David said moreover , “ The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear , He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. ” And Saul said unto David , “ Go , and the Lord be with thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	38	And Saul armed David with his armor , and he put a helmet of brass upon his head ; also he armed him with a coat of mail .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	39	And David girded his sword upon his armor , and he attempted to go , for he had not tested it . And David said unto Saul , “ I can not go with these , for I have not tested them. ” And David put them off him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	40	And he took his staff in his hand , and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd ’ s bag which he had , even in a pouch , and his sling was in his hand ; and he drew near to the Philistine .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	41	And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David , and the man who bore the shield went before him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	42	And when the Philistine looked about and saw David , he disdained him ; for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	43	And the Philistine said unto David , “ Am I a dog , that thou comest to me with staves ? ” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	44	And the Philistine said to David , “ Come to me , and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	45	Then said David to the Philistine , “ Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield ; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts , the God of the armies of Israel , whom thou hast defied .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	46	This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand . And I will smite thee and take thine head from thee ; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth , that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	47	And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear ; for the battle is the Lord ’ S , and He will give you into our hands. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	48	And it came to pass , when the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet David , that David hastened and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	49	And David put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone , and slung it and smote the Philistine in his forehead , so that the stone sunk into his forehead . And he fell upon his face to the earth .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	51	Therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him , and cut off his head therewith . And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	52	And the men of Israel and of Judah arose , and shouted , and pursued the Philistines until thou come to the valley and to the gates of Ekron . And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim , even unto Gath and unto Ekron .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	53	And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines , and they despoiled their tents .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	54	And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem , but he put his armor in his tent .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	55	And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine , he said unto Abner , the captain of the host , “ Abner , whose son is this youth ? ” And Abner said , “ As thy soul liveth , O king , I can not tell. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	56	And the king said , “ Inquire thou whose son the stripling is. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	57	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , Abner took him , and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	17	58	And Saul said to him , “ Whose son art thou , thou young man ? ” And David answered , “ I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite . ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	18	And David said unto Saul , “ Who am I ? And what is my life or my father ’ s family in Israel , that I should be son-in-law to the king ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	2	And Saul took him that day and would let him go home no more to his father ’ s house .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	3	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant , because he loved him as his own soul .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	4	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to David , and his garments , even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	5	And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him , and behaved himself wisely ; and Saul set him over the men of war , and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul ’ s servants .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	6	And it came to pass as they came , when David was returning from the slaughter of the Philistine , that the women came out of all cities of Israel , singing and dancing , to meet King Saul , with taborets , with joy , and with instruments of music .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	7	And the women answered one another as they played , and said , “ Saul hath slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	8	And Saul was very wroth , and the saying displeased him ; and he said , “ They have ascribed unto David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands . And what can he have more but the kingdom ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	9	And Saul eyed David from that day and forward .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	10	And it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul , and he prophesied in the midst of the house . And David played with his hand , as at other times . And there was a javelin in Saul ’ s hand ;
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	11	and Saul cast the javelin , for he said , “ I will smite David even to the wall with it. ” And David escaped out of his presence twice .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	12	And Saul was afraid of David , because the Lord was with him and had departed from Saul .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	13	Therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	14	And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways , and the Lord was with him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	15	Therefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely , he was afraid of him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	16	But all Israel and Judah loved David , because he went out and came in before them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	17	And Saul said to David , “ Behold my elder daughter Merab ; her will I give thee for a wife . Only be thou valiant for me , and fight the Lord ’ S battles. ” For Saul said , “ Let not mine hand be upon him , but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	19	But it came to pass at the time when Merab , Saul ’ s daughter , should have been given to David that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite for a wife .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	20	And Michal , Saul ’ s daughter , loved David ; and they told Saul , and the thing pleased him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	21	And Saul said , “ I will give her to him , that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. ” Therefore Saul said to David , “ Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law through one of the two. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	22	And Saul commanded his servants , saying , “ Commune with David secretly and say , ‘ Behold , the king hath delight in thee , and all his servants love thee . Now therefore be the king ’ s son-in-law. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	23	And Saul ’ s servants spoke those words in the ears of David . And David said , “ Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king ’ s son-in-law , seeing that I am a poor man and lightly esteemed ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	24	And the servants of Saul told him , saying , “ In this manner spoke David. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	25	And Saul said , “ Thus shall ye say to David : ‘ The king desireth not any dowry but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to be avenged of the king ’ s enemies. ’ ” But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	26	And when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king ’ s son-in-law ; and the days were not expired .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	27	Therefore David arose and went , he and his men , and slew of the Philistines two hundred men ; and David brought their foreskins , and they gave them in full measure to the king , that he might be the king ’ s son-in-law . And Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	28	And Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David and that Michal , Saul ’ s daughter , loved him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	29	And Saul was yet the more afraid of David , and Saul became David ’ s enemy continually .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	18	30	Then the princes of the Philistines went forth . And it came to pass , after they went forth , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul , so that his name was much esteemed .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	19	And it was told Saul , saying , “ Behold , David is at Naioth in Ramah. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	2	But Jonathan , Saul ’ s son , delighted much in David ; and Jonathan told David , saying , “ Saul my father seeketh to kill thee . Now therefore , I pray thee , take heed to thyself until the morning , and abide in a secret place and hide thyself .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	3	And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and I will commune with my father about thee ; and what I see , that I will tell thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	4	And Jonathan spoke well of David unto Saul his father , and said unto him , “ Let not the king sin against his servant , against David , because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have been toward thee very good .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	5	For he put his life in his hands and slew the Philistine , and the Lord wrought a great salvation for all Israel . Thou sawest it and didst rejoice . Why then wilt thou sin against innocent blood , to slay David without a cause ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	6	And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan ; and Saul swore , “ As the Lord liveth , he shall not be slain. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	7	And Jonathan called David , and Jonathan showed him all those things . And Jonathan brought David to Saul , and he was in his presence as in times past .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	8	And there was war again . And David went out and fought with the Philistines , and slew them with a great slaughter , and they fled from him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	9	And the evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand . And David played music with his hand .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	10	And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul ’ s presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall . And David fled and escaped that night .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	11	Saul also sent messengers unto David ’ s house to watch him and to slay him in the morning . And Michal , David ’ s wife , told him , saying , “ If thou save not thy life tonight , tomorrow thou shalt be slain. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	12	So Michal let David down through a window ; and he went and fled , and escaped .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	13	And Michal took an image and laid it in the bed , and put a pillow of goats ’ hair for its head , and covered it with a cloth .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	14	And when Saul sent messengers to take David , she said , “ He is sick. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	15	And Saul sent the messengers again to see David , saying , “ Bring him up to me in the bed , that I may slay him. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	16	And when the messengers had come in , behold , there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats ’ hair for his bolster .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	17	And Saul said unto Michal , “ Why hast thou deceived me so , and sent away mine enemy , that he is escaped ? ” And Michal answered Saul , “ He said unto me , ‘ Let me go : Why should I kill thee ? ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	18	So David fled and escaped , and came to Samuel at Ramah , and told him all that Saul had done to him . And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	20	And Saul sent messengers to take David ; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying , and Samuel standing as appointed over them , the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul , and they also prophesied .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	21	And when it was told to Saul , he sent other messengers , and they prophesied likewise . And Saul sent messengers again the third time , and they prophesied also .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	22	Then went he also to Ramah , and came to a great well that is in Sechu ; and he asked and said , “ Where are Samuel and David ? ” And one said , “ Behold , they are at Naioth in Ramah. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	23	And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah ; and the Spirit of God was upon him also , and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	19	24	And he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before Samuel in like manner , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . Therefore they say , “ Is Saul also among the prophets ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	20	And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof , as though I shot at a mark .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	2	And he said unto him , “ God forbid ! Thou shalt not die . Behold , my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will show it to me . And why should my father hide this thing from me ? It is not so. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	3	And David swore moreover and said , “ Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes , and he saith , ‘ Let not Jonathan know this , lest he be grieved. ’ But truly as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth , there is but a step between me and death. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	4	Then said Jonathan unto David , “ Whatsoever thy soul desireth , I will even do it for thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	5	And David said unto Jonathan , “ Behold , tomorrow is the new moon , and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat ; but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at evening .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	6	If thy father at all miss me , then say , ‘ David earnestly asked leave of me , that he might run to Bethlehem , his city ; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family. ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	7	If he say thus , ‘ It is well , ’ thy servant shall have peace ; but if he be very wroth , then be sure that evil is determined by him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	8	Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant , for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee . Notwithstanding , if there be in me iniquity , slay me thyself ; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	9	And Jonathan said , “ Far be it from thee ; for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee , then would not I tell it to thee ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	10	Then said David to Jonathan , “ Who shall tell me ? Or what if thy father answer thee roughly ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	11	And Jonathan said unto David , “ Come , and let us go out into the field. ” And they went out both of them into the field .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	12	And Jonathan said unto David , “ By the Lord the God of Israel , when I have sounded out my father about tomorrow any time , or the third day , and behold , if there be good toward David , and I then send not unto thee and show it to thee ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	13	the Lord do so and much more to Jonathan . But if it please my father to do thee evil , then I will show it to thee and send thee away , that thou mayest go in peace ; and the Lord be with thee , as He hath been with my father .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	14	And thou shalt not only show me the kindness of the Lord while yet I live , that I die not ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	15	but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever — no , not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David , saying , “ Let the Lord even require it at the hand of David ’ s enemies. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	17	And Jonathan caused David to swear again , because he loved him ; for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	18	Then Jonathan said to David , “ Tomorrow is the new moon , and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	19	And when thou hast stayed three days , then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand , and shalt remain by the stone Ezel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	21	And behold , I will send a lad , saying , ‘ Go , find the arrows. ’ If I expressly say unto the lad , ‘ Behold , the arrows are on this side of thee ; take them , ’ then come thou , for there is peace to thee and no hurt , as the Lord liveth .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	22	But if I say thus unto the young man , ‘ Behold , the arrows are beyond thee , ’ go thy way ; for the Lord hath sent thee away .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	23	And concerning the matter which thou and I have spoken of , behold , the Lord be witness between thee and me for ever. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	24	So David hid himself in the field ; and when the new moon had come , the king sat down to eat meat .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	25	And the king sat upon his seat as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall ; and Jonathan arose , and Abner sat by Saul ’ s side , and David ’ s place was empty .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	26	Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day , for he thought , “ Something hath befallen him . He is not clean , surely he is not clean. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	27	And it came to pass on the morrow , which was the second day of the month , that David ’ s place was empty . And Saul said unto Jonathan his son , “ Why cometh not the son of Jesse to meat , neither yesterday nor today ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	28	And Jonathan answered Saul , “ David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	29	And he said , ‘ Let me go , I pray thee , for our family hath a sacrifice in the city , and my brother , he hath commanded me to be there . And now , if I have found favor in thine eyes , let me get away , I pray thee , and see my brethren. ’ Therefore he cometh not unto the king ’ s table. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	30	Then Saul ’ s anger was kindled against Jonathan , and he said unto him , “ Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman , do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother ’ s nakedness ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	31	For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground , thou shalt not be established , nor thy kingdom . Therefore now send and fetch him unto me , for he shall surely die. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	32	And Jonathan answered Saul his father and said unto him , “ Why shall he be slain ? What hath he done ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	33	And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him , whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to slay David .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	34	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and ate no meat the second day of the month ; for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	35	And it came to pass in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little lad with him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	36	And he said unto his lad , “ Run , find now the arrows which I shoot. ” And as the lad ran , he shot an arrow beyond him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	37	And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the lad and said , “ Is not the arrow beyond thee ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	38	And Jonathan cried after the lad , “ Make speed , haste , stay not. ” And Jonathan ’ s lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	39	But the lad knew not anything . Only Jonathan and David knew the matter .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	40	And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad and said unto him , “ Go , carry them to the city. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	41	And as soon as the lad was gone , David arose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times ; and they kissed one another and wept one with another , but David more .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	20	42	And Jonathan said to David , “ Go in peace , forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord , saying , ‘ The Lord be between me and thee , and between my seed and thy seed for ever. ’ ” And he arose and departed ; and Jonathan went into the city .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	21	Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest . And Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David , and said unto him , “ Why art thou alone , and no man with thee ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	2	And David said unto Ahimelech the priest , “ The king hath commanded me a business , and hath said unto me , ‘ Let no man know anything of the business about which I send thee and what I have commanded thee. ’ And I have appointed my servants to such and such a place .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	3	Now therefore , what is under thine hand ? Give me five loaves of bread in mine hand , or what there is present. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	4	And the priest answered David and said , “ There is no common bread under mine hand ; but there is hallowed bread , if at least the young men have kept themselves from women. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	5	And David answered the priest and said unto him , “ Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since I came out ; and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common , yea , though it were sanctified this day in the vessel. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	6	So the priest gave him hallowed bread ; for there was no bread there but the showbread that was taken from before the Lord , to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before the Lord ; and his name was Doeg , an Edomite , the chiefest of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	8	And David said unto Ahimelech , “ And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword ? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me , because the king ’ s business required haste. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	9	And the priest said , “ The sword of Goliath the Philistine , whom thou slewest in the Valley of Elah , behold , it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod . If thou wilt take that , take it ; for there is no other save that here. ” And David said , “ There is none like that ; give it to me. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	10	And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul , and went to Achish the king of Gath .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	11	And the servants of Achish said unto him , “ Is not this David the king of the land ? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances , saying , ‘ Saul hath slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands ’ ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	12	And David laid up these words in his heart , and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	13	And he changed his behavior before them , and feigned himself mad in their hands , and scrabbled on the doors of the gate , and let his spittle fall down upon his beard .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	14	Then said Achish unto his servants , “ Lo , ye see the man is mad . Why then have ye brought him to me ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	21	15	Have I need of mad men , that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence ? Shall this fellow come into my house ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	22	And David said unto Abiathar , “ I knew it that day , when Doeg the Edomite was there , that he would surely tell Saul . I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father ’ s house .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	2	And every one who was in distress , and every one who was in debt , and every one who was discontented , gathered themselves unto him . And he became a captain over them , and there were with him about four hundred men .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	3	And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab ; and he said unto the king of Moab , “ Let my father and my mother , I pray thee , come forth and be with you , till I know what God will do for me. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	4	And he brought them before the king of Moab , and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	5	And the prophet Gad said unto David , “ Abide not in the stronghold . Depart , and get thee into the land of Judah. ” Then David departed and came into the forest of Hereth .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	6	When Saul heard that David was discovered and the men who were with him ( now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah , having his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him ) ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	7	then Saul said unto his servants who stood about him , “ Hear now , ye Benjamites ! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards , and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	8	that all of you have conspired against me , and there is none who showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse ; and there is none of you that is sorry for me , or showeth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait , as at this day ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	9	Then answered Doeg the Edomite , who was set over the servants of Saul , and said , “ I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob , to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	10	And he inquired of the Lord for him , and gave him victuals , and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	11	Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father ’ s house , the priests who were in Nob ; and they came all of them to the king .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	12	And Saul said , “ Hear now , thou son of Ahitub. ” And he answered , “ Here I am , my lord. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	13	And Saul said unto him , “ Why have ye conspired against me , thou and the son of Jesse , in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast inquired of God for him , that he should rise against me to lie in wait , as at this day ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	14	Then Ahimelech answered the king and said , “ And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David , who is the king ’ s son-in-law , and goeth at thy bidding , and is honorable in thine house ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	15	Did I then begin to inquire of God for him ? Be it far from me . Let not the king impute anything unto his servant , nor to all the house of my father ; for thy servant knew nothing of all this , less or more. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	16	And the king said , “ Thou shalt surely die , Ahimelech , thou and all thy father ’ s house. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	17	And the king said unto the footmen who stood about him , “ Turn and slay the priests of the Lord , because their hand also is with David , and because they knew when he fled and did not show it to me. ” But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	18	And the king said to Doeg , “ Turn thou and fall upon the priests. ” And Doeg the Edomite turned and he fell upon the priests , and slew on that day fourscore and five persons who wore a linen ephod .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	19	And Nob , the city of the priests , smote he with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and sucklings , and oxen and asses and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	20	And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub , named Abiathar , escaped and fled after David .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	21	And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the Lord ’ S priests .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	22	23	Abide thou with me ; fear not . For he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life , but with me thou shalt be in safekeeping . ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	23	See therefore , and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself , and come ye again to me with the certainty , and I will go with you . And it shall come to pass , if he be in the land , that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	2	Therefore David inquired of the Lord , saying , “ Shall I go and smite these Philistines ? ” And the Lord said unto David , “ Go and smite the Philistines , and save Keilah. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	3	And David ’ s men said unto him , “ Behold , we are afraid here in Judah . How much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	4	Then David inquired of the Lord yet again . And the Lord answered him and said , “ Arise , go down to Keilah ; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	5	So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines , and brought away their cattle and smote them with a great slaughter . So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	6	And it came to pass , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	7	And it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah . And Saul said , “ God hath delivered him into mine hand , for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	8	And Saul called all the people together to war , to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	9	And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him ; and he said to Abiathar the priest , “ Bring hither the ephod. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	10	Then said David , “ O Lord God of Israel , Thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand ? Will Saul come down , as Thy servant hath heard ? O Lord God of Israel , I beseech Thee , tell Thy servant. ” And the Lord said , “ He will come down. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	12	Then said David , “ Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? ” And the Lord said , “ They will deliver thee up. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	13	Then David and his men , who were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Keilah and went whithersoever they could go . And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah ; and he forbore to go forth .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	14	And David abode in the wilderness in strongholds and remained on a mountain in the Wilderness of Ziph . And Saul sought him every day , but God delivered him not into his hand .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	15	And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life ; and David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in a wood .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	16	And Jonathan , Saul ’ s son , arose and went to David into the wood , and strengthened his hand in God .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	17	And he said unto him , “ Fear not , for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee . And thou shalt be king over Israel , and I shall be next unto thee ; and that also Saul my father knoweth. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	18	And the two made a covenant before the Lord ; and David abode in the wood , and Jonathan went to his house .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	19	Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah , saying , “ Doth not David hide himself with us in strongholds in the wood , on the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of Jeshimon ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	20	Now therefore , O king , come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king ’ s hand. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	21	And Saul said , “ Blessed be ye of the Lord ; for ye have compassion on me .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	22	Go , I pray you , prepare yet , and know and see his place where his haunt is , and who hath seen him there ; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	24	And they arose and went to Ziph before Saul . But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon , in the plain on the south of Jeshimon .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	25	Saul also and his men went to seek him . And they told David , whereupon he came down to a rock , and abode in the Wilderness of Maon . And when Saul heard that , he pursued after David in the Wilderness of Maon .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	26	And Saul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain ; and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul , for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	27	But there came a messenger unto Saul , saying , “ Hasten thee and come , for the Philistines have invaded the land. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	28	Therefore Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines . Therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth [ that is , The rock of divisions ] .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	23	29	And David went up from thence and dwelt in strongholds at Engedi .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	24	And it came to pass , when Saul had returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , “ Behold , David is in the Wilderness of Engedi. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and went to seek David and his men upon the Rocks of the Wild Goats .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	3	And he came to the sheepcotes by the way , where there was a cave ; and Saul went in to relieve himself , and David and his men remained in the recesses of the cave .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	4	And the men of David said unto him , “ Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee , ‘ Behold , I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand , that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. ’ ” Then David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul ’ s robe privily .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	5	And it came to pass afterward that David ’ s heart smote him because he had cut off Saul ’ s skirt .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	6	And he said unto his men , “ The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master , the Lord ’ S anointed , to stretch forth mine hand against him , seeing he is the anointed of the Lord. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	7	So David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Saul . But Saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	8	David also arose afterward , and went out of the cave and cried after Saul , saying , “ My lord the king. ” And when Saul looked behind him , David stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	9	And David said to Saul , “ Why hearest thou men ’ s words , saying , ‘ Behold , David seeketh thy hurt ? ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	10	Behold , this day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered thee today into mine hand in the cave , and some bade me kill thee . But mine eye spared thee , and I said , ‘ I will not put forth mine hand against my lord , for he is the Lord ’ S anointed. ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	11	Moreover , my father , see , yea , see the skirt of thy robe in my hand ; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not , know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand , and I have not sinned against thee ; yet thou huntest my soul to take it .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	12	The Lord judge between me and thee , and the Lord avenge me of thee ; but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	13	As saith the proverb of the ancients , ‘ Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked. ’ But mine hand shall not be upon thee .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	14	After whom has the king of Israel come out ? After whom dost thou pursue ? After a dead dog , after a flea !
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	15	The Lord therefore be judge , and judge between me and thee ; and see and plead my cause , and deliver me out of thine hand. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	16	And it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul , that Saul said , “ Is this thy voice , my son David ? ” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	17	And he said to David , “ Thou art more righteous than I ; for thou hast rewarded me good , whereas I have rewarded thee evil .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	18	And thou hast shown this day how thou hast dealt well with me ; forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand , thou killed me not .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	19	For if a man find his enemy , will he let him go well away ? Therefore the Lord reward thee good for what thou hast done unto me this day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	20	And now , behold , I know well that thou shalt surely be king , and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	21	Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father ’ s house. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	24	22	And David swore unto Saul . And Saul went home , but David and his men got themselves up unto the stronghold .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	25	Let not my lord , I pray thee , regard this man of Belial , even Nabal . For as his name is , so is he : Nabal is his name , and folly is with him . But I , thine handmaid , saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	2	And there was a man in Maon whose possessions were in Carmel . And the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats ; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	3	Now the name of the man was Nabal , and the name of his wife , Abigail . And she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance ; but the man was churlish and evil in his doings , and he was of the house of Caleb .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	4	And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	6	And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity : ‘ Peace be both to thee , and peace be to thine house , and peace be unto all that thou hast .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	7	And now I have heard that thou hast shearers . Now thy shepherds who were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there aught missing from them all the while they were in Carmel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask thy young men and they will show thee . Therefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes , for we come in a good day . Give , I pray thee , whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to thy son David. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	9	And when David ’ s young men came , they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David , and ceased .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	10	And Nabal answered David ’ s servants and said , “ Who is David ? And who is the son of Jesse ? There are many servants nowadays who break away every man from his master .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	11	Shall I then take my bread and my water and my slaughter that I have killed for my shearers , and give it unto men whom I know not from whence they are ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	12	So David ’ s young men turned their way and went again , and came and told him all those sayings .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	13	And David said unto his men , “ Gird ye on every man his sword. ” And they girded on every man his sword , and David also girded on his sword . And there went up after David about four hundred men , and two hundred stayed by the supplies .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	14	But one of the young men told Abigail , Nabal ’ s wife , saying , “ Behold , David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master ; and he railed at them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	15	But the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt , neither missed we anything as long as we were occupied with them when we were in the fields .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	16	They were a wall for us both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	17	Now therefore , know and consider what thou wilt do , for evil is determined against our master and against all his household . For he is such a son of Belial , that a man can not speak to him. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	18	Then Abigail made haste , and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine , and five sheep ready dressed , and five measures of parched corn , and a hundred clusters of raisins , and two hundred cakes of figs , and laid them on asses .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	19	And she said unto her servants , “ Go on before me ; behold , I come after you. ” But she told not her husband Nabal .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	20	And it was so , as she rode on the ass , that she came down by the covert of the hill ; and behold , David and his men came down toward her , and she met them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	21	Now David had said , “ Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness , so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him ; and he hath requited me evil for good .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	22	So , and more also , do God unto the enemies of David if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that urinates against the wall. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	23	And when Abigail saw David , she hastened and alighted from the ass , and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	24	and fell at his feet and said , “ Upon me , my lord , upon me let this iniquity be ; and let thine handmaid , I pray thee , speak in thine audience , and hear the words of thine handmaid .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	26	Now therefore , my lord , as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth , seeing the Lord hath withheld thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand , now let thine enemies and those who seek evil for my lord be as Nabal .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	27	And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord , let it even be given unto the young men who follow my lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	28	I pray thee , forgive the trespass of thine handmaid ; for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house , because my lord fighteth the battles of the Lord , and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	29	Yet a man has risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul . But the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God ; and the souls of thine enemies , them shall He sling out , as out of the middle of a sling .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	30	And it shall come to pass , when the Lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that He hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	31	that this shall be no grief unto thee , nor offense of heart unto my lord , either that thou hast shed blood causelessly or that my lord hath avenged himself . But when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord , then remember thine handmaid. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	32	And David said to Abigail : “ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who sent thee this day to meet me !
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	33	And blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou , who hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	34	For in very deed , as the Lord God of Israel liveth , who hath kept me back from hurting thee , unless thou hadst hastened and come to meet me , surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any who urinates against the wall. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	35	So David received from her hand that which she had brought him , and said unto her , “ Go up in peace to thine house . See , I have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	36	And Abigail came to Nabal ; and behold , he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king . And Nabal ’ s heart was merry within him , for he was very drunken ; therefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	37	But it came to pass in the morning , when the wine had gone out of Nabal and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him and he became as a stone .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	38	And it came to pass about ten days after that the Lord smote Nabal , so that he died .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	39	And when David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , “ Blessed be the Lord who hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal , and hath kept His servant from evil ; for the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. ” And David sent and communed with Abigail , to take her to him as wife .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	40	And when the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel , they spoke unto her , saying , “ David sent us unto thee to take thee to him as wife. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	41	And she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , “ Behold , let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	42	And Abigail hastened and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers who went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	43	David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel , and they were also both of them his wives .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	25	44	But Saul had given Michal his daughter , David ’ s wife , to Palti the son of Laish , who was from Gallim .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	26	And the Ziphites came unto Saul at Gibeah , saying , “ Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	2	Then Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	3	And Saul pitched camp on the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon , by the road . But David abode in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	4	David therefore sent out spies , and understood that Saul had come indeed .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	5	And David arose and came to the place where Saul had pitched camp . And David beheld the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his host ; and Saul lay in the entrenchment , and the people pitched round about him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	6	Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah , brother of Joab , saying , “ Who will go down with me to Saul into the camp ? ” And Abishai said , “ I will go down with thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	7	So David and Abishai came to the people by night . And behold , Saul lay sleeping within the entrenchment , and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster ; but Abner and the people lay round about him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	8	Then said Abishai to David , “ God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day . Now therefore let me smite him , I pray thee , with the spear even to the earth at once , and I will not smite him the second time. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	9	And David said to Abishai , “ Destroy him not , for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord ’ S anointed and be guiltless ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	10	David said furthermore , “ As the Lord liveth , the Lord shall smite him , or his day shall come to die , or he shall descend into battle and perish .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	11	The Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord ’ S anointed ; but , I pray thee , take thou now the spear that is at his bolster , and the cruse of water , and let us go. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul ’ s bolster , and they got away . And no man saw it nor knew it , neither awakened ; for they were all asleep , because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	13	Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of a hill afar off , a great space being between them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	14	And David cried to the people and to Abner the son of Ner , saying , “ Answerest thou not , Abner ? ” Then Abner answered and said , “ Who art thou that criest to the king ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	15	And David said to Abner , “ Art not thou a valiant man ? And who is like to thee in Israel ? Why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king ? For there came in one of the people to destroy the king thy lord .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	16	This thing is not good that thou hast done . As the Lord liveth , ye are worthy to die , because ye have not kept your master , the Lord ’ S anointed . And now see where the king ’ s spear is , and the cruse of water that was at his bolster. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	17	And Saul knew David ’ s voice , and said , “ Is this thy voice , my son David ? ” And David said , “ It is my voice , my lord , O king. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	18	And he said , “ Why doth my lord thus pursue after his servant ? For what have I done , or what evil is in mine hand ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	19	Now therefore , I pray thee , let my lord the king hear the words of his servant . If the Lord have stirred thee up against me , let Him accept an offering ; but if they be the children of men , cursed be they before the Lord , for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord , saying , ‘ Go , serve other gods. ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	20	Now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord ; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea , as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	21	Then said Saul , “ I have sinned . Return , my son David , for I will no more do thee harm , because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day . Behold , I have played the fool and have erred exceedingly. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	22	And David answered and said , “ Behold the king ’ s spear ! Let one of the young men come over and fetch it .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	23	The Lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness ; for the Lord delivered thee into my hand today , but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the Lord ’ S anointed .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	24	And behold , as thy life was much esteemed this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much esteemed in the eyes of the Lord , and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	26	25	Then Saul said to David , “ Blessed be thou , my son David . Thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail. ” So David went on his way , and Saul returned to his place .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	27	And David said in his heart , “ I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul . There is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines ; and Saul shall despair of me , to seek me any more in any border of Israel . So shall I escape out of his hand. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	2	And David arose , and he passed over with the six hundred men who were with him unto Achish , the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	3	And David dwelt with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal ’ s wife .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	4	And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath , and he sought no more again for him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	5	And David said unto Achish , “ If I have now found grace in thine eyes , let them give me a place in some town in the country , that I may dwell there ; for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	6	Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day . Therefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	7	And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	8	And David and his men went up and invaded the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites , for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land , as thou goest to Shur , even unto the land of Egypt .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	9	And David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel , and returned and came to Achish .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	10	And Achish said , “ Whither have ye made a raid today ? ” And David said , “ Against the south of Judah , and against the south of the Jerahmeelites , and against the south of the Kenites. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	11	And David saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to Gath , saying , “ Lest they should tell on us , saying , ‘ So did David , and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	27	12	And Achish believed David , saying , “ He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him . Therefore he shall be my servant for ever . ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	28	And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with Israel . And Achish said unto David , “ Know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to battle , thou and thy men. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	2	And David said to Achish , “ Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. ” And Achish said to David , “ Therefore will I makethee keeper of mine head for ever. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	3	Now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . And Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	4	And the Philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched camp in Shunem ; and Saul gathered all Israel together , and they pitched camp in Gilboa .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	5	And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines , he was afraid and his heart greatly trembled .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	6	And when Saul inquired of the Lord , the Lord answered him not , neither by dreams nor by Urim nor by prophets .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	7	Then said Saul unto his servants , “ Seek me a woman who hath a familiar spirit , that I may go to her and inquire of her. ” And his servants said to him , “ Behold , there is a woman who hath a familiar spirit at Endor. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	8	And Saul disguised himself and put on other raiment , and he went , and two men with him ; and they came to the woman by night . And he said , “ I pray thee , divine unto me by the familiar spirit , and bring me him up whom I shall name unto thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	9	And the woman said unto him , “ Behold , thou knowest what Saul hath done , how he hath cut off those who have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land . Why then layest thou a snare for my life , to cause me to die ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	10	And Saul swore to her by the Lord , saying , “ As the Lord liveth , there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	11	Then said the woman , “ Whom shall I bring up unto thee ? ” And he said , “ Bring me up Samuel. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	12	And when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice . And the woman spoke to Saul , saying , “ Why hast thou deceived me ? For thou art Saul ! ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	13	And the king said unto her , “ Be not afraid . For what sawest thou ? ” And the woman said unto Saul , “ I saw gods ascending out of the earth. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	14	And he said unto her , “ What form is he of ? ” And she said , “ An old man cometh up , and he is covered with a mantle. ” And Saul perceived that it was Samuel , and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed himself .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	15	And Samuel said to Saul , “ Why hast thou disquieted me , to bring me up ? ” And Saul answered , “ I am sore distressed ; for the Philistines make war against me , and God has departed from me and answereth me no more , neither by prophets nor by dreams . Therefore I have called thee , that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	16	Then said Samuel , “ Why then dost thou ask of me , seeing the Lord has departed from thee and has become thine enemy ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	17	And the Lord hath done to him , as He spoke by me . For the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbor , even to David .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	18	Because thou obeyed not the voice of the Lord nor executed His fierce wrath upon Amalek , therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto thee this day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	19	Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines ; and tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me . The Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	20	Then Saul fell straightway full length on the earth , and was sore afraid because of the words of Samuel ; and there was no strength in him , for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	21	And the woman came unto Saul and saw that he was sore troubled , and said unto him , “ Behold , thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice , and I have put my life in my hands and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spoke unto me .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	22	Now therefore , I pray thee , hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before thee ; and eat , that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	23	But he refused and said , “ I will not eat. ” But his servants , together with the woman , compelled him ; and he hearkened unto their voice . So he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	24	And the woman had a fat calf in the house ; and she hastened and killed it , and took flour and kneaded it , and baked unleavened bread thereof .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	28	25	And she brought it before Saul and before his servants , and they ate . Then they rose up and went away that night .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	29	Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek , and the Israelites pitched camp by a fountain which is in Jezreel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	2	And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands , but David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	3	Then said the princes of the Philistines , “ What do these Hebrews here ? ” And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines , “ Is not this David , the servant of Saul the king of Israel , who hath been with me these days , or these years , and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me to this day ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	4	And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him ; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him , “ Make this fellow return , that he may go back to his place which thou hast appointed for him , and let him not go down with us to battle , lest in the battle he be an adversary to us . For wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master ? Should it not be with the heads of these men ?
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	5	Is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , ‘ Saul slew his thousands , and David his ten thousands ’ ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	6	Then Achish called David and said unto him , “ Surely , as the Lord liveth , thou hast been upright , and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight ; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me to this day ; nevertheless the lords favor thee not .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	7	Therefore now return and go in peace , that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	8	And David said unto Achish , “ But what have I done ? And what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day , that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king ? ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	9	And Achish answered and said to David , “ I know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of God . Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said , ‘ He shall not go up with us to the battle. ’
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	10	Therefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master ’ s servants who have come with thee ; and as soon as ye be up early in the morning and have light , depart. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	29	11	So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the Philistines . And the Philistines went up to Jezreel .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	30	and to those who were in Hormah , and to those who were in Chorashan , and to those who were in Athach ;
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	2	and had taken the women captive , who were therein . They slew not any , either great or small , but carried them away and went on their way .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	3	So David and his men came to the city , and behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	4	Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	5	And David ’ s two wives were taken captive : Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	6	And David was greatly distressed , for the people spoke of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved , every man for his sons and for his daughters ; but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	7	And David said to Abiathar the priest , Ahimelech ’ s son , “ I pray thee , bring me hither the ephod. ” And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	8	And David inquired of the Lord , saying , “ Shall I pursue after this troop ? Shall I overtake them ? ” And He answered him , “ Pursue , for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	9	So David went , he and the six hundred men who were with him , and came to the Brook Besor , where those who were left behind stayed .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	10	But David pursued , he and four hundred men ; for two hundred remained behind , who were so faint that they could not go over the Brook Besor .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	11	And they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David and gave him bread , and he ate ; and they made him drink water .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	12	And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins ; and when he had eaten his spirit came again to him , for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and three nights .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	13	And David said unto him , “ To whom belongest thou , and from whence art thou ? ” And he said , “ I am a young man of Egypt , servant to an Amalekite ; and my master left me , because three days ago I fell sick .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	14	We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites , and upon the border which belongeth to Judah and upon the south of Caleb ; and we burned Ziklag with fire. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	16	And when he had brought him down , behold , they were spread abroad upon all the earth , eating and drinking and dancing , because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of Judah .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	17	And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day ; and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men who rode upon camels and fled .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	18	And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away , and David rescued his two wives .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	19	And there was nothing lacking to them , neither small nor great , neither sons nor daughters , neither spoil nor any thing that they had taken from them ; David recovered all .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	20	And David took all the flocks and the herds which they drove before those other cattle , and said , “ This is David ’ s spoil. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	21	And David came to the two hundred men who were so faint that they could not follow David , whom they had made also to remain at the Brook Besor ; and they went forth to meet David and to meet the people who were with him . And when David came near to the people , he saluted them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	22	Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial of those who went with David , and said , “ Because they went not with us , we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered , save to every man his wife and his children , that they may lead them away and depart. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	23	Then said David , “ Ye shall not do so , my brethren , with that which the Lord hath given us , who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our hand .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	24	For who will hearken unto you in this matter ? But as his part is who goeth down to the battle , so shall his part be who tarrieth by the supplies : they shall divide alike. ”
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	25	And it was so from that day forward , that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	26	And when David came to Ziklag , he sent a portion of the spoil unto the elders of Judah , even to his friends , saying , “ Behold , a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord ” —
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	27	to those who were in Bethel , and to those who were in South Ramoth , and to those who were in Jattir ;
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	28	and to those who were in Aroer , and to those who were in Siphmoth , and to those who were in Eshtemoa ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	29	and to those who were in Rachal , and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites , and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites ;
KJ21	1%20Samuel	30	31	and to those who were in Hebron , and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	1	Samuel
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	31	Now the Philistines fought against Israel ; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	2	And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua , Saul ’ s sons .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	3	And the battle went sore against Saul , and the archers hit him ; and he was sore wounded by the archers .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	4	Then said Saul unto his armorbearer , “ Draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith , lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me. ” But his armorbearer would not , for he was sore afraid . Therefore Saul took a sword , and fell upon it .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	5	And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead , he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	6	So Saul died , and his three sons , and his armorbearer , and all his men that same day together .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	7	And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley , and those who were on the other side of the Jordan , saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook the cities and fled ; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	8	And it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	9	And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about to proclaim it in the house of their idols and among the people .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	10	And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth , and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	11	And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul ,
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	12	all the valiant men arose and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan , and came to Jabesh and burned them there .
KJ21	1%20Samuel	31	13	And they took their bones and buried them under a tree at Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	2	it came even to pass on the third day that , behold , a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head ; and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the earth and did obeisance .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	1	Now it came to pass after the death of Saul , when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had stayed two days in Ziklag—
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	3	And David said unto him , “ From whence comest thou ? ” And he said unto him , “ Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	4	And David said unto him , “ How went the matter ? I pray thee , tell me. ” And he answered , “ The people have fled from the battle , and many of the people also are fallen and dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	5	And David said unto the young man who told him , “ How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	6	And the young man who told him said , “ As I happened by chance upon Mount Gilboa , behold , Saul leaned upon his spear ; and lo , the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	7	And when he looked behind him , he saw me and called unto me . And I answered , ‘ Here am I. ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	8	And he said unto me , ‘ Who art thou ? ’ And I answered him , ‘ I am an Amalekite. ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	9	And he said unto me again , ‘ Stand , I pray thee , upon me and slay me ; for anguish is come upon me , because my life is yet whole in me. ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	10	So I stood upon him and slew him , because I was sure that he could not live after he was fallen . And I took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm , and have brought them hither unto my lord. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	11	Then David took hold on his clothes and rent them , and likewise all the men who were with him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	12	And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the Lord and for the house of Israel , because they had fallen by the sword .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	13	And David said unto the young man who told him , “ From whence art thou ? ” And he answered , “ I am the son of a stranger , an Amalekite. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	14	And David said unto him , “ How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lord ’ S anointed ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	15	And David called one of the young men and said , “ Go near , and fall upon him. ” And he smote him so that he died .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	16	And David said unto him , “ Thy blood be upon thy head , for thy mouth hath testified against thee , saying , ‘ I have slain the Lord ’ S anointed. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	17	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	18	( Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow ; behold , it is written in the Book of Jasher ) :
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	19	“ The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places ! How are the mighty fallen !
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	20	Tell it not in Gath , publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon , lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	21	“ Ye mountains of Gilboa , let there be no dew , neither let there be rain upon you , nor fields of offerings . For there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away , the shield of Saul , as though he had not been anointed with oil .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	22	“ From the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , the bow of Jonathan turned not back , and the sword of Saul returned not empty .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	23	“ Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided ; they were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	24	“ Ye daughters of Israel , weep over Saul , who clothed you in scarlet , with other delights , who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	25	“ How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle ! O Jonathan , thou was slain in thine high places .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	26	I am distressed for thee , my brother Jonathan ; very pleasant hast thou been unto me . Thy love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	1	27	“ How are the mighty fallen , and the weapons of war perished ! ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	2	So David went up thither , and his two wives also , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail , Nabal ’ s wife the Carmelite .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	3	And his men who were with him did David bring up , every man with his household ; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	4	And the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . And they told David , saying , “ The men of Jabeshgilead were those who buried Saul. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	5	And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead , and said unto them , “ Blessed be ye of the Lord , that ye have shown this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	6	And now the Lord show kindness and truth unto you ; and I also will requite you this kindness , because ye have done this thing .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	7	Therefore now , let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant ; for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	8	But Abner the son of Ner , captain of Saul ’ s host , took Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	9	and made him king over Gilead , and over the Ashurites , and over Jezreel , and over Ephraim , and over Benjamin , and over all Israel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	10	Ishbosheth , Saul ’ s son , was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel , and reigned two years . But the house of Judah followed David .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	11	And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	12	And Abner the son of Ner , and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul , went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	13	And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met together by the pool of Gibeon ; and they sat down , the one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	14	And Abner said to Joab , “ Let the young men now arise and play before us. ” And Joab said , “ Let them arise. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	15	Then there arose and went over by number , twelve of Benjamin , who pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and twelve of the servants of David .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	16	And they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellow ’ s side , so they fell down together ; therefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim [ that is , The field of strong men ] , which is in Gibeon .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	17	And there was a very sore battle that day ; and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	18	And there were three sons of Zeruiah there : Joab and Abishai and Asahel . And Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	19	And Asahel pursued after Abner ; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	20	Then Abner looked behind him and said , “ Art thou Asahel ? ” And he answered , “ I am. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	21	And Abner said to him , “ Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left , and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armor. ” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	22	And Abner said again to Asahel , “ Turn thee aside from following me . Why should I smite thee to the ground ? How then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	23	However , he refused to turn aside . Therefore Abner with the rear end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib , so that the spear came out behind him ; and he fell down there and died in the same place . And it came to pass that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died , stood still .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	24	Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner . And the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah , that lieth before Giah by the way of the Wilderness of Gibeon .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	25	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one troop , and stood on the top of a hill .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	26	Then Abner called to Joab and said , “ Shall the sword devour for ever ? Knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end ? How long shall it be then , ere thou bid the people to return from following their brethren ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	27	And Joab said , “ As God liveth , unless thou had spoken , surely then in the morning the people would have gone up every one from following his brother. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	28	So Joab blew a trumpet ; and all the people stood still and pursued after Israel no more , neither fought they any more .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	29	And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain , and passed over the Jordan and went through all Bithron ; and they came to Mahanaim .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	30	And Joab returned from following Abner ; and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David ’ s servants nineteen men and Asahel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	2	32	And they took up Asahel and buried him in the sepulcher of his father , which was in Bethlehem . And Joab and his men went all night , and they came to Hebron at break of day .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	2	And unto David were sons born in Hebron : and his firstborn was Amnon , of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	3	and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah , the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	4	and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	5	and the sixth , Ithream , by Eglah David ’ s wife . These were born to David in Hebron .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	6	And it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	7	And Saul had a concubine , whose name was Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah . And Ishbosheth said to Abner , “ Why hast thou gone in unto my father ’ s concubine ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	8	Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth , and said , “ Am I a dog ’ s head , who against Judah do show kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father , to his brethren and to his friends , and have not delivered thee into the hand of David , that thou chargest me today with a fault concerning this woman ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	9	God so do to Abner , and more also , unless , as the Lord hath sworn to David , even so I do to him :
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	10	to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah , from Dan even to Beersheba. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	11	And he could not answer Abner a word again , because he feared him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	12	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf , saying , “ Whose land is it ? ” saying also , “ Make thy league with me , and behold , my hand shall be with thee to bring about all Israel unto thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	13	And he said , “ Well ; I will make a league with thee , but one thing I require of thee , that is : thou shalt not see my face , unless thou first bring Michal , Saul ’ s daughter , when thou comest to see my face. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	14	And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth , Saul ’ s son , saying , “ Deliver me my wife Michal , whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	15	And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband , even from Paltiel the son of Laish .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	16	And her husband went along with her , weeping behind her , to Bahurim . Then said Abner unto him , “ Go , return. ” And he returned .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	17	And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel , saying , “ Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	18	Now then do it ; for the Lord hath spoken of David , saying , ‘ By the hand of My servant David , I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	19	And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin ; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	20	So Abner came to David at Hebron , and twenty men with him . And David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	21	And Abner said unto David , “ I will arise and go , and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king , that they may make a league with thee , and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. ” And David sent Abner away , and he went in peace .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	22	And behold , the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them ; but Abner was not with David in Hebron , for he had sent him away , and he had gone in peace .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	23	When Joab and all the host that was with him had come , they told Joab , saying , “ Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he hath sent him away , and he has gone in peace. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	24	Then Joab came to the king and said , “ What hast thou done ? Behold , Abner came unto thee ; why is it that thou hast sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	25	Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive thee , and to know thy going out and thy coming in , and to know all that thou doest. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	26	And when Joab had come out from David , he sent messengers after Abner , who brought him back from the well of Sirah ; but David knew it not .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	27	And when Abner had returned to Hebron , Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly , and smote him there under the fifth rib , so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	28	And afterward when David heard it , he said , “ I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	29	Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father ’ s house ; and let there never fail from the house of Joab one who hath an issue , or who is a leper , or who leaneth on a staff , or who falleth on the sword , or who lacketh bread. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	30	So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner , because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	31	And David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him , “ Rend your clothes and gird yourselves with sackcloth , and mourn before Abner. ” And King David himself followed the bier .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	32	And they buried Abner in Hebron . And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner ; and all the people wept .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	33	And the king lamented over Abner and said , “ Died Abner as a fool dieth ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	34	Thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters . As a man falleth before wicked men , so fellest thou. ” And all the people wept again over him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	35	And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day , David swore , saying , “ So do God to me , and more also , if I taste bread or aught else till the sun be down. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	36	And all the people took notice of it , and it pleased them , as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	37	For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not because of the king that Abner the son of Ner was slain .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	38	And the king said unto his servants , “ Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	3	39	And I am this day weak , though anointed king ; and these men , the sons of Zeruiah , are too hard for me . The Lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness . ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	2	And Saul ’ s son had two men who were captains of companies : the name of the one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab , the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite , of the children of Benjamin . ( For Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	4	And Jonathan , Saul ’ s son , had a son who was lame in his feet . He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel , and his nurse took him up and fled . And it came to pass , as she made haste to flee , that he fell and became lame . And his name was Mephibosheth .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	3	and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and were sojourners there until this day . )
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	5	And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth , who lay on a bed at noon .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	6	And they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat , and they smote him under the fifth rib ; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	7	For when they came into the house , he lay on his bed in his bedchamber ; and they smote him , and slew him , and beheaded him , and took his head , and got themselves away through the plain all night .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	8	And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David at Hebron , and said to the king , “ Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy , who sought thy life ; and the Lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	9	And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , and said unto them , “ As the Lord liveth , who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	10	when one told me , saying , ‘ Behold , Saul is dead , ’ thinking to have brought good tidings , I took hold of him and slew him in Ziklag ; he thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	11	How much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed ? Shall I not therefore now require his blood at your hand and take you away from the earth ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	4	12	And David commanded his young men , and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet , and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron . But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the sepulcher of Abner in Hebron .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	2	Also in time past , when Saul was king over us , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel ; and the Lord said to thee , ‘ Thou shalt feed My people Israel , and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months , and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron ; and King David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord , and they anointed David king over Israel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	6	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites , the inhabitants of the land , who spoke unto David , saying , “ Unless thou take away the blind and the lame , thou shalt not come in hither , ” thinking , “ David can not come in hither. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	7	Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion ( the same is the City of David ) .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	8	And David said on that day , “ Whosoever getteth up through the gutter and smiteth the Jebusites , and the lame and the blind , who are hated in David ’ s soul , he shall be chief and captain. ” Therefore they said , “ The blind and the lame shall not come into the house. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	9	So David dwelt in the fortress , and called it the City of David . And David built round about from the Millo and inward .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	10	And David went on and grew great , and the Lord God of hosts was with him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	11	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David , and cedar trees and carpenters and masons ; and they built David a house .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	12	And David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel , and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people Israel ’ s sake .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	13	And David took more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem after he had come from Hebron ; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	14	And these are the names of those who were born unto him in Jerusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , and Nathan , and Solomon ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	15	Ibhar also , and Elishua , and Nepheg , and Japhia ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	17	But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines came up to seek David ; and David heard of it and went down to the stronghold .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	18	The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the Valley of Rephaim .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	19	And David inquired of the Lord , saying , “ Shall I go up to the Philistines ? Wilt Thou deliver them into mine hand ? ” And the Lord said unto David , “ Go up , for I will surely deliver the Philistines into thine hand. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	20	And David came to Baalperazim , and David smote them there and said , “ The Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me , as the breach of waters. ” Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim [ that is , The plain of breaches ] .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	21	And there they left their images , and David and his men burned them .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	22	And the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the Valley of Rephaim .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	23	And when David inquired of the Lord , He said , “ Thou shalt not go up ; but pass around behind them , and come upon them over against the mulberry trees .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	24	And let it be , when thou hearest the sound of moving in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt bestir thyself ; for then shall the Lord go out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	5	25	And David did so , as the Lord had commanded him , and smote the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	2	And David arose , and went with all the people who were with him from Baale of Judah to bring up from thence the ark of God , whose name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts who dwelleth between the cherubims .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	6	And when they came to Nachon ’ s threshing floor , Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it , for the oxen shook it .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	3	And they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab , that was at Gibeah ; and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drove the new cart .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	4	And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab , which wasat Gibeah , accompanying the ark of God ; and Ahio went before the ark .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	5	And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood , even on harps and on psalteries , and on timbrels and on cornets , and on cymbals .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	7	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah , and God smote him there for his error ; and there he died by the ark of God .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	8	And David was displeased because the Lord had broken out upon Uzzah ; and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah [ that is , The breach of Uzzah ] to this day .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	9	And David was afraid of the Lord that day and said , “ How shall the ark of the Lord come to me ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	10	So David would not remove the ark of the Lord unto him into the City of David , but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	11	And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months ; and the Lord blessed Obededom and all his household .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	12	And it was told King David , saying , “ The Lord hath blessed the house of Obededom and all that pertaineth unto him , because of the ark of God. ” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the City of David with gladness .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	13	And it was so that , when those who bore the ark of the Lord had gone six paces , he sacrificed oxen and fatlings .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	14	And David danced before the Lord with all his might ; and David was girded with a linen ephod .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	15	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	16	And as the ark of the Lord came into the City of David , Michal , Saul ’ s daughter , looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord ; and she despised him in her heart .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	17	And they brought in the ark of the Lord , and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	18	And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	19	And he dealt among all the people , even among the whole multitude of Israel , as well to the women as men , to every one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine . So all the people departed every one to his house .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	20	Then David returned to bless his household . And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said , “ How glorious was the king of Israel today , who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants , as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself ! ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	21	And David said unto Michal , “ It was before the Lord , who chose me before thy father and before all his house , to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord , over Israel ; therefore will I play before the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	22	And I will yet be more vile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight ; and of the maidservants whom thou hast spoken of , of them shall I be held in honor. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	6	23	Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	2	that the king said unto Nathan the prophet , “ See now , I dwell in a house of cedar , but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	7	In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel , spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel , whom I commanded to feed My people Israel , saying , “ Why build ye not Me a house of cedar ? ” ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	3	And Nathan said to the king , “ Go , do all that is in thine heart , for the Lord is with thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	4	And it came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	5	“ Go and tell My servant David , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Shalt thou build Me a house for Me to dwell in ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	6	For I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	8	Now therefore , so shalt thou say unto My servant David , ‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : I took thee from the sheepcote , from following the sheep , to be ruler over My people , over Israel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	9	And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men who are on the earth .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	10	Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel , and will plant them , that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more ; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more , as before ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	11	and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies . “ ‘ Also the Lord telleth thee that He will make thee a house .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	12	And when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , I will set up thy seed after thee , who shall proceed out of thy loins , and I will establish his kingdom .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	13	He shall build a house for My name , and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	14	I will be his Father , and he shall be My son . If he commit iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	15	but My mercy shall not depart away from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before thee .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	16	And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee ; thy throne shall be established for ever. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	17	According to all these words and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speak unto David .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	18	Then went King David in and sat before the Lord , and he said : “ Who am I , O Lord God ? And what is my house , that Thou hast brought me hitherto ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	19	And this was yet a small thing in Thy sight , O Lord God ; but Thou hast spoken also of Thy servant ’ s house for a great while to come . And is this the manner of man , O Lord God ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	20	And what can David say more unto Thee ? For Thou , Lord God , knowest Thy servant .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	21	For Thy word ’ s sake and according to Thine own heart hast Thou done all these great things to make Thy servant know them .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	22	Therefore Thou art great , O Lord God ; for there is none like Thee , neither is there any God besides Thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	23	And what one nation on the earth is like Thy people , even like Israel , whom God went to redeem for a people to Himself , and to make Him a name and to do for You great things and fearsome for Thy land , before Thy people whom Thou redeemed to Thee from Egypt , from the nations and their gods ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	24	For Thou hast confirmed for Thyself Thy people Israel to be a people unto Thee for ever ; and Thou , Lord , art become their God .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	25	And now , O Lord God , the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant and concerning his house , establish it for ever , and do as Thou hast said .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	26	And let Thy name be magnified for ever saying , ‘ The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel ’ ; and let the house of Thy servant David be established before Thee .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	27	For Thou , O Lord of hosts , God of Israel , hast revealed to Thy servant , saying , ‘ I will build thee a house. ’ Therefore hath Thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto Thee .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	28	And now , O Lord God , Thou art that God , and Thy words be true , and Thou hast promised this goodness unto Thy servant .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	7	29	Therefore now let it please Thee to bless the house of Thy servant , that it may continue for ever before Thee ; for Thou , O Lord God , hast spoken it , and with Thy blessing let the house of Thy servant be blessed for ever . ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	2	And he smote Moab , and measured them with a line , casting them down to the ground : even with two lines measured he those to be put to death , and with one full line those to be kept alive . And so the Moabites became David ’ s servants and brought gifts .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	8	And from Betah and from Berothai , cities of Hadadezer , King David took exceeding much brass .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	3	David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob , king of Zobah , as he went to recover his border at the River Euphrates .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	4	And David took from him a thousand chariots , and seven hundred horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen ; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses , but reserved enough of them for a hundred chariots .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah , David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus ; and the Syrians became servants to David and brought gifts . And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	9	When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	10	then Toi sent Joram his son unto King David to salute him and to bless him , because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him ; for Hadadezer had wars with Toi . And Joram brought with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	11	which also King David dedicated unto the Lord , with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued :
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	12	of Syria , and of Moab , and of the children of Ammon , and of the Philistines , and of Amalek , and of the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob , king of Zobah .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	13	And David got him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt , being eighteen thousand men .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	14	And he put garrisons in Edom ; throughout all Edom he put garrisons , and all those of Edom became David ’ s servants . And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	15	And David reigned over all Israel ; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	16	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	17	and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests ; and Seraiah was the scribe ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	8	18	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and David ’ s sons were chief rulers .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	2	And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba . And when they had called him unto David , the king said unto him , “ Art thou Ziba ? ” And he said , “ Thy servant is he. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	9	Then the king called to Ziba , Saul ’ s servant , and said unto him , “ I have given unto thy master ’ s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	3	And the king said , “ Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may show the kindness of God unto him ? ” And Ziba said unto the king , “ Jonathan hath yet a son who is lame in his feet. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	4	And the king said unto him , “ Where is he ? ” And Ziba said unto the king , “ Behold , he is in the house of Machir , the son of Ammiel , in Lodebar. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	5	Then King David sent and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , from Lodebar .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	6	Now when Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , had come unto David , he fell on his face and did reverence . And David said , “ Mephibosheth. ” And he answered , “ Behold thy servant ! ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	7	And David said unto him , “ Fear not ; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father ’ s sake , and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father ; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	8	And he bowed himself and said , “ What is thy servant , that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	10	Thou , therefore , and thy sons and thy servants , shall till the land for him , and thou shalt bring in the fruits , that thy master ’ s son may have food to eat ; but Mephibosheth thy master ’ s son shall eat bread always at my table. ” ( Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants . )
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	11	Then said Ziba unto the king , “ According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant , so shall thy servant do. ” “ As for Mephibosheth , ” said the king , “ he shall eat at my table as one of the king ’ s sons. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	12	And Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micha . And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	9	13	So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem , for he ate continually at the king ’ s table , and was lame in both his feet .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	2	Then said David , “ I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash , as his father showed kindness unto me. ” And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father . And David ’ s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	10	and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother , that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	3	And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord , “ Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father , that he hath sent comforters unto thee ? Hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	4	Therefore Hanun took David ’ s servants and shaved off one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	5	When they told it unto David , he sent to meet them , because the men were greatly ashamed . And the king said , “ Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown , and then return. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they were a stench before David , the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba , twenty thousand footmen , and of King Maacah a thousand men , and of Ishtob twelve thousand men .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	7	And when David heard of it , he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	8	And the children of Ammon came out and set up in battle array at the entrance to the gate ; and the Syrians of Zoba , and of Rehob , and Ishtob , and Maacah were by themselves in the field .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	9	When Joab saw that the front of the battle line was against him before and behind , he chose from all the choice men of Israel and put them in array against the Syrians ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	11	And he said , “ If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me ; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	12	Be of good courage , and let us play the man for our people and for the cities of our God ; and the Lord do that which seemeth to Him good. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	13	And Joab drew nigh , and the people who were with him , unto the battle against the Syrians ; and they fled before him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	14	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , then fled they also before Abishai and entered into the city . So Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	15	And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel , they gathered themselves together .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	16	And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the river , and they came to Helam ; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadadezer went before them .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	17	And when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together and passed over the Jordan and came to Helam . And the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	18	And the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians and forty thousand horsemen , and smote Shobach the captain of their host , who died there .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	10	19	And when all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were smitten before Israel , they made peace with Israel and served them . So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	2	And it came to pass in an eveningtide that David arose from his bed and walked upon the roof of the king ’ s house . And from the roof he saw a woman washing herself , and the woman was very beautiful to look upon .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	11	And Uriah said unto David , “ The ark and Israel and Judah abide in tents , and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields : shall I then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife ? As thou livest and as thy soul liveth , I will not do this thing. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	3	And David sent and inquired after the woman . And one said , “ Is not this Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah the Hittite ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	4	And David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in unto him , and he lay with her , for she was purified from her uncleanness ; and she returned unto her house .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	5	And the woman conceived , and sent and told David , and said , “ I am with child. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	6	And David sent to Joab , saying , “ Send me Uriah the Hittite. ” And Joab sent Uriah to David .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	7	And when Uriah had come unto him , David demanded of him how Joab did , and how the people did , and how the war prospered .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	8	And David said to Uriah , “ Go down to thy house and wash thy feet. ” And Uriah departed out of the king ’ s house , and there followed him a meal of meat from the king .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	9	But Uriah slept at the door of the king ’ s house with all the servants of his lord , and went not down to his house .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	10	And when they had told David , saying , “ Uriah went not down unto his house , ” David said unto Uriah , “ Camest thou not from thy journey ? Why then did thou not go down unto thine house ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	12	And David said to Uriah , “ Tarry here today also , and tomorrow I will let thee depart. ” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the morrow .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	13	And when David had called him , he ate and drank before him , and he made him drunk ; and at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but went not down to his house .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	14	And it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to Joab , and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	15	And he wrote in the letter , saying , “ Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle , and retire ye from him , that he may be smitten and die. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	16	And it came to pass , when Joab observed the city , that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	17	And the men of the city went out and fought with Joab ; and there fell some of the people of the servants of David , and Uriah the Hittite died also .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	18	Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	19	and charged the messenger , saying , “ When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	20	and if so be that the king ’ s wrath arise and he say unto thee , ‘ Why approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye fought ? Knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	21	Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth ? Did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall , that he died in Thebez ? Why went ye nigh the wall ? ’ — then say thou , ‘ Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	22	So the messenger went , and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	23	And the messenger said unto David , “ Surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field , and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	24	And the shooters shot from the wall upon thy servants ; and some of the king ’ s servants are dead , and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	25	Then David said unto the messenger , “ Thus shalt thou say unto Joab : ‘ Let not this thing displease thee , for the sword devoureth one as well as another . Press thy battle stronger against the city , and overthrow it ’ ; and encourage thou him. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	26	And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead , she mourned for her husband .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	11	27	And when the mourning was past , David sent and fetched her to his house ; and she became his wife and bore him a son . But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	2	The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	12	For thou did it secretly ; but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	3	But the poor man had nothing , save one little ewe lamb , which he had bought and nourished up . And it grew up together with him and with his children ; it ate of his own meat and drank of his own cup , and lay in his bosom , and was unto him as a daughter .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	4	And there came a traveler unto the rich man , and he was unwilling to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man who had come unto him , but took the poor man ’ s lamb and dressed it for the man who had come to him. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	5	And David ’ s anger was greatly kindled against the man , and he said to Nathan , “ As the Lord liveth , the man who hath done this thing shall surely die .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	6	And he shall restore the lamb fourfold , because he did this thing and because he had no pity. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	7	And Nathan said to David , “ Thou art the man . Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : ‘ I anointed thee king over Israel , and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	8	and I gave thee thy master ’ s house and thy master ’ s wives into thy bosom , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	9	Why hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord , to do evil in His sight ? Thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and hast taken his wife to be thy wife , and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	10	Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house , because thou hast despised Me and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	11	“ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house ; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor , and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	13	And David said unto Nathan , “ I have sinned against the Lord. ” And Nathan said unto David , “ The Lord also hath put away thy sin ; thou shalt not die. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	14	However , because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme , the child also who is born unto thee shall surely die. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	15	And Nathan departed unto his house . And the Lord struck the child that Uriah ’ s wife bore unto David , and it was very sick .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	16	David therefore besought God for the child ; and David fasted , and went in and lay all night upon the earth .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	17	And the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth ; but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	18	And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died . And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead ; for they said , “ Behold , while the child was yet alive , we spoke unto him , and he would not hearken unto our voice . How will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	19	But when David saw that his servants whispered , David perceived that the child was dead . Therefore David said unto his servants , “ Is the child dead ? ” And they said , “ He is dead. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	20	Then David arose from the earth , and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel , and came into the house of the Lord , and worshiped . Then he came to his own house ; and when he required , they set bread before him and he ate .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	21	Then said his servants unto him , “ What thing is this that thou hast done ? Thou did fast and weep for the child while it was alive , but when the child was dead , thou did rise and eat bread. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	22	And he said , “ While the child was yet alive , I fasted and wept ; for I said , ‘ Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me , that the child may live ? ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	23	But now he is dead ; why should I fast ? Can I bring him back again ? I shall go to him , but he shall not return to me. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	24	And David comforted Bathsheba his wife , and went in unto her and lay with her . And she bore a son , and he called his name Solomon ; and the Lord loved him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	25	And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet , and he called his name Jedidiah [ that is , Beloved of the Lord ] , because of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	26	And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and took the royal city .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	27	And Joab sent messengers to David and said , “ I have fought against Rabbah and have taken from the city its waters .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	28	Now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it , lest I take the city and it be called after my name. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	29	And David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah , and fought against it , and took it .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	30	And he took their king ’ s crown from off his head , the weight of which was a talent of gold with the precious stones ; and it was set on David ’ s head . And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	12	31	And he brought forth the people who were therein , and put them under saws , and under harrows of iron , and under axes of iron , and made them pass through the brickkiln ; and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon . So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	2	And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister Tamar ; for she was a virgin , and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	13	And I , whither shall I cause my shame to go ? And as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel . Now therefore , I pray thee , speak unto the king , for he will not withhold me from thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	3	But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab , the son of Shimeah David ’ s brother ; and Jonadab was a very subtle man .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	4	And he said unto him , “ Why art thou , being the king ’ s son , lean from day to day ? Wilt thou not tell me ? ” And Amnon said unto him , “ I love Tamar , my brother Absalom ’ s sister. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	5	And Jonadab said unto him , “ Lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick ; and when thy father cometh to see thee , say unto him , ‘ I pray thee , let my sister Tamar come and give me meat , and dress the meat in my sight , that I may see it and eat it at her hand. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	6	So Amnon lay down and made himself sick ; and when the king came to see him , Amnon said unto the king , “ I pray thee , let Tamar my sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat at her hand. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	7	Then David sent home to Tamar , saying , “ Go now to thy brother Amnon ’ s house , and dress him meat. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon ’ s house ; and he was lying down . And she took flour and kneaded it , and made cakes in his sight , and baked the cakes .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	9	And she took a pan and poured them out before him , but he refused to eat . And Amnon said , “ Send out all men from me. ” And they went out every man from him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	10	And Amnon said unto Tamar , “ Bring the meat into the chamber , that I may eat from thine hand. ” And Tamar took the cakes which she had made , and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	11	And when she had brought them unto him to eat , he took hold of her and said unto her , “ Come lie with me , my sister. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	12	And she answered him , “ Nay , my brother , do not force me , for no such thing ought to be done in Israel . Do not thou this folly !
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	14	Nevertheless he would not hearken unto her voice ; but , being stronger than she , forced her , and lay with her .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	15	Then Amnon hated her exceedingly , so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her . And Amnon said unto her , “ Arise , be gone ! ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	16	And she said unto him , “ There is no cause . This evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou did unto me. ” But he would not hearken unto her .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	17	Then he called his servant who ministered unto him and said , “ Put now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	18	And she had a garment of divers colors upon her , for with such robes were the king ’ s daughters who were virgins appareled . Then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	19	And Tamar put ashes on her head , and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her , and laid her hand on her head and went on crying .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	20	And Absalom her brother said unto her , “ Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee ? But hold now thy peace , my sister . He is thy brother ; regard not this thing. ” So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom ’ s house .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	21	But when King David heard of all these things , he was very wroth .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	22	And Absalom spoke unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad ; for Absalom hated Amnon , because he had forced his sister Tamar .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	23	And it came to pass after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor , which is beside Ephraim ; and Absalom invited all the king ’ s sons .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	24	And Absalom came to the king and said , “ Behold now , thy servant hath sheepshearers ; let the king , I beseech thee , and his servants go with thy servant. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	25	And the king said to Absalom , “ Nay , my son , let us not all now go , lest we be a burden unto thee. ” And he pressed him ; however he would not go , but blessed him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	26	Then said Absalom , “ If not , I pray thee , let my brother Amnon go with us. ” And the king said unto him , “ Why should he go with thee ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	27	But Absalom pressed him , so that he let Amnon and all the king ’ s sons go with him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	28	Now Absalom had commanded his servants , saying , “ Mark ye now when Amnon ’ s heart is merry with wine , and when I say unto you , ‘ Smite Amnon , ’ then kill him . Fear not . Have not I commanded you ? Be courageous and be valiant. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	29	And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded . Then all the king ’ s sons arose , and every man got himself up upon his mule and fled .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	30	And it came to pass , while they were on the way , that tidings came to David , saying , “ Absalom hath slain all the king ’ s sons , and there is not one of them left. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	31	Then the king arose and tore his garments , and lay on the earth ; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	32	And Jonadab the son of Shimeah , David ’ s brother , answered and said , “ Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men , the king ’ s sons , for Amnon only is dead ; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	33	Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king ’ s sons are dead ; for Amnon only is dead. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	34	But Absalom fled . And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , there came many people by the way of the hillside behind him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	35	And Jonadab said unto the king , “ Behold , the king ’ s sons come . As thy servant said , so it is. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	36	And it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of speaking , that behold , the king ’ s sons came , and lifted up their voice and wept ; and the king also and all his servants wept very sorely .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	37	But Absalom fled , and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud , king of Geshur . And David mourned for his son every day .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	38	So Absalom fled and went to Geshur , and was there three years .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	13	39	And the soul of King David longed to go forth unto Absalom , for he was comforted concerning Amnon , seeing he was dead .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	2	Samuel
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	14	For we must needs die , and are as water spilled on the ground , which can not be gathered up again ; neither doth God respect any person . Yet doth He devise means , that His banished be not expelled from Him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	3	and come to the king and speak in this manner unto him. ” So Joab put the words in her mouth .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	4	And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king , she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance , and said , “ Help , O king ! ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	5	And the king said unto her , “ What aileth thee ? ” And she answered , “ I am indeed a widow woman , and mine husband is dead .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	6	And thy handmaid had two sons , and the two strove together in the field ; and there was none to part them , but the one smote the other and slew him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	7	And behold , the whole family has risen against thine handmaid , and they said , ‘ Deliver him that smote his brother , that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew ; and we will destroy the heir also. ’ And so they shall quench my coal which is left , and shall leave to my husband neither name nor remnant upon the earth. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	8	And the king said unto the woman , “ Go to thine house , and I will give charge concerning thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	9	And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king , “ My lord , O king , the iniquity be on me and on my father ’ s house , and the king and his throne be guiltless. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	10	And the king said , “ Whosoever saith aught unto thee , bring him to me , and he shall not touch thee any more. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	11	Then said she , “ I pray thee , let the king remember the Lord thy God , that thou wouldest not suffer the avengers of blood to destroy any more , lest they destroy my son. ” And he said , “ As the Lord liveth , there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	12	Then the woman said , “ Let thine handmaid , I pray thee , speak one word unto my lord the king. ” And he said , “ Say on. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	13	And the woman said , “ Why then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God ? For the king doth speak this thing as one who is faulty , in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	15	Now therefore , why I have come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king : it is because the people have made me afraid . And thy handmaid said , ‘ I will now speak unto the king . It may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	16	For the king will hear , to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	17	Then thine handmaid said , ‘ The word of my lord the king shall now be comforting ; for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad . Therefore the Lord thy God will be with thee. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	18	Then the king answered and said unto the woman , “ Hide not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall ask thee. ” And the woman said , “ Let my lord the king now speak. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	19	And the king said , “ Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this ? ” And the woman answered and said , “ As thy soul liveth , my lord the king , none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken ; for thy servant Joab , he bade me , and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	20	To bring about this manner of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing ; and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	21	And the king said unto Joab , “ Behold now , I have done this thing . Go therefore , bring the young man Absalom again. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	22	And Joab fell to the ground on his face , and bowed himself , and thanked the king ; and Joab said , “ Today thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight , my lord , O king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	23	So Joab arose and went to Geshur , and brought Absalom to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	24	And the king said , “ Let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face. ” So Absalom returned to his own house , and saw not the king ’ s face .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	25	But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty ; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	26	And when he cut his hair ( for it was at every year ’ s end that he cut it , because the hair was heavy on him ; therefore he cut it ) , he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels according to the king ’ s weight .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	27	And unto Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter whose name was Tamar ; she was a woman of a fair countenance .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	28	So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem , and saw not the king ’ s face .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	29	Therefore Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king , but he would not come to him ; and when he sent again the second time , he would not come .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	30	Therefore he said unto his servants , “ See , Joab ’ s field is near mine , and he hath barley there ; go and set it on fire. ” And Absalom ’ s servants set the field on fire .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	31	Then Joab arose and came to Absalom unto his house , and said unto him , “ Why have thy servants set my field on fire ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	32	And Absalom answered Joab , “ Behold , I sent unto thee , saying , ‘ Come hither , that I may send thee to the king to say , “ Why have I come from Geshur ? It had been good for me to have been there still ! ” ’ Now therefore let me see the king ’ s face ; and if there be any iniquity in me , let him kill me. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	14	33	So Joab came to the king and told him . And when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king ; and the king kissed Absalom .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	2	And Absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate ; and it was so that , when any man who had a controversy came to the king for judgment , then Absalom called unto him and said , “ Of what city art thou ? ” And he said , “ Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	15	And the king ’ s servants said unto the king , “ Behold , thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	3	And Absalom said unto him , “ See , thy matters are good and right ; but there is no man deputed by the king to hear thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	4	Absalom said moreover , “ Oh , that I were made judge in the land , that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me , and I would do him justice ! ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	5	And it was so that , when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	6	And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel who came to the king for judgment ; so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	7	And it came to pass after forty years , that Absalom said unto the king , “ I pray thee , let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed unto the Lord in Hebron .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	8	For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria , saying , ‘ If the Lord shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem , then I will serve the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	9	And the king said unto him , “ Go in peace. ” So he arose and went to Hebron .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	10	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , “ As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet , then ye shall say , ‘ Absalom reigneth in Hebron. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	11	And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem who were called ; and they went in their simplicity , and they knew not any thing .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	12	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David ’ s counselor , from his city , even from Giloh , while he offered sacrifices . And the conspiracy was strong , for the people increased continually with Absalom .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	13	And there came a messenger to David , saying , “ The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	14	And David said unto all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem , “ Arise , and let us flee , for we shall not else escape from Absalom . Make speed to depart , lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us , and smite the city with the edge of the sword. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	16	And the king went forth , and all his household after him . And the king left ten women , who were concubines , to keep the house .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	17	And the king went forth , and all the people after him , and tarried in a place that was far off .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	18	And all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the Gittites , six hundred men who came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	19	Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite , “ Why goest thou also with us ? Return to thy place and abide with the king , for thou art a stranger and also an exile .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	20	Whereas thou camest but yesterday , should I this day make thee go up and down with us ? Seeing I go whither I may , return thou and take back thy brethren . Mercy and truth be with thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	21	And Ittai answered the king and said , “ As the Lord liveth and as my lord the king liveth , surely in what place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , even there also will thy servant be. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	22	And David said to Ittai , “ Go , and pass over. ” And Ittai the Gittite passed over , and all his men and all the little ones who were with him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	23	And all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over . The king also himself passed over the Brook Kidron , and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	24	And lo , Zadok also , and all the Levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of God ; and they set down the ark of God , and Abiathar went up until all the people had passed out of the city .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	25	And the king said unto Zadok , “ Carry back the ark of God into the city . If I shall find favor in the eyes of the Lord , He will bring me back , and show me both it and His habitation .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	26	But if He thus say , ‘ I have no delight in thee , ’ behold , here am I . Let Him do to me as seemeth good unto Him. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	27	The king said also unto Zadok the priest , “ Art not thou a seer ? Return into the city in peace , and your two sons with you , Ahimaaz thy son , and Jonathan the son of Abiathar .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	28	See , I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there come word from you to assure me. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	29	Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem ; and they tarried there .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	30	And David went up by the ascent of Mount Olivet , and wept as he went up ; and he had his head covered and went barefoot . And all the people who were with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	31	And one told David , saying , “ Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. ” And David said , “ O Lord , I pray Thee , turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	32	And it came to pass , when David had come to the top of the mount where he worshiped God , that , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	33	unto whom David said , “ If thou passest on with me , then thou shalt be a burden unto me ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	34	but if thou return to the city and say unto Absalom , ‘ I will be thy servant , O king ; as I have been thy father ’ s servant hitherto , so will I now also be thy servant , ’ then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	35	And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests ? Therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king ’ s house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	36	Behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz , Zadok ’ s son , and Jonathan , Abiathar ’ s son ; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye can hear. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	15	37	So Hushai , David ’ s friend , came into the city , and Absalom came into Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	2	And the king said unto Ziba , “ What meanest thou by these ? ” And Ziba said , “ The asses are for the king ’ s household to ride on , and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat , and the wine , that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	16	And it came to pass , when Hushai the Archite , David ’ s friend , had come unto Absalom , that Hushai said unto Absalom , “ God save the king ! God save the king ! ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	3	And the king said , “ And where is thy master ’ s son ? ” And Ziba said unto the king , “ Behold , he abideth at Jerusalem ; for he said , ‘ Today shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	4	Then said the king to Ziba , “ Behold , thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. ” And Ziba said , “ I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight , my lord , O king. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	5	And when King David came to Bahurim , behold , thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera ; he came forth , and cursed constantly as he came .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	6	And he cast stones at David and at all the servants of King David ; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	7	And thus said Shimei when he cursed , “ Come out , come out , thou bloody man and thou man of Belial !
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	8	The Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose stead thou hast reigned ; and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son . And behold , thou art taken in thy mischief , because thou art a bloody man. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	9	Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king , “ Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? Let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	10	And the king said , “ What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zeruiah ? So let him curse , because the Lord hath said unto him , ‘ Curse David. ’ Who shall then say , ‘ Why hast thou done so ? ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	11	And David said to Abishai and to all his servants , “ Behold , my son , who came forth from my loins , seeketh my life . How much more now may this Benjamite do it ? Let him alone and let him curse , for the Lord hath bidden him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	12	It may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction , and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	13	And as David and his men went by the way , Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	14	And the king and all the people who were with him became weary and refreshed themselves there .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	15	And Absalom and all the people , the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	17	And Absalom said to Hushai , “ Is this thy kindness to thy friend ? Why wentest thou not with thy friend ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	18	And Hushai said unto Absalom , “ Nay ; but whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	19	And again , whom should I serve ? Should I not serve in the presence of his son ? As I have served in thy father ’ s presence , so will I be in thy presence. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	20	Then said Absalom to Ahithophel , “ Give counsel among you what we shall do. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	21	And Ahithophel said unto Absalom , “ Go in unto thy father ’ s concubines , whom he hath left to keep the house ; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred by thy father . Then shall the hands of all who are with thee be strong. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	22	So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house , and Absalom went in unto his father ’ s concubines in the sight of all Israel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	16	23	And the counsel of Ahithophel , which he counseled in those days , was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God ; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	2	And I will come upon him while he is weary and weakhanded , and will make him afraid ; and all the people who are with him shall flee , and I will smite the king only .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel , for they dared not be seen to come into the city ; and a maidservant went and told them , and they went and told King David .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	3	And I will bring back all the people unto thee : the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned ; so all the people shall be in peace. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	4	And the saying pleased Absalom well , and all the elders of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	5	Then said Absalom , “ Call now Hushai the Archite also , and let us hear likewise what he saith. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	6	And when Hushai had come to Absalom , Absalom spoke unto him , saying , “ Ahithophel hath spoken in this manner . Shall we do according to his word ? If not , speak thou. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	7	And Hushai said unto Absalom , “ The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	8	For , ” said Hushai , “ thou knowest thy father and his men , that they are mighty men , and they are chafed in their minds , as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field ; and thy father is a man of war , and will not lodge with the people .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	9	Behold , he is hid now in some pit , or in some other place ; and it will come to pass , when some of them are overthrown at the first , that whosoever heareth it will say , ‘ There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom. ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	10	And he also that is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt ; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man , and those who are with him are valiant men .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	11	Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee , from Dan even to Beersheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude , and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	12	So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground ; and of him and of all the men who are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	13	Moreover , if he be gotten into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city ; and we will draw it into the river , until there be not one small stone found there. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	14	And Absalom and all the men of Israel said , “ The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. ” For the Lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel , with the intent that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	15	Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , “ Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel , and thus and thus have I counseled .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	16	Now therefore send quickly and tell David , saying , ‘ Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness , but speedily pass over , lest the king be swallowed up and all the people who are with him. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	18	Nevertheless a lad saw them , and told Absalom ; but they went both of them away quickly , and came to a man ’ s house in Bahurim , who had a well in his court , whither they went down .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	19	And the woman took and spread a covering over the well ’ s mouth , and spread ground corn thereon ; and the thing was not known .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	20	And when Absalom ’ s servants came to the woman to the house , they said , “ Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? ” And the woman said unto them , “ They have gone over the brook of water. ” And when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	21	And it came to pass , after they had departed , that they came up out of the well and went and told King David , and said unto David , “ Arise , and pass quickly over the water , for thus hath Ahithophel counseled against you. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	22	Then David arose , and all the people who were with him , and they passed over the Jordan . By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	23	And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his ass , and arose and got him home to his house , to his city , and put his household in order , and hanged himself , and died , and was buried in the sepulcher of his father .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	24	Then David came to Mahanaim . And Absalom passed over the Jordan , he and all the men of Israel with him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	25	And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab . This Amasa was a man ’ s son whose name was Ithra , an Israelite , who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah Joab ’ s mother .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	26	So Israel and Absalom pitched camp in the land of Gilead .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	27	And it came to pass , when David had come to Mahanaim , that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar , and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	28	brought beds and basins and earthen vessels , and wheat and barley and flour and parched corn , and beans and lentils and parched pulse ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	17	29	and honey and butter , and sheep , and cheese from cows , for David and for the people who were with him to eat . For they said , “ The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness . ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	2	And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab , and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah , Joab ’ s brother , and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite . And the king said unto the people , “ I will surely go forth with you myself also. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar , which is in the King ’ s Dale , for he said , “ I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. ” And he called the pillar after his own name ; and it is called unto this day , Absalom ’ s Place .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	3	But the people answered , “ Thou shalt not go forth ; for if we flee away , they will not care for us ; neither if half of us die will they care for us . But now thou art worth ten thousand of us ; therefore now it is better that thou succor us from the city. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	4	And the king said unto them , “ What seemeth to you best I will do. ” And the king stood by the gate side , and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	5	And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , “ Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom. ” And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	6	So the people went out into the field against Israel . And the battle was in the wood of Ephraim ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	7	where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David ; and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	8	For the battle there was scattered over the face of all the country ; and the woods devoured more people that day than the sword devoured .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	9	And Absalom met the servants of David . And Absalom rode upon a mule , and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak ; and his head caught hold of the oak , and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth , and the mule that was under him went away .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	10	And a certain man saw it , and told Joab and said , “ Behold , I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	11	And Joab said unto the man who told him , “ And behold , thou sawest him , and why did thou not smite him there to the ground ? And I would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	12	And the man said unto Joab , “ Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand , yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king ’ s son ; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai , saying , ‘ Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	13	Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life ; for there is no matter hid from the king , and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	14	Then said Joab , “ I may not tarry thus with thee. ” And he took three darts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	15	And ten young men who bore Joab ’ s armor compassed about and smote Absalom , and slew him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	16	And Joab blew the trumpet , and the people returned from pursuing after Israel , for Joab held back the people .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	17	And they took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood , and laid a very great heap of stones upon him ; and all Israel fled every one to his tent .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	19	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok , “ Let me now run and bear the king tidings , how the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	20	And Joab said unto him , “ Thou shalt not bear tidings this day , but thou shalt bear tidings another day ; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings , because the king ’ s son is dead. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	21	Then said Joab to a Cushite , “ Go , tell the king what thou hast seen. ” And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab and ran .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	22	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab , “ But come what may , let me , I pray thee , also run after the Cushite. ” And Joab said , “ Why wilt thou run , my son , seeing that thou hast no tidings ready ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	23	“ But howsoever , ” said he , “ let me run. ” And he said unto him , “ Run. ” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain , and outran the Cushite .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	24	And David sat between the two gates ; and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , a man running alone .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	25	And the watchman cried and told the king . And the king said , “ If he be alone , there are tidings in his mouth. ” And he came apace and drew near .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	26	And the watchman saw another man running ; and the watchman called unto the gatekeeper and said , “ Behold , another man running alone. ” And the king said , “ He also bringeth tidings. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	27	And the watchman said , “ I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. ” And the king said , “ He is a good man , and cometh with good tidings. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	28	And Ahimaaz called and said unto the king , “ All is well. ” And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said , “ Blessed be the Lord thy God , who hath delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	29	And the king said , “ Is the young man Absalom safe ? ” And Ahimaaz answered , “ When Joab sent the king ’ s servant and me thy servant , I saw a great tumult , but I knew not what it was. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	30	And the king said unto him , “ Turn aside and stand here. ” And he turned aside and stood still .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	31	And behold , the Cushite came ; and the Cushite said , “ Tidings , my lord the king ; for the Lord hath avenged thee this day of all those who rose up against thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	32	And the king said unto the Cushite , “ Is the young man Absalom safe ? ” And the Cushite answered , “ The enemies of my lord the king , and all who rise against thee to do thee hurt , be as that young man is. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	18	33	And the king was much moved , and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept . And as he went , thus he said , “ O my son Absalom , my son , my son Absalom ! Would God I had died for thee , O Absalom , my son , my son ! ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	2	Samuel
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	19	and said unto the king , “ Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me , neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem , that the king should take it to his heart ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	3	And the people got themselves by stealth that day into the city , as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	4	But the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , “ O my son Absalom , O Absalom , my son , my son ! ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	5	And Joab came into the house to the king , and said , “ Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants who this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters , and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	6	in that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends . For thou hast declared this day that thou regardest neither princes nor servants ; for this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all we had died this day , then it had pleased thee well .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	7	Now therefore arise , go forth , and speak comfortingly unto thy servants . For I swear by the Lord , if thou go not forth , there will not tarry one with thee this night ; and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	8	Then the king arose and sat in the gate . And they told unto all the people , saying , “ Behold , the king doth sit in the gate. ” And all the people came before the king , for Israel had fled every man to his tent .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	9	And all the people were in strife throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , “ The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies , and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines ; and now he has fled out of the land because of Absalom .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	10	And Absalom , whom we anointed over us , is dead in battle . Now therefore , why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	11	And King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , saying , “ Speak unto the elders of Judah , saying , ‘ Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house , seeing the speech of all Israel has come to the king , even to his house ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	12	Ye are my brethren , ye are my bones and my flesh . Why then are ye the last to bring back the king ? ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	13	And say ye to Amasa , ‘ Art thou not of my bone and of my flesh ? God do so to me , and more also , if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in place of Joab. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	14	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as the heart of one man , so that they sent this word unto the king : “ Return thou , and all thy servants. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	15	So the king returned and came to the Jordan . And Judah came to Gilgal to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over the Jordan .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	16	And Shimei the son of Gera , a Benjamite , who was of Bahurim , hastened and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	17	And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over the Jordan before the king .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	18	And there went over a ferryboat to carry over the king ’ s household , and to do what he thought good . And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was coming over the Jordan ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	20	for thy servant doth know that I have sinned . Therefore , behold , I have come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	21	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said , “ Shall not Shimei be put to death for this , because he cursed the Lord ’ S anointed ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	22	And David said , “ What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zeruiah , that ye should this day be adversaries unto me ? Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel ? For do not I know that I am this day king over Israel ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	23	Therefore the king said unto Shimei , “ Thou shalt not die. ” And the king swore unto him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	24	And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king , and had neither dressed his feet , nor trimmed his beard , nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	25	And it came to pass , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said unto him , “ Why wentest not thou with me , Mephibosheth ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	26	And he answered , “ My lord , O king , my servant deceived me ; for thy servant said , ‘ I will saddle me an ass , that I may ride thereon and go to the king , ’ because thy servant is lame .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	27	And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king , but my lord the king is as an angel of God . Do therefore what is good in thine eyes .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	28	For all of my father ’ s house were but dead men before my lord the king ; yet did thou set thy servant among those who ate at thine own table . What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	29	And the king said unto him , “ Why speakest thou any more of thy matters ? I have said , ‘ Thou and Ziba divide the land. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	30	And Mephibosheth said unto the king , “ Yea , let him take all , forasmuch as my lord the king has come again in peace unto his own house. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	31	And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim , and went over the Jordan with the king to conduct him over the Jordan .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	32	Now Barzillai was a very aged man , even fourscore years old ; and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim , for he was a very great man .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	33	And the king said unto Barzillai , “ Come thou over with me , and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	34	And Barzillai said unto the king , “ How long have I to live , that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	35	I am this day fourscore years old , and can I discern between good and evil ? Can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink ? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women ? Why then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	36	Thy servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king . And why should the king recompense me with such a reward ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	37	Let thy servant , I pray thee , turn back again , that I may die in mine own city and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother . But behold thy servant Chimham . Let him go over with my lord the king , and do to him what shall seem good unto thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	38	And the king answered , “ Chimham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee . And whatsoever thou shalt require of me , that will I do for thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	39	And all the people went over the Jordan . And when the king had come over , the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him , and he returned unto his own place .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	40	Then the king went on to Gilgal , and Chimham went on with him ; and all the people of Judah conducted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	41	And behold , all the men of Israel came to the king and said unto the king , “ Why have our brethren , the men of Judah , stolen thee away , and have brought the king and his household and all David ’ s men with him over the Jordan ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	42	And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel , “ Because the king is near of kin to us . Why then be ye angry for this matter ? Have we eaten at all at the king ’ s cost ? Or hath he given us any gift ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	19	43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said , “ We have ten parts in the king , and we have also more right in David than ye . Why then did ye despise us , that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king ? ” And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	2	So every man of Israel went up from after David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri ; but the men of Judah cleaved unto their king , from the Jordan even to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	20	And Joab answered and said , “ Far be it , far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	3	And David came to his house at Jerusalem ; and the king took the ten women , his concubines whom he had left to keep the house , and put them in custody and fed them , but went not in unto them . So they were shut up unto the day of their death , living in widowhood .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	4	Then said the king to Amasa , “ Assemble me the men of Judah within three days , and be thou present here. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	5	So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah , but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	6	And David said to Abishai , “ Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom . Take thou thy lord ’ s servants and pursue after him , lest he get himself fortifed cities and escape us. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	7	And there went out after him Joab ’ s men and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men ; and they went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	8	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon , Amasa went before them . And Joab ’ s garment that he had put on was girded unto him , and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof ; and as he went forth , it fell out .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	9	And Joab said to Amasa , “ Art thou in health , my brother ? ” And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	10	but Amasa took no heed of the sword that was in Joab ’ s hand ; so Joab smote him therewith in the fifth rib , and shed out his bowels to the ground , and struck him not again ; and he died . So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	11	And one of Joab ’ s men stood by him and said , “ He that favoreth Joab and he that is for David , let him follow after Joab. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	12	And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway . And when the man saw that all the people stood still , he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him , when he saw that every one who came by him stood still .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	13	When he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	14	And Sheba went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel and to Bethmaachah and all the Berites ; and they were gathered together , and went also with him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	15	And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah ; and they cast up a siege bank against the city , and it stood in the trench ; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall to throw it down .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	16	Then cried a wise woman out of the city , “ Hear , hear ! Say , I pray you , unto Joab , ‘ Come near hither , that I may speak with thee. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	17	And when he had come near unto her , the woman said , “ Art thou Joab ? ” And he answered , “ I am he. ” Then she said unto him , “ Hear the words of thine handmaid. ” And he answered , “ I do hear. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	18	Then she spoke , saying , “ They were wont to speak in olden times , saying , ‘ They shall surely ask counsel at Abel ’ ; and so they ended the matter .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	19	I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel . Thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel . Why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the Lord ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	21	The matter is not so ; but a man of Mount Ephraim , Sheba the son of Bichri by name , hath lifted up his hand against the king , even against David . Deliver him only , and I will depart from the city. ” And the woman said unto Joab , “ Behold , his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	22	Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom . And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri , and cast it out to Joab . And he blew a trumpet , and they retired from the city , every man to his tent . And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	23	Now Joab was over all the host of Israel ; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	24	and Adoram was over the tribute ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	25	and Sheva was scribe ; and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	20	26	and Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler under David .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	2	And the king called the Gibeonites and said unto them ( now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel , but of the remnant of the Amorites ; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them , but Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah ) ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	21	And when he defied Israel , Jonathan the son of Shimea , the brother of David , slew him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	3	therefore David said unto the Gibeonites : “ What shall I do for you ? And wherewith shall I make the atonement , that ye may bless the inheritance of the Lord ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	4	And the Gibeonites said unto him , “ We will have no silver nor gold of Saul nor of his house , neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. ” And he said , “ What ye shall say , that will I do for you. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	5	And they answered the king , “ The man who consumed us and who devised against us , that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	6	let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us , and we will hang them up unto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul , whom the Lord chose. ” And the king said , “ I will give them. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	7	But the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of the Lord ’ S oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	8	But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bore unto Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth , and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	9	And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites , and they hanged them on the hill before the Lord ; and they fell all seven together , and were put to death in the days of harvest , in the first days , in the beginning of barley harvest .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	10	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself upon the rock , from the beginning of harvest untilwater dropped upon them out of heaven ; and she suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	11	And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , the concubine of Saul , had done .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	12	And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead , who had stolen them from the street of Bethshan , where the Philistines had hanged them when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	13	And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son ; and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	14	And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah , in the sepulcher of Kish his father ; and they performed all that the king commanded . And after that God was entreated for the land .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	15	Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel ; and David went down , and his servants with him , and fought against the Philistines ; and David waxed faint .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	16	And Ishbibenob , who was of the sons of the giant , the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight — he , being girded with a new sword , thought to slay David .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him , and smote the Philistine and killed him . Then the men of David swore unto him , saying , “ Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle , that thou quench not the light of Israel. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	18	And it came to pass after this that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob . Then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph , who was of the sons of the giant .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	19	And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines , where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim , a Bethlehemite , slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver ’ s beam .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	20	And there was yet a battle in Gath , where there was a man of great stature , who had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	21	22	These four were born to the giant in Gath , and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	2	And he said , “ The Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	22	For I have kept the ways of the Lord , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	3	the God of my rock , in Him will I trust . He is my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my savior ; Thou savest me from violence .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	4	I will call on the Lord , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	5	“ When the waves of death compassed me , the floods of ungodly men made me afraid ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	6	the sorrows of hell compassed me about ; the snares of death lay ahead of me .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	7	In my distress I called upon the Lord , and cried to my God ; and He heard my voice out of His temple , and my cry entered into His ears .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	8	Then the earth shook and trembled ; the foundations of heaven moved and shook , because He was wroth .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	9	There went up a smoke out of His nostrils , and fire out of His mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	10	He bowed the heavens also , and came down ; and darkness was under His feet .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	11	And He rode upon a cherub , and flew ; and He was seen upon the wings of the wind .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	12	And He made darkness pavilions round about Him , dark waters and thick clouds of the skies .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	13	Through the brightness before Him were coals of fire kindled .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	14	The Lord thundered from heaven , and the Most High uttered His voice .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	15	And He sent out arrows and scattered them ; lightning , and discomfited them .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	16	And the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were laid bare at the rebuking of the Lord , at the blast of the breath of His nostrils .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	17	“ He sent from above , He took me ; He drew me out of many waters .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	18	He delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them that hated me ; for they were too strong for me .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	19	They came before me in the day of my calamity , but the Lord was my stay .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	20	He brought me forth also into a large place ; He delivered me , because He delighted in me .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	21	“ The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness ; according to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	23	For all His judgments were before me ; and as for His statutes , I did not depart from them .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	24	I was also upright before Him , and have kept myself from mine iniquity .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	25	Therefore the Lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness , according to my cleanness in His eyesight .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	26	“ With the merciful Thou wilt show Thyself merciful , and with the upright man Thou wilt show Thyself upright .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	27	With the pure Thou wilt show thyself pure , and with the froward Thou wilt show thyself unsavory .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	28	And the afflicted people Thou wilt save ; but Thine eyes are upon the haughty , that Thou mayest bring them down .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	29	For Thou art my lamp , O Lord ; and the Lord will lighten my darkness .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	30	For by Thee I have run through a troop ; by my God have I leaped over a wall .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	31	“ As for God , His way is perfect ; the word of the Lord is tried ; He is a buckler to all them that trust in Him .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	32	“ For who is God , save the Lord ? And who is a rock , save our God ?
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	33	God is my strength and power , and He maketh my way perfect .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	34	He maketh my feet like hinds ’ feet , and setteth me upon my high places .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	35	He teacheth my hands to war , so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	36	Thou hast also given me the shield of Thy salvation , and Thy gentleness hath made me great .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	37	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me , so that my feet did not slip .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	38	I have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them , and turned not again until I had consumed them .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	39	And I have consumed them and wounded them , that they could not arise ; yea , they are fallen under my feet .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	40	For Thou hast girded me with strength to battle ; them that rose up against me hast Thou subdued under me .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	41	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies , that I might destroy them that hate me .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	42	They looked , but there was none to save ; even unto the Lord , but He answered them not .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	43	Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth ; I stamped them as the mire of the street and spread them abroad .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	44	“ Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people ; Thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen ; a people whom I knew not shall serve me .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	45	Strangers shall submit themselves unto me ; as soon as they hear , they shall be obedient unto me .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	46	Strangers shall fade away , and they shall be afraid out of their secret places .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	47	“ The Lord liveth ! And blessed be my Rock ! And exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation !
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	48	It is God that avengeth me , and that bringeth down the people under me ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	49	and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies . Thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me ; Thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	50	Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee , O Lord , among the heathen , and I will sing praises unto Thy name .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	22	51	He is the tower of salvation for His king , and showeth mercy to His anointed , unto David , and to his seed for evermore . ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	2	“ The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me , and His word was on my tongue .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	23	He was more honorable than the thirty , but he attained not to the first three . And David set him over his guard .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	3	The God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spoke to me : ‘ He that ruleth over men must be just , ruling in the fear of God .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	4	And he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth , even a morning without clouds , as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain. ’
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	5	“ Although my house be not so with God , yet He hath made with me an everlasting covenant , ordered in all things and sure ; for this is all my salvation and all my desire , although He make it not to grow .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	6	But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away , because they can not be taken with hands ;
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	7	but the man that shall touch them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear ; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	8	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had : The Tachmonite who sat in the chief seat among the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite . He lifted up his spear against eight hundred , whom he slew at one time .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	9	And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo , the Ahohite , one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together for battle , and the men of Israel had gone away .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	10	He arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary , and his hand cleaved unto the sword ; and the Lord wrought a great victory that day , and the people returned after him only to despoil .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	11	And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite . And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of lentils ; and the people fled from the Philistines .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	12	But he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it , and slew the Philistines ; and the Lord wrought a great victory .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	13	And three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam ; and the troop of the Philistines pitched camp in the Valley of Rephaim .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	14	And David was then in a stronghold , and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	15	And David longed , and said , “ Oh that one would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	16	And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate , and took it and brought it to David ; nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but poured it out unto the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	17	And he said , “ Be it far from me , O Lord , that I should do this . Is not this the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives ? ” Therefore he would not drink it . These things did these three mighty men .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	18	And Abishai the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief among three . And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them , and had the name among three .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	19	Was he not most honorable of three ? Therefore he was their captain ; however he attained not unto the first three .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	20	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done many acts , he slew two lionlike men of Moab . He went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	21	And he slew an Egyptian , a goodly man ; and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand , but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian ’ s hand , and slew him with his own spear .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	22	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and had the name among three mighty men .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	24	Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty ; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	25	Shammah the Harodite , Elika the Harodite ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	26	Helez the Paltite , Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	27	Abiezer the Anathothite , Mebunnai the Hushathite ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	28	Zalmon the Ahohite , Maharai the Netophathite ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	29	Heleb the son of Baanah , a Netophathite , Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	30	Benaiah the Pirathonite , Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	31	Abialbon the Arbathite , Azmaveth the Barhumite ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite of the sons of Jashen , Jonathan ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	33	Shammah the Hararite , Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	34	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai , the son of the Maachathite , Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	35	Hezrai the Carmelite , Paarai the Arbite ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	36	Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah , Bani the Gadite ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	37	Zelek the Ammonite , Naharai the Beerothite , armorbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	38	Ira an Ithrite , Gareb an Ithrite ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	23	39	Uriah the Hittite : thirty and seven in all .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	2	For the king said to Joab the captain of the host who was with him , “ Go now through all the tribes of Israel , from Dan even to Beersheba , and number ye the people , that I may know the number of the people. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	24	And the king said unto Araunah , “ Nay ; but I will surely buy it from thee at a price ; neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing. ” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	3	And Joab said unto the king , “ Now the Lord thy God add unto the people , how many so ever they be , a hundredfold , that the eyes of my lord the king may see it . But why doth my lord the king delight in this thing ? ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	4	Notwithstanding , the king ’ s word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the host . And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	5	And they passed over the Jordan and pitched camp in Aroer , on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the valley of Gad and toward Jazer .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	6	Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtimhodshi ; and they came to Danjaan and about to Sidon ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	7	and came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites ; and they went out to the south of Judah , even to Beersheba .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	8	So when they had gone through all the land , they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	9	And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword , and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	10	And David ’ s heart smote him after he had numbered the people . And David said unto the Lord , “ I have sinned greatly in what I have done . And now , I beseech Thee , O Lord , take away the iniquity of Thy servant , for I have done very foolishly. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	11	For when David was up in the morning , the word of the Lord came unto the prophet Gad , David ’ s seer , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	12	“ Go , and say unto David , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : I offer thee three things . Choose thee one of them , that I may do it unto thee. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	13	So Gad came to David and told him , and said unto him , “ Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land ? Or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee ? Or shall there be three days ’ pestilence in thy land ? Now advise , and see what answer I shall return to Him that sent me. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	14	And David said unto Gad , “ I am in a great strait . Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord , for His mercies are great ; and let me not fall into the hand of man. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	15	So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed ; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	16	And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it , the Lord repented of the evil , and said to the angel who destroyed the people , “ It is enough : stay now thine hand. ” And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	17	And David spoke unto the Lord when he saw the angel who smote the people , and said , “ Lo , I have sinned , and I have done wickedly . But these sheep , what have they done ? Let Thine hand , I pray Thee , be against me and against my father ’ s house. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	18	And Gad came that day to David and said unto him , “ Go up , rear an altar unto the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	19	And David , according to the saying of Gad , went up as the Lord commanded .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	20	And Araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him ; and Araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	21	And Araunah said , “ Why has my lord the king come to his servant ? ” And David said , “ To buy the threshing floor from thee to build an altar unto the Lord , that the plague may be stayed from the people. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	22	And Araunah said unto David , “ Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him . Behold , here are oxen for burnt sacrifice , and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	23	All these things did Araunah , as a king , give unto the king . And Araunah said unto the king , “ The Lord thy God accept thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Samuel	24	25	And David built there an altar unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . So the Lord was entreated for the land , and the plague was stayed from Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	1	Now King David was old and stricken in years ; and they covered him with clothes , but he got no heat .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	2	Therefore his servants said unto him , “ Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin ; and let her stand before the king , and let her comfort him , and let her lie in thy bosom , that my lord the king may get heat. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	3	So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the region of Israel , and found Abishag , a Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	4	And the damsel was very fair , and cherished the king and ministered to him ; but the king knew her not .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	5	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , “ I will be king ” ; and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	6	And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , “ Why hast thou done so ? ” And he also was a very goodly man , and his mother bore him after Absalom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	7	And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest ; and they , following Adonijah , helped him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	8	But Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men who belonged to David were not with Adonijah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	9	And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth , which is by Enrogel , and called all his brethren , the king ’ s sons , and all the men of Judah , the king ’ s servants ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	10	but Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah , and the mighty men , and Solomon his brother , he called not .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	11	Therefore Nathan spoke unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon , saying , “ Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign , and David our lord knoweth it not ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	12	Now therefore come , let me , I pray thee , give thee counsel , that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son Solomon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	13	Go and get thee in unto King David and say unto him , ‘ Didst not thou , my lord , O king , swear unto thine handmaid , saying , “ Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne ” ? Why then doth Adonijah reign ? ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	14	Behold , while thou yet talkest there with the king , I also will come in after thee and confirm thy words. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	15	And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber ; and the king was very old , and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	16	And Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king . And the king said , “ What wouldest thou ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	17	And she said unto him , “ My lord , thou swore by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid , saying , ‘ Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	18	And now , behold , Adonijah reigneth ; and now , my lord the king , thou knowest it not .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	19	And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the captain of the host ; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	20	And thou , my lord , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	21	Otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	22	And , lo , while she yet talked with the king , Nathan the prophet also came in .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	23	And they told the king , saying , “ Behold Nathan the prophet. ” And when he had come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	24	And Nathan said , “ My lord , O king , hast thou said , ‘ Adonijah shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne ’ ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	25	For he has gone down this day , and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the king ’ s sons and the captains of the host and Abiathar the priest ; and behold , they eat and drink before him and say , ‘ God save King Adonijah ! ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	26	But me , even me thy servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and thy servant Solomon hath he not called .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	27	Is this thing done by my lord the king , and thou hast not shown unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	28	Then King David answered and said , “ Call to me Bathsheba. ” And she came into the king ’ s presence and stood before the king .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	29	And the king swore , and said , “ As the Lord liveth , who hath redeemed my soul out of all distress ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	30	even as I swore unto thee by the Lord God of Israel , saying , ‘ Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead , ’ even so will I certainly do this day. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	31	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth , and did reverence to the king and said , “ Let my lord King David live for ever. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	32	And King David said , “ Call to me Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. ” And they came before the king .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	33	The king also said unto them , “ Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule , and bring him down to Gihon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	34	And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel ; and blow ye with the trumpet , and say , ‘ God save King Solomon ! ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	35	Then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my throne , for he shall be king in my stead ; and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	36	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said , “ Amen ! The Lord God of my lord the king say so too .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	37	As the Lord hath been with my lord the king , even so be He with Solomon , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	38	So Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites went down and caused Solomon to ride upon King David ’ s mule , and brought him to Gihon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	39	And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed Solomon . And they blew the trumpet , and all the people said , “ God save King Solomon ! ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	40	And all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	41	And Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating . And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet , he said , “ For what reason is this noise , and the city in an uproar ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	42	And while he yet spoke , behold , Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came ; and Adonijah said unto him , “ Come in , for thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	43	And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah , “ Verily our lord King David hath made Solomon king .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	44	And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites ; and they have caused him to ride upon the king ’ s mule .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	45	And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon ; and they have come up from thence rejoicing , so that the city rang again . This is the noise that ye have heard .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	46	And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	47	And moreover the king ’ s servants came to bless our lord King David , saying , ‘ God make the name of Solomon better than thy name , and make his throne greater than thy throne. ’ And the king bowed himself upon the bed .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	48	And also thus said the king , ‘ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who hath given one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes even seeing it. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	49	And all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid , and rose up and went every man his way .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	50	And Adonijah feared because of Solomon , and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	51	And it was told Solomon , saying , “ Behold , Adonijah feareth King Solomon ; for lo , he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar , saying , ‘ Let King Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	52	And Solomon said , “ If he will show himself a worthy man , there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth ; but if wickedness shall be found in him , he shall die. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	1	53	So King Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . And he came and bowed himself to King Solomon ; and Solomon said unto him , “ Go to thine house . ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	2	“ I go the way of all the earth . Be thou strong therefore , and show thyself a man ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	3	and keep the charge of the Lord thy God to walk in His ways , to keep His statutes , and His commandments , and His judgments , and His testimonies , as it is written in the Law of Moses , that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	4	that the Lord may continue His word which He spoke concerning me , saying , ‘ If thy children take heed to their way , to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul , there shall not fail thee , ’ said He , ‘ a man on the throne of Israel. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	5	“ Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me , and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel , unto Abner the son of Ner and unto Amasa the son of Jether , whom he slew , and shed the blood of war in peace , and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feet .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	6	Do therefore according to thy wisdom , and let not his hoary head go down to the grave in peace .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	7	But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be among those who eat at thy table ; for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	8	And behold , thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera , a Benjamite of Bahurim , who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim ; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan , and I swore to him by the Lord , saying , ‘ I will not put thee to death with the sword. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	9	Now therefore hold him not guiltless , for thou art a wise man and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him ; but his hoary head bring thou down to the grave with blood. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	10	So David slept with his fathers , and was buried in the City of David .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	11	And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years : seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	12	Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father , and his kingdom was established greatly .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	13	And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon . And she said , “ Comest thou peaceably ? ” And he said , “ Peaceably. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	14	He said moreover , “ I have something to say unto thee. ” And she said , “ Say on. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	15	And he said , “ Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine , and that all Israel set their faces on me , that I should reign . However the kingdom is turned about and has become my brother ’ s , for it was his from the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	16	And now I ask one petition of thee ; deny me not. ” And she said unto him , “ Say on. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	17	And he said , “ Speak , I pray thee , unto Solomon the king ( for he will not say ‘ nay ’ to thee ) , that he give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	18	And Bathsheba said , “ Well ; I will speak for thee unto the king. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	19	Bathsheba therefore went unto King Solomon to speak unto him for Adonijah . And the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her , and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the king ’ s mother ; and she sat on his right hand .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	20	Then she said , “ I desire one small petition of thee ; I pray thee , say not ‘ nay ’ to me. ” And the king said unto her , “ Ask on , my mother , for I will not say to thee ‘ nay. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	21	And she said , “ Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	22	And King Solomon answered and said unto his mother , “ And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah ? Ask for him the kingdom also , for he is mine elder brother — even for him , and for Abiathar the priest , and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	23	Then King Solomon swore by the Lord , saying , “ God do so to me , and more also , if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	24	Now therefore , as the Lord liveth , who hath established me and set me on the throne of David my father , and who hath made me a house , as He promised , Adonijah shall be put to death this day. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	25	And King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he fell upon him so that he died .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	26	And unto Abiathar the priest said the king , “ Get thee to Anathoth , unto thine own fields , for thou art worthy of death ; but I will not at this time put thee to death , because thou didst bear the ark of the Lord God before David my father , and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	27	So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the Lord , that he might fulfill the word of the Lord which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	28	Then tidings came to Joab ; for Joab had turned after Adonijah , though he turned not after Absalom . And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	29	And it was told King Solomon that Joab had fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord ; and behold , he is by the altar . Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , “ Go , fall upon him. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	30	And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the Lord , and said unto him , “ Thus saith the king , ‘ Come forth ! ’ ” And he said , “ Nay , but I will die here. ” And Benaiah brought the king word again , saying , “ Thus said Joab , and thus he answered me. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	31	And the king said unto him , “ Do as he hath said , and fall upon him and bury him , that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which Joab shed from me and from the house of my father .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	32	And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head , who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword — to wit , Abner the son of Ner , captain of the host of Israel , and Amasa the son of Jether , captain of the host of Judah — my father David not knowing thereof .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	33	Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his seed for ever ; but upon David , and upon his seed , and upon his house , and upon his throne , shall there be peace for ever from the Lord. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	34	So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up , and fell upon him and slew him ; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	35	And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the host , and Zadok the priest did the king put in the place of Abiathar .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	36	And the king sent and called for Shimei , and said unto him , “ Build thee a house in Jerusalem and dwell there , and go not forth from thence anywhere .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	37	For it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over the Brook Kidron , thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die ; thy blood shall be upon thine own head. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	38	And Shimei said unto the king , “ The saying is good . As my lord the king hath said , so will thy servant do. ” And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	39	And it came to pass , at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah , king of Gath . And they told Shimei , saying , “ Behold , thy servants are in Gath. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	40	And Shimei arose and saddled his ass , and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants ; and Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	41	And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath , and had come back .
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	42	And the king sent and called for Shimei , and said unto him , “ Did I not make thee to swear by the Lord , and protested unto thee , saying , ‘ Know for certain , on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad anywhere , that thou shalt surely die ’ ? And thou said unto me , ‘ The word that I have heard is good. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	43	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord and the commandment that I have charged thee with ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	44	The king said moreover to Shimei , “ Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to , that thou did to David my father . Therefore the Lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	45	and King Solomon shall be blessed , and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	2	46	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , who went out and fell upon him so that he died . And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	3	And Solomon loved the Lord , walking in the statutes of David his father ; only , he sacrificed and burned incense in high places .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	2	Only , the people sacrificed in high places , because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord until those days .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	4	And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there , for that was the great high place . A thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	5	In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night ; and God said , “ Ask what I shall give thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	6	And Solomon said , “ Thou hast shown unto Thy servant David my father great mercy , according as he walked before Thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with Thee ; and Thou hast kept for him this great kindness , that Thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne , as it is this day .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	7	And now , O Lord my God , Thou hast made Thy servant king instead of David my father . And I am but a little child ; I know not how to go out or come in .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	8	And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people whom Thou hast chosen , a great people , that can not be numbered nor counted for multitude .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	9	Give therefore Thy servant an understanding heart to judge Thy people , that I may discern between good and bad ; for who is able to judge this Thy so great a people ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	10	And the speech pleased the Lord , that Solomon had asked this thing .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	11	And God said unto him , “ Because thou hast asked this thing , and hast not asked for thyself long life , neither hast asked riches for thyself , nor hast asked the life of thine enemies , but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	12	behold , I have done according to thy words . Lo , I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart , so that there was none like thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	13	And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches and honor , so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	14	And if thou wilt walk in My ways to keep My statutes and My commandments , as thy father David did walk , then I will lengthen thy days. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	15	And Solomon awoke ; and behold , it was a dream . And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings , and made a feast for all his servants .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	17	And the one woman said , “ O my lord , I and this woman dwell in one house ; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	18	And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered that this woman was delivered also . And we were together ; there was no stranger with us in the house , save we two in the house .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	19	And this woman ’ s child died in the night , because she lay upon it .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	20	And she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	21	And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck , behold , it was dead . But when I had considered it in the morning , behold , it was not my son whom I had borne. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	22	And the other woman said , “ Nay ; but the living is my son , and the dead is thy son ! ” And this said , “ No ; but the dead is thy son , and the living is my son ! ” Thus they spoke before the king .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	23	Then said the king , “ The one saith , ‘ This is my son who liveth , and thy son is the dead ’ ; and the other saith , ‘ Nay ; but thy son is the dead , and my son is the living. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	24	And the king said , “ Bring me a sword. ” And they brought a sword before the king .
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	25	And the king said , “ Divide the living child in two , and give half to the one and half to the other. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	26	Then spoke the woman whose the living child was unto the king , for her heart yearned for her son and she said , “ O my lord , give her the living child , and in no wise slay it ! ” But the other said , “ Let it be neither mine nor thine , but divide it. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	27	Then the king answered and said , “ Give her the living child , and in no wise slay it . She is the mother thereof. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	3	28	And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged ; and they feared the king , for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	4	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host ; and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	2	And these were the princes whom he had : Azariah the son of Zadok , the priest ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	3	Elihoreph and Ahijah , the sons of Shisha , scribes ; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud , the recorder ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	5	and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers ; and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer and the king ’ s friend ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	6	and Ahishar was over the household ; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	7	And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel , who provided victuals for the king and his household ; each man his month in a year made provision .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	8	And these are their names : the son of Hur , in Mount Ephraim ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	9	the son of Deker , in Makaz and in Shaalbim and Bethshemesh and Elonbethhanan ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	10	the son of Hesed , in Arubboth ; to him pertained Sochoh and all the land of Hepher ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	11	the son of Abinadab , in all the region of Dor , who had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as a wife ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	12	Baana the son of Ahilud ; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo , and all Bethshean , which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel , from Bethshean to Abelmeholah , even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	13	the son of Geber , in Ramothgilead ; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh , which are in Gilead ; to him also pertained the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	15	Ahimaaz was in Naphtali ; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon for a wife ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	16	Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah , in Issachar ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	18	Shimei the son of Elah , in Benjamin ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	19	Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead , in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan , and he was the only officer who was in the land .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	20	Judah and Israel were many , as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking and making merry .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	21	And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines and unto the border of Egypt . They brought presents , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	22	And Solomon ’ s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour , and threescore measures of meal ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	23	ten fat oxen , and twenty oxen out of the pastures , and a hundred sheep , besides harts , and roebucks , and fallow deer , and fatted fowl .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	24	For he had dominion over all the region on this side of the river , from Tiphsah even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side of the river ; and he had peace on all sides round about him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	25	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely , every man under his vine and under his fig tree , from Dan even to Beersheba , all the days of Solomon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	26	And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	27	And those officers provided victuals for King Solomon and for all who came unto King Solomon ’ s table , every man in his month . They lacked nothing .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	28	Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were , every man according to his charge .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	29	And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much , and largeness of heart , even as the sand that is on the seashore .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	30	And Solomon ’ s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East country and all the wisdom of Egypt .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	31	For he was wiser than all men — than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman and Chalcol and Darda , the sons of Mahol ; and his fame was in all nations round about .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	32	And he spoke three thousand proverbs , and his songs were a thousand and five .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	33	And he spoke of trees , from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall . He spoke also of beasts , and of fowl , and of creeping things , and of fishes .
KJ21	1%20Kings	4	34	And there came from all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the earth , who had heard of his wisdom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	5	And behold , I purpose to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God , as the Lord spoke unto David my father , saying , ‘ Thy son , whom I will set upon thy throne in thy stead , he shall build a house unto My name. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	2	And Solomon sent to Hiram , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	3	“ Thou knowest how David my father could not build a house unto the name of the Lord his God because of the wars which were about him on every side , until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	4	But now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side , so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	6	Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon , and my servants shall be with thy servants ; and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint , for thou knowest that there is not among us any that has skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	7	And it came to pass , when Hiram heard the words of Solomon , that he rejoiced greatly and said , “ Blessed be the Lord this day , who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	8	And Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , “ I have considered the things for which thou sentest to me , and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	9	My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea ; and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me , and will cause them to be discharged there , and thou shalt receive them . And thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	10	So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	11	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of pure oil ; thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	12	And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom , as He promised him ; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon , and they two made a league together .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	13	And King Solomon raised a tribute of men out of all Israel ; and the levy was thirty thousand men .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	14	And he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses : a month they were in Lebanon and two months at home ; and Adoniram was over the levy .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	15	And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand who bore burdens and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	16	besides the chief of Solomon ’ s officers who were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , who ruled over the people who wrought in the work .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	17	And the king commanded , and they brought great stones , costly stones and hewn stones , to lay the foundation of the house .
KJ21	1%20Kings	5	18	And Solomon ’ s builders and Hiram ’ s builders and the stone squarers hewed them . So they prepared timber and stones to build the house .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	6	The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad ; for outside in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about , that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	2	And the house which King Solomon built for the Lord , the length thereof was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits , and the height thereof thirty cubits .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	3	And the porch in front of the temple of the house , twenty cubits was the length thereof , according to the breadth of the house , and ten cubits was the breadth thereof in front of the house .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	4	And for the house he made windows broad within and narrow without .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	5	And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temple and of the oracle ; and he made chambers round about .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	7	And the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither , so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	8	The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house ; and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	9	So he built the house and finished it , and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	10	And then he built chambers against all the house , five cubits high ; and they rested on the house with timber of cedar .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	11	And the word of the Lord came to Solomon , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	12	“ Concerning this house which thou art building , if thou wilt walk in My statutes and execute My judgments and keep all My commandments to walk in them , then will I perform My word with thee , which I spoke unto David thy father .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	13	And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake My people Israel. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	14	So Solomon built the house and finished it .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	15	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar , both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling ; and he covered them on the inside with wood , and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	16	And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house , both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar ; he even built them for it within , even for the oracle , even for the Most Holy Place .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	17	And the house , that is , the temple before it , was forty cubits long .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	18	And the cedar of the house within was carved with buds and open flowers . All was cedar ; there was no stone seen .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	19	And the oracle he prepared in the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	20	And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof ; and he overlaid it with pure gold , and so covered the altar which was of cedar .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	21	So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold ; and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle , and he overlaid it with gold .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	22	And the whole house he overlaid with gold , until he had finished all the house ; also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	23	And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree , each ten cubits high .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	24	And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the outermost part of the one wing unto the outermost part of the other was ten cubits .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	25	And the other cherub was ten cubits ; both the cherubims were of one measure and one size .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	26	The height of the one cherub was ten cubits , and so was it of the other cherub .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	27	And he set the cherubims within the inner house ; and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall ; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	28	And he overlaid the cherubims with gold .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	29	And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , within and without .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	30	And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold , within and without .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	31	And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive tree ; the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	32	The two doors also were of olive tree ; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , and overlaid them with gold , and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm trees .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	33	So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree , a fourth part of the wall .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	34	And the two doors were of fir tree ; the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	35	And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	36	And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	37	In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid , in the month of Ziv .
KJ21	1%20Kings	6	38	And in the eleventh year , in the month of Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it . So was he seven years in building it .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	7	Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge , even the Porch of Judgment ; and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	2	He built also the House of the Forest of Lebanon ; the length thereof was a hundred cubits , and the breadth thereof fifty cubits , and the height thereof thirty cubits , upon four rows of cedar pillars , with cedar beams upon the pillars .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	3	And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on fortyfive pillars , fifteen in a row .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	4	And there were windows in three rows , and light was against light in three ranks .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	5	And all the doors and posts were square , with the windows ; and light was against light in three ranks .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	6	And he made a Porch of Pillars : the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits ; and the porch was in front of them , and the other pillars and the thick beam were in front of them .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	8	And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch , which was of the like work . Solomon made also a house for Pharaoh ’ s daughter , whom he had taken for a wife , like unto this porch .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	9	All these were of costly stones , according to the measures of hewn stones , sawed with saws , within and without , even from the foundation unto the coping , and so on the outside toward the great court .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	10	And the foundation was of costly stones , even great stones , stones of ten cubits , and stones of eight cubits .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	11	And above were costly stones , according to the measures of hewn stones and cedars .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	12	And the great court round about was with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams , both for the inner court of the house of the Lord and for the porch of the house .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	13	And King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	14	He was a widow ’ s son of the tribe of Naphtali , and his father was a man of Tyre , a worker in brass ; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill to work all works in brass . And he came to King Solomon and wrought all his work .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	15	For he cast two pillars of brass , of eighteen cubits high apiece ; and a line of twelve cubits compassed each of them about .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	16	And he made two capitals of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars ; the height of the one capital was five cubits , and the height of the other capital was five cubits ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	17	and nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars , seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	18	And he made the pillars , and two rows with pomegranates round about upon the one network to cover the capitals that were upon the top ; and so did he for the other capital .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	19	And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch , four cubits .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	20	And the capitals upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above , over against the belly which was by the network ; and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other capital .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	21	And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof Jachin [ that is , He shall establish ] , and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof Boaz [ that is , In it is strength ] .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	22	And upon the top of the pillars was lily work ; so was the work of the pillars finished .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	23	And he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other ; it was round all about , and his height was five cubits , and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	24	And under the brim of it round about there were buds compassing it , ten to a cubit , compassing the sea round about ; the buds were cast in two rows when it was cast .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	25	It stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hind parts were inward .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	26	And it was a handbreadth thick , and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies . It contained two thousand baths .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	27	And he made ten bases of brass ; four cubits was the length of one base , and four cubits the breadth thereof , and three cubits the height of it .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	28	And the work of the bases was in this manner : they had borders , and the borders were between the ledges ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	29	and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubims . And upon the ledges there was a base above ; and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	30	And every base had four brazen wheels and plates of brass , and the four corners thereof had supports . Under the laver were molten supports at the side of every addition .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	31	And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit ; but the mouth thereof was round according to the work of the base , a cubit and a half ; and also upon the mouth of it were engravings with their borders , foursquare , not round .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	32	And under the borders were four wheels , and the axles of the wheels were joined to the base ; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	33	And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel ; their axles and their hubs and their rims and their spokes were all molten .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	34	And there were four supports to the four corners of one base , and the supports were part of the very base itself .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	35	And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high ; and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	36	For on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders thereof he engraved cherubims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	37	After this manner he made the ten bases ; all of them had one casting , one measure , and one size .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	38	Then made he ten lavers of brass ; each laver contained forty baths , and every laver was four cubits , and upon every one of the ten bases was one laver .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	39	And he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house , and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	40	And Hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the bowls . So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made King Solomon for the house of the Lord :
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	41	the two pillars , and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two pillars , and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	42	and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	43	and the ten bases , and ten lavers on the bases ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	44	and one sea , and twelve oxen under the sea ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	45	and the pots and the shovels and the basins . And all these vessels which Hiram made for King Solomon for the house of the Lord were of bright brass .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	46	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	47	And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed , because they were exceeding many ; neither was the weight of the brass found out .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	48	And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the Lord : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , upon which the showbread was ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	49	and the candlesticks of pure gold , five on the right side and five on the left before the oracle , with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	50	and the bowls , and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the censers of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the inner house , the Most Holy Place , and for the doors of the house , to wit , of the temple .
KJ21	1%20Kings	7	51	So was ended all the work that King Solomon made for the house of the Lord . And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated ; even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	8	And they stretched out the staves so that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle , and they were not seen from outside ; and there they are unto this day .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	2	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto King Solomon at the feast in the month of Ethanim , which is the eventh month .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	3	And all the elders of Israel came , and the priests took up the ark .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	4	And they brought up the ark of the Lord , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle ; even those did the priests and the Levites bring up .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	5	And King Solomon , and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him , were with him before the ark , sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	6	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place , into the oracle of the house , to the Most Holy Place , even under the wings of the cherubims .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	7	For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark , and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	9	There was nothing in the ark save the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb , when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	10	And it came to pass , when the priests had come out of the holy place , that the cloud filled the house of the Lord ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	11	so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud ; for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	12	Then spoke Solomon : “ The Lord said that He would dwell in the thick darkness .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	13	I have surely built Thee a house to dwell in , a settled place for Thee to abide in for ever. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	14	And the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of Israel , and all the congregation of Israel were standing .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	15	And he said , “ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who spoke with His mouth unto David my father , and hath with His hand fulfilled it , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	16	‘ Since the day that I brought forth My people Israel out of Egypt , I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house , that My name might be therein ; but I chose David to be over My people Israel. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	17	And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	18	And the Lord said unto David my father , ‘ Whereas it was in thine heart to build a house unto My name , thou didst well that it was in thine heart .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	19	Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins , he shall build the house unto My name. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	20	And the Lord hath performed His word that He spoke ; and I have risen up in the place of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	21	And I have set there a place for the ark , wherein is the covenant of the Lord which He made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	22	And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	23	and he said , “ Lord God of Israel , there is no God like Thee in heaven above or on earth beneath , who keepest covenant and mercy with Thy servants who walk before Thee with all their heart ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	24	who hast kept with Thy servant David my father what Thou promised him . Thou speakest also with Thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with Thine hand , as it is this day .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	25	Therefore now , Lord God of Israel , keep with Thy servant David my father what Thou promised him , saying , ‘ There shall not fail thee a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel , only if thy children take heed to their way , that they walk before Me as thou hast walked before Me. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	26	And now , O God of Israel , let Thy word , I pray Thee , be verified , which Thou speakest unto Thy servant David my father .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	27	“ But will God indeed dwell on the earth ? Behold , the heaven and heaven of heavens can not contain Thee ; how much less this house that I have built ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	28	Yet have Thou respect unto the prayer of Thy servant and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which Thy servant prayeth before Thee today ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	29	that Thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which Thou hast said , ‘ My name shall be there , ’ that Thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant shall make toward this place .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	30	And hearken Thou to the supplication of Thy servant and of Thy people Israel when they shall pray toward this place , and hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place ; and when Thou hearest , forgive .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	31	“ If any man trespass against his neighbor , and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear , and the oath come before Thine altar in this house ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	32	then hear Thou in heaven , and do and judge Thy servants , condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head , and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	33	“ When Thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against Thee , and shall turn again to Thee and confess Thy name , and pray and make supplication unto Thee in this house ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	34	then hear Thou in heaven and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel , and bring them again unto the land which Thou gavest unto their fathers .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	35	“ When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against Thee , if they pray toward this place and confess Thy name , and turn from their sin when Thou afflictest them ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	36	then hear Thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of Thy servants and of Thy people Israel , that Thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon Thy land which Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	37	“ If there be in the land famine , if there be pestilence , blight , mildew , locust , or if there be caterpillar , if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities , whatsoever plague , whatsoever sickness there be ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	38	what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all Thy people Israel , who shall know every man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house—
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	39	then hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart Thou knowest ( for Thou , even Thou only , knowest the hearts of all the children of men ) ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	40	that they may fear Thee all the days that they live in the land which Thou gavest unto our fathers .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	41	“ Moreover concerning a stranger who is not of Thy people Israel , but cometh out of a far country for Thy name ’ s sake
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	42	( for they shall hear of Thy great name and of Thy strong hand and of Thy stretched out arm ) , when he shall come and pray toward this house ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	43	hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for , that all people of the earth may know Thy name to fear Thee , as do Thy people Israel , and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Thy name .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	44	“ If Thy people go out to battle against their enemy , whithersoever Thou shalt send them , and shall pray unto the Lord toward the city which Thou hast chosen and toward the house that I have built for Thy name ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	45	then hear Thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their cause .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	46	“ If they sin against Thee ( for there is no man that sinneth not ) , and Thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy , far or near ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	47	yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives , and repent and make supplication unto Thee in the land of those who carried them captives , saying , ‘ We have sinned and have done perversely , we have committed wickedness ’ ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	48	and so return unto Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who led them away captive , and pray unto Thee toward their land which Thou gavest unto their fathers , the city which Thou hast chosen and the house which I have built for Thy name—
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	49	then hear Thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven Thy dwelling place , and maintain their cause ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	50	and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against Thee , and give them compassion before those who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	51	( for they are Thy people and Thine inheritance , whom Thou broughtest forth out of Egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron ) ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	52	that Thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of Thy servant and unto the supplication of Thy people Israel , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto Thee .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	53	For Thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth to be Thine inheritance , as Thou spoke by the hand of Moses Thy servant when Thou brought our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord God. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	54	And it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord , he arose from before the altar of the Lord , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	55	And he stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	56	“ Blessed be the Lord , who hath given rest unto His people Israel , according to all that He promised . There hath not failed one word of all His good promise , which He promised by the hand of Moses His servant .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	57	The Lord our God be with us , as He was with our fathers . Let Him not leave us nor forsake us ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	58	that He may incline our hearts unto Him to walk in all His ways , and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments which He commanded our fathers .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	59	And let these my words , wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord , be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night , that He maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel at all times , as the matter shall require ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	60	that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God , and that there is none else .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	61	Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God , to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments , as at this day. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	62	And the king , and all Israel with him , offered sacrifice before the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	63	And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered unto the Lord : two and twenty thousand oxen , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep . So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	64	The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord ; for there he offered burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings , because the brazen altar that was before the Lord was too little to receive the burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	65	And at that time Solomon held a feast , and all Israel with him , a great congregation , from the entrance of Hamath unto the River of Egypt , before the Lord our God seven days and seven days , even fourteen days .
KJ21	1%20Kings	8	66	On the eighth day he sent the people away ; and they blessed the king , and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord had done for David His servant and for Israel His people .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	9	And they shall answer , ‘ Because they forsook the Lord their God who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt , and have taken hold upon other gods , and have worshiped them and served them ; therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	2	that the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time , as He had appeared unto him at Gibeon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	3	And the Lord said unto him , “ I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before Me . I have hallowed this house which thou hast built , to put My name there forever ; and Mine eyes and Mine heart shall be there perpetually .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	4	And if thou wilt walk before Me as David thy father walked , in integrity of heart and in uprightness , to do according to all that I have commanded thee , and wilt keep My statutes and My judgments ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	5	then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David thy father , saying , ‘ There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	6	But if ye shall at all turn from following Me , ye or your children , and will not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you , but go and serve other gods and worship them ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	7	then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them , and this house which I have hallowed for My name will I cast out of My sight ; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	8	And at this house , which is high , every one who passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss ; and they shall say , ‘ Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land and to this house ? ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	10	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord and the king ’ s house
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	11	( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	12	And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him , and they pleased him not .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	13	And he said , “ What cities are these which thou hast given me , my brother ? ” And he called them the land of Cabul [ that is , Displeasing ] unto this day .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	14	And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	15	And this is the reason for the levy which King Solomon raised : to build the house of the Lord , and his own house , and Millo , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Hazor , and Megiddo , and Gezer .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	16	( For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer , and burned it with fire and slain the Canaanites who dwelt in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon ’ s wife . )
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	17	And Solomon built Gezer , and Bethhoron the Nether ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	18	and Baalath , and Tadmor in the wilderness , in the land ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	19	and all the cities of storage that Solomon had , and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen , and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	20	And all the people who were left of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel—
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	21	their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy — upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bond service unto this day .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	22	But of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondmen ; but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots , and his horsemen .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	23	These were the chief of the officers who were over Solomon ’ s work : five hundred and fifty , who bore rule over the people who wrought in the work .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	24	But Pharaoh ’ s daughter came up out of the City of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her ; then did he build Millo .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	25	And three times in a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord , and he burned incense upon the altar that was before the Lord . So he finished the house .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	26	And King Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber , which is beside Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	27	And Hiram sent in the navy his servants , shipmen who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	9	28	And they came to Ophir and fetched from thence gold , four hundred and twenty talents , and brought it to King Solomon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	10	And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices a very great store , and precious stones ; there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	2	And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train , with camels that bore spices and very much gold and precious stones ; and when she had come to Solomon , she communed with him about all that was in her heart .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	3	And Solomon told her all her questions ; there was not any thing hidden from the king which he told her not .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon ’ s wisdom , and the house that he had built ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	5	and the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their apparel , and his cupbearers , and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord , there was no more spirit in her .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	6	And she said to the king , “ It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	7	However I believed not the words until I came and mine eyes had seen it ; and behold , the half was not told me . Thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	8	Happy are thy men , happy are these thy servants , who stand continually before thee and who hear thy wisdom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	9	Blessed be the Lord thy God , who delighted in thee , to set thee on the throne of Israel ! Because the Lord loved Israel for ever , therefore made He thee king to do judgment and justice. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	11	And the navy also of Hiram , that brought gold from Ophir , brought in from Ophir a great plenty of almug trees and precious stones .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	12	And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the Lord and for the king ’ s house , harps also and psalteries for singers . There came no more such almug trees , nor were seen unto this day .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	13	And King Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty . So she turned and went to her own country , she and her servants .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	15	besides what he had from the merchants , and from the traffic of the spice merchants , and from all the kings of Arabia , and from the governors of the country .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	16	And King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold ; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	17	And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold ; three pounds of gold went to one shield . And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	18	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory , and overlaid it with the best gold .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	19	The throne had six steps , and the top of the throne was round behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the stays .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	20	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps . There was not the like made in any kingdom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	21	And all King Solomon ’ s drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold . None were of silver ; it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	22	For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram . Once in three years came the navy of Tarshish bringing gold and silver , ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	23	So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	24	And all the earth sought Solomon to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	25	And they brought every man his present : vessels of silver and vessels of gold , and garments , and armor , and spices , horses , and mules , at a set rate year by year .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	26	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen ; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen , whom he placed in the cities for chariots and with the king at Jerusalem .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	27	And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the vale , for abundance .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	28	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yarn ; the king ’ s merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
KJ21	1%20Kings	10	29	And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and a horse for a hundred and fifty ; and so for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria they brought them out by their means .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	11	Therefore the Lord said unto Solomon , “ Forasmuch as this is done by thee , and thou hast not kept My covenant and My statutes which I have commanded thee , I will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	2	from the nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel , “ Ye shall not go in to them , neither shall they come in unto you ; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods. ” Solomon cleaved unto these in love .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	3	And he had seven hundred wives , princesses , and three hundred concubines ; and his wives turned away his heart .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	4	For it came to pass , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods ; and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as was the heart of David his father .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians , and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	6	And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord , and went not fully after the Lord , as did David his father .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	7	Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab , on the hill that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	8	And likewise did he for all his foreign wives , who burned incense and sacrificed unto their gods .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	9	And the Lord was angry with Solomon , because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel , who had appeared unto him twice
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	10	and had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods ; but he kept not that which the Lord commanded .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	12	Notwithstanding , I will not do it in thy days for David thy father ’ s sake ; but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	13	However I will not rend away all the kingdom , but will give one tribe to thy son for David My servant ’ s sake and for Jerusalem ’ s sake which I have chosen. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	14	And the Lord stirred up an adversary against Solomon , Hadad the Edomite ; he was of the king ’ s seed in Edom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	15	For it came to pass , when David was in Edom , and Joab thecaptain of the host had gone up to bury the slain after he had smitten every male in Edom
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	16	( for six months Joab remained there with all Israel until he had cut off every male in Edom ) ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	17	that Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father ’ s servants with him , to go into Egypt , Hadad being yet a little child .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	18	And they arose out of Midian and came to Paran ; and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , who gave him a house and appointed him victuals and gave him land .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	19	And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him for a wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	20	And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh ’ s house ; and Genubath was in Pharaoh ’ s household among the sons of Pharaoh .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	21	And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the captain of the host was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , “ Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	22	Then Pharaoh said unto him , “ But what hast thou lacked with me , that , behold , thou seekest to go to thine own country ? ” And he answered , “ Nothing , however let me go in any wise. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	23	And God stirred him up another adversary , Rezon the son of Eliadah , who fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	24	And he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band , when David slew those of Zobah ; and they went to Damascus and dwelt therein , and reigned in Damascus .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	25	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon , besides the mischief that Hadad did ; and he abhorred Israel , and reigned over Syria .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	26	And Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephraimite of Zereda , Solomon ’ s servant , whose mother ’ s name was Zeruah , a widow woman , even he lifted up his hand against the king .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	27	And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Millo , and repaired the breaches of the City of David his father .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	28	And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor ; and Solomon , seeing that the young man was industrious , made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	29	And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; and he had clad himself with a new garment , and the two were alone in the field .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	30	And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him , and rent it in twelve pieces .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	31	And he said to Jeroboam , “ Take thee ten pieces ; for thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel : ‘ Behold , I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to thee
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	32	( but he shall have one tribe for My servant David ’ s sake , and for Jerusalem ’ s sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel ) ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	33	because they have forsaken Me and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians , Chemosh the god of the Moabites , and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon , and have not walked in My ways to do that which is right in Mine eyes , and to keep My statutes and My judgments , as did David his father .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	34	However that be , I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand ; but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David My servant ’ s sake , whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My statutes .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	35	But I will take the kingdom out of his son ’ s hand and will give it unto thee , even ten tribes .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	36	And unto his son will I give one tribe , that David My servant may have a light always before Me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen Me to put My name there .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	37	And I will take thee , and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth , and shalt be king over Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	38	And it shall be , if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee , and wilt walk in My ways and do what is right in My sight , to keep My statutes and My commandments as David My servant did , that I will be with thee and build thee a sure house , as I built for David , and will give Israel unto thee .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	39	And I will for this afflict the seed of David , but not for ever. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	40	Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam . And Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt , unto Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	41	And the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	42	And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years .
KJ21	1%20Kings	11	43	And Solomon slept with his fathers , and was buried in the City of David his father ; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king had appointed , saying , “ Come to me again the third day. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	2	And it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it ( for he had fled from the presence of King Solomon , and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt ) ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	3	that they sent and called him . And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke unto Rehoboam , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	4	“ Thy father made our yoke grievous . Now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter , and we will serve thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	5	And he said unto them , “ Depart yet for three days , then come again to me. ” And the people departed .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	6	And King Rehoboam consulted with the old men who stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , and said , “ How do ye advise that I may answer this people ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	7	And they spoke unto him , saying , “ If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day , and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them , then they will be thy servants for ever. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	8	But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they hadgiven him , and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him , and who stood before him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	9	And he said unto them , “ What counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me , saying , ‘ Make the yoke which thy father put upon us lighter ’ ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	10	And the young men who had grown up with him spoke unto him , saying , “ Thus shalt thou speak unto this people who spoke unto thee , saying , ‘ Thy father made our yoke heavy , but make thou it lighter unto us ’ — thus shalt thou say unto them : ‘ My little finger shall be thicker than my father ’ s loins !
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	11	And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke . My father hath chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions ! ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	13	And the king answered the people roughly , and forsook the old men ’ s counsel that they gave him ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	14	and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men , saying , “ My father made your yoke heavy , and I will add to your yoke . My father also chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions ! ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	15	Therefore the king hearkened not unto the people ; for the cause was from the Lord , that He might perform His saying which the Lord spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	16	So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them , the people answered the king , saying , “ What portion have we in David ? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse . To your tents , O Israel ! Now see to thine own house , David ! ” So Israel departed unto their tents .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	17	But as for the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	18	Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the tribute ; and all Israel stoned him with stones so that he died . Therefore King Rehoboam made haste to get up to his chariot to flee to Jerusalem .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	20	And it came to pass , when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come again , that they sent and called him unto the congregation , and made him king over all Israel . There was none who followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	21	And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin , a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men who were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	22	But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	23	“ Speak unto Rehoboam , the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and to the remnant of the people , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	24	‘ Thus saith the Lord : Ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel . Return every man to his house , for this thing is from Me. ’ ” They hearkened therefore to the word of the Lord and returned to depart , according to the word of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in Mount Ephraim and dwelt therein , and went out from thence and built Penuel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	26	And Jeroboam said in his heart , “ Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	27	If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem , then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord , even unto Rehoboam king of Judah , and they shall kill me and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	28	Whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold , and said unto them , “ It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem . Behold thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt ! ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	29	And he set the one in Bethel , and the other put he in Dan .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	30	And this thing became a sin , for the people went to worship before the one , even unto Dan .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	31	And he made a house of high places , and made priests of the lowest of the people , who were not of the sons of Levi .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	32	And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month , on the fifteenth day of the month , like unto the feast that is in Judah , and he offered upon the altar . So did he in Bethel , sacrificing unto the calves that he had made ; and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made .
KJ21	1%20Kings	12	33	So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart , and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel ; and he offered upon the altar and burned incense .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	13	And he said unto his sons , “ Saddle me the ass. ” So they saddled him the ass ; and he rode thereon ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	2	And this man cried against the altar in the word of the Lord , and said , “ O altar , altar , thus saith the Lord : ‘ Behold , a child shall be born unto the house of David , Josiah by name ; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places who burn incense upon thee , and men ’ s bones shall be burned upon thee. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	3	And he gave a sign the same day , saying , “ This is the sign which the Lord hath spoken : Behold , the altar shall be rent , and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	4	And it came to pass , when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God who had cried against the altar in Bethel , that he put forth his hand from the altar , saying , “ Lay hold on him ! ” And his hand , which he put forth against him , dried up , so that he could not pull it in back to him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	5	The altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	6	And the king answered and said unto the man of God , “ Entreat now the face of the Lord thy God and pray for me , that my hand may be restored to me again. ” And the man of God besought the Lord , and the king ’ s hand was restored to him again , and became as it was before .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	7	And the king said unto the man of God , “ Come home with me and refresh thyself , and I will give thee a reward. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	8	And the man of God said unto the king , “ If thou wilt give me half thine house , I will not go in with thee , neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	9	For so was it charged me by the word of the Lord , saying , ‘ Eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that thou camest. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	10	So he went another way , and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	11	Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel , and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel ; the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	12	And their father said unto them , “ What way went he ? ” For his sons had seen which way the man of God went who came from Judah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	14	and went after the man of God , and found him sitting under an oak . And he said unto him , “ Art thou the man of God who camest from Judah ? ” And he said , “ I am. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	15	Then he said unto him , “ Come home with me and eat bread. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	16	And he said , “ I may not return with thee , nor go in with thee ; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	17	For it was said to me by the word of the Lord : ‘ Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn back to go by the way that thou camest. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	18	He said unto him , “ I am a prophet also as thou art ; and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the Lord , saying , ‘ Bring him back with thee into thine house , that he may eat bread and drink water. ’ ” But he lied unto him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	19	So he went back with him , and ate bread in his house , and drank water .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	20	And it came to pass , as they sat at the table , that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet who brought him back ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	21	and he cried unto the man of God who came from Judah , saying , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord , and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	22	but camest back , and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which the Lord said to thee , “ Eat no bread , and drink no water , ” thy carcass shall not come unto the sepulcher of thy fathers. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	23	And it came to pass , after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk , that he saddled for him the ass , to wit , for the prophet whom he had brought back .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	24	And when he was gone , a lion met him by the way and slew him ; and his carcass was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it ; the lion also stood by the carcass .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	25	And behold , men passed by and saw the carcass cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcass ; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	26	And when the prophet who brought him back from the way heard thereof , he said , “ It is the man of God who was disobedient unto the word of the Lord . Therefore the Lord hath delivered him unto the lion , which hath torn him and slain him , according to the word of the Lord which He spoke unto him. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	27	And he spoke to his sons , saying , “ Saddle me the ass. ” And they saddled him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	28	And he went and found his carcass cast in the way , and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass . The lion had not eaten the carcass nor torn the ass .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	29	And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass and brought it back ; and the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	30	And he laid his carcass in his own grave ; and they mourned over him , saying , “ Alas , my brother ! ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	31	And it came to pass , after he had buried him , that he spoke to his sons , saying , “ When I am dead , then bury me in the sepulcher wherein the man of God is buried ; lay my bones beside his bones .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	32	For the saying which he cried by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria , shall surely come to pass. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	33	After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way , but made again from the lowest of the people priests for the high places ; whosoever would , he consecrated him , and he became one of the priests of the high places .
KJ21	1%20Kings	13	34	And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam , even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	14	Moreover the Lord shall raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day . But what ? Even now !
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	2	And Jeroboam said to his wife , “ Arise , I pray thee , and disguise thyself , that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam , and get thee to Shiloh . Behold , Ahijah the prophet is there , who told me that I should be king over this people .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	3	And take with thee ten loaves and cakes and a cruse of honey , and go to him . He shall tell thee what shall become of the child. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	4	And Jeroboam ’ s wife did so , and arose and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . But Ahijah could not see , for his eyes were dim by reason of his age .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	5	And the Lord said unto Ahijah , “ Behold , the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son , for he is sick . Thus and thus shalt thou say unto her ; for it shall be , when she cometh in , that she shall feign herself to be another woman. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	6	And it was so , when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door , that he said , “ Come in , thou wife of Jeroboam . Why feignest thou thyself to be another ? For I am sent to thee with heavy tidings .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	7	Go , tell Jeroboam , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : “ Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over My people Israel ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	8	and rent the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to thee , and yet thou hast not been as My servant David , who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart to do that only which was right in Mine eyes ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	9	but hast done evil above all who were before thee , for thou hast gone and made thee other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger , and hast cast Me behind thy back—
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	10	therefore behold , I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam , and will cut off from Jeroboam him that urinates against the wall and him that is shut up and left in Israel , and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam , as a man taketh away dung till it be all gone .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	11	Him of Jeroboam that dieth in the city shall the dogs eat , and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat ; for the Lord hath spoken it. ” ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	12	Arise thou therefore , get thee to thine own house ; and when thy feet enter into the city , the child shall die .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	13	And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him ; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave , because in him there is found some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	15	For the Lord shall smite Israel , as a reed is shaken in the water ; and He shall root up Israel out of this good land which He gave to their fathers , and shall scatter them beyond the river , because they have made their Asherah poles , provoking the Lord to anger .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	16	And He shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , who sinned and who made Israel to sin. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	17	And Jeroboam ’ s wife arose and departed , and came to Tirzah ; and when she came to the threshold of the door , the child died .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	18	And they buried him ; and all Israel mourned for him , according to the word of the Lord , which He spoke by the hand of His servant Ahijah the prophet .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	19	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	20	And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years ; and he slept with his fathers , and Nadab his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	21	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah . Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there . And his mother ’ s name was Naamah , an Ammonitess .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	22	And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord , and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed , above all that their fathers had done .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	23	For they also built for themselves high places , and images and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	24	And there were also sodomites in the land , and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	25	And it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	26	And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king ’ s house ; he even took away all . And he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	27	And King Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields , and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard , who kept the door of the king ’ s house .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	28	And it was so , when the king went into the house of the Lord , that the guard bore them and brought them back into the guard chamber .
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	14	30	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	15	And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and the things which he himself had dedicated into the house of the Lord , silver and gold and vessels .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	2	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	3	And he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him ; and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	4	Nevertheless for David ’ s sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him and to establish Jerusalem ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	5	because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , and turned not aside from any thing that He commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	6	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	7	Now the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	8	And Abijam slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the City of David ; and Asa his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	9	And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	10	And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	11	And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , as did David his father .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	12	And he took away the sodomites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	13	And also Maachah his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove ; and Asa destroyed her idol and burned it by the Brook Kidron .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	14	But the high places were not removed . Nevertheless Asa ’ s heart was perfect with the Lord all his days .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	16	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	17	And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and the treasuries of the king ’ s house , and delivered them into the hand of his servants . And King Asa sent them to Benhadad , the son of Tabrimmon , the son of Hezion , king of Syria , who dwelt at Damascus , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	19	“ There is a league between me and thee , and between my father and thy father . Behold , I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold . Come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	20	So Benhadad hearkened unto King Asa , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel and smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abelbethmaachah , and all Chinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	21	And it came to pass , when Baasha heard thereof , that he left off building Ramah and dwelt in Tirzah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	22	Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah ; none was exempted . And they took away the stones of Ramah and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha had built ; and King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	23	The rest of all the acts of Asa , and all his might , and all that he did , and the cities which he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	24	And Asa slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father ; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	25	And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned over Israel two years .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	26	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	27	And Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines , for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	28	Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah , Baasha slew him and reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	29	And it came to pass , when he reigned , that he smote all the house of Jeroboam ; he left not to Jeroboam any who breathed , until he had destroyed him , according unto the saying of the Lord which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	30	because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he made Israel sin , by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	32	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah , twenty and four years .
KJ21	1%20Kings	15	34	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	16	And the people who were encamped heard it said : “ Zimri hath conspired and hath also slain the king. ” Therefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	2	“ Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over My people Israel , and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam and hast made My people Israel to sin , to provoke Me to anger with their sins ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	3	behold , I will take away the posterity of Baasha and the posterity of his house , and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	4	Him of Baasha that dieth in the city shall the dogs eat , and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	6	So Baasha slept with his fathers , and was buried in Tirzah ; and Elah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	7	And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the Lord against Baasha and against his house , even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord in provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands , in being like the house of Jeroboam , and because he killed him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	8	In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah , two years .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	9	And his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him as he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , steward of his house in Tirzah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	10	And Zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	11	And it came to pass , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he slew all the house of Baasha ; he left him not one that urinates against a wall , neither of his kinsfolk nor of his friends .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	12	Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha , according to the word of the Lord which He spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	13	for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son by which they sinned and by which they made Israel to sin , in provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	15	In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah . And the people were encamped against Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	17	And Omri went up from Gibbethon , and all Israel with him , and they besieged Tirzah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	18	And it came to pass , when Zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king ’ s house and burned the king ’ s house over himself with fire and died ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	19	because of his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the Lord , in walking in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make Israel to sin .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and his treason that he wrought , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	21	Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath to make him king , and half followed Omri .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	22	But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath ; so Tibni died , and Omri reigned .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	23	In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel , twelve years ; six years reigned he in Tirzah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	24	And he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver , and built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built after the name of Shemer , owner of the hill , Samaria .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	25	But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord , and did worse than all who were before him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	26	For he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin , to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might that he showed , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	28	So Omri slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria ; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	29	And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel ; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	30	And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all who were before him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	31	And it came to pass , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took for a wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians , and went and served Baal and worshiped him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	32	And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal , which he had built in Samaria .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	33	And Ahab made an Asherah pole ; and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	16	34	In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho : he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn , and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub , according to the word of the Lord which He spoke by Joshua the son of Nun .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	17	And it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	2	And the word of the Lord came unto him , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	3	“ Get thee hence and turn thee eastward , and hide thyself by the Brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	4	And it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook , and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	5	So he went and did according unto the word of the Lord ; for he went and dwelt by the Brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	6	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drank from the brook .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	7	And it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up , because there had been no rain in the land .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	8	And the word of the Lord came unto him , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	9	“ Arise , get thee to Zarephath , which belongeth to Sidon , and dwell there . Behold , I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	10	So he arose and went to Zarephath . And when he came to the gate of the city , behold , the widow woman was there gathering sticks ; and he called to her and said , “ Fetch me , I pray thee , a little water in a vessel , that I may drink. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	11	And as she was going to fetch it , he called to her and said , “ Bring me , I pray thee , a morsel of bread in thine hand. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	12	And she said , “ As the Lord thy God liveth , I have not a cake , but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse . And behold , I am gathering two sticks , that I may go in and dress it for me and my son , that we may eat it and die. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	13	And Elijah said unto her , “ Fear not ; go and do as thou hast said , but make me thereof a little cake first , and bring it unto me , and afterward make for thee and for thy son .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	14	For thus saith the Lord God of Israel : ‘ The barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oil fail , until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	15	And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah , and she and he and her house ate for many days .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	16	And the barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cruse of oil fail , according to the word of the Lord which He spoke by Elijah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	18	And she said unto Elijah , “ What have I to do with thee , O thou man of God ? Art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	19	And he said unto her , “ Give me thy son. ” And he took him out of her bosom , and carried him up into a loft where he abode , and laid him upon his own bed .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	20	And he cried unto the Lord and said , “ O Lord my God , hast Thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn by slaying her son ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	21	And he stretched himself upon the child three times , and cried unto the Lord and said , “ O Lord my God , I pray Thee , let this child ’ s soul come into him again ! ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	22	And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	23	And Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him unto his mother ; and Elijah said , “ See , thy son liveth. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	17	24	And the woman said to Elijah , “ Now by this I know that thou art a man of God , and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth . ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	18	And he answered , “ I have not troubled Israel , but thou and thy father ’ s house , in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord , and thou hast followed the Baalim .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	2	And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab . And there was a sore famine in Samaria .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	3	And Ahab called Obadiah , who was the governor of his house . ( Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	4	For it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord , that Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	5	And Ahab said unto Obadiah , “ Go into the land unto all fountains of water and unto all brooks . Perhaps we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive , that we lose not all the beasts. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	6	So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ; Ahab went one way by himself , and Obadiah went another way by himself .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	7	And as Obadiah was on the way , behold , Elijah met him ; and he knew him , and fell on his face and said , “ Art thou my lord Elijah ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	8	And he answered him , “ I am . Go , tell thy lord : ‘ Behold , Elijah is here. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	9	And he said , “ What have I sinned , that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab to slay me ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	10	As the Lord thy God liveth , there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee ; and when they said , ‘ He is not there , ’ he took an oath from the kingdom and nation that they found thee not .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	11	And now thou sayest , ‘ Go , tell thy lord : “ Behold , Elijah is here. ” ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	12	And it shall come to pass , as soon as I am gone from thee , that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not ; and so when I come and tell Ahab , and he can not find thee , he shall slay me . But I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	13	Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord , how I hid a hundred men of the Lord ’ S prophets by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	14	And now thou sayest , ‘ Go , tell thy lord : “ Behold , Elijah is here , ” ’ and he shall slay me ! ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	15	And Elijah said , “ As the Lord of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , I will surely show myself unto him today. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab , and told him ; and Ahab went to meet Elijah .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	17	And it came to pass , when Ahab saw Elijah , that Ahab said unto him , “ Art thou he that troubleth Israel ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	19	Now therefore , send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel , and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty , and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred , who eat at Jezebel ’ s table. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	20	So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel , and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	21	And Elijah came unto all the people and said , “ How long halt ye between two opinions ? If the Lord be God , follow Him ; but if Baal , then follow him. ” And the people answered him not a word .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	22	Then said Elijah unto the people , “ I , even I only , remain a prophet of the Lord , but Baal ’ s prophets are four hundred and fifty men .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	23	Let them therefore give us two bullocks . And let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces , and lay it on wood and put no fire under it ; and I will dress the other bullock , and lay it on wood , and put no fire under it .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	24	And call ye on the name of your gods , and I will call on the name of the Lord ; and the God that answereth by fire , let Him be God. ” And all the people answered and said , “ It is well spoken. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	25	And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal , “ Choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first , for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under it. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	26	And they took the bullock which was given them , and they dressed it , and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon , saying , “ O Baal , hear us ! ” But there was no voice , nor any that answered . And they leaped upon the altar which was made .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	27	And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said , “ Cry aloud , for he is a god ! Either he is talking , or he is pursuing , or he is on a journey , or perhaps he sleepeth and must be awakened. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	28	And they cried aloud , and cut themselves according to their manner with knives and lancets , till the blood gushed out upon them .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	29	And it came to pass , when midday was past , and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	30	And Elijah said unto all the people , “ Come near unto me. ” And all the people came near unto him . And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	31	And Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , unto whom the word of the Lord came , saying , “ Israel shall be thy name. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	32	And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord , and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	33	And he put the wood in order , and cut the bullock in pieces , and laid him on the wood and said , “ Fill four barrels with water , and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	34	And he said , “ Do it the second time. ” And they did it the second time . And he said , “ Do it the third time. ” And they did it the third time .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	35	And the water ran round about the altar ; and he filled the trench also with water .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	36	And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that Elijah the prophet came near and said , “ Lord God of Abraham , Isaac , and of Israel , let it be known this day that Thou art God in Israel , and that I am Thy servant , and that I have done all these things at Thy word .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	37	Hear me , O Lord ! Hear me , that this people may know that Thou art the Lord God , and that Thou hast turned their heart back again. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	38	Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood and the stones and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	39	And when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces and they said , “ The Lord , He is the God ! The Lord , He is the God ! ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	40	And Elijah said unto them , “ Take the prophets of Baal . Let not one of them escape ! ” And they took them ; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and slew them there .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	41	And Elijah said unto Ahab , “ Get thee up , eat and drink ; for there is a sound of abundance of rain. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink . And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	43	and said to his servant , “ Go up now , look toward the sea. ” And he went up and looked , and said , “ There is nothing. ” And he said , “ Go again , ” seven times .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	44	And it came to pass at the seventh time , that he said , “ Behold , there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea , like a man ’ s hand. ” And he said , “ Go up , say unto Ahab , ‘ Prepare thy chariot , and get thee down , that the rain stop thee not. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	45	And it came to pass in the meantime , that the heaven was black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . And Ahab rode , and went to Jezreel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	18	46	And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah ; and he girded up his loins , and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	19	So he departed from thence , and found Elisha the son of Shaphat , who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him , and he with the twelfth ; and Elijah passed by him , and cast his mantle upon him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah , saying , “ So let the gods do to me , and more also , if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	3	And when he saw that , he arose and went for his life and came to Beersheba , which belongeth to Judah , and left his servant there .
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	4	But he himself went a day ’ s journey into the wilderness , and came and sat down under a juniper tree ; and he requested for himself that he might die , and said , “ It is enough ! Now , O Lord , take away my life , for I am not better than my fathers. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	5	And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree , behold , then an angel touched him and said unto him , “ Arise and eat. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	6	And he looked , and behold , there was a cake baked on the coals and a cruse of water at his head . And he ate and drank , and lay down again .
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	7	And the angel of the Lord came again the second time , and touched him and said , “ Arise and eat , because the journey is too great for thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	8	And he arose , and ate and drank , and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God .
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	9	And he came thither unto a cave and lodged there ; and behold , the word of the Lord came to him , and He said unto him , “ What doest thou here , Elijah ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	10	And he said , “ I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts ; for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant , thrown down Thine altars , and slain Thy prophets with the sword . And I , even I only , am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	11	And He said , “ Go forth , and stand upon the mount before the Lord. ” And behold , the Lord passed by , and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord , but the Lord was not in the wind ; and after the wind an earthquake , but the Lord was not in the earthquake .
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	12	And after the earthquake a fire , but the Lord was not in the fire ; and after the fire a still small voice .
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	13	And it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave . And behold , there came a voice unto him and said , “ What doest thou here , Elijah ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	14	And he said , “ I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts , because the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant , thrown down Thine altars , and slain Thy prophets with the sword . And I , even I only , am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	15	And the Lord said unto him , “ Go , return on thy way to the Wilderness of Damascus . And when thou comest , anoint Hazael to be king over Syria ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	16	and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel ; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	17	And it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay ; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay .
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	18	Yet I have left Me seven thousand in Israel , all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal , and every mouth which hath not kissed him. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	20	And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah , and said , “ Let me , I pray thee , kiss my father and my mother , and then I will follow thee. ” And he said unto him , “ Go back again , for what have I done to thee ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	19	21	And he returned back from him , and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen , and gave unto the people , and they ate . Then he arose and went after Elijah , and ministered unto him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	20	And they slew every one his man ; and the Syrians fled , and Israel pursued them ; and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	2	And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city , and said unto him , “ Thus saith Benhadad :
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	3	‘ Thy silver and thy gold is mine ; thy wives also and thy children , even the goodliest , are mine. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	4	And the king of Israel answered and said , “ My lord , O king , according to thy saying , I am thine , and all that I have. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	5	And the messengers came again , and said , “ Thus speaketh Benhadad , saying , ‘ Although I have sent unto thee , saying , “ Thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children , ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	6	yet I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time , and they shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants . And it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes , they shall put it in their hand and take it away. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land , and said , “ Mark , I pray you , and see how this man seeketh mischief ; for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold , and I denied him not. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	8	And all the elders and all the people said unto him , “ Hearken not unto him , nor consent. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	9	Therefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad , “ Tell my lord the king : ‘ All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do , but this thing I may not do. ’ ” And the messengers departed and brought him word again .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	10	And Benhadad sent unto him and said , “ The gods do so unto me , and more also , if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	11	And the king of Israel answered and said , “ Tell him : ‘ Let not him that girdeth on his armor boast himself as he that putteth it off. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	12	And it came to pass , when Benhadad heard this message , as he was drinking , he and the kings in the pavilions , that he said unto his servants , “ Set yourselves in array. ” And they set themselves in array against the city .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	13	And behold , there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel , saying , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Hast thou seen all this great multitude ? Behold , I will deliver it into thine hand this day , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	14	And Ahab said , “ By whom ? ” And he said , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. ’ ” Then he said , “ Who shall order the battle ? ” And he answered , “ Thou. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	15	Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty two ; and after them he numbered all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	16	And they went out at noon . But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions , he and the kings , the thirty and two kings who helped him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	17	And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first ; and Benhadad sent out , and they told him , saying , “ There are men coming out of Samaria. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	18	And he said , “ Whether they have come out for peace , take them alive ; or whether they have come out for war , take them alive. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	19	So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city , and the army which followed them .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	21	And the king of Israel went out and smote the horses and chariots , and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	22	And the prophet came to the king of Israel , and said unto him , “ Go , strengthen thyself , and mark , and see what thou doest ; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	23	And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him , “ Their gods are gods of the hills ; therefore they were stronger than we . But let us fight against them in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	24	And do this thing : Take the kings away , every man out of his place , and put captains in their places .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	25	And number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost , horse for horse and chariot for chariot ; and we will fight against them in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they. ” And he hearkened unto their voice , and did so .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	26	And it came to pass at the return of the year , that Benhadad numbered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	27	And the children of Israel were numbered and were all present , and went against them ; and the children of Israel pitched camp before them like two little flocks of kids , but the Syrians filled the country .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	28	And there came a man of God , and spoke unto the king of Israel and said , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Because the Syrians have said , “ The Lord is God of the hills , but He is not God of the valleys , ” therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand , and ye shall know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	29	And they pitched camp one opposite the other seven days . And so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined , and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	30	But the rest fled to Aphek , into the city ; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men who were left . And Benhadad fled and came into the city , into an inner chamber .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	31	And his servants said unto him , “ Behold now , we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings . Let us , I pray thee , put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads , and go out to the king of Israel . Perhaps he will save thy life. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads , and came to the king of Israel and said , “ Thy servant Benhadad saith , ‘ I pray thee , let me live. ’ ” And he said , “ Is he yet alive ? He is my brother. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	33	Now the men diligently observed whether any thing would come from him , and hastily caught it ; and they said , “ Thy brother Benhadad. ” Then he said , “ Go ye , bring him. ” Then Benhadad came forth to him ; and he caused him to come up into the chariot .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	34	And Benhadad said unto him , “ The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore ; and thou shalt make streets for thyself in Damascus , as my father made in Samaria. ” Then said Ahab , “ I will send thee away with this covenant. ” So he made a covenant with him , and sent him away .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	35	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbor in the word of the Lord , “ Smite me , I pray thee. ” And the man refused to smite him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	36	Then said he unto him , “ Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the Lord , behold , as soon as thou art departed from me , a lion shall slay thee. ” And as soon as he had departed from him , a lion found him and slew him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	37	Then he found another man and said , “ Smite me , I pray thee. ” And the man smote him , so that in smiting he wounded him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	38	So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way , and disguised himself with ashes upon his face .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	39	And as the king passed by , he cried unto the king ; and he said , “ Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle . And behold , a man turned aside and brought a man unto me , and said , ‘ Keep this man . If by any means he be missing , then shall thy life be for his life , or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	40	And as thy servant was busy here and there , he was gone. ” And the king of Israel said unto him , “ So shall thy judgment be ; thyself hast decided it. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	41	And he hastened and took the ashes away from his face , and the king of Israel recognized him , that he was of the prophets .
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	42	And he said unto the king , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction , therefore thy life shall go for his life , and thy people for his people. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	20	43	And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased , and came to Samaria .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	21	‘ Behold , I will bring evil upon thee , and will take away thy posterity , and will cut off from Ahab him that urinates against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	2	And Ahab spoke unto Naboth , saying , “ Give me thy vineyard , that I may have it for a garden of herbs , because it is near unto my house . And I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it ; or , if it seem good to thee , I will give thee the worth of it in money. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	3	And Naboth said to Ahab , “ The Lord forbid me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	4	And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him ; for he had said , “ I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. ” And he lay down upon his bed , and turned away his face , and would eat no bread .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	5	But Jezebel his wife came to him , and said unto him , “ Why is thy spirit so sad , that thou eatest no bread ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	6	And he said unto her , “ Because I spoke unto Naboth the Jezreelite and said unto him , ‘ Give me thy vineyard for money ; or else , if it please thee , I will give thee another vineyard for it. ’ And he answered , ‘ I will not give thee my vineyard. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	7	And Jezebel his wife said unto him , “ Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel ? Arise , and eat bread , and let thine heart be merry . I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	8	So she wrote letters in Ahab ’ s name and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles who were in his city , dwelling with Naboth .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	9	And she wrote in the letters , saying , “ Proclaim a fast , and set Naboth on high among the people .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	10	And set two men , sons of Belial , before him to bear witness against him , saying , ‘ Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. ’ And then carry him out and stone him , that he may die. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	11	And the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as Jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	12	They proclaimed a fast , and set Naboth on high among the people .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	13	And there came in two men , children of Belial , and sat before him ; and the men of Belial witnessed against him , even against Naboth , in the presence of the people , saying , “ Naboth blasphemed God and the king. ” Then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones , so that he died .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	14	Then they sent to Jezebel , saying , “ Naboth has been stoned and is dead. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	15	And it came to pass , when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead , that Jezebel said to Ahab , “ Arise , take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , which he refused to give thee for money ; for Naboth is not alive , but dead. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	16	And it came to pass , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	17	And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	18	“ Arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who is in Samaria . Behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , whither he has gone down to possess it .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	19	And thou shalt speak unto him , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Hast thou killed and also taken possession ? ’ And thou shalt speak unto him , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord , “ In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood , even thine. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	20	And Ahab said to Elijah , “ Hast thou found me , O mine enemy ? ” And he answered , “ I have found thee , because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	22	And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked Me to anger and made Israel sin. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	23	And of Jezebel also spoke the Lord , saying , ‘ The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	24	Him of Ahab that dieth in the city the dogs shall eat , andhim that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	25	But there was none like unto Ahab , who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord , whom Jezebel his wife stirred up .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	26	And he did very abominably in following idols , according to all things as did the Amorites , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	27	And it came to pass , when Ahab heard those words , that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh , and fasted and lay in sackcloth , and went about dispiritedly .
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	28	And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Kings	21	29	“ Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before Me ? Because he humbleth himself before Me , I will not bring the evil in his days ; but in his son ’ s days will I bring the evil upon his house . ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	1	Kings
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	22	And the Lord said unto him , ‘ Wherewith ? ’ And he said , ‘ Iwill go forth , and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. ’ And He said , ‘ Thou shalt persuade him , and prevail also . Go forth , and do so. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	2	And it came to pass in the third year that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	3	And the king of Israel said unto his servants , “ Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours , and we are still , and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	4	And he said unto Jehoshaphat , “ Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead ? ” And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , “ I am as thou art , my people as thy people , my horses as thy horses. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	5	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel , “ Inquire , I pray thee , for the word of the Lord today. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together , about four hundred men , and said unto them , “ Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? ” And they said , “ Go up ; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	7	And Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides , that we might inquire of him ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	8	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , “ There is yet one man , Micaiah the son of Imlah , by whom we may inquire of the Lord ; but I hate him , for he doth not prophesy good concerning me , but evil. ” And Jehoshaphat said , “ Let not the king say so. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	9	Then the king of Israel called an officer and said , “ Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	10	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a vacant place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	11	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron ; and he said , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ With these shalt thou push the Syrians until thou have consumed them. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	12	And all the prophets prophesied so , saying , “ Go up to Ramothgilead and prosper , for the Lord shall deliver it into the king ’ s hand. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	13	And the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke unto him , saying , “ Behold now , the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth . Let thy word , I pray thee , be like the word of one of them , and speak that which is good. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	14	And Micaiah said , “ As the Lord liveth , what the Lord saith unto me , that will I speak. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	15	So he came to the king . And the king said unto him , “ Micaiah , shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle , or shall we forbear ? ” And he answered him , “ Go , and prosper , for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	16	And the king said unto him , “ How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	17	And he said , “ I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills , as sheep that have not a shepherd . And the Lord said , ‘ These have no master . Let them return every man to his house in peace. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	18	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , “ Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me , but evil ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	19	And Micaiah said , “ Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on His throne , and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	20	And the Lord said , ‘ Who shall persuade Ahab , that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead ? ’ And one said in this manner , and another said in that manner .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	21	And there came forth a spirit , and stood before the Lord and said , ‘ I will persuade him. ’
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	23	Now therefore , behold , the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets , and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	24	But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near , and smote Micaiah on the cheek and said , “ Which way went the spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee ? ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	25	And Micaiah said , “ Behold , thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	26	And the king of Israel said , “ Take Micaiah , and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king ’ s son ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	27	and say , ‘ Thus saith the king : Put this fellow in theprison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I come in peace. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	28	And Micaiah said , “ If thou return at all in peace , the Lord hath not spoken by me. ” And he said , “ Hearken , O people , every one of you ! ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	30	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , “ I willing disguise myself and enter into the battle , but put thou on thy robes. ” And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	31	But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains who had rule over his chariots , saying , “ Fight neither with small nor great , save only with the king of Israel. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	32	And it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , “ Surely it is the king of Israel. ” And they turned aside to fight against him ; and Jehoshaphat cried out .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	33	And it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	34	And a certain man drew a bow at random , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor . Therefore he said unto the driver of his chariot , “ Turn thine hand and carry me out of the host , for I am wounded. ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	35	And the battle increased that day . And the king was propped up in his chariot against the Syrians , and died at evening ; and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	36	And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun , saying , “ Every man to his city , and every man to his own country ! ”
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	37	So the king died , and was brought to Samaria ; and they buried the king in Samaria .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	38	And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria , and the dogs licked up his blood ; and they washed his armor , according unto the word of the Lord which He spoke .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did , and the ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	40	So Ahab slept with his fathers ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	41	And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	42	Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . And hismother ’ s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	43	And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father . He turned not aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord . Nevertheless the high places were not taken away , for the people offered and burned incense yet in the high places .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	44	And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he showed , and how he warred , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	46	And the remnant of the sodomites , who remained in the days of his father Asa , he took out of the land .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	47	There was then no king in Edom ; a deputy was king .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	48	Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold ; but they went not , for the ships were broken at Eziongeber .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	49	Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat , “ Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. ” But Jehoshaphat would not .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	50	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father ; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and reigned two years over Israel .
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	52	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin ;
KJ21	1%20Kings	22	53	for he served Baal and worshiped him , and provoked to anger the Lord God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	2	And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria , and was sick . And he sent messengers and aid unto them , “ Go , inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover from this disease. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	1	Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab .
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	3	But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite , “ Arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say unto them , ‘ Is it not because there is not a God in Israel that ye go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron ? ’
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	4	Now therefore thus saith the Lord : ‘ Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou hast gone up , but shalt surely die ! ’ ” And Elijah departed .
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	5	And when the messengers returned unto the king , he said unto them , “ Why have ye now turned back ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	6	And they said unto him , “ There came a man up to meet us , and said unto us , ‘ Go , return unto the king who sent you and say unto him , “ Thus saith the Lord : Is it not because there is not a God in Israel that thou sendest to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron ? Therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou hast gone up , but shalt surely die ! ” ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	7	And he said unto them , “ What manner of man was he that came up to meet you and told you these words ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	8	And they answered him , “ He was a hairy man , and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. ” And he said , “ It is Elijah he Tishbite. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	9	Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty . And he went up to him ; and behold , he sat on the top of a ill. And he spoke unto him , “ Thou man of God , the king hath said , ‘ Come down. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	10	And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty , “ If I be a man of God , then let fire come down from heaven and consume hee and thy fifty. ” And there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty .
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	11	Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty . And he answered and said unto him , “ O man of God , thus hath the king said , ‘ Come down quickly. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	12	And Elijah answered and said unto them , “ If I be a man of God , let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty. ” And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty .
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	13	And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty . And the third captain of fifty went up , and came and fell on his knees before Elijah , and besought him and said unto him , “ O man of God , I pray thee , let my life and the life of these fifty , thy servants , be precious in thy sight .
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	14	Behold , there came fire down from heaven and burned up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties . Therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	15	And the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah , “ Go down with him ; be not afraid of him. ” And he arose and went down with him unto the king .
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	16	And he said unto him , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron , is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word ? Therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou hast gone up , but shalt surely die ! ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	17	So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken . And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , because he had no son .
KJ21	2%20Kings	1	18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	2	And Elijah said unto Elisha , “ Tarry here , I pray thee ; for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel. ” And Elisha said unto him , “ As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee. ” So they went down to Bethel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	3	And the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came forth to Elisha and said unto him , “ Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today ? ” And he said , “ Yea , I know it ; hold ye your peace. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	4	And Elijah said unto him , “ Elisha , tarry here , I pray thee ; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. ” And he said , “ As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee. ” So they came to Jericho .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	5	And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him , “ Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today ? ” And he answered , “ Yea , I know it ; hold ye your peace. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	6	And Elijah said unto him , “ Tarry , I pray thee , here ; for the Lord hath sent me to the Jordan. ” And he said , “ As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee. ” And the two went on .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood in sight to view afar off ; and they two stood by the Jordan .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	8	And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters , and they were divided hither and thither so that the two went over on dry ground .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	9	And it came to pass , when they had gone over , that Elijah said unto Elisha , “ Ask what I shall do for thee , before I be taken away from thee. ” And Elisha said , “ I pray thee , let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	10	And he said , “ Thou hast asked a hard thing . Nevertheless , if thou see me when I am taken from thee , it shall be so unto thee ; but if not , it shall not be so. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	11	And it came to pass , as they still went on and talked , that , behold , there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire , and parted them both asunder ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	12	And Elisha saw it , and he cried , “ My father , my father , the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof ! ” And he saw him no more . And he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	13	He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	14	And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and smote the waters and said , “ Where is the Lord God of Elijah ? ” And when he also had smitten the waters , they parted hither and thither ; and Elisha went over .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	15	And when the sons of the prophets who were in view at Jericho saw him , they said , “ The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. ” And they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	16	And they said unto him , “ Behold now , there are with thy servants fifty strong men . Let them go , we pray thee , and seek thy master , lest perhaps the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. ” And he said , “ Ye shall not send. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	17	And when they urged him till he was ashamed , he said , “ Send. ” They sent therefore fifty men , and they sought three days but found him not .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	18	And when they came again to him ( for he tarried at Jericho ) , he said unto them , “ Did I not say unto you , ‘ Go not ’ ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	19	And the men of the city said unto Elisha , “ Behold , I pray thee , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord seeth ; but the water is nought , and the ground barren. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	20	And he said , “ Bring me a new cruse , and put salt therein. ” And they brought it to him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	21	And he went forth unto the spring of the waters , and cast the salt in there and said , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ I have healed these waters ; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	22	So the waters were healed unto this day , according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	23	And he went up from thence unto Bethel . And as he was going up by the way , there came forth little children out of the city , and mocked him and said unto him , “ Go up , thou bald head ! Go up , thou bald head ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	24	And he turned back and looked on them , and cursed them in the name of the Lord . And there came forth two shebears out of the wood and tore forty and two children of them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	2	25	And he went from thence to Mount Carmel , and from thence he returned to Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	2	And he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord , but not like his father and like his mother ; for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	3	Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	4	And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster , and rendered unto the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams with the wool .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	5	But it came to pass , when Ahab was dead , that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	6	And King Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time and numbered all Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	7	And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , saying , “ The king of Moab hath rebelled against me . Wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle ? ” And he said , “ I will go up ; I am as thou art , my people as thy people , and my horses as thy horses. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	8	And he said , “ Which way shall we go up ? ” And he answered , “ The way through the Wilderness of Edom. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	9	So the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah and the king of Edom ; and they made a circuit of seven days ’ journey . And there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	10	And the king of Israel said , “ Alas ! that the Lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	11	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there not here a prophet of the Lord , that we may inquire of the Lord by him ? ” And one of the king of Israel ’ s servants answered and said , “ Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat , who poured water on the hands of Elijah. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	12	And Jehoshaphat said , “ The word of the Lord is with him. ” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	13	And Elisha said unto the king of Israel , “ What have I to do with thee ? Get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother. ” And the king of Israel said unto him , “ Nay , for the Lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	14	And Elisha said , “ As the Lord of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , surely , were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , I would not look toward thee , nor see thee .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	15	But now bring me a minstrel. ” And it came to pass , when the minstrel played , that the hand of the Lord came upon him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	16	And he said , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Make this valley full of ditches. ’
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	17	For thus saith the Lord : ‘ Ye shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye and your cattle and your beasts. ’
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	18	And this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord ; He will deliver the Moabites also into your hand .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	19	And ye shall smite every fortified city and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all wells of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	20	And it came to pass in the morning , when the meat offering was offered , that behold , there came water by the way of Edom , and the country was filled with water .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	21	And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , they gathered all who were able to put on armor and upward , and stood in the border .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	22	And they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone upon the water , and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	23	And they said , “ This is blood ! The kings are surely slain , and they have smitten one another . Now therefore , Moab , to the spoil ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	24	And when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites , so that they fled before them ; but they went forward smiting the Moabites , even in their country .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	25	And they beat down the cities , and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it ; and they stopped all the wells of water , and felled all the good trees . Only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof ; however the slingers went about it and smote it .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	26	And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords to break through even unto the king of Edom , but they could not .
KJ21	2%20Kings	3	27	Then he took his eldest son who should have reigned in his stead , and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall . And there was great indignation against Israel . And they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	2	And Elisha said unto her , “ What shall I do for thee ? Tell me , what hast thou in the house ? ” And she said , “ Thine handmaid hath not anything in the house , save a pot of oil. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	4	And when thou hast come in , thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons , and shalt pour out into all those vessels , and thou shalt set aside that which is full. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	3	Then he said , “ Go , borrow thee vessels abroad from all thy neighbors , even empty vessels ; borrow not a few .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	5	So she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she poured out .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	6	And it came to pass , when the vessels were full , that she said unto her son , “ Bring me yet a vessel. ” And he said unto her , “ There is not a vessel more. ” And the oil flow ceased .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	7	Then she came and told the man of God . And he said , “ Go , sell the oil and pay thy debt , and live thou and thy children on the rest. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	8	And there was a day that Elisha passed to Shunem , where was a great woman ; and she constrained him to eat bread . And so it was that as oft as he passed by , he turned in thither to eat bread .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	9	And she said unto her husband , “ Behold now , I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passeth by us continually .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	10	Let us make a little chamber , I pray thee , on the wall ; and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick . And it shall be , when he cometh to us , that he shall turn in thither. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	11	And it fell on a day that he came thither , and he turned into the chamber and lay there .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	12	And he said to Gehazi his servant , “ Call this Shunammite. ” And when he had called her , she stood before him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	13	And he said unto him , “ Say now unto her , ‘ Behold , thou hast shown concern for us with all this care . What is to be done for thee ? Wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host ? ’ ” And she answered , “ I dwell among mine own people. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	14	And he said , “ What then is to be done for her ? ” And Gehazi answered , “ Verily she hath no child , and her husband is old. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	15	And he said , “ Call her. ” And when he had called her , she stood in the door .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	16	And he said , “ About this season , according to the time of life , thou shalt embrace a son. ” And she said , “ Nay , my lord , thou man of God , do not lie unto thine handmaid. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	17	And the woman conceived , and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her , according to the time of life .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	18	And when the child was grown , it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	19	And he said unto his father , “ My head , my head. ” And he said to a lad , “ Carry him to his mother. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	20	And when he had taken him and brought him to his mother , he sat on her knees till noon , and then died .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	21	And she went up , and laid him on the bed of the man of God , and shut the door upon him and went out .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	22	And she called unto her husband and said , “ Send me , I pray thee , one of the young men and one of the asses , that I may run to the man of God and come back. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	23	And he said , “ Why wilt thou go to him today ? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath. ” And she said , “ It shall be well. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	24	Then she saddled an ass , and said to her servant , “ Drive , and go forward ; slacken not thy riding for me unless I bid thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	25	So she went and came unto the man of God to Mount Carmel . And it came to pass , when the man of God saw her afar off , that he said to Gehazi his servant , “ Behold , yonder is that Shunammite .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	26	Run now , I pray thee , to meet her and say unto her , ‘ Is it well with thee ? Is it well with thy husband ? Is it well with the child ? ’ ” And she answered , “ It is well. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	27	And when she came to the man of God at the hill , she caught him by the feet ; but Gehazi came near to thrust her away . And the man of God said , “ Let her alone , for her soul is vexed within her ; and the Lord hath hid it from me , and hath not told me. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	28	Then she said , “ Did I desire a son of my lord ? Did I not say , ‘ Do not deceive me ’ ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	29	Then he said to Gehazi , “ Gird up thy loins , and take my staff in thine hand , and go thy way . If thou meet any man , salute him not ; and if any salute thee , answer him not again . And lay my staff upon the face of the child. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	30	And the mother of the child said , “ As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee. ” And he arose and followed her .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	31	And Gehazi passed on before them , and laid the staff upon the face of the child ; but there was neither voice nor hearing . Therefore he went back to meet him , and told him , saying , “ The child has not awakened. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	32	And when Elisha had come into the house , behold , the child was dead and lay upon his bed .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	33	He went in therefore and shut the door upon the twain , and prayed unto the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	34	And he went up and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands ; and he stretched himself upon the child , and the flesh of the child waxed warm .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	35	Then he returned and walked in the house to and fro , and went up and stretched himself upon him ; and the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	36	And he called Gehazi and said , “ Call this Shunammite. ” So he called her . And when she had come in unto him , he said , “ Take up thy son. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	37	Then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground , and took up her son and went out .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	38	And Elisha came again to Gilgal ; and there was a famine in the land . And the sons of the prophets were sitting before him ; and he said unto his servant , “ Set on the great pot , and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	39	And one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds , his lap full , and came and shred them into the pot of pottage , for they knew them not .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	40	So they poured out for the men to eat . And it came to pass , as they were eating of the pottage , that they cried out and said , “ O thou man of God , there is death in the pot ! ” And they could not eat thereof .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	41	But he said , “ Then bring meal. ” And he cast it into the pot and he said , “ Pour out for the people , that they may eat. ” And there was no harm in the pot .
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	42	And there came a man from Baalshalisha , and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits , twenty loaves of barley and full ears of corn in the husk thereof . And he said , “ Give unto the people , that they may eat. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	43	And his servitor said , “ What , should I set this before a hundred men ? ” He said again , “ Give the people , that they may eat ; for thus saith the Lord : ‘ They shall eat and shall leave some thereof. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	4	44	So he set it before them , and they ate and left thereof , according to the word of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	2	And the Syrians had gone out by companies , and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid ; and she waited on Naaman ’ s wife .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	5	And the king of Syria said , “ Go now , go ; and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. ” And he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	3	And she said unto her mistress , “ Would to God my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria ! For he would heal him of his leprosy. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	4	And one went in and told his lord , saying , “ Thus and thus said the maid who is from the land of Israel. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	6	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , “ Now when this letter has come unto thee , behold , I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee , that thou mayest cure him of his leprosy. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	7	And it came to pass , when the king of Israel had read the letter , that he rent his clothes and said , “ Am I God , to kill and to make alive , that this man doth send unto me to cure a man of his leprosy ? Therefore consider , I pray you , and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	8	And it was so , when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , “ Why hast thou rent thy clothes ? Let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	9	So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot , and stood at the door of the house of Elisha .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	10	And Elisha sent a messenger unto him , saying , “ Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	11	But Naaman was wroth and went away , and said , “ Behold , I thought , ‘ He will surely come out to me , and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God , and strike his hand over the place , and cure the leper. ’
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	12	Are not Abana and Pharpar , rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? May I not wash in them and be clean ? ” So he turned and went away in a rage .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	13	And his servants came near , and spoke unto him and said , “ My father , if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing , wouldest thou not have done it ? How much rather then , when he saith to thee , ‘ Wash , and be clean ’ ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	14	Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	15	And he returned to the man of God , he and all his company , and came and stood before him ; and he said , “ Behold , now I know that there is no God in all the earth , but in Israel . Now therefore , I pray thee , take a blessing from thy servant. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	16	But he said , “ As the Lord liveth , before whom I stand , I will receive none. ” And he urged him to take it , but he refused .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	17	And Naaman said , “ Shall there not then , I pray thee , be given to thy servant two mules ’ burden of earth ? For thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods , but unto the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	18	In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant , that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there , and he leaneth on my hand , and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon — when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon , the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	19	And he said unto him , “ Go in peace. ” So he departed from him a little way .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	20	But Gehazi , the servant of Elisha the man of God , said , “ Behold , my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian in not receiving at his hands that which he brought ; but , as the Lord liveth , I will run after him and take something from him. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	21	So Gehazi followed after Naaman . And when Naaman saw him running after him , he alighted down from the chariot to meet him , and said , “ Is all well ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	22	And he said , “ All is well . My master hath sent me , saying , ‘ Behold , even now there have come to me from Mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets . Give them , I pray thee , a talent of silver and two changes of garments. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	23	And Naaman said , “ Be content , take two talents. ” And he urged him , and bound two talents of silver in two bags , with two changes of garments , and laid them upon two of his servants ; and they bore them before him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	24	And when he came to the tower , he took them from their hand and stowed them in the house ; and he let the men go , and they departed .
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	25	But he went in and stood before his master . And Elisha said unto him , “ From whence comest thou , Gehazi ? ” And he said , “ Thy servant went nowhere. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	26	And he said unto him , “ Went not mine heart with thee when the man turned back from his chariot to meet thee ? Is it a time to receive money and to receive garments , and olive yards and vineyards , and sheep and oxen , and menservants and maidservants ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	5	27	The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever. ” And he went out from his presence a leper , as white as snow .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	2	Let us go , we pray thee , unto the Jordan , and take from thence every man a beam , and let us make us a place there where we may dwell. ” And he answered , “ Go ye. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	6	And the man of God said , “ Where fell it ? ” And he showed him the place . And he cut down a stick and cast it in thither , and the iron did swim .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	3	And one said , “ Be content , I pray thee , and go with thy servants. ” And he answered , “ I will go. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	4	So he went with them . And when they came to the Jordan , they cut down wood .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	5	But as one was felling a beam , the ax head fell into the water ; and he cried and said , “ Alas , master ! For it was borrowed ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	7	Therefore said he , “ Take it up to thee. ” And he put out his hand and took it .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	8	Then the king of Syria warred against Israel , and took counsel with his servants , saying , “ In such and such a place shall be my camp. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	9	And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel , saying , “ Beware that thou pass not such a place , for thither the Syrians are coming down. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	10	And the king of Israel sent to the place of which the man of God told him and warned him , and saved himself there , not once nor twice .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	11	Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled by this thing ; and he called his servants and said unto them , “ Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	12	And one of his servants said , “ None , my lord , O king ; but Elisha , the prophet who is in Israel , telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	13	And he said , “ Go and spy where he is , that I may send and fetch him. ” And it was told him , saying , “ Behold , he is in Dothan. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	14	Therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host , and they came by night and compassed the city about .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	15	And when the servant of the man of God had risen early and gone forth , behold , a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots . And his servant said unto him , “ Alas , my master ! What shall we do ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	16	And he answered , “ Fear not , for they that are with us are more than they that are with them. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	17	And Elisha prayed and said , “ Lord , I pray thee , open his eyes , that he may see. ” And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man , and he saw ; and behold , the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	18	And when they came down to him , Elisha prayed unto the Lord and said , “ Smite this people , I pray thee , with blindness. ” And He smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	19	And Elisha said unto them , “ This is not the way , neither is this the city . Follow me , and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. ” But he led them to Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	20	And it came to pass , when they had come into Samaria , that Elisha said , “ Lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see. ” And the Lord opened their eyes , and they saw ; and behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	21	And the king of Israel said unto Elisha when he saw them , “ My father , shall I smite them ? Shall I smite them ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	22	And he answered , “ Thou shalt not smite them . Wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow ? Set bread and water before them , that they may eat and drink and go to their master. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	23	And he prepared great provision for them ; and when they had eaten and drunk , he sent them away , and they went to their master . So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	24	And it came to pass after this that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host , and went up and besieged Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	25	And there was a great famine in Samaria ; and behold , they besieged it until an ass ’ s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a kab of dove ’ s dung for five pieces of silver .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	26	And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall , there cried a woman unto him , saying , “ Help , my lord , O king ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	27	And he said , “ If the Lord do not help thee , from whence shall I help thee ? Out of the barn floor or out of the wine press ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	28	And the king said unto her , “ What aileth thee ? ” And she answered , “ This woman said unto me , ‘ Give thy son , that we may eat him today , and we will eat my son tomorrow. ’
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	29	So we boiled my son and ate him . And I said unto her on the next day , ‘ Give thy son , that we may eat him ’ ; and she hath hid her son. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	30	And it came to pass , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he rent his clothes ; and he passed by upon the wall , and the people looked , and behold , he had sackcloth within upon his flesh .
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	31	Then he said , “ God do so and more also to me , if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	32	But Elisha sat in his house , and the elders sat with him ; and the king sent a man from before him . But ere the messenger came to him , he said to the elders , “ See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head ? Look , when the messenger cometh , shut the door , and hold him fast at the door . Is not the sound of his master ’ s feet behind him ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	6	33	And while he yet talked with them , behold , the messenger came down unto him ; and he said , “ Behold , this evil is from the Lord . Why should I wait for the Lord any longer ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	2	Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said , “ Behold , if the Lord would make windows in heaven , might this thing be ? ” And he said , “ Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	7	Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents and their horses and their asses , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	3	And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate . And they said one to another , “ Why sit we here until we die ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	4	If we say , ‘ We will enter into the city , ’ then the famine is in the city , and we shall die there ; and if we sit still here , we die also . Now therefore come , and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians . If they save us alive , we shall live ; and if they kill us , we shall but die. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	5	And they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the Syrians ; and when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	6	For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses , even the noise of a great host ; and they said one to another , “ Lo , the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	8	And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp , they went into one tent and ate and drank , and carried from thence silver and gold and raiment , and went and hid it ; and came again , and entered into another tent and carried from thence also , and went and hid it .
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	9	Then they said one to another , “ We do not what is right . This day is a day of good tidings , and we hold our peace . If we tarry till the morning light , some mischief will come upon us . Now therefore come , that we may go and tell the king ’ s household. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	10	So they came and called unto the gatekeepers of the city ; and they told them , saying , “ We came to the camp of the Syrians , and behold , there was no man there , neither voice of man , but horses tied and asses tied and the tents as they were. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	11	And he called the gatekeepers , and they told it to the king ’ s house within .
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	12	And the king arose in the night and said unto his servants , “ I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us . They know that we are hungry ; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field , saying , ‘ When they come out of the city , we shall catch them alive and get into the city. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	13	And one of his servants answered and said , “ Let some take , I pray thee , five of the horses that remain , which are left in the city — behold , they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it ; behold , I say , they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites who are consumed — and let us send and see. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	14	They took therefore two chariot horses ; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians , saying , “ Go and see. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	15	And they went after them unto the Jordan ; and lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . And the messengers returned and told the king .
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	16	And the people went out and despoiled the tents of the Syrians . So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	17	And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate . And the people trod upon him in the gate , and he died , as the man of God had said , who spoke when the king came down to him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	18	And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king , saying , “ Two measures of barley for a shekel , and a measure of fine flour for a shekel , shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	19	And that lord answered the man of God and said , “ Now , behold , if the Lord should make windows in heaven , might such a thing be ? ” And he said , “ Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	7	20	And so it befell him , for the people trod upon him in the gate and he died .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	2	And the woman arose and did according to the saying of the man of God ; and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	8	And the king said unto Hazael , “ Take a present in thine hand and go , meet the man of God , and inquire of the Lord by him , saying , ‘ Shall I recover from this disease ? ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	3	And it came to pass , at the seven years ’ end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines ; and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	4	And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God , saying , “ Tell me , I pray thee , all the great things that Elisha hath done. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	5	And it came to pass , as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life , that behold , the woman , whose son he had restored to life , cried to the king for her house and for her land . And Gehazi said , “ My lord , O king , this is the woman , and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	6	And when the king asked the woman , she told him . So the king appointed unto her a certain officer , saying , “ Restore all that was hers , and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land , even until now. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	7	And Elisha came to Damascus . And Benhadad the king of Syria was sick ; and it was told him , saying , “ The man of God has come hither. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	9	So Hazael went to meet him , and took a present with him , even of every good thing of Damascus , forty camels ’ burden , and came and stood before him and said , “ Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee , saying , ‘ Shall I recover from this disease ? ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	10	And Elisha said unto him , “ Go , say unto him , ‘ Thou mayest certainly recover ’ . However the Lord hath shown me that he shall surely die. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	11	And he fixed his countenance steadfastly until Hazael was ashamed ; and the man of God wept .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	12	And Hazael said , “ Why weepeth my lord ? ” And he answered , “ Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel . Their strongholds wilt thou set on fire , and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword , and wilt dash their children , and rip up their women with child. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	13	And Hazael said , “ But what , is thy servant a dog , that he should do this great thing ? ” And Elisha answered , “ The Lord hath shown me that thou shalt be king over Syria. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	14	So he departed from Elisha , and came to his master , who said to him , “ What said Elisha to thee ? ” And he answered , “ He told me that thou shouldest surely recover. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	15	And it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water , and spread it on his face so that he died ; and Hazael reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	16	And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	17	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	18	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab , for the daughter of Ahab was his wife ; and he did evil in the sight of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	19	Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah for David His servant ’ s sake , as He promised him to give him always a light , and to his children .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	20	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah , and made a king over themselves .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	21	So Joram went over to Zair , and all the chariots with him . And he rose by night and smote the Edomites who compassed him about , and the captains of the chariots ; and the people fled into their tents .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	22	Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day . Then Libnah revolted at the same time .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	23	And the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	24	And Joram slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the City of David ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	26	Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Athaliah , the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	27	And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did evil in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of Ahab ; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	28	And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead ; and the Syrians wounded Joram .
KJ21	2%20Kings	8	29	And King Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah , when he fought against Hazael king of Syria . And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel , because he was sick .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	2	And when thou comest thither , seek out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in and make him arise up from among his brethren , and carry him to an inner chamber .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	9	And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	3	Then take the box of oil , and pour it on his head and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : “ I have anointed thee king over Israel. ” ’ Then open the door and flee , and tarry not. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	4	So the young man , even the young man the prophet , went to Ramothgilead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	5	And when he came , behold , the captains of the host were sitting ; and he said , “ I have a message for thee , O captain. ” And Jehu said , “ Unto which of us all ? ” And he said , “ To thee , O captain. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	6	And he arose and went into the house ; and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him , “ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : ‘ I have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord , even over Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	7	And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master , that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of Jezebel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	8	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish ; and I will cut off from Ahab him that urinates against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	10	And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel , and there shall be none to bury her. ’ ” And he opened the door and fled .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	11	Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord ; and one said unto him , “ Is all well ? Why came this mad fellow to thee ? ” And he said unto them , “ Ye know the man and his communication. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	12	And they said , “ It is false ; tell us now. ” And he said , “ Thus and thus spoke he to me , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : I have anointed thee king over Israel. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	13	Then they hastened and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew with trumpets , saying , “ Jehu is king ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	14	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram . ( Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead , he and all Israel , because of Hazael king of Syria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	15	But King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria . ) And Jehu said , “ If it be your minds , then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	16	So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel , for Joram lay there . And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	17	And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel , and he spied the company of Jehu as he came , and said , “ I see a company. ” And Joram said , “ Take a horseman and send to meet them , and let him say , ‘ Is it peace ? ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	18	So there went one on horseback to meet him , and said , “ Thus saith the king : ‘ Is it peace ? ’ ” And Jehu said , “ What hast thou to do with peace ? Turn thee in behind me. ” And the watchman told , saying , “ The messenger came to them , but he cometh not back. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	19	Then he sent out a second on horseback , who came to them and said , “ Thus saith the king : ‘ Is it peace ? ’ ” And Jehu answered , “ What hast thou to do with peace ? Turn thee in behind me. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	20	And the watchman told , saying , “ He came even unto them and cometh not back ; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi , for he driveth furiously. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	21	And Joram said , “ Make ready. ” And his chariot was made ready . And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out , each in his chariot ; and they went out against Jehu and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	22	And it came to pass , when Joram saw Jehu , that he said , “ Is it peace , Jehu ? ” And he answered , “ What peace , so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	23	And Joram turned his hands and fled , and said to Ahaziah , “ There is treachery , O Ahaziah ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	24	And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote Joram between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sank down in his chariot .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	25	Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain , “ Take him up , and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite ; for remember how when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father , the Lord laid this burden upon him :
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	26	‘ Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons , saith the Lord , and I will requite thee in this plot , saith the Lord. ’ Now therefore take and cast him into the plot of ground , according to the word of the Lord. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	27	But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this , he fled by the way of the garden house . And Jehu followed after him and said , “ Smite him also in the chariot. ” And they did so at the ascent to Gur , which is by Ibleam . And he fled to Megiddo , and died there .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	28	And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem , and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the City of David .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	29	And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab , Ahaziah had begun to reign over Judah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	30	And when Jehu had come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her face and attired her head , and looked out at a window .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	31	And as Jehu entered in at the gate , she said , “ Had Zimri peace , who slew his master ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	32	And he lifted up his face to the window and said , “ Who is on my side ? Who ? ” And there looked out at him two or three eunuchs .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	33	And he said , “ Throw her down ! ” So they threw her down , and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses ; and he trod her underfoot .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	34	And when he had come in , he ate and drank , and said , “ Go , see now this cursed woman , and bury her ; for she is a king ’ s daughter. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	35	And they went to bury her , but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	36	Therefore they came back and told him . And he said , “ This is the word of the Lord , which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite , saying , ‘ In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	9	37	And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel , so that they shall not say , “ This is Jezebel . ” ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	2	“ Now as soon as this letter cometh to you , since your master ’ s sons are with you and there are with you chariots and horses , a fortified city also and armor ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	10	Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Ahab , for the Lord hath done that which He spoke by His servant Elijah. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	3	choose even out the best and most suitable of your master ’ s sons and set him on his father ’ s throne , and fight for your master ’ s house. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	4	But they were exceedingly afraid and said , “ Behold , two kings stood not before him . How then shall we stand ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	5	And he that was over the house , and he that was over the city , the elders also , and the guardians of the children , sent to Jehu , saying , “ We are thy servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us ; we will not make any king . Do thou that which is good in thine eyes. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	6	Then he wrote a letter the second time to them , saying , “ If ye be for me , and if ye will hearken unto my voice , take ye the heads of the men your master ’ s sons and come to me at Jezreel by tomorrow this time. ” Now the king ’ s sons , being seventy persons , were with the great men of the city , who brought them up .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	7	And it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king ’ s sons and slew seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets and sent him them at Jezreel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	8	And there came a messenger and told him , saying , “ They have brought the heads of the king ’ s sons. ” And he said , “ Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	9	And it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood , and said to all the people , “ Ye are righteous . Behold , I conspired against my master and slew him , but who slew all these ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	11	So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , and all his great men and his kinsfolk and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	12	And he arose and departed , and came to Samaria . And as he was at the shearing house on the way ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	13	Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah , and said , “ Who are ye ? ” And they answered , “ We are the brethren of Ahaziah , and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	14	And he said , “ Take them alive ! ” And they took them alive and slew them at the pit of the shearing house , even two and forty men ; neither left he any of them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	15	And when he had departed from thence , he happened upon Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him ; and he saluted him and said to him , “ Is thine heart right , as my heart is with thy heart ? ” And Jehonadab answered , “ It is. ” “ If it be , give me thine hand. ” And he gave him his hand , and Jehu took him up to him into the chariot .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	16	And he said , “ Come with me , and see my zeal for the Lord. ” So they made him ride in his chariot .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	17	And when he came to Samaria , he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the Lord which He spoke to Elijah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	18	And Jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them , “ Ahab served Baal a little , but Jehu shall serve him much .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	19	Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal , all his servants , and all his priests . Let none be wanting , for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal . Whosoever shall be wanting , he shall not live. ” But Jehu did it in subtlety , with the intent that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	20	And Jehu said , “ Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. ” And they proclaimed it .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	21	And Jehu sent through all Israel ; and all the worshipers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left who came not . And they came into the house of Baal , and the house of Baal was full from one end to another .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	22	And he said unto him that was over the vestry , “ Bring forth vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. ” And he brought them forth vestments .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	23	And Jehu went , and Jehonadab the son of Rechab , into the house of Baal and said unto the worshipers of Baal , “ Search , and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the Lord , but the worshipers of Baal only. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	24	And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings , Jehu appointed fourscore men outside and said , “ If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape , he that letteth him go , his life shall be for the life of him. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	25	And it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains , “ Go in and slay them ; let none come forth ! ” And they smote them with the edge of the sword . And the guard and the captains cast them out , and went to the city of the house of Baal .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	26	And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal and burned them ;
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	27	and they broke down the image of Baal and broke down the house of Baal , and made it an outhouse unto this day .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	28	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	29	However , from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , Jehu departed not from them , to wit , from the golden calves that were in Bethel and that were in Dan .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	30	And the Lord said unto Jehu , “ Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in Mine eyes , and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in Mine heart , thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	31	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart ; for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam , who made Israel to sin .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	32	In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short ; and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	33	from the Jordan eastward , all the land of Gilead , the Gadites , and the Reubenites , and the Manassites , from Aroer , which is by the River Arnon , even Gilead and Bashan .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	35	And Jehu slept with his fathers , and they buried him in Samaria . And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	10	36	And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	2	But Jehosheba , the daughter of King Joram , sister of Ahaziah , took Joash the son of Ahaziah , and stole him from among the king ’ s sons who were slain ; and they hid him , even him and his nurse , in the bedchamber from Athaliah , so that he was not slain .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	11	And the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	3	And he was with her hid in the house of the Lord six years . And Athaliah reigned over the land .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	4	And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds , with the captains and the guard , and brought them to him into the house of the Lord , and made a covenant with them , and took an oath from them in the house of the Lord , and showed them the king ’ s son .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	5	And he commanded them , saying , “ This is the thing that ye shall do : A third part of you that enter in on the Sabbath shall be keepers of the watch of the king ’ s house ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	6	and a third part shall be at the gate of Sur , and a third part at the gate behind the guard . So shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	7	And two parts of all you that go forth on the Sabbath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord about the king .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	8	And ye shall compass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he that cometh within the ranges , let him be slain . And be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	9	And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded ; and they took every man his men who were to come in on the Sabbath , with those who should go out on the Sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	10	And to the captains over hundreds the priest gave King David ’ s spears and shields that were in the temple of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	12	And he brought forth the king ’ s son , and put the crown upon him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king and anointed him . And they clapped their hands and said , “ God save the king ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	13	And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the temple of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	14	And when she looked , behold , the king stood by a pillar , as the manner was , and the princes and the trumpeters by the king . And all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets . And Athaliah rent her clothes and cried , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	15	But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds , the officers of the host , and said unto them , “ Bring her forth outside the ranks ; and him that followeth her kill with the sword. ” For the priest had said , “ Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	16	And they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by which the horses came into the king ’ s house , and there was she slain .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	17	And Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people , that they should be the Lord ’ S people , and also between the king and the people .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	18	And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal and broke it down ; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . And the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	19	And he took the rulers over hundreds , and the captains , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king ’ s house . And he sat on the throne of the kings .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	20	And all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was in quiet ; and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king ’ s house .
KJ21	2%20Kings	11	21	Seven years old was Joash when he began to reign .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	2	And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	12	and to masons and hewers of stone , and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	3	But the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	4	And Joash said to the priests , “ All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the Lord , even the money of every one that passeth the account , the money that every man is set at , and all the money that cometh into any man ’ s heart to bring into the house of the Lord ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	5	let the priests take it to themselves , every man from his acquaintance ; and let them repair the breaches of the house , wheresoever any breach shall be found. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	6	But it was so , that in the three and twentieth year of King Joash , the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	7	Then King Joash called for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests , and said unto them , “ Why repair ye not the breaches of the house ? Now therefore receive no more money from your acquaintance , but deliver it for the breaches of the house. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	8	And the priests consented to receive no more money from the people , neither to repair the breaches of the house .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	9	But Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it , and set it beside the altar , on the right side as one cometh into the house of the Lord ; and the priests who kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	10	And it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king ’ s scribe and the high priest came up , and they put it up in bags , and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	11	And they gave the money , being counted , into the hands of those who did the work , who had the oversight of the house of the Lord ; and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders who wrought upon the house of the Lord ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	13	However , there were not made for the house of the Lord bowls of silver , snuffers , basins , trumpets , any vessels of gold or vessels of silver from the money that was brought into the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	14	But they gave that to the workmen , and repaired therewith the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	15	Moreover they reckoned not with the men into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on the workmen , for they dealt faithfully .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	16	The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the Lord ; it was the priests ’ .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	17	Then Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath , and took it ; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	18	And Joash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah , his fathers , kings of Judah , had dedicated , and his own hallowed things , and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and in the king ’ s house , and sent it to Hazael king of Syria ; and he went away from Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	19	And the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	20	And his servants arose and made a conspiracy , and slew Joash in the house of Millo , which goeth down to Silla .
KJ21	2%20Kings	12	21	For Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer , his servants , smote him , and he died . And they buried him with his fathers in the City of David ; and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	13	And Jehoash slept with his fathers , and Jeroboam sat upon his throne . And Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	3	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael all their days .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	4	And Jehoahaz besought the Lord , and the Lord hearkened unto him ; for He saw the oppression of Israel , because the king of Syria oppressed them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	5	( And the Lord gave Israel a savior , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians ; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents , as before .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	6	Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , who made Israel sin , but walked therein ; and there remained the Asherah poles also in Samaria . )
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	7	Neither did He leave to Jehoahaz of the people but fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the dust by threshing .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	9	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers ; they buried him in Samaria , and Jehoash his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	10	In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned sixteen years .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	11	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord . He departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel sin , but he walked therein .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	12	And the rest of the acts of Jehoash and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	14	Now Elisha had fallen sick with his sickness whereof he died . And Jehoash the king of Israel came down unto him , and wept over his face , and said , “ O my father , my father , the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof ! ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	15	And Elisha said unto him , “ Take bow and arrows. ” And he took unto him a bow and arrows .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	16	And he said to the king of Israel , “ Put thine hand upon the bow. ” And he put his hand upon it , and Elisha put his hands upon the king ’ s hands .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	17	And he said , “ Open the window eastward. ” And he opened it . Then Elisha said , “ Shoot. ” And he shot . And he said , “ The arrow of the Lord ’ S deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria , for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek till thou have consumed them. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	18	And he said , “ Take the arrows. ” And he took them . And he said unto the king of Israel , “ Smite upon the ground. ” And he smote thrice , and ceased .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	19	And the man of God was wroth with him and said , “ Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times . Then had thou smitten Syria till thou had consumed it , whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	20	And Elisha died , and they buried him . And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	21	And it came to pass , as they were burying a man , that , behold , they spied a band of men ; and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha . And when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha , he revived and stood up on his feet .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	22	But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	23	And the Lord was gracious unto them and had compassion on them and had respect unto them , because of His covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast He them from His presence as yet .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	24	So Hazael king of Syria died ; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	13	25	And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took back out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war . Three times did Jehoash beat him , and recovered the cities of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	2	He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	14	And he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king ’ s house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , yet not like David his father . He did according to all things as Joash his father did .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	4	However , the high places were not taken away ; as yet the people sacrificed and burned incense on the high places .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	5	And it came to pass , as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand , that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	6	But the children of the murderers he slew not , according unto that which is written in the Book of the Law of Moses , wherein the Lord commanded , saying , “ The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , nor the children be put to death for the fathers ; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	7	He slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand , and took Sela by war , and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , “ Come , let us look one another in the face. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	9	And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah , saying , “ The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon , saying , ‘ Give thy daughter to my son for a wife. ’ And there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon , and trod down the thistle .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	10	Thou hast indeed smitten Edom , and thine heart hath lifted thee up . Glory in this , and tarry at home ; for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and Judah with thee ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	11	But Amaziah would not hear . Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up , and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	12	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel , and they fled every man to their tents .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	13	And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash the son of Ahaziah , at Bethshemesh , and came to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim unto the Corner Gate , four hundred cubits .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	15	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	16	And Jehoash slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel ; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	17	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash , son of Jehoahaz king of Israel , fifteen years .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	18	And the rest of the acts of Amaziah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	19	Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem , and he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish and slew him there .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	20	And they brought him on horses , and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	21	And all the people of Judah took Azariah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king instead of his father Amaziah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	22	He built Elath , and restored it to Judah ; after that the king slept with his fathers .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah , Jeroboam the son of Jehoash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria , and reigned forty and one years .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	24	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord ; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	25	He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath unto the Sea of the Plain , according to the word of the Lord God of Israel , which He spoke by the hand of His servant Jonah , the son of Amittai , the prophet who was from Gathhepher .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	26	For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter ; for there was not any shut up nor any free , nor any helper for Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	27	And the Lord said not that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven , but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Jehoash .
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	28	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did , and his might , how he warred , and how he recovered Damascus and Hamath ( which belonged to Judah ) for Israel , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	14	29	And Jeroboam slept with his fathers , even with the kings of Israel ; and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	2	Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	15	And the rest of the acts of Shallum and his conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Amaziah had done ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	4	save that the high places were not removed ; the people sacrificed and burned incense still on the high places .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	5	And the Lord smote the king , so that he was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a separate house . And Jotham the king ’ s son was over the house , judging the people of the land .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	6	And the rest of the acts of Azariah and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	7	So Azariah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David ; and Jotham his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	8	In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah , did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as his fathers had done ; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	10	And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him , and smote him before the people and slew him , and reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	11	And the rest of the acts of Zechariah , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	12	This was the word of the Lord which He spoke unto Jehu , saying , “ Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation. ” And so it came to pass .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	13	Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah ; and he reigned a full month in Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	14	For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah and came to Samaria , and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and slew him , and reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	16	Then Menahem smote Tiphsah and all who were therein , and the borders thereof from Tirzah , because they opened not to him ; therefore he smote it . And all the women therein who were with child he ripped up .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	17	In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah , began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel , and reigned ten years in Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	18	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord ; he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	19	And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land ; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	20	And Menahem exacted the money from Israel , even from all the mighty men of wealth , from each man fifty shekels of silver , to give to the king of Assyria . So the king of Assyria turned back and stayed not there in the land .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	21	And the rest of the acts of Menahem and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	22	And Menahem slept with his fathers ; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned two years .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	24	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord ; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	25	But Pekah the son of Remaliah , a captain of his , conspired against him and smote him in Samaria , in the palace of the king ’ s house , with Argob and Arieh and with him fifty men of the Gileadites ; and he killed him and reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	26	And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	27	In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah , Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned twenty years .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	28	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord ; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	29	In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria , and took Ijon , and Abelbethmaachah , and Janoah , and Kedesh , and Hazor , and Gilead , and Galilee , all the land of Naphtali , and carried them captive to Assyria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	30	And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and smote him and slew him , and reigned in his stead in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	31	And the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	32	In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel , began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	33	Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Jerusha , the daughter of Zadok .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	34	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord ; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	35	However , the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places . He built the Higher Gate of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	36	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	37	In those days the Lord began to send against Judah , Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	15	38	And Jotham slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father ; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	2	Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem , and did not do that which was right in the sight of the Lord his God , like David his father .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	16	Thus did Urijah the priest , according to all that King Ahaz commanded .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	3	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yea , and made his son pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	4	And he sacrificed and burned incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	5	Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war ; and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	6	At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath for Syria , and drove the Jews from Elath ; and the Syrians came to Elath and dwelt there unto this day .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria , saying , “ I am thy servant and thy son ; come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel , who rise up against me. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	8	And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king ’ s house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	9	And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him ; for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it , and carried the people of it captive to Kir , and slew Rezin .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	10	And King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria , and saw an altar that was at Damascus ; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the design of the altar and the pattern of it , according to all the workmanship thereof .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	11	And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus ; so Urijah the priest made it for King Ahaz ’ s coming from Damascus .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	12	And when the king came from Damascus , the king saw the altar ; and the king approached the altar and offered thereon .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	13	And he burned his burnt offering and his meat offering , and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon the altar .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	14	And he brought also the brazen altar which was before the Lord from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the altar .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	15	And King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest , saying , “ Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering , and the evening meat offering , and the king ’ s burnt sacrifice , and his meat offering , with the burnt offering of all the people of the land , and their meat offering , and their drink offerings ; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice . And the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	17	And King Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the laver from them , and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it and put it upon a pavement of stones .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	18	And the covert for the Sabbath that they had built in the house , and the king ’ s entry outside , he removed from the house of the Lord for the king of Assyria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	16	20	And Ahaz slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the City of David ; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , but not as the kings of Israel who were before him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	17	And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke Him to anger .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	3	Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria ; and Hoshea became his servant , and rendered him tribute .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	4	And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea ; for he had sent messengers to So , king of Egypt , and brought no present to the king of Assyria , as he had done year by year . Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	5	Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land , and went up to Samaria and besieged it three years .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	6	In the ninth year of Hoshea , the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away into Assyria , and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the River of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	7	For so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God , who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	8	And they walked in the statutes of the heathen whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	9	And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the Lord their God , and they built themselves high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	10	And they set up for themselves images and Asherah poles in every high hill and under every green tree ;
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	11	and there they burned incense in all the high places , as did the heathen whom the Lord carried away before them , and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	12	For they served idols , whereof the Lord had said unto them , “ Ye shall not do this thing. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	13	Yet the Lord testified against Israel and against Judah by all the prophets and by all the seers , saying , “ Turn ye from your evil ways , and keep My commandments and My statutes , according to all the law which I commanded your fathers , and which I sent to you by My servants the prophets. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	14	Notwithstanding they would not hear , but hardened their necks like the neck of their fathers , who did not believe in the Lord their God .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	15	And they rejected His statutes and His covenant that He made with their fathers , and His testimonies which He testified against them ; and they followed vanity and became vain , and went after the heathen who were round about them , concerning whom the Lord had charged them that they should not do like them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	16	And they left all the commandments of the Lord their God and made them molten images , even two calves , and made an Asherah pole , and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	18	Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of His sight . There was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	19	Also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God , but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	20	And the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of despoilers until He had cast them out of His sight .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	21	For He rent Israel from the house of David , and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king . And Jeroboam drove Israel from following the Lord , and made them sin a great sin .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	22	For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did ; they departed not from them ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	23	until the Lord removed Israel out of His sight , as He had said by all His servants the prophets . So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	24	And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon , and from Cuthah , and from Ava , and from Hamath , and from Sepharvaim , and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel ; and they possessed Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	25	And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared not the Lord ; therefore the Lord sent lions among them , which slew some of them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	26	Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria , saying , “ The nations which thou hast removed and placed in the cities of Samaria know not the manner of the God of the land ; therefore He hath sent lions among them , and behold , they slay them because they know not the manner of the God of the land. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	27	Then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , “ Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	28	Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel , and taught them how they should fear the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	29	However every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	30	And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth , and the men of Cuth made Nergal , and the men of Hamath made Ashima ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	31	and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak ; and the Sepharvites burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	32	So they feared the Lord , and made unto themselves from the lowest of them priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	33	They feared the Lord , but served their own gods , after the manner of the nations who carried them away from thence .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	34	Unto this day they do according to the former manner . They fear not the Lord , neither do they according to their statutes or according to their ordinances or the law and commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob , whom He named Israel ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	35	with whom the Lord had made a covenant and charged them , saying , “ Ye shall not fear other gods , nor bow yourselves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them ;
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	36	but the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm , Him shall ye fear and Him shall ye worship , and to Him shall ye do sacrifice .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	37	And the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which He wrote for you , ye shall observe to do for evermore ; and ye shall not fear other gods .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	38	And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget , neither shall ye fear other gods .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	39	But the Lord your God ye shall fear , and He shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	40	However they did not hearken , but they did according to their former manner .
KJ21	2%20Kings	17	41	So these nations feared the Lord , and also served their graven images , both their children and their children ’ s children : as did their fathers , so do they unto this day .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	2	Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name also was Abi , the daughter of Zechariah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	18	And when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father did .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	4	He removed the high places , and broke the images , and cut down the Asherah poles , and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made ; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it ; and he called it Nehushtan .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	5	He trusted in the Lord God of Israel , so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor any who were before him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	6	For he cleaved to the Lord and departed not from following Him , but kept His commandments which the Lord commanded Moses .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	7	And the Lord was with him , and he prospered whithersoever he went forth ; and he rebelled against the king of Assyria and served him not .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	8	He smote the Philistines even unto Gaza and the borders thereof , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	9	And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it ;
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	10	and at the end of three years they took it . Even in the sixth year of Hezekiah , that is , the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	11	And the king of Assyria carried away Israel unto Assyria , and put them in Halah and in Habor by the River of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	12	because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God , but transgressed His covenant and all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded , and would not hear them nor do them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	13	Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah , Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	14	And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish , saying , “ I have offended . Turn away from me ; that which thou puttest on me will I bear. ” And the king of Assyria imposed upon Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	15	And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king ’ s house .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	16	At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	17	And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem . And they went up and came to Jerusalem . And when they had come up , they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool , which is in the highway of the Fuller ’ s Field .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	19	And Rabshakeh said unto them , “ Speak ye now to Hezekiah , ‘ Thus saith the great king , the king of Assyria : What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	20	Thou sayest ( but they are but vain words ) , “ I have counsel and strength for the war. ” Now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	21	Now , behold , thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man lean , it will go into his hand and pierce it . So is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all who trust in him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	22	But if ye say unto me , “ We trust in the Lord our God , ” is not that He , whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away , and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem , “ Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem ” ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	23	Now therefore , I pray thee , give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria , and I will deliver thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	24	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master ’ s servants , and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	25	Have I now come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it ? The Lord said to me , “ Go up against this land and destroy it. ” ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	26	Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , and Shebna and Joah , unto Rabshakeh , “ Speak , I pray thee , to thy servants in the Syrian language , for we understand it ; and talk not with us in the Jews ’ language in the ears of the people who are on the wall. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	27	But Rabshakeh said unto them , “ Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words ? Hath he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall , that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	28	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ’ language and spoke , saying , “ Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria !
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	29	Thus saith the king : ‘ Let not Hezekiah deceive you , for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand .
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	30	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , “ The Lord will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. ” ’
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	31	Hearken not to Hezekiah , for thus saith the king of Assyria : ‘ Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me ; and then eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyards , a land of oil olive and of honey , that ye may live and not die . And hearken not unto Hezekiah when he persuadeth you , saying , “ The Lord will deliver us. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	33	Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	34	Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ? Have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	35	Who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of mine hand , that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand ? ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	36	But the people held their peace and answered him not a word ; for the king ’ s commandment was , saying , “ Answer him not. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	18	37	Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder to Hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	2	And he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	19	Now therefore , O Lord our God , I beseech Thee , save Thou us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the Lord God , even Thou only. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	3	And they said unto him , “ Thus saith Hezekiah : ‘ This day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy ; for the children have come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	4	It may be the Lord thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God , and will reprove the words which the Lord thy God hath heard . Therefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant who are left. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	5	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	6	And Isaiah said unto them , “ Thus shall ye say to your master , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard , with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	7	Behold , I will send a blight upon him , and he shall hear a rumor and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	8	So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah , for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	9	And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , “ Behold , he has come out to fight against thee , ” he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	10	“ Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , ‘ Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , “ Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	11	Behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly . And shalt thou be delivered ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them whom my fathers have destroyed , as Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden who were in Thelasar ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	13	Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivah ? ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it ; and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	15	And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord , and said , “ O Lord God of Israel , who dwellest between the cherubims , Thou art the God , even Thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth . Thou hast made heaven and earth .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	16	Lord , bow down Thine ear , and hear ; open , Lord , Thine eyes , and see ; and hear the words of Sennacherib , who hath sent him to reproach the living God .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	17	Of a truth , Lord , the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	18	and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men ’ s hands , wood and stone . Therefore they have destroyed them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , “ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : ‘ That which thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. ’
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	21	This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning him : “ ‘ The virgin , the daughter of Zion , hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn ; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	22	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? Even against the Holy One of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	23	By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord , and hast said , “ With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains , to the sides of Lebanon , and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof , and the choice fir trees thereof ; and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders , and into the forest of his Carmel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	24	I have dug and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	25	“ ‘ Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? Now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	26	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power ; they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb , as the grass on the house tops and as corn blighted before it be grown up .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	27	“ ‘ But I know thy abode , and thy going out and thy coming in , and thy rage against Me .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	28	Because thy rage against Me and thy tumult is come up into Mine ears , therefore I will put My hook in thy nose , and My bridle in thy lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	29	“ ‘ And this shall be a sign unto thee : Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which springeth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye and reap , and plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	30	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	31	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of Mount Zion . The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this. ’
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	32	“ Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria : ‘ He shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a mound against it .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	33	By the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	34	‘ For I will defend this city to save it for Mine own sake , and for My servant David ’ s sake. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	35	And it came to pass that night , that the angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand ; and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed , and went and returned , and dwelt at Nineveh .
KJ21	2%20Kings	19	37	And it came to pass , as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer , his sons , smote him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	2	Then he turned his face to the wall , and prayed unto the Lord , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	20	And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and all his might , and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought water into the city , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	3	“ I beseech Thee , O Lord , remember now how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in Thy sight. ” And Hezekiah wept sorely .
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	4	And it came to pass , before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court , that the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	5	“ Turn back and tell Hezekiah the captain of My people , ‘ Thus saith the Lord , the God of David thy father : I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears ; behold , I will heal thee . On the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	6	And I will add unto thy days fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria . And I will defend this city for Mine own sake and for My servant David ’ s sake. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	7	And Isaiah said , “ Take a lump of figs. ” And they took and laid it on the boil , and he recovered .
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	8	And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah , “ What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me , and that I shall go up into the house of the Lord the third day ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	9	And Isaiah said , “ This sign shalt thou have of the Lord , that the Lord will do the thing that He hath spoken : Shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	10	And Hezekiah answered , “ It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees ; nay , but let the shadow return backward ten degrees. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	11	And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord ; and He brought the shadow ten degrees backward , by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz .
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	12	At that time Berodachbaladan , the son of Baladan king of Babylon , sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah , for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	13	And Hezekiah hearkened unto them , and showed them all the house of his precious things : the silver , and the gold , and the spices , and the precious ointment , and all the house of his armor , and all that was found in his treasuries . There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah showed them not .
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	14	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto King Hezekiah and said unto him , “ What said these men ? And from whence came they unto thee ? ” And Hezekiah said , “ They have come from a far country , even from Babylon. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	15	And he said , “ What have they seen in thine house ? ” And Hezekiah answered , “ All the things that are in mine house have they seen . There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	16	And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah , “ Hear the word of the Lord :
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	17	‘ Behold , the days come that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day , shall be carried into Babylon ; nothing shall be left , ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	18	‘ And of thy sons who shall issue from thee , whom thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	19	Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah , “ Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. ” And he said , “ Is it not good , if peace and truth be in my days ? ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	20	21	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers ; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	21	And he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the idols that his father served and worshiped them ;
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	3	For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars for Baal and made an Asherah pole , as did Ahab king of Israel , and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	4	And he built altars in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord said , “ In Jerusalem will I put My name. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	6	And he made his son pass through the fire , and observed omens , and used enchantments , and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards . He wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord , to provoke Him to anger .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	7	And he set a graven image of the Asherah pole that he had made in the house , of which the Lord said to David and to Solomon his son , “ In this house and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel , will I put My name for ever .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	8	Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers , only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	9	But they hearkened not , and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	10	And the Lord spoke by his servants the prophets , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	11	“ Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations , and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did who were before him , and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	12	therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel : Behold , I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah that whosoever heareth of it , both of his ears shall tingle .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab ; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish , wiping it and turning it upside down .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	14	And I will forsake the remnant of Mine inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	15	because they have done that which was evil in My sight and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even unto this day. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	16	Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much , till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another , besides his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	18	And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza ; and Amon his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	19	Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Meshullemeth , the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	20	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as his father Manasseh did .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	22	and he forsook the Lord God of his fathers , and walked not in the way of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	23	And the servants of Amon conspired against him , and slew the king in his own house .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	24	And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against King Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	21	26	And he was buried in his sepulcher in the garden of Uzza ; and Josiah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	22	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Jedidah , the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	3	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of King Josiah that the king sent Shaphan the scribe , the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam , to the house of the Lord , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	4	“ Go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may count the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the keepers of the door have gathered from the people .
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	5	And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work , who have the oversight of the house of the Lord ; and let them give it to the doers of the work who are in the house of the Lord to repair the breaches of the house —
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	6	unto carpenters and builders and masons — and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house .
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	7	However there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand , because they dealt faithfully. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	8	And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe , “ I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord. ” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	9	And Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again and said , “ Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of those who do the work , who have the oversight of the house of the Lord. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	10	And Shaphan the scribe showed the king , saying , “ Hilkiah the priest hath delivered to me a book. ” And Shaphan read it before the king .
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	11	And it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the Book of the Law , that he rent his clothes .
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	12	And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Michaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	13	“ Go ye , inquire of the Lord for me , and for the people and for all Judah , concerning the words of this book that is found ; for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us , because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book , to do according unto all that which is written concerning us. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	14	So Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asaiah went unto Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college ) , and they communed with her .
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	15	And she said unto them , “ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : Tell the man who sent you to me ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	16	‘ Thus saith the Lord : Behold , I will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	17	because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands . Therefore My wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched. ’
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	18	But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard :
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	19	Because thine heart was tender , and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord when thou heardest what I spoke against this place and against the inhabitants thereof , that they should become a desolation and a curse , and hast rent thy clothes and wept before Me , I also have heard thee , saith the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	22	20	Behold therefore , I will gather thee unto thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace ; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. ’ ” And they brought the king word again .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	2	And the king went up into the house of the Lord , and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him , and the priests and the prophets and all the people , both small and great ; and he read in their ears all the words of the Book of the Covenant which was found in the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	23	but in the eighteenth year of King Josiah wherein this Passover was held to the Lord in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	3	And the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the Lord , to walk after the Lord and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul , to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book . And all the people stood to the covenant .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	4	And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest , and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door , to bring forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal and for the Asherah pole and for all the host of heaven ; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron , and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	5	And he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places round about Jerusalem , those also who burned incense unto Baal , to the sun and to the moon and to the planets , and to all the host of heaven .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	6	And he brought out the Asherah pole from the house of the Lord outside Jerusalem unto the Brook Kidron , and burned it at the Brook Kidron , and stamped it small to powder , and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	7	And he broke down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the Lord , where the women wove hangings for the Asherah pole .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	8	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah , and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from Geba to Beersheba , and broke down the high places of the gates that were in the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city , which were on a man ’ s left hand at the gate of the city .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	9	Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem , but they ate of the unleavened bread among their brethren .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	10	And he defiled Topheth , which is in the Valley of the Children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	11	And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun , at the entrance to the house of the Lord by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain , which was in the suburbs , and burned the chariots of the sun with fire .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	12	And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz , which the kings of Judah had made , and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , did the king beat down and broke them down from thence , and cast the dust of them into the Brook Kidron .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	13	And the high places that were before Jerusalem , which were on the right hand of the Mount of Corruption , which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians , and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites , and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon , did the king defile .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	14	And he broke in pieces the images , and cut down the Asherah poles , and filled their places with the bones of men .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	15	Moreover the altar that was at Bethel , and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , had made , both that altar and the high place he broke down , and burned the high place and stamped it small to powder and burned the Asherah pole .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	16	And as Josiah turned , he spied the sepulchers that were there on the mount , and sent and took the bones out of the sepulchers and burned them upon the altar , and polluted it according to the word of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these words .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	17	Then he said , “ What marker is that which I see ? ” And the men of the city told him , “ It is the sepulcher of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	18	And he said , “ Let him alone ; let no man move his bones. ” So they let his bones alone , with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	19	And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria , which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger , Josiah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	20	And he slew all the priests of the high places who were there upon the altars and burned men ’ s bones upon them , and returned to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	21	And the king commanded all the people , saying , “ Keep the Passover unto the Lord your God , as it is written in the Book of this Covenant. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	22	Surely there was not held such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel nor of the kings of Judah ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	24	Moreover the workers with familiar spirits and the wizards , and the images and the idols , and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem did Josiah put away , that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	25	And like unto him was there no king before him , who turned to the Lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might , according to all the Law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	26	Notwithstanding , the Lord turned not from the fierceness of His great wrath , wherewith His anger was kindled against Judah because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	27	And the Lord said , “ I will remove Judah also out of My sight , as I have removed Israel , and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen and the house of which I said , ‘ My name shall be there. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	29	In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up together with the king of Assyria to the River Euphrates ; and King Josiah went against him . And Pharaohnechoh slew Josiah at Megiddo when he had seen him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	30	And his servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo , and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulcher . And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him , and made him king in his father ’ s stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	31	Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	32	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his fathers had done .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	33	And Pharaohnechoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem , and put the land under a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	34	And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the stead of Josiah his father , and turned his name to Jehoiakim , and took Jehoahaz away ; and he came to Egypt and died there .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	35	And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh , but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh . He exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land , from every one according to his taxation , to give it unto Pharaohnechoh .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	36	Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Zebudah , the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	23	37	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his fathers had done .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	2	And the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldeans , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of the Lord which He spoke by His servants the prophets .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	24	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up , and Jehoiakim became his servant three years . Then he turned and rebelled against him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	3	Surely at the commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah , to remove them out of His sight for the sins of Manasseh , according to all that he did ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	4	and also for the innocent blood that he shed ; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood , which the Lord would not pardon .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers , and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	7	And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land , for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the River Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem three months . And his mother ’ s name was Nehushta , the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father had done .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem , and the city was besieged .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	11	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city , and his servants besieged it .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	12	And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he and his mother , and his servants and his princes and his officers ; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	14	And he carried away all Jerusalem , and all the princes , and all the mighty men of valor , even ten thousand captives , and all the craftsmen and smiths . None remained , save the poorest sort of the people of the land .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	15	And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon , and the king ’ s mother , and the king ’ s wives , and his officers , and the mighty of the land : those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	16	And all the men of might , even seven thousand , and craftsmen and smiths , a thousand , all who were strong and apt for war , even these the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	17	And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father ’ s brother king in his stead , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	18	Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	19	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
KJ21	2%20Kings	24	20	For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , until He had cast them out from His presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	2	And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of King Zedekiah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	25	But it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , came and ten men with him , and smote Gedaliah so that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	3	And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city , and there was no bread for the people of the land .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	4	And the city was broken up , and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls , which is by the king ’ s garden ( now the Chaldeans were against the city round about ) ; and the king went the way toward the plain .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	5	And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho , and all his army were scattered from him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	6	So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah , and they gave judgment upon him .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	7	And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him with fetters of brass and carried him to Babylon .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	8	And in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which is the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan , captain of the guard , a servant of the king of Babylon , unto Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	9	And he burned the house of the Lord , and the king ’ s house , and all the houses of Jerusalem , and every great man ’ s house burned he with fire .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	10	And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	11	Now the rest of the people who were left in the city and the fugitives who fell away to the king of Babylon , with the remnant of the multitude , did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	12	But the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	13	And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the brass of them to Babylon .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	14	And the pots , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	15	And the firepans and the bowls , and such things as were of gold , all gold , and of silver , all silver , the captain of the guard took away .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	16	The two pillars , one sea , and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord , the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	17	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits , and the capital upon it was brass ; and the height of the capital was three cubits , and the wreathen work and pomegranates upon the capital round about , all of brass ; and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	18	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	19	And out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war , and five men of those who were in the king ’ s presence who were found in the city , and the principal scribe of the host who mustered the people of the land , and threescore men of the people of the land who were found in the city ;
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	20	and Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	21	And the king of Babylon smote them , and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath . So Judah was carried away out of their land .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	22	And as for the people who remained in the land of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , ruler .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	23	And when all the captains of the armies , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor , there came to Gedaliah at Mizpah even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan the son of Careah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	24	And Gedaliah swore to them and to their men , and said unto them , “ Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldeans . Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you. ”
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	26	And all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the armies , arose and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	27	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , that Evilmerodach king of Babylon , in the year that he began to reign , lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison .
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	28	And he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon ,
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	29	and changed his prison garments . And he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life ;
KJ21	2%20Kings	25	30	and his allowance was a continual allowance given him from the king , a daily rate for every day , all the days of his life .

KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	2	And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	3	And the battle went sorely against Saul ; and the archers hit him , and he was wounded by the archers .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	4	Then said Saul to his armorbearer , “ Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith , lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. ” But his armorbearer would not , for he was sore afraid . So Saul took a sword and fell upon it .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	5	And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead , he fell likewise on the sword and died .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	6	So Saul died , and his three sons , and all his house died together .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	7	And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , then they forsook their cities and fled ; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	8	And it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	9	And when they had stripped him , they took his head and his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about to carry tidings unto their idols and to the people .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	11	And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	12	they arose , all the valiant men , and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	13	So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the Lord , even against the word of the Lord which he kept not , and also for asking counsel of one who had a familiar spirit , to inquire of it .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	10	14	And he inquired not of the Lord . Therefore He slew him , and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	11	And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had : Jashobeam , a Hachmonite , the chief of the captains ; he lifted up his spear against three hundred , slain by him at one time .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	2	And moreover in times past , even when Saul was king , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel ; and the Lord thy God said unto thee , ‘ Thou shalt feed My people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over My people Israel. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	3	Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king at Hebron , and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord . And they anointed David king over Israel , according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Samuel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	4	And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem , which is Jebus , where the Jebusites were , the inhabitants of the land .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	5	And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David , “ Thou shalt not come hither. ” Nevertheless David took the citadel of Zion , which is the City of David .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	6	And David said , “ Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. ” So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up , and was chief .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	7	And David dwelt in the citadel ; therefore they called it the City of David [ that is , Zion ] .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	8	And he built the city round about , even from Millo round about ; and Joab repaired the rest of the city .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	9	So David waxed greater and greater ; for the Lord of hosts was with him .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	10	These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who held strongly with him in his kingdom , and with all Israel , to make him king according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	12	And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo , the Ahohite , who was one of the three mighty men .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	13	He was with David at Pasdammim . And there the Philistines were gathered together for battle , where there was a parcel of ground full of barley . And the people fled from before the Philistines .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	14	And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel , and delivered it , and slew the Philistines ; and the Lord saved them by a great deliverance .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	15	Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Rephaim .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	16	And David was then in his hideout , and the Philistines ’ garrison was then at Bethlehem .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	17	And David longed and said , “ Oh that one would give me a drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem that is at the gate ! ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	18	And the three broke through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate , and took it and brought it to David . But David would not drink of it , but poured it out to the Lord
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	19	and said , “ My God forbid me that I should do this thing ! Shall I drink the blood of these men , who have put their lives in jeopardy ? For with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. ” Therefore he would not drink it . These things did these three mightiest .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	20	And Abishai the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spear against three hundred , he slew them , and had a name among the three .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	21	Of the three , he was more honorable than the two , for he was their captain ; however he attained not to the first three .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	22	Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done many acts : he slew two lionlike men of Moab ; also he went down and slew a lion in a pit on a snowy day .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	23	And he slew an Egyptian , a man of great stature , five cubits high . And in the Egyptian ’ s hand was a spear like a weaver ’ s beam ; and he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian ’ s hand , and slew him with his own spear .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	24	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and had a name among the three mighties .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	11	25	Behold , he was honorable among the thirty , but attained not to the first three ; and David set him over his guard .

KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	23	And these are the numbers of the armed groups ready for war , and came to David at Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul to him , according to the word of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	24	The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred , ready , armed for the war .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	25	Of the children of Simeon , mighty men of valor for the war , seven thousand and one hundred .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	26	Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	27	And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites , and with him were three thousand and seven hundred ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	28	and Zadok , a young man mighty of valor , and from his father ’ s house twenty and two captains .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	29	And of the children of Benjamin , the kindred of Saul , three thousand ; for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the watch of the house of Saul .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	30	And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred , mighty men of valor , famous throughout the house of their fathers .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	31	And of the halftribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand , who were expressed by name to come and make David king .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	32	And of the children of Issachar , who were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their brethren were at their command .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	33	Of Zebulun , such as went forth to battle , expert in war with all instruments of war , fifty thousand who could keep rank ; they were not of double heart .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	34	And of Naphtali a thousand captains , and with them with shield and spear , thirty and seven thousand .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	35	And of the Danites , expert in war , twenty and eight thousand and six hundred .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	36	And of Asher , such as went forth to battle , expert in war , forty thousand .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	37	And on the other side of the Jordan , of the Reubenites and the Gadites , and of the halftribe of Manasseh , with all manner of instruments of war for the battle , a hundred and twenty thousand .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	38	All these men of war , who could keep rank , came with a perfect heart to Hebron to make David king over all Israel ; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	39	And there they were with David three days , eating and drinking , for their brethren had prepared for them .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	12	40	Moreover those who were nigh to them , even as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali , brought bread on asses , and on camels , and on mules , and on oxen , and meat , meal , cakes of figs , and bunches of raisins , and wine , and oil , and oxen , and sheep abundantly ; for there was joy in Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	13	So David brought not the ark home with him to the City of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	2	And David said unto all the congregation of Israel , “ If it seem good unto you , and if it be of the Lord our God , let us send abroad unto our brethren everywhere who are left in all the land of Israel , and with them also to the priests and Levites who are in their cities and suburbs , that they may gather themselves unto us .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	3	And let us bring back the ark of our God to us , for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	4	And all the congregation said that they would do so , for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	5	So David gathered all Israel together from Shihor of Egypt , even unto the entrance of Hemath , to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	6	And David went up , and all Israel , to Baalah , that is , to Kirjathjearim , which belonged to Judah , to bring up from thence the ark of God the Lord , who dwelleth between the cherubims , whose name is called on it .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	7	And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab ; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	8	And David and all Israel played before God with all their might , and with singing and with harps , and with psalteries and with timbrels , and with cymbals and with trumpets .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	9	And when they came unto the threshing floor of Chidon , Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark , for the oxen stumbled .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	10	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzza , and He smote him because he put his hand to the ark ; and there he died before God .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	11	And David was displeased , because the Lord had broken forth upon Uzza . Therefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	12	And David was afraid of God that day , saying , “ How shall I bring the ark of God home to me ? ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	13	14	And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months . And the Lord blessed the house of Obededom and all that he had .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	14	Therefore David inquired again of God , and God said unto him , “ Go not up after them ; turn away from them and come upon them opposite the mulberry trees .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	2	And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel , for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of His people Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	3	And David took more wives at Jerusalem ; and David begot more sons and daughters .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	4	Now these are the names of his children whom he had in Jerusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	5	and Ibhar , and Elishua , and Elpelet ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	6	and Nogah , and Nepheg , and Japhia ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	7	and Elishama , and Beeliada , and Eliphelet .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	8	And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David . And David heard of it and went out against them .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	9	And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the Valley of Rephaim .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	10	And David inquired of God , saying , “ Shall I go up against the Philistines ? And wilt Thou deliver them into mine hand ? ” And the Lord said unto him , “ Go up ; for I will deliver them into thine hand. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	11	So they came up to Baalperazim , and David smote them there . Then David said , “ God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters. ” Therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim [ that is , A place of breaches ] .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	12	And when they had left their gods there , David gave a commandment , and they were burned with fire .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	13	And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	15	And it shall be , when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt go out to battle ; for God has gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	16	David therefore did as God commanded him ; and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	14	17	And the fame of David went out into all lands , and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	15	And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	2	Then David said , “ None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites , for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God and to minister unto Him for ever. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	3	And David gathered all Israel together at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord unto his place , which he had prepared for it .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	4	And David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites :
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	5	of the sons of Kohath , Uriel the chief , and his brethren a hundred and twenty ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	6	of the sons of Merari , Asaiah the chief , and his brethren two hundred and twenty ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	7	of the sons of Gershom , Joel the chief , and his brethren a hundred and thirty ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	8	of the sons of Elizaphan , Shemaiah the chief , and his brethren two hundred ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	9	of the sons of Hebron , Eliel the chief , and his brethren fourscore ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	10	of the sons of Uzziel , Amminadab the chief , and his brethren a hundred and twelve .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	11	And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests , and for the Levites , for Uriel , Asaiah , and Joel , Shemaiah , and Eliel , and Amminadab ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	12	and said unto them , “ Ye are the chiefs of the fathers of the Levites . Sanctify yourselves , both ye and your brethren , that ye may bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	13	For because ye did it not at the first , the Lord our God broke forth upon us , for we sought Him not after the due order. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	14	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	16	And David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music : psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	17	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brethren , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brethren , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	18	and with them their brethren of the second degree : Zechariah , Ben , and Jaaziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , Eliab , and Benaiah , and Maaseiah , and Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and Mikneiah , and Obededom , and Jeiel , the doorkeepers .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	19	So the singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	20	and Zechariah , and Aziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , and Eliab , and Maaseiah , and Benaiah , with psalteries on Alamoth ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	21	and Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and Mikneiah , and Obededom , and Jeiel , and zaziah with harps on the Sheminith to lead .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	22	And Chenaniah , chief of the Levites , was for song ; he instructed about the song , ecause he was skillful .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	23	And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	24	And Shebaniah , and Jehoshaphat , and Nethaneel , and Amasai , and Zechariah , nd Benaiah , and Eliezer , the priests , blew with the trumpets before the ark of God ; and bededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	25	So David and the elders of Israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obededom with joy .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	26	And it came to pass , when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord , that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	27	And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites who bore the ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers ; David also had upon him an ephod of linen .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	28	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpets and with cymbals , making a noise with psalteries and harps .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	15	29	And it came to pass , as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the City of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul , looking out of a window , saw King David dancing and playing ; and she despised him in her heart .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	16	even of the covenant which He made with Abraham , and of His oath unto Isaac ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	2	And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	3	And he dealt to every one of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	4	And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord , and to call to remembrance and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel :
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	5	Asaph the chief , and next to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obededom ; and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps , but Asaph made a sound with cymbals ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	6	Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	7	Then on that day David delivered first this psalm , to thank the Lord , into the hand of Asaph and his brethren :
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	8	Give thanks unto the Lord , call upon His name ; make known His deeds among the people .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	9	Sing unto Him , sing psalms unto Him ; talk ye of all His wondrous works .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	10	Glory ye in His holy name ; let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	11	Seek the Lord and His strength ; seek His face continually .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	12	Remember His marvelous works that He hath done , His wonders and the judgments of His mouth ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	13	O ye seed of Israel His servant , ye children of Jacob , His chosen ones !
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	14	He is the Lord our God ; His judgments are in all the earth .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	15	Be ye mindful always of His covenant , the word which He commanded to a thousand generations ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	17	and hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law , and to Israel for an everlasting covenant ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	18	saying , “ Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan , the lot of your inheritance , ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	19	when ye were but few , even a few , and strangers in it .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	20	And when they went from nation to nation , and from one kingdom to another people ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	21	He suffered no man do them wrong ; yea , He reproved kings for their sakes ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	22	saying , “ Touch not Mine anointed , and do My prophets no harm. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	23	Sing unto the Lord , all the earth ; show forth from day to day His salvation .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	24	Declare His glory among the heathen , His marvelous works among all nations .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	25	For great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised ; He also is to be feared above all gods .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	26	For all the gods of the people are idols ; but the Lord made the heavens .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	27	Glory and honor are in His presence ; strength and gladness are in His place .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	28	Give unto the Lord , ye kindreds of the people , give unto the Lord glory and strength .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	29	Give unto the Lord the glory due unto His name ; bring an offering , and come before Him ; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	30	Fear before Him , all the earth ! The world also shall be stable , that it be not moved .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	31	Let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice ; and let men say among the nations , “ The Lord reigneth. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	32	Let the sea roar , and the fullness thereof ; let the fields rejoice , and all that is therein .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	33	Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord , because He cometh to judge the earth .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	34	O give thanks unto the Lord , for He is good ; for His mercy endureth for ever .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	35	And say ye , “ Save us , O God of our salvation , and gather us together , and deliver us from the heathen , that we may give thanks to Thy holy name , and glory in Thy praise. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	36	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for ever and ever ! And all the people said , “ Amen , ” and praised the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	37	So he left there Asaph and his brethren before the ark of the covenant of the Lord to minister before the ark continually , as every day ’ s workrequired ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	38	and Obededom with their brethren , threescore and eight ; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah , to be doorkeepers ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	39	and Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests , before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	40	to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the Law of the Lord , which He commanded Israel ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	41	and with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the Lord because His mercy endureth for ever ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	42	and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those who should make a sound , and with musical instruments of God . And the sons of Jeduthun were for the gate .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	16	43	And all the people departed , every man to his house ; and David returned to bless his house .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	17	And yet this was a small thing in Thine eyes , O God ; for Thou hast also spoken of Thy servant ’ s house for a great while to come , and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , O Lord God .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	2	Then Nathan said unto David , “ Do all that is in thine heart , for God is with thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	3	And it came to pass the same night that the word of God came to Nathan , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	4	“ Go and tell David My servant , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Thou shalt not build Me a house to dwell in ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	5	for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tabernacle to another .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	6	Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel , spoke I a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to feed My people , saying , “ Why have ye not built Me a house of cedars ? ” ’
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	7	Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto My servant David , ‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : I took thee from the sheepcote , even from following the sheep , that thou shouldest be ruler over My people Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	8	And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men who are on the earth .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	9	Also I will ordain a place for My people Israel , and will plant them , and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more ; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more , as at the beginning
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	10	and since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel . Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies . Furthermore I tell thee that the Lord will build thee a house .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	11	And it shall come to pass , when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers , that I will raise up thy seed after thee , who shall be of thy sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	12	He shall build Me a house , and I will establish his throne for ever .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	13	I will be his Father , and he shall be My son ; and I will not take My mercy away from him , as I took it from him that was before thee .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	14	But I will settle him in Mine house and in My kingdom for ever ; and his throne shall be established for evermore. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	15	According to all these words and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speak unto David .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	16	And David the king came and sat before the Lord and said , “ Who am I , O Lord God , and what is mine house , that Thou hast brought me hitherto ?
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	18	What can David speak more to Thee for the honor of Thy servant ? For Thou knowest Thy servant .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	19	O Lord , for Thy servant ’ s sake and according to Thine own heart hast Thou done all this greatness , in making known all these great things .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	20	O Lord , there is none like Thee , neither is there any God besides Thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	21	And what one nation on the earth is like Thy people Israel , whom God went to redeem to be His own people , to make Thee a name of greatness and fearsomeness by driving out nations from before Thy people , whom Thou hast redeemed out of Egypt ?
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	22	For Thy people Israel didst Thou make Thine own people for ever ; and Thou , Lord , becamest their God .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	23	Therefore now , Lord , let the thing that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever , and do as Thou hast said .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	24	Let it even be established , that Thy name may be magnified for ever , saying , ‘ The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel , even a God to Israel ; and let the house of David Thy servant be established before Thee. ’
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	25	For Thou , O my God , hast told Thy servant that Thou wilt build him a house ; therefore Thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before Thee .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	26	And now , Lord , Thou art God , and hast promised this goodness unto Thy servant .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	17	27	Now therefore let it please Thee to bless the house of Thy servant , that it may be before Thee for ever ; for Thou blessest , O Lord , and it shall be blessed for ever . ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	18	Now after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines and subdued them , and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	2	And he smote Moab , and the Moabites became David ’ s servants and brought gifts .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	3	And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah toward Hamath , as he went to establish his dominion by the River Euphrates .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	4	And David took from him a thousand chariots , and seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen . David also hamstrung all the chariot horses , but reserved enough of them for a hundred chariots .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	6	Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus ; and the Syrians became David ’ s servants , and brought gifts . Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	8	Likewise from Tibhath and from Chun , cities of Hadadezer , David brought very much brass , wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	9	Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer king of Zobah ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	10	he sent Hadoram his son to King David to inquire of his welfare and to congratulate him , because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him ( for Hadadezer had wars with Tou ) ; and he sent with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	11	These also King David dedicated unto the Lord , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations — from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	12	Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	13	And he put garrisons in Edom , and all the Edomites became David ’ s servants . Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	14	So David reigned over all Israel , and executed judgment and justice among all his people .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	15	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army , and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud , recorder .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	16	And Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	18	17	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and the sons of David were chief about the king .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	19	And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they made peace with David and became his servants ; neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	2	And David said , “ I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash , because his father showed kindness to me. ” And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father . So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun to comfort him .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	3	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun , “ Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father , that he hath sent comforters unto thee ? Are not his servants come unto thee to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land ? ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	4	Therefore Hanun took David ’ s servants and shaved them , and cut off their garments in the middle by their buttocks , and sent them away .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	5	Then went certain ones and told David how the men were served . And he sent to meet them , for the men were greatly ashamed . And the king said , “ Tarry at Jericho until your beards have grown , and then return. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David , Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia and from Syriamaachah and from Zobah .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	7	So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots , and the king of Maachah and his people , who came and pitched camp before Medeba . And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battle .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	8	And when David heard of it , he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	9	And the children of Ammon came out and assembled in battle array before the gate of the city , and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	10	Now when Joab saw that the battle line was formed against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	11	And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother , and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	12	And he said , “ If the Syrians are too strong for me , then thou shalt help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for thee , then I will help thee .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	13	Be of good courage , and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people and for the cities of our God ; and let the Lord do that which is good in His sight. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	14	So Joab and the people who were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle , and they fled before him .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	15	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . Then Joab came to Jerusalem .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	16	And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the river ; and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadadezer went before them .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	17	And it was told to David ; and he gathered all Israel , and passed over the Jordan and came upon them , and set the battle in array against them . So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians , they fought with him .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	19	18	But the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men who fought in chariots and forty thousand footmen , and killed Shophach the captain of the host .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	20	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	20	20	And it came to pass after the year had expired , at the time that kings go out to battle , that Joab led forth the power of the army and laid waste the country of the children of Ammon , and came and besieged Rabbah . But David tarried at Jerusalem . And Joab smote Rabbah and destroyed it .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	20	2	And David took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it ; and it was set upon David ’ s head . And he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	20	3	And he brought out the people who were in it , and cut them with saws and with harrows of iron and with axes . Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon . And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	20	4	And it came to pass after this that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines , at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai , who was one of the children of the giant ; and they were subdued .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	20	5	And there was war again with the Philistines ; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi , the brother of Goliath the Gittite , whose spear staff was like a weaver ’ s beam .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	20	6	And yet again there was war at Gath , where was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were four and twenty , six on each hand and six on each foot ; and he also was the son of the giant .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	20	7	But when he defied Israel , Jonathan the son of Shimea , David ’ s brother , slew him .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	20	8	These were born unto the giant in Gath , and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	21	And as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out from the threshing floor and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	2	And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people , “ Go , number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan , and bring the number of them to me , that I may know it. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	3	And Joab answered , “ The Lord make His people a hundred times more than they are . But , my lord the king , are they not all my lord ’ s servants ? Why then doth my lord require this thing ? Why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel ? ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	4	Nevertheless the king ’ s word prevailed against Joab . Therefore Joab departed , and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	5	And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David . And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men who drew the sword , and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men who drew the sword .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	6	But Levi and Benjamin he counted not among them , for the king ’ s word was abominable to Joab .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	7	And God was displeased with this thing ; therefore He smote Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	8	And David said unto God , “ I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing . But now , I beseech Thee , do away with the iniquity of Thy servant , for I have done very foolishly. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	9	And the Lord spoke unto Gad , David ’ s seer , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	10	“ Go and tell David , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : I offer thee three things . Choose thee one of them , that I may do it unto thee. ’ ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	11	So Gad came to David , and said unto him , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Choose thee
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	12	either three years ’ famine ; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee ; or else three days the sword of the Lord , even the pestilence in the land and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. ’ Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring back to Him that sent me. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	14	So the Lord sent pestilence upon Israel , and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	15	And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it ; and as he was destroying , the Lord beheld , and He repented of the evil , and said to the angel who destroyed , “ It is enough . Stay now thine hand. ” And the angel of the Lord stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	16	And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord standing between the earth and the heaven , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . Then David and the elders of Israel , who were clothed in sackcloth , fell upon their faces .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	17	And David said unto God , “ Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered ? Even I it is who have sinned and done evil indeed ; but as for these sheep , what have they done ? Let Thine hand , I pray Thee , O Lord my God , be on me and on my father ’ s house , but not on Thy people , that they should be plagued. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	18	Then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and set up an altar unto the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	19	And David went up at the saying of Gad , which he spoke in the name of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	20	And Ornan turned back and saw the angel , and his four sons with him hid themselves . Now Ornan was threshing wheat .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	22	Then David said to Ornan , “ Grant me the place of this threshing floor , that I may uild an altar therein unto the Lord . Thou shalt grant it to me for the full price , that the plague ay be stayed from the people. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	23	And Ornan said unto David , “ Take it to thee , and let my lord the king do that hich is good in his eyes . Lo , I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings , and the threshing nstruments for wood , and the wheat for the meat offering ; I give it all. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	24	And King David said to Ornan , “ Nay , but I will verily buy it for the full price ; for will not take that which is thine for the Lord , nor offer burnt offerings without cost. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	25	So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	26	And David built there an altar unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called upon the Lord ; and He answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	27	And the Lord commanded the angel , and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	28	At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite , then he sacrificed there .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	29	For the tabernacle of the Lord , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season at the high place at Gibeon .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	21	30	But David could not go before it to inquire of God , for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	22	Then David said , “ This is the house of the Lord God , and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	2	And David commanded to gather together the strangers who were in the land of Israel , and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	3	And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the joinings , and brass in abundance beyond measure ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	4	also cedar trees in abundance ; for the Sidonians and those of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	5	And David said , “ Solomon my son is young and tender , and the house that is to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent , of fame and of glory throughout all countries . I will therefore now make preparation for it. ” So David prepared abundantly before his death .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	6	Then he called for Solomon his son , and charged him to build a house for the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	7	And David said to Solomon , “ My son , as for me , it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	8	But the word of the Lord came to me , saying , ‘ Thou hast shed blood abundantly , and hast made great wars . Thou shalt not build a house unto My name , because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in My sight .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	9	Behold , a son shall be born to thee , who shall be a man of rest . And I will give him rest from all his enemies round about ; for his name shall be Solomon [ that is , Peaceable ] , and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	10	He shall build a house for My name , and he shall be My son , and I will be his Father ; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. ’
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	11	Now , my son , the Lord be with thee ; and prosper thou , and build the house of the Lord thy God , as He hath said of thee .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	12	Only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding , and give thee charge concerning Israel , that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord thy God .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	13	Then shalt thou prosper , if thou takest heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning Israel . Be strong and of good courage ; dread not , nor be dismayed .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	14	Now behold , in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold , and a thousand thousand talents of silver , and of brass and iron beyond measure , for it is in abundance . Timber also and stone have I prepared , and thou mayest add thereto .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	15	Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance : hewers and workers of stone and timber , and all manner of skillful men for every manner of work .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	16	Of the gold , the silver and the brass and the iron , there is no number . Arise therefore and be doing , and the Lord be with thee. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	17	David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son , saying ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	18	“ Is not the Lord your God with you ? And hath He not given you rest on every side ? For He hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand , and the land is subdued before the Lord and before His people . ]
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	22	19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God . Arise therefore , and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God , to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord . ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	23	The sons of Mushi : Mahli , and Eder , and Jeremoth , three .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	2	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel , with the priests and the Levites .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	3	Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward ; and their number by their head count , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	4	of whom twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of the Lord , and six thousand were officers and judges .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	5	Moreover four thousand were doorkeepers , and four thousand praised the Lord with the instruments “ which I made , ” said David , “ to praise therewith. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	6	And David divided them into divisions among the sons of Levi , namely , Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	7	Of the Gershonites were Laadan and Shimei .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	8	The sons of Laadan : the chief was Jehiel , and Zetham , and Joel , three .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	9	The sons of Shimei : Shelomith , and Haziel , and Haran , three . These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	10	And the sons of Shimei were Jahath , Zina , and Jeush , and Beriah . These four were the sons of Shimei .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	11	And Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second ; but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons ; therefore they were in one reckoning , according to their father ’ s house .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	12	The sons of Kohath : Amram , Izhar , Hebron , and Uzziel , four .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	13	The sons of Amram : Aaron and Moses ; and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons for ever , to burn incense before the Lord , to minister unto Him , and to bless in His name for ever .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	14	Now concerning Moses the man of God , his sons were named of the tribe of Levi .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	15	The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	16	Of the sons of Gershom , Shebuel was the chief .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	17	And the son of Eliezer was Rehabiah , the chief . And Eliezer had no other sons , but the sons of Rehabiah were very many .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	18	Of the sons of Izhar , Shelomith was the chief .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	19	Of the sons of Hebron : Jeriah the first , Amariah the second , Jahaziel the third , and Jekameam the fourth .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	20	Of the sons of Uzziel : Micah the first , and Jesiah the second .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	21	The sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . The sons of Mahli : Eleazar and Kish .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	22	And Eleazar died and had no sons , but daughters ; and their brethren the sons of Kish took them as wives .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	24	These were the sons of Levi according to the house of their fathers , even the chief of the fathers , as they were counted by number of names by their heads , who did the work for the service of the house of the Lord , from the age of twenty years and upward .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	25	For David said , “ The Lord God of Israel hath given rest unto His people , that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever ” ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	26	and also unto the Levites , “ They shall no more carry the tabernacle , nor any vessels of it for the service thereof. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	27	For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	28	because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord in the courts and in the chambers , and in the purifying of all holy things , and the work of the service of the house of God ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	29	both for the showbread and for the fine flour for meat offering , and for the unleavened cakes and for that which is baked in the pan and for that which is fried , and for all manner of measure and size ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	30	and to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord , and likewise at evening ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	31	and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the Lord on the Sabbaths , on the new moons , and on the set feasts , by number according to the order commanded unto them , continually before the Lord ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	23	32	and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the charge of the holy place , and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren in the service of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	24	Of the sons of Uzziel , Michah ; of the sons of Michah , Shamir .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children ; therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest ’ s office .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	3	And David assigned them , both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , according to their offices in their service .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	4	And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar , and thus were they divided . Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers , and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	5	Thus were they divided by lot , one sort with another , for the governors of the sanctuary and governors of the house of God were of the sons of Eleazar and of the sons of Ithamar .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	6	And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe , one of the Levites , wrote them in the presence of the king and the princes , and Zadok the priest , and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites : one principal household being taken for Eleazar and one taken for Ithamar .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	7	Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib , the second to Jedaiah ,

KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	19	These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the Lord , according to their manner under Aaron their father , as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	20	And the rest of the sons of Levi were these : of the sons of Amram , Shubael ; of the sons of Shubael , Jehdeiah .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	21	Concerning Rehabiah , of the sons of Rehabiah , the first was Isshiah .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	22	Of the Izharites , Shelomoth ; of the sons of Shelomoth , Jahath .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	23	And the sons of Hebron , Jeriah the first , Amariah the second , Jahaziel the third , Jekameam the fourth .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	25	The brother of Michah was Isshiah ; of the sons of Isshiah , Zechariah .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	26	The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi : the son of Jaaziah , Beno .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	27	The sons of Merari by Jaaziah : Beno , and Shoham , and Zaccur , and Ibri .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	28	Of Mahli came Eleazar , who had no sons .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	29	Concerning Kish : the son of Kish was Jerahmeel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	30	The sons also of Mushi ; Mahli , and Eder , and Jerimoth . These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	24	31	These likewise cast lots even as their brethren the sons of Aaron , in the presence of David the king , and Zadok , and Ahimelech , and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites ; even the principal fathers did as their younger brethren .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	25	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	25	25	the eighteenth to Hanani : he , his sons , and his brethren were twelve ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	25	2	of the sons of Asaph : Zaccur , and Joseph , and Nethaniah , and Asarelah ; the sons of Asaph were under the hand of Asaph , who prophesied according to the order of the king .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	25	3	Of Jeduthun , the sons of Jeduthun : Gedaliah , and Zeri , and Jeshaiah , Hashabiah , and Mattithiah [ with Shimei , mentioned ] , six , under the hand of their father Jeduthun , who prophesied with a harp to give thanks and to praise the Lord .

KJ21	1%20Chronicles	25	5	All these were the sons of Heman the king ’ s seer in the matters of God , to lift up the horn . And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	25	6	All these were under the hand of their father for song in the house of the Lord with cymbals , psalteries and harps , for the service of the house of God , according to the king ’ s order to Asaph , Jeduthun , and Heman .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	25	7	So the number of them , with their brethren who were instructed in the songs of the Lord , even all who were skilled , was two hundred fourscore and eight .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	25	8	And they cast lots , watch against watch , the small as well as the great , the teacher as the scholar .

KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	3	But God said unto me , ‘ Thou shalt not build a house for My name , because thou hast been a man of war and hast shed blood. ’
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	4	However that be , the Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever ; for He hath chosen Judah to be the ruler ; and of the house of Judah , the house of my father , and among the sons of my father He favored me to make me king over all Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	5	And of all my sons ( for the Lord hath given me many sons ) , He hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	6	And He said unto me , ‘ Solomon thy son , he shall build My house and My courts ; for I have chosen him to be My son , and I will be his Father .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	7	Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever , if he be constant to do My commandments and My judgments , as at this day. ’
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	8	Now therefore in the sight of all Israel , the congregation of the Lord , and in the audience of our God , keep and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God , that ye may possess this good land , and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	9	“ And thou , Solomon my son , know thou the God of thy father , and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind ; for the Lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts .

KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	10	Take heed now , for the Lord hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary . Be strong , and do it. ”

KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	12	and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit , of the courts of the house of the Lord and of all the chambers round about , of the treasuries of the house of God and of the treasuries of the dedicated things ;
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	13	also for the courses of the priests and the Levites , and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	14	He gave gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service ;

KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	19	“ All this , ” said David , “ the Lord made me understand in writing by His hand upon me , even all the works of this pattern. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	20	And David said to Solomon his son , “ Be strong and of good courage , and do it . Fear not , nor be dismayed , for the Lord God , even my God , will be with thee . He will not fail thee , nor forsake thee , until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	28	21	And behold , the courses of the priests and the Levites , even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God ; and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skillful man , for any manner of service . Also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy command . ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	1	Chronicles
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	29	Now the acts of David the king , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of Samuel the seer , and in the book of Nathan the prophet , and in the book of Gad the seer ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	2	Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold , and the silver for things of silver , and the brass for things of brass , the iron for things of iron , and wood for things of wood , onyx stones , and stones to be set , glistening stones of divers colors , and all manner of precious stones , and marble stones in abundance .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	3	Moreover , because I have set my affection on the house of my God , I have of mine own private goods , of gold and silver , which I have given to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house :
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	4	even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver with which to overlay the walls of the houses ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	5	the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver , and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers . And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord ? ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	6	Then the chiefs of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel , and the captains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rulers of the king ’ s work , offered willingly ,
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	7	and gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass eighteen thousand talents , and one hundred thousand talents of iron .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	8	And those with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord , by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	9	Then the people rejoiced , for they had offered willingly , because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord ; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	10	Therefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation . And David said : “ Blessed be Thou , Lord God of Israel , our Father , for ever and ever .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	11	Thine , O Lord , is the greatness , and the power and the glory , and the victory and the majesty ; for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Thine . Thine is the kingdom , O Lord , and Thou art exalted as head above all .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	12	Both riches and honor come from Thee , and Thou reignest over all . And in Thine hand is power and might ; and in Thine hand it is to make great , and to give strength unto all .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	13	Now therefore , our God , we thank Thee and praise Thy glorious name .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	14	“ But who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly in this manner ? For all things come from Thee , and from Thine own have we given Thee .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	15	For we are strangers before Thee , and sojourners , as were all our fathers ; our days on the earth are as a shadow , and there is none abiding .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	16	O Lord our God , all this store that we have prepared to build Thee a house for Thine holy name cometh from Thine hand and is all Thine own .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	17	I know also , my God , that Thou triest the heart , and hast pleasure in uprightness . As for me , in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things ; and now have I seen with joy Thy people , who are present here to offer willingly unto Thee .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	18	O Lord God of Abraham , Isaac , and of Israel , our fathers , keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of Thy people , and prepare their heart unto Thee .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	19	And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart to keep Thy commandments , Thy testimonies , and Thy statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision. ”
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	20	And David said to all the congregation , “ Now bless the Lord your God. ” And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and worshiped the Lord and the king .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	21	And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings unto the Lord on the morrow after that day : even a thousand bullocks , a thousand rams , and a thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	22	And they ate and drank before the Lord on that day with great gladness . And they made Solomon , the son of David , king the second time , and anointed him unto the Lord to be the chief governor , and Zadok to be priest .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father , and prospered ; and all Israel obeyed him .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	24	And all the princes and the mighty men , and all the sons likewise of King David , submitted themselves unto Solomon the king .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	25	And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	26	Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	27	And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years : seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	28	And he died in a good old age , full of days , riches , and honor ; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	1%20Chronicles	29	30	with all his reign and his might , and the times that went over him , and over Israel , and over all the kingdoms of the countries .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	2	Then Solomon spoke unto all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every overnor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	1	And Solomon , the son of David , was strengthened in his kingdom , and the Lord his God was with him and magnified him xceedingly .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	3	So Solomon , and all the congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of he congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	4	But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it , for he had pitched a ent for it at Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	5	Moreover the brazen altar that Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , he put before the tabernacle of the Lord ; nd Solomon and the congregation sought unto it .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	6	And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the Lord , which was at the tabernacle of the congregation , and ffered a thousand burnt offerings upon it .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	7	In that night did God appear unto Solomon and said unto him , “ Ask what I shall give thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	8	And Solomon said unto God , “ Thou hast shown great mercy unto David my father , and hast made me to reign in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	9	Now , O Lord God , let Thy promise unto David my father be established , for Thou hast made me king over a people like the ust of the earth in multitude .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	10	Give me now wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people ; for who can judge this Thy people that is o great ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	11	And God said to Solomon , “ Because this was in thine heart , and thou hast not asked riches , wealth , or honor , nor the life of hine enemies , neither yet hast asked for long life , but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself , that thou mayest judge My eople over whom I have made thee king ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	12	wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee ; and I will give thee riches and wealth and honor , such as none of the kings have ad who have been before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	13	Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem , from before the tabernacle of the ongregation , and reigned over Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	14	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen ; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen , hom he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	15	And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones , and cedar trees made he as abundant as the sycamore rees that are in the vale .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	16	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yarn ; the king ’ s merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	1	17	And they fetched and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver , and a horse for a hundred and ifty ; and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria by their means .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	2	And Solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens , and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain , and hree thousand and six hundred to oversee them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	3	And Solomon sent to Hiram , the king of Tyre , saying , “ As thou didst deal with David my father and didst send him cedars to uild him a house to dwell therein , even so deal with me .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	4	Behold , I build a house to the name of the Lord my God , to dedicate it to Him and to burn before Him sweet incense , and for he continual showbread , and for the burnt offerings morning and evening , on the Sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn easts of the Lord our God . This is an ordinance for ever to Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	5	And the house which I build is great , for great is our God above all gods .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	6	But who is able to build Him a house , seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens can not contain Him ? Who am I then , that I hould build Him a house , save only to burn sacrifice before Him ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	7	Send me now therefore a man skillful to work in gold and in silver , and in brass and in iron , and in purple and crimson and lue , and who can expertly engrave with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem , whom David my father provided .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	8	Send me also cedar trees , fir trees , and algum trees out of Lebanon ; for I know that thy servants have skill to cut timber in ebanon . And behold , my servants shall be with thy servants ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	9	even to prepare me timber in abundance ; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	10	And behold , I will give to thy servants , the hewers who cut timber , twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat , and twenty housand measures of barley , and twenty thousand baths of wine , and twenty thousand baths of oil. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	11	Then Hiram the king of Tyre answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon : “ Because the Lord hath loved His people , He hath ade thee king over them. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	12	Hiram said moreover : “ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who made heaven and earth , who hath given to David the king a wise on , endued with prudence and understanding , who might build a house for the Lord and a house for his kingdom .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	13	“ And now I have sent a skillful man , endued with understanding , Hiramabi
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	14	( the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan , and his father was a man of Tyre ) , skillful to work in gold and in silver , in rass , in iron , in stone , and in timber , in purple , in blue , and in fine linen , and in crimson ; also to engrave any manner of ngraving and to figure out every design which shall be put to him , with thy skillful men and with the skillful men of my lord avid thy father .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	15	Now therefore , the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord hath spoken of , let him send unto his ervants ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	16	and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as thou shalt need ; and we will bring it to thee as rafts by sea to Joppa , and hou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	17	And Solomon numbered all the strangers who were in the land of Israel , according to the numbering wherewith David his father ad numbered them ; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	2	18	And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens , and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain , nd three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people to work .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	2	And he began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	3	Now these are the measurements which Solomon instructed for the building of the house of God : The length by cubits , according o the ancient measure , was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubits .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	4	And the porch that was in the front of the house , the length of it was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , nd the height was a hundred and twenty ; and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	5	And the greater house he ceiled with fir tree , which he overlaid with fine gold and set thereon palm trees and chains .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	6	And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty , and the gold was gold of Parvaim .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	7	He overlaid also the house — the beams , the posts , and the walls thereof , and the doors thereof — with gold , and engraved herubims on the walls .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	8	And he made the most holy house : the length thereof was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the readth thereof twenty cubits ; and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	9	And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold . And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	10	And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work and overlaid them with gold .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	11	And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long : one wing of the one cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of he house , and the other wing was likewise five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	12	And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house , and the other wing was five cubits lso , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	13	The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits ; and they stood on their feet , and their faces faced nward .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	14	And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen , and wrought cherubims thereon .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	15	Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high , and the capital that was on the top of each of them as five cubits .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	16	And he made chains , as in the oracle , and put them on the heads of the pillars ; and made a hundred pomegranates , and put hem on the chains .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	3	17	And he raised up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand and the other on the left , and called the name of that n the right hand Jachin [ that is , He shall establish ] , and the name of that on the left Boaz [ that is , In it is strength ] .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	2	Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and five cubits the height thereof ; and a line f thirty cubits did compass it round about .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	4	It stood upon twelve oxen : three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the outh , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	3	And under it was the similitude of oxen , which compassed it round about , ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about . Two ows of oxen were cast when it was cast .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	5	And the thickness of it was a handbreadth , and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies ; and t received and held three thousand baths .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	6	He made also ten lavers , and put five on the right hand and five on the left , to wash in them . Such things as they offered or the burnt offering they washed in them , but the sea was for the priests to wash in .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	7	And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form and set them in the temple , five on the right hand and five on he left .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	8	He made also ten tables and placed them in the temple , five on the right side and five on the left . And he made a hundred asins of gold .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	9	Furthermore he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid their doors with rass .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	10	And he set the sea on the right side of the east end toward the south .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	11	And Hiram made the pots and the shovels and the basins . And Hiram finished the work that he was to do for King Solomon for he house of God ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	12	to wit : the two pillars , and the globes and the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars , and the two wreaths to over the two globes of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	13	and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths , two rows of pomegranates on each wreath to cover the two globes of the apitals which were upon the pillars .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	14	He made also bases , and lavers made he upon the bases ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	15	one sea and twelve oxen under it .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	16	The pots also , and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all their instruments , did Hiramabi make for King Solomon for the ouse of the Lord of bright brass .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	17	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	18	Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance , for the weight of the brass could not be found out .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	19	And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God , the golden altar also and the tables whereon the showbread as set ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	20	moreover the candlesticks with their lamps , that they should burn according to the manner before the oracle , of pure gold ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	21	and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs made he of gold , and that of perfect gold ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	4	22	and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the censers , of pure gold ; and the entry of the house , the inner oors thereof for the Most Holy Place and the doors of the house of the temple were of gold .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	2	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes , the chief of the fathers of the children of srael , unto Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the City of David , which is Zion .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	5	And they brought up the ark , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the abernacle ; these did the priests and the Levites bring up .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	3	Therefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	4	And all the elders of Israel came ; and the Levites took up the ark .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	6	Also King Solomon , and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled unto him before the ark , sacrificed sheep and xen , which could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place , to the oracle of the house , into the Most oly Place , even under the wings of the cherubims .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	8	For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark , and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof bove .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	9	And they drew out the staves of the ark so that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark in front of the oracle ; but hey were not seen outside . And they are there unto this day .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	10	There was nothing in the ark save the two tablets which Moses put therein at Horeb , when the Lord made a covenant with he children of Israel when they came out of Egypt .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	11	And it came to pass when the priests had come out of the holy place ( for all the priests who were present were sanctified nd did not then wait by course ) ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	12	also the Levites who were the singers , all of them of Asaph , of Heman , of Jeduthun , with their sons and their brethren , being rrayed in white linen , having cymbals and psalteries and harps , stood at the east end of the altar , and with them a hundred and wenty priests sounding with trumpets—
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	13	it came even to pass , as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord , and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music , and praised the Lord , saying , For He is good , for His mercy endureth for ever , ” that then the house was filled with a cloud , even the house of the Lord ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	5	14	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud , for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	2	But I have built a house of habitation for Thee , and a place for Thy dwelling for ever. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	6	but I have chosen Jerusalem , that My name might be there , and have chosen David to be over My people Israel. ’
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	3	And the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of Israel , and all the congregation of Israel stood .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	4	And he said , “ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who hathwith His hands fulfilled that which He spoke with His mouth to my ather David , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	5	‘ Since the day that I brought forth My people out of the land of Egypt , I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build house in , that My name might be there , neither chose I any man to be a ruler over My people Israel ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	7	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	8	But the Lord said to David my father : ‘ Inasmuch as it was in thine heart to build a house for My name , thou didst well in that t was in thine heart .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	9	Notwithstanding , thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins , he shall build the house or My name. ’
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	10	The Lord therefore hath performed His word that He hath spoken ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father and m set on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	11	And in it have I put the ark wherein is the covenant of the Lord that He made with the children of Israel. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	12	And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	13	For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high , and had set it in he midst of the court ; and upon it he stood , and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel , and spread orth his hands toward heaven
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	14	and said , “ O Lord God of Israel , there is no God like Thee in the heaven nor in the earth , who keepest covenant and showest mercy unto Thy servants who walk before Thee with all their hearts—
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	15	Thou who hast kept with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast promised him and spokest with Thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with Thine hand , as it is this day .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	16	Now therefore , O Lord God of Israel , keep with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast promised him , saying , ‘ There shall not fail thee a man in My sight to sit upon the throne of Israel ; yet only that thy children take heed to their way , to alk in My law as thou hast walked before Me. ’
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	17	Now then , O Lord God of Israel , let Thy word be verified , which Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant David .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	18	“ But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth ? Behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can not contain Thee ; how much less this house which I have built !
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	19	Have respect therefore to the prayer of Thy servant and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which Thy servant prayeth before Thee :
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	20	that Thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place whereof Thou hast said that Thou wouldest put Thy name there , to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant prayeth toward this place .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	21	Hearken therefore unto the supplications of Thy servant and of Thy people Israel , which they shall make toward this place . Hear Thou from Thy dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when Thou hearest , forgive .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	22	“ If a man sin against his neighbor , and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear , and the oath come before Thine altar in this house ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	23	then hear Thou from heaven , and do , and judge Thy servants by requiting the wicked , by recompensing his way upon his own head , and by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	24	“ And if Thy people Israel be smitten before the enemy because they have sinned against Thee , and shall return and confess Thy name , and pray and make supplication before Thee in this house ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	25	then hear Thou from the heavens and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel , and bring them again unto the land which Thou gavest to them and to their fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	26	“ When the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against Thee , yet if they pray toward this place and confess Thy name , and turn from their sin when Thou dost afflict them ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	27	then hear Thou from heaven , and forgive the sin of Thy servants and of Thy people Israel when Thou hast taught them the good way wherein they should walk ; and send rain upon Thy land which Thou hast given unto Thy people for an inheritance .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	28	“ If there be dearth in the land , if there be pestilence , if there be blight or mildew , locusts or caterpillars , if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land , whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	29	what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made by any man or by all Thy people Israel , when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief , and shall spread forth his hands in this house—
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	30	then hear Thou from heaven , Thy dwelling place , and forgive and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart Thou knowest ( for Thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men ) ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	31	that they may fear Thee , to walk in Thy ways so long as they live in the land which Thou gavest unto our fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	32	“ Moreover concerning the stranger , who is not of Thy people Israel , but has come from a far country for Thy great name ’ s sake and Thy mighty hand and Thy stretched out arm : if they come and pray in this house ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	33	then hear Thou from the heavens , even from Thy dwelling place , and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for , that all people of the earth may know Thy name and fear Thee , as doth Thy people Israel , and may know that this house which I have built is called by Thy name .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	34	“ If Thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that Thou shalt send them , and they pray unto Thee toward this city which Thou hast chosen and the house which I have built for Thy name ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	35	then hear Thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their cause .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	36	“ If they sin against Thee ( for there is no man who sinneth not ) , and Thou be angry with them and deliver them over before their enemies , and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	37	yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive , and turn and pray unto Thee in the land of their captivity , saying , ‘ We have sinned , we have done amiss and have dealt wickedly ’ ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	38	if they return to Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have carried them captives , and pray toward their land which Thou gavest unto their fathers , and toward the city which Thou hast chosen , and toward the house which I have built for Thy name—
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	39	then hear Thou from the heavens , even from Thy dwelling place , their prayer and their supplications , and maintain their cause , and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	40	Now , my God , let , I beseech Thee , Thine eyes be open , and let Thine ears be attentive unto the prayer that is made in this place .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	41	“ Now therefore arise , O Lord God , into Thy resting place , Thou , and the ark of Thy strength . Let Thy priests , O Lord God , be clothed with salvation , and let Thy saints rejoice in goodness .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	6	42	O Lord God , turn not away the face of Thine anointed . Remember the mercies of David Thy servant . ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	2	And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord , because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord ’ S house .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	7	Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord ; for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings , because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings and the meat offerings and the fat .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	3	And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the Lord upon the house , they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement , and worshiped and praised the Lord , saying , “ For He is good , for His mercy endureth for ever. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	5	And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep ; so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	6	And the priests attended to their offices . The Levites also , with instruments of music of the Lord which David the king had made to praise the Lord ( because His mercy endureth for ever ) , when David offered praise by their ministry ; and the priests ounded trumpets before them , and all Israel stood .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	8	Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great congregation , from the entrance of Hamath unto the river of Egypt .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	9	And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly , for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	10	And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents , glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the Lord had shown unto David and to Solomon and to Israel His people .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	11	Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the king ’ s house ; and all that came into Solomon ’ s heart to do in the house of the Lord and in his own house , he prosperously effected .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	12	And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night and said unto him : “ I have heard thy prayer , and have chosen this place for Myself for a house of sacrifice .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	13	If I shut up heaven that there be no rain , or if I command the locusts to devour the land or if I send pestilence among My people ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	14	if My people , who are called by My name , shall humble themselves and pray , and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways , then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin and will heal their land .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	15	Now Mine eyes shall be open and Mine ears attentive unto the prayer that is made in this place .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	16	For now have I chosen and sanctified this house , that My name may be there for ever ; and Mine eyes and Mine heart shall be there perpetually .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	17	And as for thee , if thou wilt walk before Me as David thy father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe My statutes and My judgments ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	18	then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom , according as I have covenanted with David thy father , saying , ‘ There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel. ’
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	19	“ But if ye turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods and worship them ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	20	then will I pluck them up by the roots out of My land which I have given them ; and this house which I have sanctified for My name will I cast out of My sight , and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	21	And this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one who passeth by it , so that he shall say , ‘ Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land and unto this house ? ’
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	7	22	And it shall be answered , ‘ Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers , who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them . Therefore hath He brought all this evil upon them . ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	2	that the cities which Hiram had restored to Solomon , Solomon built them up and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	8	( of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not ) , these Solomon made to pay tribute until this day .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	3	And Solomon went to Hamathzobah , and prevailed against it .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	4	And he built Tadmor in the wilderness , and all the storecities which he built in Hamath .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	5	Also he built Bethhoron the Upper and Bethhoron the Nether , fortified cities with walls , gates , and bars ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	6	and Baalath , and all the storecities that Solomon had , and all the cities for the chariots and the cities for the horsemen , and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and throughout all the land of his dominion .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	7	As for all the people who were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	9	But of the children of Israel Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and captains of his chariots and horsemen .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	10	And these were the chief of King Solomon ’ s officers , even two hundred and fifty , who bore rule over the people .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	11	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the City of David unto the house that he had built for her ; for he said , “ My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel , because the places are holy unto which the ark of the Lord hath come. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the Lord on the altar of the Lord , which he had built before the porch ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	13	according to a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of Moses on the Sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts , three times in the year : on the Feast of Unleavened Bread and on the Feast of Weeks and on the Feast of Tabernacles .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	14	And he appointed , according to the order of David his father , the courses of the priests for their service , and the Levites to their charges to praise and minister before the priests , as the duty of every day required ; the gatekeepers also by their courses at every gate , for so had David the man of God commanded .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	15	And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasurers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	16	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord and until it was finished . So the house of the Lord was perfected .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	17	Then went Solomon to Eziongeber and to Eloth at the seaside , in the land of Edom .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	8	18	And Hiram sent him ships by the hands of his servants , and servants who had knowledge of the sea ; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and took from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to King Solomon .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	2	And Solomon told her all her questions , and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	9	And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and spices in great abundance and precious stones ; neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	3	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon , and the house that he had built ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	4	and the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel , his cupbearers also and their apparel , and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord , there was no more spirit in her .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	5	And she said to the king , “ It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	6	However I believed not their words until I came and mine eyes had seen it . And behold , the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me , for thou exceedest the fame that I heard .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	7	Happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants , who stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	8	Blessed be the Lord thy God , who delighted in thee to set thee on His throne to be king for the Lord thy God . Because thy God loved Israel , to establish them for ever , therefore He made thee king over them to do judgment and justice. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	10	And the servants also of Hiram and the servants of Solomon , who brought gold from Ophir , brought algum trees and precious stones .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	11	And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the Lord and to the king ’ s palace , and harps and psalteries for singers ; and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	12	And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , besides that which she had brought unto the king . So she turned and went away to her own land , she and her servants .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	13	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	14	besides that which traders and merchants brought . And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	15	And King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold : six hundred shekels of beaten gold went into one buckler .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	16	And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold : three hundred shekels of gold went into one shield . And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	17	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	18	And there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on each side of the sitting place , and two lions standing by the stays ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	19	and twelve lions stood there on one side and on the other upon the six steps . There was not the like made in any kingdom .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	20	And all the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold . None were of silver . ( It was of no account in the days of Solomon . )
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	21	For the king ’ s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram : once every three years came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold and silver , ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	22	And King Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	24	And they brought every man his present : vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and raiment , armor , and spices , horses , and mules , a set rate year by year .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	25	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , whom he positioned in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	26	And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	27	And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones , and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that are in the low plains in abundance .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	28	And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt and out of all lands .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	30	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	9	31	And Solomon slept with his fathers , and he was buried in the City of David his father ; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	2	And it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat ( who was in Egypt whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king ) heard it , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	10	And the young men who were brought up with him spoke unto him , saying , “ Thus shalt thou answer the people who spoke unto thee , saying , ‘ Thy father made our yoke heavy , but make thou it somewhat lighter for us ’ — thus shalt thou say unto them , ‘ My little finger shall be thicker than my father ’ s loins .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	3	And they sent and called him . So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	4	“ Thy father made our yoke grievous . Now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us , and we will serve thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	5	And he said unto them , “ Come again unto me after three days. ” And the people departed .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	6	And King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , “ What counsel give ye me to return an answer to this people ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	7	And they spoke unto him , saying , “ If thou be kind to this people and please them , and speak good words to them , they will be thy servants for ever. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	8	But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him , and took counsel with the young men who were brought up with him , who stood before him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	9	And he said unto them , “ What advice give ye that we may return an answer to this people who have spoken to me , saying , ‘ Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father put upon us ’ ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	11	For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you , I will put more on your yoke . My father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day , as the king bade , saying , “ Come again to me on the third day. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	13	And the king answered them roughly ; and King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	14	and answered them according to the advice of the young men , saying , “ My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add thereto : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions ! ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	15	So the king hearkened not unto the people , for the cause was of God , that the Lord might perform His word which He spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	16	And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them , the people answered the king , saying , “ What portion have we in David ? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse . Every man to your tents , O Israel ! And now , David , see to thine own house ! ” So all Israel went to their tents .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	17	But as for the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	18	Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram who had charge over the tribute ; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones , so that he died . But King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	10	19	And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	2	But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	11	And he fortified the strongholds and put captains in them , and stores of victuals and of oil and wine .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	3	“ Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	4	‘ Thus saith the Lord : Ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren . Return every man to his house , for this thing is done from Me. ’ ” And they obeyed the words of the Lord , and returned from going against Jeroboam .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	5	And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem , and built cities for defense in Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	6	He built even Bethlehem , and Etam , and Tekoa ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	7	and Bethzur , and Shoco , and Adullam ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	8	and Gath , and Mareshah , and Ziph ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	9	and Adoraim , and Lachish , and Azekah ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	10	and Zorah , and Aijalon , and Hebron , which are in Judah and in Benjamin , fortified cities .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	12	And in each separate city he put shields and spears , and made them exceedingly strong , having Judah and Benjamin on his side .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	13	And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their borders .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	14	For the Levites left their suburbs and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem , for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest ’ s office unto the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	15	And he ordained for himself priests for the high places , and for the devils , and for the calves which he had made .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	16	And after them , out of all the tribes of Israel , such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years . For three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	18	And Rehoboam took Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David for a wife , and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	19	who bore him children : Jeush , and Shamariah , and Zaham .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	20	And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom , who bore him Abijah , and Attai , and Ziza , and Shelomith .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	21	And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines ( for he took eighteen wives and threescore concubines , and begot twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters ) ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	22	and Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief to be ruler among his brethren , for he thought to make him king .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	11	23	And he dealt wisely , and dispersed some of his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin , unto every fortified city ; and he gave them victuals in abundance . And he desired many wives .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	2	And it came to pass that in the fifth year of King Rehoboam , Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , because they had transgressed against the Lord ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	12	And when he humbled himself , the wrath of the Lord turned from him , that He would not destroy him altogether ; and also in Judah things went well .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	3	with twelve hundred chariots , and threescore thousand horsemen ; and the people were without number who came with him out of Egypt : the Lubims , the Sukkiims , and the Ethiopians .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	4	And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah , and came to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	5	Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah , who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said unto them , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Ye have forsaken Me , and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	6	Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves , and they said , “ The Lord is righteous. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	7	And when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves , the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah , saying , “ They have humbled themselves . Therefore I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliverance , and My wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	8	Nevertheless they shall be his servants , that they may know My service , and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	9	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king ’ s house . He took all : he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	10	In their stead King Rehoboam made shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard , who kept the entrance of the king ’ s house .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	11	And when the king entered into the house of the Lord , the guard came and fetched them , and brought them again into the guard chamber .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	13	So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem , and reigned ; for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there . And his mother ’ s name was Naamah , an Ammonitess .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	14	And he did evil , because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	15	Now the acts of Rehoboam , first and last , are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies ? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	12	16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried in the City of David ; and Abijah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem . Also his mother ’ s name was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah . And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	13	But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them ; so they were before Judah and the ambush was behind them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	3	And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war , even four hundred thousand chosen men . Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men , being mighty men of valor .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	4	And Abijah stood up upon Mount Zemaraim , which is in Mount Ephraim , and said , “ Hear me , thou Jeroboam and all Israel :
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	5	Ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , hath risen up and hath rebelled against his lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	7	And there are gathered unto him vain men , the children of Belial , and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	8	“ And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of the sons of David ; and ye are a great multitude , and there are with you golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	9	Have ye not cast out the priests of the Lord , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites , and have made priests for yourselves in the manner of the nations of other lands , so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams , the same may be a priest of them that are no gods ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	10	But as for us , the Lord is our God , and we have not forsaken Him ; and the priests , who minister unto the Lord are the sons of Aaron , and the Levites wait upon their business .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	11	And they burn unto the Lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense . The showbread also set they in order upon the pure table , and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening ; for we keep the charge of the Lord our God . But ye have forsaken Him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	12	And behold , God Himself is with us for our captain , and His priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you . O children of Israel , fight ye not against the Lord God of your fathers , for ye shall not prosper. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	14	And when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind ; and they cried unto the Lord , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	15	Then the men of Judah gave a shout ; and as the men of Judah shouted , it came to pass that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	16	And the children of Israel fled before Judah , and God delivered them into their hand .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	17	And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter ; so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	18	Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed because they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	19	And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam and took cities from him : Bethel with the towns thereof , and Jeshanah with the towns thereof , and Ephrain with the towns thereof .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	20	Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah ; and the Lord struck him , and he died .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	21	But Abijah waxed mighty , and married fourteen wives , and begot twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	13	22	And the rest of the acts of Abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	2	And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	14	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar , for the fear of the Lord came upon them ; and they despoiled all the cities , for there was exceeding much spoil in them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	3	For he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places , and broke down the images , and cut down the Asherah poles ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	4	and he commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	5	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images ; and the kingdom was quiet before him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	6	And he built fortified cities in Judah , for the land had rest ; and he had no war in those years , because the Lord had given him rest .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	7	Therefore he said unto Judah , “ Let us build these cities and make walls about them , and towers , gates , and bars while the land is yet before us , because we have sought the Lord our God . We have sought Him , and He hath given us rest on every side. ” So they built and prospered .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	8	And Asa had an army of men who bore bucklers and spears out of Judah , three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows , two hundred and fourscore thousand . All these were mighty men of valor .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	9	And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with a host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots , and came unto Mareshah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	10	Then Asa went out against him , and they set the battle in array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	11	And Asa cried unto the Lord his God and said , “ Lord , it is nothing with Thee to help , whether with many or with those who have no power . Help us , O Lord our God , for we rest on Thee , and in Thy name we go against this multitude . O Lord , Thou art our God . Let not man prevail against Thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	12	So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah , and the Ethiopians fled .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	13	And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them unto Gerar ; and the Ethiopians were overthrown so that they could not recover themselves , for they were destroyed before the Lord and before His host ; and they carried away very much spoil .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	14	15	They smote also the tents of cattle , and carried away sheep and camels in abundance , and returned to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	2	And he went out to meet Asa , and said unto him , “ Hear ye me , Asa , and all Judah and Benjamin : The Lord is with you while ye be with Him ; and if ye seek Him , He will be found by you ; but if ye forsake Him , He will forsake you .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	15	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with their whole desire , and He was found by them ; and the Lord gave them rest round about .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	3	Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God , and without a teaching priest and without law .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	4	But when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel and sought Him , He was found by them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	5	And in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in , but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	6	And nation was destroyed by nation , and city by city ; for God vexed them with all adversity .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	7	Be ye strong therefore , and let not your hands be weak ; for your work shall be rewarded. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	8	And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet , he took courage , and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from Mount Ephraim , and renewed the altar of the Lord that was before the porch of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	9	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin , and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh and out of Simeon ; for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that the Lord his God was with him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	10	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	11	And they offered unto the Lord at that time from the spoil which they had brought , seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	12	And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	13	that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	14	And they swore unto the Lord with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	16	And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king , he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol for Asherah . And Asa cut down her idol , and stamped it , and burned it at the Brook Kidron ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	17	but the high places were not taken away out of Israel . Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	18	And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated : silver and gold and vessels .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	15	19	And there was no more war until the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	2	Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasuries of the house of the Lord and from the king ’ s house , and sent to Benhadad king of Syria , who dwelt at Damascus , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	16	In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa , Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah , with the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	3	“ There is a league between me and thee , as there was between my father and thy father . Behold , I have sent thee silver and gold . Go , break thy league with Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	4	And Benhadad hearkened unto King Asa , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abelmaim , and all the storecities of Naphtali .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	5	And it came to pass , when Baasha heard it , that he left off building Ramah and let his work cease .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	6	Then Asa the king took all Judah , and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timber thereof wherewith Baasha was building ; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	7	And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah , and said unto him , “ Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria and not relied on the Lord thy God , therefore has the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen ? Yet , because thou didst rely on the Lord , He delivered them into thine hand .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	9	For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth , to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward Him . Herein thou hast done foolishly : therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	10	Then Asa was wroth with the seer , and put him in a prison house , for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	11	And behold , the acts of Asa , first and last , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	12	And Asa , in the thirty and ninth year of his reign , was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great . Yet in his disease he sought not the Lord , but the physicians .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	13	And Asa slept with his fathers , and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	16	14	And they buried him in his own sepulchers , which he had made for himself in the City of David , and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries ’ art ; and they made a very great burning for him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	2	And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim , which Asa his father had taken .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	17	And of Benjamin : Eliada a mighty man of valor , and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	3	And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat , because he walked in the first ways of his father David and sought not unto the Baalim ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	4	but sought the Lord God of his father and walked in His commandments , and not according to the doings of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	5	Therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand ; and all Judah brought Jehoshaphat presents , and he had riches and honor in abundance .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	6	And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord ; moreover he took away the high places and Asherah poles out of Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	7	Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes , even Benhail , and Obadiah , and Zechariah , and Nethaneel , and Michaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	8	And with them he sent Levites , even Shemaiah , and Nethaniah , and Zebadiah , and Asahel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehonathan , and Adonijah , and Tobijah , and Tobadonijah , Levites ; and with them Elishama and Jehoram , priests .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	9	And they taught in Judah , and had the Book of the Law of the Lord with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	10	And the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah , so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	11	Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and tribute silver ; and the Arabians brought him flocks , seven thousand and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred hegoats .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	12	And Jehoshaphat waxed exceedingly great ; and he built in Judah palaces and cities for stores .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	13	And he had much business in the cities of Judah ; and the men of war , mighty men of valor , were in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	14	And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers . Of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the chief , and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	15	and next to him was Jehohanan the captain , and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	16	and next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself unto the Lord , and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	18	and next to him was Jehozabad , and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand ready , prepared for the war .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	17	19	These waited on the king , besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	2	And after certain years he went down to Ahab in Samaria . And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people whom he had with him , and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	18	Again Micaiah said , “ Therefore hear the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting upon His throne , and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and on His left .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	3	And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah , “ Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead ? ” And he answered him , “ I am as thou art , and my people as thy people ; and we will be with thee in the war. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	4	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel , “ Inquire , I pray thee , at the word of the Lord today. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	5	Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men , and said unto them , “ Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? ” And they said , “ Go up ; for God will deliver it into the king ’ s hand. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	6	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides these , that we might inquire of him ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	7	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , “ There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord ; but I hate him , for he never prophesied good unto me , but always evil . The same is Micaiah the son of Imla. ” And Jehoshaphat said , “ Let not the king say so ! ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	8	And the king of Israel called for one of his officers and said , “ Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	9	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat each of them on his throne , clothed in their robes , and they sat in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	10	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron , and said , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	11	And all the prophets prophesied so , saying , “ Go up to Ramothgilead and prosper , for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	12	And the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him , saying , “ Behold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent . Let thy word therefore , I pray thee , be like one of theirs , and speak thou good. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	13	And Micaiah said , “ As the Lord liveth , even what my God saith , that will I speak. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	14	And when he had come to the king , the king said unto him , “ Micaiah , shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? ” And he said , “ Go ye up and prosper , and they shall be delivered into your hand. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	15	And the king said to him , “ How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the Lord ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	16	Then he said , “ I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd . And the Lord said , ‘ These have no master . Let them return therefore every man to his house in peace. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me , but evil ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	19	And the Lord said , ‘ Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead ? ’ And one spoke saying in this manner , and another saying in that manner .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	20	Then there came out a spirit , and stood before the Lord and said , ‘ I will entice him. ’ And the Lord said unto him , ‘ How ? ’
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	21	And he said , ‘ I will go out , and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. ’ And the Lord said , ‘ Thou shalt entice him , and thou shalt also prevail . Go out , and do even so. ’
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	22	Now therefore , behold , the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets , and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and smote Micaiah upon the cheek and said , “ Which way went the spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	24	And Micaiah said , “ Behold , thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	25	Then the king of Israel said , “ Take ye Micaiah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king ’ s son ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	26	and say , ‘ Thus saith the king : Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I return in peace. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	27	And Micaiah said , “ If thou certainly return in peace , then hath not the Lord spoken by me. ” And he said , “ Hearken , all ye people. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	29	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , “ I will disguise myself and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes. ” So the king of Israel disguised himself , and they went to the battle .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots who were with him , saying , “ Fight ye not with small or great , but only with the king of Israel. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	31	And it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat that they said , “ It is the king of Israel. ” Therefore they compassed about him to fight . But Jehoshaphat cried out , and the Lord helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	32	For it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	33	And a certain man drew a bow at random , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor . Therefore he said to his chariot man , “ Turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry me out of the host , for I am wounded. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	18	34	And the battle increased that day . Nonetheless the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening . And about the time of the sun going down he died .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	2	And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him , and said to King Jehoshaphat , “ Shouldest thou help the ungodly , and love those who hate the Lord ? Therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	19	And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	3	Nevertheless there are good things found in thee , in that thou hast taken away the Asherah poles out of the land , and hast prepared thine heart to seek God. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	4	And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem ; and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim , and brought them back unto the Lord God of their fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	5	And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah , city by city ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	6	and said to the judges , “ Take heed what ye do ; for ye judge not for man , but for the Lord , who is with you in the matter of judgment .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	7	Therefore now , let the fear of the Lord be upon you . Take heed and do it ; for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God , nor respect of persons , nor taking of bribes. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	8	Moreover in Jerusalem , Jehoshaphat set some of the Levites and some of the priests and some of the chief of the fathers of Israel for the judgment of the Lord and for controversies , when they returned to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	9	And he charged them , saying , “ Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord , faithfully , and with a perfect heart .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	10	And whatsoever cause shall come to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities , between blood and blood , between law and commandment , statutes and judgments , ye shall even warn them , that they trespass not against the Lord , and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren . This do , and ye shall not trespass .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	19	11	And behold , Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the Lord , and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael , the ruler of the house of Judah , for all the king ’ s matters . Also the Levites shall be officers before you . Deal courageously , and the Lord shall be with the good . ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	2	Then there came some who told Jehoshaphat , saying , “ There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side of Syria ; and behold , they are in Hazazontamar , which is Engedi. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	20	And they rose early in the morning and went forth into the Wilderness of Tekoa ; and as they went forth , Jehoshaphat stood and said , “ Hear me , O Judah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem : Believe in the Lord your God ; so shall ye be established . Believe His prophets ; so shall ye prosper. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	3	And Jehoshaphat feared , and set himself to seek the Lord , and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	4	And Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord ; even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	5	And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem , in the house of the Lord , before the new court ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	6	and said , “ O Lord God of our fathers , art not Thou God in heaven ? And rulest not Thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen ? And in Thine hand is there not power and might , so that none is able to withstand Thee ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	7	Art not Thou our God , who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before Thy people Israel , and gavest it to the seed of Abraham Thy friend for ever ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	8	And they dwelt therein , and have built Thee a sanctuary therein for Thy name , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	9	‘ If , when evil cometh upon us , as the sword , judgment , or pestilence , or famine , we stand before this house and in Thy presence ( for Thy name is in this house ) , and cry unto Thee in our affliction , then Thou wilt hear and help. ’
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	10	And now , behold , the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir , whom Thou wouldest not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt , but they turned from them and destroyed them not ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	11	behold , I say , how they reward us by coming to cast us out of Thy possession , which Thou hast given us to inherit .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	12	O our God , wilt Thou not judge them ? For we have no might against this great company that cometh against us , neither know we what to do ; but our eyes are upon Thee. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	13	And all Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones , their wives , and their children .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	14	Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph , came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	15	And he said , “ Hearken ye , all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem , and thou King Jehoshaphat ! Thus saith the Lord unto you : ‘ Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God ’ s .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	16	Tomorrow go ye down against them . Behold , they come up by the cliff of Ziz , and ye shall find them at the end of the brook , before the Wilderness of Jeruel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	17	Ye shall not need to fight in this battle . Set yourselves , stand ye still , and see the salvation of the Lord with you , O Judah and Jerusalem. ’ Fear not , nor be dismayed . Tomorrow go out against them , for the Lord will be with you. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	18	And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground , and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord , worshiping the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	19	And the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites , stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	21	And when he had consulted with the people , he appointed singers unto the Lord who should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army , and to say , “ Praise the Lord , for His mercy endureth for ever. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	22	And when they began to sing and to praise , the Lord set ambushes against the children of Ammon , Moab , and Mount Seir , who had come against Judah ; and they were smitten .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	23	For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir utterly to slay and destroy them ; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , every one helped to destroy another .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	24	And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness , they looked unto the multitude ; and behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	25	And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil from them , they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels , which they stripped off for themselves , more than they could carry away ; and they were three days in gathering the spoil , it was so much .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	26	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the Valley of Berachah [ that is , Blessing ] , for there they blessed the Lord . Therefore the name of the same place was called The Valley of Berachah unto this day .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	27	Then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , with Jehoshaphat at the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	28	And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	29	And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	30	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet ; for his God gave him rest round about .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	31	And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah . He was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	32	And he walked in the way of Asa his father and departed not from it , doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	33	However the high places were not taken away , for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani , who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	35	And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel , who did very wickedly .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	36	And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish ; and they made the ships in Eziongeber .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	20	37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat , saying , “ Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah , the Lord hath broken thy works. ” And the ships were broken up , so that they were not able to go to Tarshish .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	2	And he had brethren , the sons of Jehoshaphat : Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah ; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	21	Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the City of David . And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	3	And their father gave them great gifts of silver and gold and precious things , with fortified cities in Judah ; but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram , because he was the firstborn .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	4	Now when Jehoram had risen up to the kingdom of his father , he strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword , and others also of the princes of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	5	Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab , for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife ; and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	7	However the Lord would not destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that He had made with David , and as He promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	8	In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah , and made themselves a king .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	9	Then Jehoram went forth with his princes , and all his chariots with him ; and he rose up by night and smote the Edomites who compassed him about and the captains of the chariots .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	10	So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day . The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand , because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	11	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah , and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication , and compelled Judah thereto .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	12	And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet , saying , “ Thus saith the Lord God of David thy father : ‘ Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father , nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	13	but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring like the whoredoms of the house of Ahab , and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father ’ s house , who were better than thyself ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	14	behold , with a great plague will the Lord smite thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy goods .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	15	And thou shalt have great sickness with a disease of thy bowels , until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	16	Moreover the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	17	And they came up into Judah and broke into it , and carried away all the substance that was found in the king ’ s house , and his sons also and his wives , so that there was not a son left him , save Jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	18	And after all this the Lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	19	And it came to pass that in process of time , after the end of two years , his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness ; so he died of grievous diseases . And his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	21	20	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired . However they buried him in the City of David , but not in the sepulchers of the kings .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	2	Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign , and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name also was Athaliah , the daughter of Omri .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	22	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead , for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest . So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram , king of Judah , reigned .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab , for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	4	Therefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab ; for they were his counselors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	5	He walked also after their counsel , and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead ; and the Syrians smote Joram .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	6	And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah when he fought with Hazael king of Syria . And Azariah the son of Jehoram , king of Judah , went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel , because he was sick .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	7	And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by his coming to Joram ; for when he had come , he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi , whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	8	And it came to pass , when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab , and found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah who ministered to Ahaziah , that he slew them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	9	And he sought Ahaziah , and they caught him ( for he had hid in Samaria ) and brought him to Jehu . And when they had slain him , they buried him , “ because , ” said they , “ he is the son of Jehoshaphat , who sought the Lord with all his heart. ” So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep the kingdom still .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	10	But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	11	But Jehoshabeath , the daughter of the king , took Joash the son of Ahaziah , and stole him from among the king ’ s sons who were slain , and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber . So Jehoshabeath , the daughter of King Jehoram , the wife of Jehoiada the priest ( for she was the sister of Ahaziah ) , hid him from Athaliah , so that she slew him not .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	22	12	And he was with them hidden in the house of God six years ; and Athaliah reigned over the land .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	2	And they went about in Judah and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the chief of the fathers of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	23	And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds into a covenant with him : Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	3	And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God . And he said unto them , “ Behold , the king ’ s son shall reign , as the Lord hath said of the sons of David .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	4	This is the thing that ye shall do : A third part of you entering on the Sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be keepers of the doors ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	5	and a third part shall be at the king ’ s house ; and a third part at the Gate of the Foundation ; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	6	But let none come into the house of the Lord save the priests and those who minister of the Levites . They shall go in , for they are holy , but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	7	And the Levites shall compass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and whosoever else cometh into the house , he shall be put to death ; but be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded , and took every man his men who were to come in on the Sabbath , with those who were to go out on the Sabbath ; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	9	Moreover , Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been King David ’ s , which were in the house of God .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	10	And he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	11	Then they brought out the king ’ s son , and put upon him the crown , and gave him the testimony , and made him king . And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him , and said , “ God save the king. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	12	Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king , she came to the people into the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	13	And she looked , and behold , the king stood at his pillar at the entrance , and the princes and the trumpets by the king ; and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets , also the singers with instruments of music , and such as taught to sing praise . Then Athaliah rent her clothes and said , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	14	Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the host , and said unto them , “ Take her forth among the ranks . And whoso followeth her , let him be slain with the sword. ” For the priest said , “ Slay her not in the house of the Lord. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	15	So they laid hands on her ; and when she had come to the entrance of the Horse Gate by the king ’ s house , they slew her there .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	16	And Jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the people and between the king , that they should be the Lord ’ S people .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	17	Then all the people went to the house of Baal and broke it down , and broke his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	18	Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand of the priests , the Levites , whom David had distributed in the house of the Lord , to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord , as it is written in the Law of Moses , with rejoicing and with singing , as it was ordained by David .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	19	And he set the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the Lord , that none who was unclean in any thing should enter in .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	20	And he took the captains of hundreds , and the nobles , and the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of the Lord ; and they came through the High Gate into the king ’ s house , and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	23	21	And all the people of the land rejoiced ; and the city was quiet after they had slain Athaliah with the sword .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	2	And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	24	For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men ; and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand , because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers . So they executed judgment against Joash .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	3	And Jehoiada took for him two wives , and he begot sons and daughters .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	4	And it came to pass after this , that Joash was minded to repair the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	5	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites , and said to them , “ Go out unto the cities of Judah , and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year , and see that ye hasten the matter. ” However the Levites hastened it not .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	6	And the king called for Jehoiada the chief priest and said unto him , “ Why hast thou not required the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection , according to the commandment of Moses , the servant of the Lord , and of the congregation of Israel , for the tabernacle of witness ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	7	For the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon the Baalim .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	8	And at the king ’ s commandment they made a chest , and set it outside at the gate of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	9	And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to bring in to the Lord the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	11	Now it came to pass , at whatever time the chest was brought unto the king ’ s office by the hand of the Levites , and when they saw that there was much money , that the king ’ s scribe and the high priest ’ s officer came and emptied the chest , and took it and carried it to his place again . Thus they did day by day , and gathered money in abundance .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord ; and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord , and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	13	So the workmen wrought , and the work was perfected by them ; and they set the house of God in order , and strengthened it .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	14	And when they had finished it , they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada , of which were made vessels for the house of the Lord , even vessels to minister and to offer withal , and spoons , and vessels of gold and silver . And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jehoiada .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	15	But Jehoiada waxed old , and was full of days when he died : a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	16	And they buried him in the City of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both toward God and toward His house .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	17	Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah , and made obeisance to the king . Then the king hearkened unto them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	18	And they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers , and served Asherah poles and idols ; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	19	Yet He sent prophets to them , to bring them again unto the Lord ; and they testified against them , but they would not give ear .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	20	And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest , who stood above the people , and said unto them , “ Thus saith God : ’ Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord , that ye can not prosper ? Because ye have forsaken the Lord , He hath also forsaken you. ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	21	And they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	22	Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but slew his son . And when he died , he said , “ The Lord look upon it , and require it. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	23	And it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of Syria came up against him ; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all their spoil unto the king of Damascus .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	25	And when they had departed from him ( for they left him with grave diseases ) , his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest , and slew him on his bed , and he died . And they buried him in the City of David , but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	26	And these are those who conspired against him : Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	24	27	Now concerning his sons , and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him , and the repairing of the house of God , behold , they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings . And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , but not with a perfect heart .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	25	And Amaziah the son of Joash , king of Judah , lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz , king of Israel , fifteen years .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	3	Now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he slew his servants who had killed the king his father .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	4	But he slew not their children , but did as it is written in the law in the Book of Moses , where the Lord commanded , saying , “ The fathers shall not die for the children , neither shall the children die for the fathers , but every man shall die for his own sin. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	5	Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds , according to the houses of their fathers , throughout all Judah and Benjamin . And he numbered them from twenty years old and above , and found them three hundred thousand choice men , able to go forth to war , who could handle spear and shield .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	6	He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	7	But there came a man of God to him , saying , “ O king , let not the army of Israel go with thee , for the Lord is not with Israel , to wit , with all the children of Ephraim .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	8	But if thou wilt go , do it ; be strong for the battle . But God shall make thee fall before the enemy , for God hath the power to help and to cast down. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	9	And Amaziah said to the man of God , “ But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel ? ” And the man of God answered , “ The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	10	Then Amaziah separated them ( to wit , the army that had come to him out from Ephraim ) to go home again . Therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in great anger .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	11	And Amaziah strengthened himself , and led forth his people and went to the Valley of Salt , and smote ten thousand of the children of Seir .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	12	And another ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	13	But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell upon the cities of Judah from Samaria even unto Bethhoron , and smote three thousand of them and took much spoil .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	14	Now it came to pass , after Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites , that he brought the gods of the children of Seir and set them up to be his gods , and bowed down himself before them and burned incense unto them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	15	Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah , and He sent unto him a prophet , who said unto him , “ Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	16	And it came to pass as he talked with him , that the king said unto him , “ Art thou made the king ’ s counsel ? Forbear ! Why should thou be smitten ? ” Then the prophet forbore and said , “ I know that God hath determined to destroy thee , because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	17	Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice , and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz , the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , “ Come , let us look one another in the face. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	18	And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah , saying , “ The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon , saying , ‘ Give thy daughter to my son as wife ’ ; and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon , and trod down the thistle .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	19	Thou sayest , ‘ Lo , thou hast smitten the Edomites , ’ and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast . Abide now at home . Why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou and Judah with thee ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	20	But Amaziah would not hear ; for it came from God , that He might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they sought after the gods of Edom .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	21	So Joash the king of Israel went up ; and they looked one another in the face , both he and Amaziah king of Judah , at Bethshemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	22	And Judah was smitten before Israel , and they fled every man to his tent .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	23	And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash , the son of Jehoahaz , at Bethshemesh ; and he brought him to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate , four hundred cubits .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	24	And he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom , and the treasures of the king ’ s house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	27	Now after the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord , they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish , but they sent to Lachish after him and slew him there .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	25	28	And they brought him upon horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah [ that is , the City of David ] .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	2	He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	26	Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in place of his father Amaziah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	3	Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign , and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem . Also his mother ’ s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	4	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Amaziah did .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	5	And he sought God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the visions of God ; and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him to prosper .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	6	And he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod , and built cities about Ashdod and among the Philistines .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	7	And God helped him against the Philistines , and against the Arabians who dwelt in Gurbaal , and the Meunites .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	8	And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah ; and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt , for he strengthened himself exceedingly .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	9	Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	10	Also he built towers in the desert and dug many wells , for he had much cattle , both in the low country and in the plains ; husbandmen also , and vine dressers in the mountains and in Carmel , for he loved husbandry .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	11	Moreover Uzziah had a host of fighting men who went out to war by bands , according to the number of their count by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler , under the hand of Hananiah , one of the king ’ s captains .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	12	The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand and six hundred .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	13	And under their hand was an army , three hundred and seven thousand and five hundred , that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	14	And Uzziah prepared for them , throughout all the host , shields , and spears , and helmets , and jackets of mail , and bows , and slings to cast stones .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	15	And he made in Jerusalem engines , invented by skillful men , to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks with which to shoot arrows and great stones . And his name spread far abroad , for he was marvelously helped till he was strong .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	16	But when he was strong his heart was lifted up , to his destruction ; for he transgressed against the Lord his God , and went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	17	And Azariah the priest went in after him , and with him fourscore priests of the Lord , who were valiant men .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	18	And they withstood Uzziah the king , and said unto him , “ It pertaineth not unto thee , Uzziah , to burn incense unto the Lord , but to the priests the sons of Aaron , who are consecrated to burn incense . Go out of the sanctuary , for thou hast trespassed ; neither shall it be for thine honor from the Lord God. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	19	Then Uzziah was wroth , and had a censer in his hand to burn incense ; and while he was wroth with the priests , the leprosy even rose up on his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord , beside the incense altar .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	20	And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him , and behold , he was leprous on his forehead , and they thrust him out from thence . Yea , he himself hastened also to go out , because the Lord had smitten him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	21	And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death ; and he dwelt in a separate house , being a leper , for he was cut off from the house of the Lord . And Jotham his son was over the king ’ s house , judging the people of the land .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first and last , did Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , write .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	26	23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings , for they said , “ He is a leper. ” And Jotham his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	27	2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Uzziah did . Howbeit , he entered not into the temple of the Lord , and the people did yet corruptly .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	27	27	Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . Also his mother ’ s name was Jerushah , the daughter of Zadok .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	27	3	He built the High Gate of the house of the Lord , and on the wall of Ophel he built much .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	27	4	Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah , and in the forests he built strongholds and towers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	27	5	He fought also with the king of the Ammonites , and prevailed against them . And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver , and ten thousand measures of wheat , and ten thousand of barley . The same did the children of Ammon pay unto him both the second year and the third .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	27	6	So Jotham became mighty , because he prepared his ways before the Lord his God .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	27	7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	27	8	He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	27	9	And Jotham slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the City of David ; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	2	For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and made also molten images for the Baalim .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	28	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem ; but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord like David his father .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	3	Moreover he burned incense in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , and burned his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	4	He sacrificed also and burned incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	5	Therefore the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria ; and they smote him , and carried away a great multitude of them captives , and brought them to Damascus . And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel , who smote him with a great slaughter .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	6	For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day , who were all valiant men , because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	7	And Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , slew Maaseiah the king ’ s son , and Azrikam the governor of the house , and Elkanah who was next to the king .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	8	And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	9	But a prophet of the Lord was there , whose name was Oded ; and he went out before the host that came to Samaria , and said unto them , “ Behold , because the Lord God of your fathers was wroth with Judah , He hath delivered them into your hand , and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	10	And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem as bondmen and bondwomen unto you . But are there not with you , even with you , sins against the Lord your God ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Now hear me therefore , and deliver the captives back , whom ye have taken captive from your brethren ; for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	12	Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against those who came from the war
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	13	and said unto them , “ Ye shall not bring in the captives hither , for whereas we have offended against the Lord already , ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass ; for our trespass is great , and there is fierce wrath against Israel. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	15	And the men who were mentioned by name rose up and took the captives , and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them , and arrayed them , and shod them , and gave them to eat and to drink , and anointed them , and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to their brethren at Jericho , the city of palm trees . Then they returned to Samaria .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	16	At that time King Ahaz sent unto the kings of Assyria to help him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	17	For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah , and carried away captives .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	18	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country and of the south of Judah , and had taken Bethshemesh , and Aijalon , and Gederoth , and Shocho with the villages thereof , and Timnah with the villages thereof , Gimzo also and the villages thereof ; and they dwelt there .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	19	For the Lord brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel , for he made Judah naked and transgressed sorely against the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	20	And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him and distressed him , but strengthened him not .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	21	For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king and from the princes , and gave it unto the king of Assyria ; but he helped him not .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	22	And in the time of his distress he trespassed yet more against the Lord : this is that King Ahaz .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	23	For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus which smote him ; and he said , “ Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them , therefore will I sacrifice to them , that they may help me. ” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	24	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord , and he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	25	And in every separate city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods , and provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	26	Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	28	27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem ; but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel . And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father had done .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	29	And when they had made an end of offering , the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	3	He , in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the Lord and repaired them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	4	And he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them together into the east street ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	5	and said unto them , “ Hear me , ye Levites ! Sanctify now yourselves , and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers , and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	6	For our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have forsaken Him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	7	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	8	Therefore the wrath of the Lord was upon Judah and Jerusalem , and He hath delivered them to trouble , to astonishment , and to hissing , as ye see with your eyes .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	9	For lo , our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	10	Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel , that His fierce wrath may turn away from us .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	11	My sons , be not now negligent ; for the Lord hath chosen you to stand before Him , to serve Him , and that ye should minister unto Him and burn incense. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	12	Then the Levites arose : Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah , of the sons of the Kohathites ; and of the sons of Merari , Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehalelel ; and of the Gershonites , Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	13	and of the sons of Elizaphan , Shimri and Jeiel ; and of the sons of Asaph , Zechariah and Mattaniah ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	14	and of the sons of Heman , Jehiel and Shimei ; and of the sons of Jeduthun , Shemaiah and Uzziel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	15	And they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves , and came , according to the commandment of the king by the words of the Lord , to cleanse the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	16	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord . And the Levites took it to carry it out abroad into the Brook Kidron .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	17	Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the Lord . So they sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days , and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	18	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said , “ We have cleansed all the house of the Lord , and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof , and the showbread table with all the vessels thereof .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	19	Moreover all the vessels which King Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression , have we prepared and sanctified ; and behold , they are before the altar of the Lord. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	20	Then Hezekiah the king rose early , and gathered the rulers of the city , and went up to the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	21	And they brought seven bullocks , and seven rams , and seven lambs , and seven hegoats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah . And he commanded the priests , the sons of Aaron , to offer them on the altar of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	22	So they killed the bullocks , and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar . Likewise , when they had killed the rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar . They killed also the lambs , and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	23	And they brought forth the hegoats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation , and they laid their hands upon them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	24	And the priests killed them , and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all Israel ; for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	25	And he set the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals , with psalteries , and with harps , according to the commandment of David , and of Gad the king ’ s seer , and Nathan the prophet ; for so was the commandment of the Lord by his prophets .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	26	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David , and the priests with the trumpets .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	27	And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar . And when the burnt offering began , the song of the Lord began also with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	28	And all the congregation worshiped , and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded ; and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	30	Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph the seer . And they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	31	Then Hezekiah answered and said , “ Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the Lord ; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the Lord. ” And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings , and as many as were of a free heart burned offerings .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	32	And the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought was threescore and ten bullocks , a hundred rams , and two hundred lambs . All these were for a burnt offering to the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	33	And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	34	But the priests were too few , so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings . Therefore their brethren the Levites helped them till the work was ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves ; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	35	And also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace offerings , and the drink offerings for every burnt offering . So the service of the house of the Lord was set in order .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	29	36	And Hezekiah rejoiced , and all the people , that God had prepared the people ; for the thing was done suddenly .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	2	For the king had taken counsel with his princes and all the congregation in Jerusalem to keep the Passover in the second month .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	30	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem to keep the Passover unto the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	3	For they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently , neither had the people gathered themselves together at Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	4	And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	5	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel , from Beersheba even to Dan , that they should come to keep the Passover unto the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem ; for they had not done it for a long time in such manner as it was written .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	6	So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah , and according to the commandment of the king , saying , “ Ye children of Israel , turn again unto the Lord God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , and He will return to the remnant of you that have escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	7	And be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren who trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers , so that He therefore gave them up to desolation , as ye see .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	8	Now be ye not stiffnecked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the Lord and enter into His sanctuary , which He hath sanctified for ever ; and serve the Lord your God , that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	9	For if ye turn again unto the Lord , your brethren and your children shall find compassion before those who lead them captive , so that they shall come again into this land ; for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful , and will not turn away His face from you if ye return unto Him. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	10	So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh , even unto Zebulun ; but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	11	Nevertheless some from Asher and Manasseh and from Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	12	Also the hand of God was in Judah , to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	13	And there assembled at Jerusalem many people to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month , a very great congregation .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	14	And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the Brook Kidron .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	15	Then they killed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month ; and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	16	And they stood in their place according to their order , according to the law of Moses the man of God . The priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	17	For there were many in the congregation who were not sanctified : therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the Passover lambs for every one who was not clean , to sanctify them unto the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	18	For a multitude of the people , even many from Ephraim , and Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun had not cleansed themselves , yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it was written . But Hezekiah prayed for them , saying , “ The good Lord pardon every one
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	19	who prepareth his heart to seek God , the Lord God of his fathers , though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	20	And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah , and healed the people .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	21	And the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness ; and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	22	And Hezekiah spoke comfortingly unto all the Levites who taught the good knowledge of the Lord ; and they ate throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings and making confession to the Lord God of their fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	23	And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days , and they kept another seven days with gladness .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	24	For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep , and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep ; and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	25	And all the congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers who came out of the land of Israel and who dwelt in Judah rejoiced .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem ; for since the time of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel , there was not the like in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	30	27	Then the priests , the Levites , arose and blessed the people ; and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place , even unto heaven .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	2	And Hezekiah appointed the watches of the priests and the Levites according to their courses , every man according to his service , the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings , to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	31	Now when all this was finished , all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah , and broke the images in pieces , and cut down the Asherah poles , and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin , in Ephraim also and Manasseh , until they had utterly destroyed them all . Then all the children of Israel returned , every man to his possession , into their own cities .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	3	He appointed also the king ’ s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings , to wit : for the morning and evening burnt offerings , and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and for the new moons and for the set feasts , as it is written in the law of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	4	Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	5	And as soon as the commandment came abroad , the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn , wine , and oil , and honey , and of all the increase of the field ; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	6	And concerning the children of Israel and Judah , who dwelt in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep , and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the Lord their God , and laid them in heaps .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	7	In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	8	And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps , they blessed the Lord and His people Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	9	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	10	And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him and said , “ Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord , we have had enough to eat and have left plenty ; for the Lord hath blessed His people , and that which is left is this great store .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	11	Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare storage chambers in the house of the Lord ; and they prepared them ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	12	and faithfully brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things , over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler and Shimei his brother was the next .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	13	And Jehiel , and Azaziah , and Nahath , and Asahel , and Jerimoth , and Jozabad , and Eliel , and Ismachiah , and Mahath , and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother at the commandment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	14	And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite , the gatekeeper toward the east , was over the freewill offerings of God to distribute the oblations of the Lord and the most holy things .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	15	And next to him were Eden , and Miniamin , and Jeshua , and Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests , in their set office , to give to their brethren by courses , as well to the great as to the small ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	16	besides their genealogy of males from three years old and upward , even unto every one who entereth into the house of the Lord , his daily portion for their service in their charges , according to their courses ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	17	both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers , and the Levites from twenty years old and upward , in their charges by their courses ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	18	and to the genealogy of all their little ones , their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , through all the congregation ; for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	20	And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah , and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the Lord his God .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	31	21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God , and in the law and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prospered .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	2	And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come , and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his goodness , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	3	he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were outside the city ; and they helped him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	4	So there were gathered many people together , who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land , saying , “ Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water ? ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	5	Also he strengthened himself , and built up all the wall that was broken , and raised it up to the towers , and another wall outside , and repaired Millo in the City of David , and made darts and shields in abundance .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	6	And he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and spoke comfortingly to them , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	7	“ Be strong and courageous . Be not afraid nor dismayed by the king of Assyria and all the multitude that is with him , for there are more with us than with him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	8	With him is an arm of flesh , but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles. ” And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	9	After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem ( but he himself laid siege against Lachish , and all his power with him ) unto Hezekiah king of Judah , and unto all Judah who were at Jerusalem , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	10	“ Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria : ‘ Whereon do ye trust , that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	11	Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , “ The Lord our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ” ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	12	Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem , saying , “ Ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it ” ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	13	Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands ? Were the gods of the nations of those lands any way able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	14	Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	15	Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this manner , neither yet believe him ; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the hand of my fathers . How much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand ? ’ ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	16	And his servants spoke yet more against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	17	He wrote also letters to rail at the Lord God of Israel and to speak against Him , saying , “ As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand , so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	18	Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ’ speech unto the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall to frighten them and to trouble them , that they might take the city .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	19	And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the people of the earth , which were the work of the hands of man .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	20	And for this cause Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah , the son of Amoz , prayed and cried to heaven .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	21	And the Lord sent an angel who cut off all the mighty men of valor , and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria . So he returned with shame of face to his own land . And when he had come into the house of his god , those who came forth from his own loins slew him there with the sword .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	22	Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	23	And many brought gifts unto the Lord to Jerusalem , and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah , so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	24	In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death , and prayed unto the Lord ; and He spoke unto him , and He gave him a sign .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	25	But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him , for his heart was lifted up . Therefore there was wrath upon him , and upon Judah and Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	26	Notwithstanding , Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the rath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	27	And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor ; and he made himself treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for recious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all manner of pleasant jewels ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	28	storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and oil , and stalls for all manner of beasts , and cotes for flocks .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	29	Moreover he provided for himself cities , and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance ; for God had given him very much substance .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	30	This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon , and brought it straight down to the west side of the City of David . And Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	31	Howbeit , in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him to try him , that He might know all that was in his heart .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	32	33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchers of the sons of David ; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death . And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	2	But he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , like the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	33	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	3	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down , and he reared up altars for the Baalim , and made Asherah poles , and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	4	Also he built altars in the house of the Lord , whereof the Lord had said , “ In Jerusalem shall My name be for ever. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	6	And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom ; also he observed omens , and used enchantments , and used witchcraft , and dealt with mediums and with wizards . He wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke Him to anger .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	7	And he set a carved image , the idol which he had made , in the house of God , of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son , “ In this house and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel , will I put My name for ever ;
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	8	neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers , so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them , according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	9	So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err and to do worse than the heathen whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	10	And the Lord spoke to Manasseh and to his people , but they would not hearken .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	11	Therefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria , who took Manasseh among the thorns , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	12	And when he was in affliction , he besought the Lord his God , and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	13	and prayed unto Him ; and He was entreated by him and heard his supplication , and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom . Then Manasseh knew that the Lord , He was God .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	14	Now after this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of Gihon in the valley , even to the entrance at the Fish Gate , and it compassed about Ophel ; and he raised it up a very great height , and put captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	15	And he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the Lord , and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem , and cast them out of the city .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	16	And he repaired the altar of the Lord , and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings , and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	17	Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places , but unto the Lord their God only .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and his prayer unto his God , and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	19	His prayer also and how God was entreated by him , and all his sins and his trespass , and the places wherein he built high places and set up Asherah poles and graven images before he was humbled , behold , they are written among the sayings of the seers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers , and they buried him in his own house ; and Amon his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	21	Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned two years in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	22	But he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as did Manasseh his father ; for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made and served them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	23	And he humbled not himself before the Lord , as Manasseh his father had humbled himself ; but Amon trespassed more and more .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	24	And his servants conspired against him , and slew him in his own house .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	33	25	But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against King Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	34	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	3	For in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he began to seek after the God of David his father ; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places , and the Asherah poles , and the carved images , and the molten images .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	4	And they broke down the altars of the Baalim in his presence , and the sun images that were on high above them he cut down ; and the Asherah poles and the carved images and the molten images he broke in pieces , and made dust of them and strewed it upon the graves of those who had sacrificed unto them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	5	And he burned the bones of the priests upon their altars , and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	6	And so did he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon , even unto Naphtali , with their mattocks round about .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	7	And when he had broken down the altars and the Asherah poles , and had beaten the graven images into powder , and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel , he returned to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the Lord his God .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	9	And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest , they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God , which the Levites who kept the doors had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim , and from all the remnant of Israel , and from all Judah and Benjamin ; and they returned to Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	10	And they put it in the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the Lord ; and they gave it to the workmen who wrought in the house of the Lord to repair and mend the house .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	11	Even to the artificers and builders they gave it to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	12	And the men did the work faithfully . And the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites , of the sons of Merari , and Zechariah and Meshullam , of the sons of the Kohathites , to move it forward , and others of the Levites , all who had skill with instruments of music .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	13	Also they were over the bearers of burdens , and were overseers of all who wrought the work in any manner of service ; and of the Levites there were scribes and officers and doorkeepers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	14	And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	15	And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe , “ I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord. ” And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	16	And Shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king word back again , saying , “ All that was committed to thy servants , they do it .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	17	And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and to the hand of the workmen. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	18	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , “ Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. ” And Shaphan read it before the king .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	19	And it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he rent his clothes .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	20	And the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	21	“ Go , inquire of the Lord for me , and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah , concerning the words of the book that is found ; for great is the wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us , because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord , to do according to all that is written in this book. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	22	And Hilkiah and those whom the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college ) , and they spoke to her to that effect .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	23	And she answered them , “ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : Tell ye the man who sent you to Me ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	24	‘ Thus saith the Lord : Behold , I will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	25	because they have forsaken Me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands . Therefore My wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched. ’
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	26	And as for the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of the Lord , so shall ye say unto him , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard :
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	27	Because thine heart was tender , and thou didst humble thyself before God when thou heardest His words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof , and humbled thyself before Me , and didst rend thy clothes and weep before Me , I have even heard thee also , saith the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	28	Behold , I will gather thee to thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace , neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same. ’ ” So they brought the king word again .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	30	And the king went up into the house of the Lord , and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and the priests and the Levites , and all the people , great and small ; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	31	And the king stood in his place , and made a covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord , and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes , with all his heart and with all his soul , to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	32	And he caused all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it . And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	34	33	And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel , and made all who were present in Israel to serve , even to serve the Lord their God . And all his days they departed not from following the Lord , the God of their fathers .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	2	And he set the priests in their charges , and encouraged them to the service of the house of the Lord ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	35	Moreover Josiah kept a Passover unto the Lord in Jerusalem ; and they killed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	3	and said unto the Levites who taught all Israel , who were holy unto the Lord , “ Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David , king of Israel , built . It shall not be a burden upon your shoulders . Serve now the Lord your God and His people Israel ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	4	and prepare yourselves according to the houses of your fathers by your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	5	And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people and according to the division of the families of the Levites .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	6	So kill the Passover lamb , and sanctify yourselves and prepare your brethren , that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	7	And Josiah gave to the people lambs and kids from the flock , all for the Passover offerings for all who were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bullocks ; these were from the king ’ s substance .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	8	And his princes gave willingly unto the people , to the priests , and to the Levites . Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel , rulers of the house of God , gave unto the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	9	Conaniah also , and Shemaiah and Nethaneel , his brethren , and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad , chief of the Levites , gave unto the Levites for Passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	10	So the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place and the Levites in their courses , according to the king ’ s commandment .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	11	And they killed the Passover lamb , and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands , and the Levites flayed them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	12	And they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer unto the Lord , as it is written in the Book of Moses . And so did they with the oxen .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	13	And they roasted the Passover lamb with fire according to the ordinance ; but the other holy offerings boiled they in pots and in caldrons and in pans , and divided them speedily among all the people .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	14	And afterward they made ready for themselves and for the priests , because the priests , the sons of Aaron , were busied in offering burnt offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests , the sons of Aaron .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	15	And the singers , the sons of Asaph , were in their place , according to the commandment of David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun the king ’ s seer . And the doorkeepers waited at every gate ; they needed not depart from their service , for their brethren the Levites prepared for them .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	16	So all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord , according to the commandment of King Josiah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	17	And the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time , and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	18	And there was no Passover like to that kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet ; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept , and the priests and the Levites , and all Judah and Israel that were present , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	20	After all this , when Josiah had prepared the temple , Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates ; and Josiah went out against him .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	21	But he sent ambassadors to him , saying , “ What have I to do with thee , thou king of Judah ? I come not against thee this day , but against the house wherewith I have war ; for God commanded me to make haste . Forbear thee from meddling with God , who is with me , that He destroy thee not. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	22	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him , but disguised himself , that he might fight with him , and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God , and came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	23	And the archers shot at King Josiah ; and the king said to his servants , “ Take me away , for I am sorely wounded. ”
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	24	His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had , and they brought him to Jerusalem ; and he died , and was buried in one of the sepulchers of his fathers . And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	25	And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah . And all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day , and made them an ordinance in Israel ; and behold , they are written in the lamentations .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness , according to that which was written in the law of the Lord ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	35	27	and his deeds , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	2	Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	36	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and made him king in his father ’ s stead in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	3	And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem , and levied upon the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	4	And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem , and changed his name to Jehoiakim . And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother and carried him to Egypt .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	5	Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem ; and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	6	Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , and bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	7	Nebuchadnezzar also carried part of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah ; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	9	Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem ; and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	10	And when the year had expired , King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	11	Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	12	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God , and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet who spoke from the mouth of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	13	And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God ; but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	14	Moreover all the chief of the priests and the people transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen , and polluted the house of the Lord which He had hallowed in Jerusalem .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	15	And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by His messengers , rising up early , and sending , because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	16	But they mocked the messengers of God , and despised His words , and misused His prophets , until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people , till there was no remedy .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	17	Therefore He brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans , who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary , and had no compassion upon young man or maiden , old man , or him that stooped with age ; He gave them all into his hand .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	18	And all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king and of his princes , all these he brought to Babylon .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	19	And they burned the house of God , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem , and burned all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	20	And those who had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	21	to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah , until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths ; for as long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath , to fulfill threescore and ten years .
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	22	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing , saying ,
KJ21	2%20Chronicles	36	23	“ Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia : All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God of heaven given me ; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem , which is in Judah . Who is there among you of all His people ? The Lord his God be with him , and let him go up . ”
KJ21	Ezra	1	1	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled , the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing , saying ,
KJ21	Ezra	1	2	“ Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia : ‘ The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and He hath charged me to build Him a house at Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
KJ21	Ezra	1	3	Who is there among you of all His people ? His God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem , which is in Judah , and build the house of the Lord God of Israel ( He is the God ) , which is in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Ezra	1	4	And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth , let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold , and with goods and with beasts , besides the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezra	1	5	Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests and the Levites , with all those whose spirit God had raised , to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Ezra	1	6	And all those who were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , besides all that was willingly offered .
KJ21	Ezra	1	7	Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord , which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put them in the house of his gods ;
KJ21	Ezra	1	8	even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer , and counted them over to Sheshbazzar , the prince of Judah .
KJ21	Ezra	1	9	And this is the number of them : thirty chargers of gold , a thousand chargers of silver , nine and twenty knives ,
KJ21	Ezra	1	10	thirty basins of gold , four hundred and ten silver basins of a second sort , and other vessels a thousand .
KJ21	Ezra	1	11	All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with those of the captivity , who were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem .

KJ21	Ezra	2	57	the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth of Zebaim , the children of Ami .
KJ21	Ezra	2	58	All the Nethinim and the children of Solomon ’ s servants were three hundred ninety and two .
KJ21	Ezra	2	59	And these were they who went up from Telmelah , Telharsa , Cherub , Addan , and Immer ; but they could not show their father ’ s house and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
KJ21	Ezra	2	60	the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred fifty and two .
KJ21	Ezra	2	61	And of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
KJ21	Ezra	2	62	These sought their register among those who were reckoned by genealogy , but they were not found ; therefore were they as polluted , put from the priesthood .
KJ21	Ezra	2	63	And the Tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things until there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim .
KJ21	Ezra	2	64	The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore ,
KJ21	Ezra	2	65	besides their servants and their maids , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven ; and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women .
KJ21	Ezra	2	66	Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six , their mules two hundred forty and five ,
KJ21	Ezra	2	67	their camels four hundred thirty and five , their asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty .
KJ21	Ezra	2	68	And some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place .
KJ21	Ezra	2	69	They gave according to their ability to the treasury of the work , threescore and one thousand drams of gold , and five thousand pounds of silver , and one hundred priests ’ garments .
KJ21	Ezra	2	70	So the priests and the Levites and some of the people , and the singers and the gatekeepers and the Nethinim , dwelt in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
KJ21	Ezra	3	3	And they set the altar upon his bases , for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries ; and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
KJ21	Ezra	3	2	Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brethren the priests , and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brethren , and built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings thereon , as it is written in the law of Moses , the man of God .
KJ21	Ezra	3	4	They kept also the Feast of Tabernacles , as it is written , and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the custom , as the duty of every day required ;
KJ21	Ezra	3	5	and afterward offered the continual burnt offering , both of the new moons and of all the set feasts of the Lord that were consecrated , and of every one who willingly offered a freewill offering unto the Lord .
KJ21	Ezra	3	6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord . But the foundation of the temple of the Lord was not yet laid .
KJ21	Ezra	3	7	They gave money also unto the masons and to the carpenters , and meat and drink and oil unto those of Sidon and to those of Tyre , to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa , according to the grant that they had from Cyrus king of Persia .
KJ21	Ezra	3	8	Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem , in the second month , began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and the remnant of their brethren , the priests and the Levites , and all those who had come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem ; and they appointed the Levites from twenty years old and upward , to press forward the work of the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Ezra	3	9	Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren , Kadmiel and his sons , the sons of Judah together , to supervise the workmen in the house of God : the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brethren the Levites .
KJ21	Ezra	3	10	And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord , they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets , and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals to praise the Lord , according to the ordinance of David king of Israel .
KJ21	Ezra	3	11	And they sang together by course , praising and giving thanks unto the Lord : “ Because He is good , for His mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. ” And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord , because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid .
KJ21	Ezra	3	12	But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers who were elderly men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy ,
KJ21	Ezra	3	13	so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people ; for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the noise was heard afar off .
KJ21	Ezra	4	4	Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah , and troubled them in building ,
KJ21	Ezra	4	2	then they came to Zerubbabel and to the chief of the fathers , and said unto them , “ Let us build with you , for we seek your God as ye do ; and we have done sacrifice unto Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria , who brought us up hither. ”
KJ21	Ezra	4	3	But Zerubbabel and Jeshua , and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said unto them , “ Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house unto our God ; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel , as King Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. ”
KJ21	Ezra	4	5	and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of Darius king of Persia .
KJ21	Ezra	4	6	And in the reign of Ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , they wrote unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem .
KJ21	Ezra	4	7	And in the days of Artaxerxes , Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel and the rest of their companions wrote unto Artaxerxes king of Persia ; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue , and interpreted in the Syrian tongue .
KJ21	Ezra	4	8	Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king of this sort :
KJ21	Ezra	4	9	Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions , the Dinaites , the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Shushanites , the Dehavites , and the Elamites ,
KJ21	Ezra	4	10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnapper brought over and set in the cities of Samaria , and the rest who are on this side of the river and at such a time :
KJ21	Ezra	4	11	( This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him , even unto Artaxerxes the king . ) “ Thy servants , the men on this side of the river , and at such a time .
KJ21	Ezra	4	12	Be it known unto the king that the Jews who came up from thee to us have come unto Jerusalem , building the rebellious and the bad city , and have set up the walls thereof , and joined the foundations .
KJ21	Ezra	4	13	Be it known now unto the king that , if this city be built and the walls set up again , then they will not pay toll , tribute , and custom , and so thou shalt bring damage to the revenue of the kings .
KJ21	Ezra	4	14	Now because we have maintenance from the king ’ s palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king ’ s dishonor , therefore have we sent and certified this to the king ,
KJ21	Ezra	4	15	that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers . So shalt thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city , and hurtful unto kings and provinces , and that they have moved sedition within the same in old times , for which cause this city was destroyed .
KJ21	Ezra	4	16	We certify to the king that if this city be built again , and the walls thereof set up , by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side of the river. ”
KJ21	Ezra	4	17	Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor , and to Shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria , and unto the rest beyond the river : “ Peace , and at such a time .
KJ21	Ezra	4	18	The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me .
KJ21	Ezra	4	19	And I commanded , and search hath been made , and it is found that this city in old times hath made insurrection against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein .
KJ21	Ezra	4	20	There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem , who have ruled over all countries beyond the river ; and toll , tribute , and custom were paid unto them .
KJ21	Ezra	4	21	Give ye now command to cause these men to cease , and that this city be not built until another command shall be given from me .
KJ21	Ezra	4	22	Take heed now that ye fail not to do this . Why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ? ”
KJ21	Ezra	4	23	Now when the copy of King Artaxerxes ’ letter was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their companions , they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them cease by force and power .
KJ21	Ezra	4	24	Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem . So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia .
KJ21	Ezra	5	5	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to cease until the matter came to Darius , and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
KJ21	Ezra	5	2	Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem ; and with them were the prophets of God helping them .
KJ21	Ezra	5	3	At the same time came to them Tattenai , governor on this side of the river , and Shetharboznai and their companions , and said thus unto them : “ Who hath commanded you to build this house , and to make up this wall ? ”
KJ21	Ezra	5	4	Then said we unto them in this manner : “ What are the names of the men who make this building ? ”
KJ21	Ezra	5	6	The copy of the letter that Tattenai , governor on this side of the river , and Shetharboznai , and his companions the Apharsachites , who were on this side of the river , sent unto Darius the king —
KJ21	Ezra	5	7	they sent a letter unto him , wherein was written thus : “ Unto Darius the king , all peace .
KJ21	Ezra	5	8	Be it known unto the king that we went into the province of Judea to the house of the great God , which is built with great stones , and timber is laid in the walls , and this work goeth fast on and prospereth in their hands .
KJ21	Ezra	5	9	Then asked we those elders , and said unto them thus : ‘ Who commanded you to build this house , and to make up these walls ? ’
KJ21	Ezra	5	10	We asked their names also , to inform thee , that we might write the names of the men who were the chief of them .
KJ21	Ezra	5	11	And thus they returned us answer , saying , ‘ We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth , and build the house that was built these many years ago , which a great king of Israel built and set up .
KJ21	Ezra	5	12	But after our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house and carried the people away into Babylon .
KJ21	Ezra	5	13	But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon , the same King Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God .
KJ21	Ezra	5	14	And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought them into the temple of Babylon , those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar , whom he had made governor .
KJ21	Ezra	5	15	And he said unto him , “ Take these vessels ; go , carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let the house of God be built in his place. ”
KJ21	Ezra	5	16	Then came the same Sheshbazzar , and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem . And since that time even until now hath it been in building , and yet it is not finished. ’
KJ21	Ezra	5	17	Now therefore , if it seem good to the king , let there be search made in the king ’ s treasure house which is there at Babylon , whether it be so that a decree was made by Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem ; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter . ”
KJ21	Ezra	6	6	“ Now therefore , Tattenai , governor beyond the river , Shetharboznai , and your companions the Apharsachites , who are beyond the river , be ye far from thence .
KJ21	Ezra	6	2	And there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of the Medes , a scroll , and therein was a record thus written :
KJ21	Ezra	6	3	“ In the first year of Cyrus the king , the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem : Let the house be built , the place where they offered sacrifices , and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid — the height thereof threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof threescore cubits ,
KJ21	Ezra	6	4	with three rows of great stones , and a row of new timber — and let the expenses be given out of the king ’ s house .
KJ21	Ezra	6	5	And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem and brought unto Babylon , be restored and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem , every one to his place , and place them in the house of God .
KJ21	Ezra	6	7	Let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place .
KJ21	Ezra	6	8	Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do for the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God : that of the king ’ s goods , even of the tribute beyond the river , forthwith expenses be given unto these men , that they be not hindered .
KJ21	Ezra	6	9	And that which they have need of — both young bullocks and rams and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven , wheat , salt , wine , and oil , according to the appointment of the priests who are at Jerusalem — let it be given them day by day without fail ,
KJ21	Ezra	6	10	that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors unto the God of heaven , and pray for the life of the king and of his sons .
KJ21	Ezra	6	11	Also I have made a decree , that whosoever shall alter this word , let timber be pulled down from his house , and being set up , let him be hanged thereon ; and let his house be made a dunghill for this .
KJ21	Ezra	6	12	And the God who hath caused His name to dwell there , destroy all kings and people who shall put forth their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem . I Darius have made a decree . Let it be done with speed. ”
KJ21	Ezra	6	13	Then Tattenai , governor on this side of the river , Shetharboznai and their companions , according to that which Darius the king had sent , so they did speedily .
KJ21	Ezra	6	14	And the elders of the Jews built , and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Idd . And they built and finished it , according to the commandment of the God of Israel , and according to the commandment of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes king of Persia .
KJ21	Ezra	6	15	And this house was finished on the third day of the month of Adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king .
KJ21	Ezra	6	16	And the children of Israel , the priests and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy ,
KJ21	Ezra	6	17	and offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs , and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve hegoats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
KJ21	Ezra	6	18	And they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem , as it is written in the Book of Moses .
KJ21	Ezra	6	19	And the children of the captivity kept the Passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month .
KJ21	Ezra	6	20	For the priests and the Levites were purified together ; all of them were pure , and killed the Passover lamb for all the children of the captivity , and for their brethren the priests , and for themselves .
KJ21	Ezra	6	21	And the children of Israel , who had come again out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land to seek the Lord God of Israel , ate ,
KJ21	Ezra	6	22	and kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy ; for the Lord had made them joyful , and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God , the God of Israel .
KJ21	Ezra	7	7	And there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests and the Levites , and the singers and the gatekeepers , and the Nethinim , unto Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
KJ21	Ezra	7	2	the son of Shallum , the son of Zadok , the son of Ahitub ,
KJ21	Ezra	7	3	the son of Amariah , the son of Azariah , the son of Meraioth ,
KJ21	Ezra	7	4	the son of Zerahiah , the son of Uzzi , the son of Bukki ,
KJ21	Ezra	7	5	the son of Abishua , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the chief priest ”
KJ21	Ezra	7	6	this Ezra went up from Babylon ; and he was a ready scribe in the Law of Moses , which the Lord God of Israel had given . And the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him .
KJ21	Ezra	7	8	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
KJ21	Ezra	7	9	For upon the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
KJ21	Ezra	7	10	For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments .
KJ21	Ezra	7	11	Now this is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest , the scribe , even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the Lord and of His statutes to Israel :
KJ21	Ezra	7	12	“ Artaxerxes , king of kings , unto Ezra the priest , a scribe of the law of the God of heaven . Perfect peace , and at such a time .
KJ21	Ezra	7	13	I make a decree that all those of the people of Israel and of his priests and Levites in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
KJ21	Ezra	7	14	Inasmuch as thou art sent by the king and by his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand ,
KJ21	Ezra	7	15	and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered unto the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
KJ21	Ezra	7	16	and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem ”
KJ21	Ezra	7	17	thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks , rams , lambs , with their meat offerings and their drink offerings , and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Ezra	7	18	And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do after the will of your God .
KJ21	Ezra	7	19	The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God , those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Ezra	7	20	And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God , which thou shalt have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king ’ s treasure house .
KJ21	Ezra	7	21	“ And I , even I Artaxerxes the king , do make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the river , that whatsoever Ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the God of heaven , shall require of you , it be done speedily ,
KJ21	Ezra	7	22	up to a hundred talents of silver , and to a hundred measures of wheat , and to a hundred baths of wine , and to a hundred baths of oil , and salt without prescribing how much .
KJ21	Ezra	7	23	Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven . For why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
KJ21	Ezra	7	24	Also we inform you , that concerning any of the priests and Levites , singers , gatekeepers , Nethinim , or ministers of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose toll , tribute , or custom upon them .
KJ21	Ezra	7	25	“ And thou , Ezra , according to the wisdom of thy God that is in thine hand , set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people who are beyond the river , all such as know the laws of thy God ; and teach ye those who know them not .
KJ21	Ezra	7	26	And whosoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of the king , let judgment be executed speedily upon him , whether it be unto death or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods or to imprisonment. ”
KJ21	Ezra	7	27	Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers , who hath put such a thing as this in the king ’ s heart , to beautify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem ,
KJ21	Ezra	7	28	and hath extended mercy unto me before the king and his counselors , and before all the king ’ s mighty princes . And I was strengthened as the hand of the Lord my God was upon me , and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me .
KJ21	Ezra	8	8	and of the sons of Shephatiah , Zebadiah the son of Michael , and with him fourscore males ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	2	Of the sons of Phinehas , Gershom ; of the sons of Ithamar , Daniel ; of the sons of David , Hattush ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	3	of the sons of Shecaniah , of the sons of Parosh , Zechariah ; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males , a hundred and fifty .
KJ21	Ezra	8	4	Of the sons of Pahathmoab , Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah , and with him two hundred males .
KJ21	Ezra	8	5	Of the sons of Shecaniah , the son of Jahaziel , and with him three hundred males ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	6	of the sons also of Adin , Ebed the son of Jonathan , and with him fifty males ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	7	and of the sons of Elam , Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah , and with him seventy males ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	9	of the sons of Joab , Obadiah the son of Jehiel , and with him two hundred and eighteen males ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	10	and of the sons of Shelomith , the son of Josiphiah , and with him a hundred and threescore males ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	11	and of the sons of Bebai , Zechariah the son of Bebai , and with him twenty and eight males ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	12	and of the sons of Azgad , Johanan the son of Hakkatan , and with him a hundred and ten males ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	13	and of the last sons of Adonikam , whose names are these — Eliphelet , Jeiel , and Shemaiah — and with them threescore males ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	14	of the sons also of Bigvai , Uthai and Zabbud , and with them seventy males .
KJ21	Ezra	8	15	And I gathered them together at the river that runneth to Ahava ; and there abode we in tents three days . And I viewed the people and the priests , and found there none of the sons of Levi .
KJ21	Ezra	8	16	Then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib and for Elnathan , men of understanding .
KJ21	Ezra	8	17	And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia , and I told them what they should say unto Iddo and to his brethren the Nethinim at the place Casiphia , that they should bring unto u ministers for the house of our God .
KJ21	Ezra	8	18	And by the good hand of our God upon us , they brought us a man of understanding of the sons of Mahli , the son of Levi , the son of Israel , and Sherebiah , with his sons and his brethren , eighteen ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	19	and Hashabiah , and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari , his brethren and their sons , twenty ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	20	also of the Nethinim , whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinim ; all of them were expressed by name .
KJ21	Ezra	8	21	Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava , that we might humble ourselves before our God , to seek of Him a right way for us and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
KJ21	Ezra	8	22	For I was ashamed to request of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the way , because we had spoken unto the king , saying , “ The hand of our God is upon all those for good who seek Him , but His power and His wrath is against all those who forsake Him. ”
KJ21	Ezra	8	23	So we fasted and besought our God for this ; and He was entreated by us .
KJ21	Ezra	8	24	Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests —Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their brethren with them —
KJ21	Ezra	8	25	and weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels , even the offering of the house of our God , which the king and his counselors and his lords and all Israel there present had offered .
KJ21	Ezra	8	26	I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver , and silver vessels a hundred talents , and of gold a hundred talents ;
KJ21	Ezra	8	27	also twenty basins of gold of a thousand drams , and two vessels of fine copper , precious as gold .
KJ21	Ezra	8	28	And I said unto them , “ Ye are holy unto the Lord ; the vessels are holy also ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the Lord God of your fathers .
KJ21	Ezra	8	29	Watch ye , and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites , and chief of the fathers of Israel at Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Ezra	8	30	So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God .
KJ21	Ezra	8	31	Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go unto Jerusalem ; and the hand of our God was upon us , and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from such as lay in wait by the way .
KJ21	Ezra	8	32	And we came to Jerusalem , and stayed there three days .
KJ21	Ezra	8	33	Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest , and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas , and with them were the Levites , Jozabad the son of Jeshua , and Noadiah the son of Binnui .
KJ21	Ezra	8	34	By number and by weight of every one , the weight of all was written down at that time .
KJ21	Ezra	8	35	Also the children of those who had been carried away , who had come out of the captivity , offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel : twelve bullocks for all Israel , ninety and six rams , seventy and seven lambs , twelve hegoats for a sin offering ; all this was a burnt offering unto the Lord .
KJ21	Ezra	8	36	And they delivered the king ’ s commissions unto the king ’ s lieutenants , and to the governors on this side of the river ; and they furthered the people and the house of God .
KJ21	Ezra	9	9	For we were bondmen ; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage , but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia , to give us a reviving to set up the house of our God and to repair the desolations thereof , and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Ezra	9	2	For they have taken their daughters for themselves and for their sons , so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands ; yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. ”
KJ21	Ezra	9	3	And when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down stunned .
KJ21	Ezra	9	4	Then were assembled unto me every one who trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of the transgression of those who had been carried away ; and I sat dismayed until the evening sacrifice .
KJ21	Ezra	9	5	And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God ,
KJ21	Ezra	9	6	and said : “ O my God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to Thee , my God ; for our iniquities are increased over our head , and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens .
KJ21	Ezra	9	7	Since the days of our fathers we have been in a great trespass unto this day ; and for our iniquities have we , our kings , and our priests , been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands , to the sword , to captivity , and to a spoil , and to confusion of face , as it is this day .
KJ21	Ezra	9	8	And now for a little space grace hath been shown from the Lord our God , to leave us a remnant to escape , and to give us a constant and sure abode in His holy place , that our God may lighten our eyes , and give us a little reviving in our bondage .
KJ21	Ezra	9	10	“ And now , O our God , what shall we say after this ? For we have forsaken Thy commandments ,
KJ21	Ezra	9	11	which Thou hast commanded by Thy servants the prophets , saying , ‘ The land unto which ye go to possess it , is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands , with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness .
KJ21	Ezra	9	12	Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons , neither take their daughters unto your sons , nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever , that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land , and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. ’
KJ21	Ezra	9	13	And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass , seeing that Thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve , and hast given us such deliverance as this ,
KJ21	Ezra	9	14	should we again break Thy commandments and join in affinity with the people of these abominations ? Wouldest not Thou be angry with us until Thou hadst consumed us , so that there should be no remnant nor escaping ?
KJ21	Ezra	9	15	O Lord God of Israel , Thou art righteous , for we remain yet escaped , as it is this day . Behold , we are before Thee in our trespasses , for we can not stand before Thee because of this . ”
KJ21	Ezra	10	10	And Ezra the priest stood up , and said unto them , “ Ye have transgressed and have taken foreign wives , to increase the trespass of Israel .
KJ21	Ezra	10	2	And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , answered and said unto Ezra , “ We have trespassed against our God , and have taken foreign wives of the people of the land . Yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
KJ21	Ezra	10	3	Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and such as are born of them , according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God ; and let it be done according to the law .
KJ21	Ezra	10	4	Arise , for this matter belongeth unto thee ; we also will be with thee . Be of good courage , and do it. ”
KJ21	Ezra	10	5	Then arose Ezra , and made the chief priests , the Levites , and all Israel to swear that they should do according to this word . And they swore .
KJ21	Ezra	10	6	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God , and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib . And when he came thither , he ate no bread nor drank water , for he mourned because of the transgression of those who had been carried away .
KJ21	Ezra	10	7	And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem ,
KJ21	Ezra	10	8	and that whosoever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the congregation of those who had been carried away .
KJ21	Ezra	10	9	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days . It was the ninth month , on the twentieth day of the month ; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God , trembling because of this matter and because of the great rain .
KJ21	Ezra	10	11	Now therefore make confession unto the Lord God of your fathers , and do His pleasure , and separate yourselves from the people of the land and from the foreign wives. ”
KJ21	Ezra	10	12	Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice , “ As thou hast said , so must we do .
KJ21	Ezra	10	13	But the people are many , and it is a time of much rain , and we are not able to stand outside , neither is this a work of one day or two ; for we are many who have transgressed in this thing .
KJ21	Ezra	10	14	Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand , and let all those who have taken foreign wives in our cities come at appointed times , and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof , until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us. ”
KJ21	Ezra	10	15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah stood against this matter , and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them .
KJ21	Ezra	10	16	And the children of the captivity did so . And Ezra the priest , with certain chief of the fathers , were separated according to the house of their fathers , and all of them by their names . And they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter ,
KJ21	Ezra	10	17	and they made an end with all the men who had taken foreign wives by the first day of the first month .
KJ21	Ezra	10	18	And among the sons of the priests who had taken foreign wives ( namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brethren ) , there were found : Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
KJ21	Ezra	10	19	And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass .
KJ21	Ezra	10	20	And of the sons of Immer : Hanani and Zebadiah ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	21	and of the sons of Harim : Maaseiah and Elijah , and Shemaiah , and Jehiel , and Uzziah ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	22	and of the sons of Pashhur : Elioenai , Maaseiah , Ishmael , Nethaneel , Jozabad , and Elasah ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	23	also of the Levites : Jozabad , and Shimei , and Kelaiah ( the same is Kelita ) , Pethahiah , Judah , and Eliezer ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	24	of the singers also : Eliashib ; and of the gatekeepers : Shallum and Telem , and Uri ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	25	moreover of Israel : of the sons of Parosh : Ramiah and Jeziah , and Malchiah , and Mijamin , and Eleazar , and Malchijah , and Benaiah ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	26	and of the sons of Elam : Mattaniah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , and Abdi , and Jeremoth , and Eliah ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	27	and of the sons of Zattu : Elioenai , Eliashib , Mattaniah , and Jeremoth , and Zabad , and Aziza ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	28	of the sons also of Bebai : Jehohanan , Hananiah , Zabbai , and Athlai ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	29	and of the sons of Bani : Meshullam , Malluch , and Adaiah , Jashub , and Sheal , and Ramoth ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	30	and of the sons of Pahathmoab : Adna , and Chelal , Benaiah , Maaseiah , Mattaniah , Bezaleel , and Binnui , and Manasseh ;
KJ21	Ezra	10	31	and of the sons of Harim : Eliezer , Ishijah , Malchiah , Shemaiah , Shimeon ,
KJ21	Ezra	10	32	Benjamin , Malluch and Shemariah ;

KJ21	Ezra	10	44	All these had taken foreign wives ; and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	1	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah . And it came to pass in the month of Chislev , in the twentieth year , as I was in the palace at Shushan ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	2	that Hanani one of my brethren came , he and certain men of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left behind from the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	3	And they said unto me , “ The remnant who are left behind from the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach . The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and the gates thereof are burned with fire. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	4	And it came to pass when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days and fasted , and prayed before the God of heaven
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	5	and said : “ I beseech thee , O Lord God of heaven , the great and fearsome God , who keepeth covenant and mercy for those who love Him and observe His commandments ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	6	let Thine ear now be attentive and Thine eyes open , that Thou mayest hear the prayer of Thy servant , which I pray before Thee now day and night for the children of Israel Thy servants , and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against Thee . Both I and my father ’ s house have sinned .
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	7	We have dealt very corruptly against Thee , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the judgments which Thou commanded Thy servant Moses .
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	8	Remember , I beseech Thee , the word that Thou commanded Thy servant Moses , saying , ‘ If ye transgress , I will scatter you abroad among the nations ;
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	9	but if ye turn unto Me , and keep My commandments and do them , though there were some of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven , yet will I gather them from thence , and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set My name there. ’
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	10	Now these are Thy servants and Thy people , whom Thou hast redeemed by Thy great power and by Thy strong hand .
KJ21	Nehemiah	1	11	O Lord , I beseech Thee , let now Thine ear be attentive to the prayer of Thy servant , and to the prayer of Thy servants who desire to fear Thy name ; and prosper , I pray Thee , Thy servant this day , and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. ” For I was the king ’ s cupbearer .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	2	Therefore the king said unto me , “ Why is thy countenance sad , seeing thou art not sick ? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart. ” Then I was very sore afraid ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	3	and said unto the king , “ Let the king live for ever . Why should not my countenance be sad when the city , the place of my fathers ’ sepulchers , lieth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ? ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	4	Then the king said unto me , “ For what dost thou make request ? ” So I prayed to the God of heaven .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	5	And I said unto the king , “ If it please the king , and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight , that thou wouldest send me unto Judah , unto the city of my fathers ’ sepulchers , that I may build it. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	6	And the king said unto me ( the queen also sitting by him ) , “ For how long shall thy journey be ? And when wilt thou return ? ” So it pleased the king to send me , and I set him a time .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	7	Moreover I said unto the king , “ If it please the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river , that they may convey me over until I come into Judah ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	8	also a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king ’ s forest , that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house , and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into. ” And the king granted me , according to the good hand of my God upon me .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	9	Then I came to the governors beyond the river , and gave them the king ’ s letters . Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	10	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	11	So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	12	And I arose in the night , I and some few men with me . Neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem ; neither was there any beast with me , except the beast that I rode upon .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	13	And I went out by night by the Gate of the Valley , even before the Dragon Well and to the dung port , and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down , and the gates thereof were consumed with fire .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	14	Then I went on to the Gate of the Fountain and to the King ’ s Pool , but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	15	Then went I up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall , and turned back and entered by the Gate of the Valley , and so returned .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	16	And the rulers knew not whither I went or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest who did the work .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	17	Then said I unto them , “ Ye see the distress that we are in , how Jerusalem lieth waste , and the gates thereof are burned with fire . Come , and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we be no more a reproach. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	18	Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me , as also the king ’ s words that he had spoken unto me . And they said , “ Let us rise up and build. ” So they strengthened their hands for this good work .
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	19	But when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian heard it , they laughed us to scorn and despised us , and said , “ What is this thing that ye do ? Will ye rebel against the king ? ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	2	20	Then answered I them and said unto them , “ The God of heaven , He will prosper us . Therefore we His servants will arise and build ; but ye have no portion , nor right , nor memorial in Jerusalem . ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	3	But the Fish Gate did the sons of Hassenaah build , who also laid the beams thereof and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof and the bars thereof .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	2	And next to him built the men of Jericho . And next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri .

KJ21	Nehemiah	3	5	And next unto them the Tekoites repaired ; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord .

KJ21	Nehemiah	3	8	Next unto him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah , of the goldsmiths , repaired . Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries ; and they fortified Jerusalem unto the Broad Wall .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	9	And next unto them Rephaiah the son of Hur , the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem , repaired .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	10	And next unto them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph repaired , even opposite his house . And next unto him Hattush the son of Hashabniah repaired .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	11	Malchijah the son of Harim and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab repaired the other piece , and the Tower of the Furnaces .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	12	And next unto him Shallum the son of Hallohesh , the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem , repaired — he and his daughters .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	13	The Valley Gate was repaired by Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah ; they built it and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof and the bars thereof , and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the Dung Gate .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	14	But Malchijah the son of Rechab , the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem repaired the Dung Gate ; he built it and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof and the bars thereof .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	15	But the Gate of the Fountain Shallun the son of Colhozeh , the ruler of part of Mizpah , repaired ; he built it and covered it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof and the bars thereof , and the wall of the Pool of Shelah by the king ’ s garden and unto the stairs that go down from the City of David .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	16	After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk , the ruler of the half part of Bethzur , repaired unto the place opposite the sepulchers of David , and to the pool that was made and unto the House of the Mighty .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	17	After him repaired the Levites , Rehum the son of Bani . Next unto him repaired Hashabiah , the ruler of the half part of Keilah , in his part .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	18	After him repaired their brethren , Bavai the son of Henadad , the ruler of the half part of Keilah .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	19	And next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , repaired another piece opposite the ascent to the armory at the turning of the wall .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	20	After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece , from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	21	After him Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz repaired another piece , from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	22	And after him repaired the priests , the men of the plain .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	23	After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub opposite their house . After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ananiah , by his house .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	24	After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another piece , from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall , even unto the corner .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	25	Palal the son of Uzai made repairs opposite the turning of the wall , and the tower which lieth out from the king ’ s high house that was by the court of the prison ; after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	26	Moreover the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel unto the place opposite the Water Gate toward the east , and the tower that lieth out .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	27	After them the Tekoites repaired another piece , opposite the great tower that lieth out , even unto the wall of Ophel .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	28	From above the Horse Gate repaired the priests , every one opposite his house .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	29	After them Zadok the son of Immer repaired opposite his house . After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah , the keeper of the East Gate .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	30	After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph repaired another piece . After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah opposite his chamber .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	31	After him Malchijah the goldsmith ’ s son repaired unto the place of the Nethinim and of the merchants , opposite the Gate Miphkad and to the ascent of the corner chamber .
KJ21	Nehemiah	3	32	And between the ascent of the corner unto the Sheep Gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	4	Hear , O our God , for we are despised ; and turn their reproach upon their own head , and give them as a prey in the land of captivity .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	2	And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria , and said , “ What are these feeble Jews doing ? Will they fortify themselves ? Will they make sacrifice ? Will they finish it in a day ? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned ? ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	3	Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him , and he said , “ Indeed that which they build , if a fox go up , even he shall break down their stone wall. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	5	And cover not their iniquity , and let not their sin be blotted out from before Thee ; for they have provoked Thee to anger before the builders .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	6	So built we the wall ; and all the wall was joined together unto half its height , for the people had a mind to work .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	7	But it came to pass that when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being rebuilt , and that the breaches began to be stopped , then they were very wroth ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	8	and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	9	Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God , and set a watch against them day and night , because of them .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	10	And Judah said , “ The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed , and there is much rubbish , so that we are not able to build the wall. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	11	And our adversaries said , “ They shall not know , neither see , until we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	12	And it came to pass that when the Jews who dwelt by them came , they said unto us ten times , “ From all places whence ye shall return unto us , they will be upon you. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	13	Therefore set I men in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places ; I even set the people by families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	14	And I looked , and rose up , and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people , “ Be not ye afraid of them ; remember the Lord , who is great and fearsome , and fight for your brethren , your sons and your daughters , your wives and your houses. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	15	And it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	16	And it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servants wrought in the work , and the other half of them held both the spears , the shields and the bows and the jackets of mail ; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	17	Those who built on the wall and those who bore burdens with those who loaded — every one with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	18	For the builders , every one , had his sword girded by his side , and so built . And he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	19	And I said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people , “ The work is great and large , and we are separated upon the wall , one far from another .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	20	In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet , resort ye thither unto us . Our God shall fight for us. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	21	So we labored in the work ; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared .
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	22	Likewise at the same time said I unto the people , “ Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and labor in the day. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	4	23	So neither I , nor my brethren , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard who followed me , none of us , put off our clothes , except that every one put them off for washing .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	5	Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren , our children as their children ; and lo , we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants , and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already ; neither is it in our power to redeem them , for other men have our lands and vineyards. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	2	For there were those who said , “ We , our sons and our daughters are many ; therefore we take up corn for them , that we may eat and live. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	3	There were some also who said , “ We have mortgaged our lands , vineyards , and houses , that we might buy corn because of the dearth. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	4	There were also those who said , “ We have borrowed money for the king ’ s tribute , and that upon our lands and vineyards .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	6	And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	7	Then I consulted with myself , and I rebuked the nobles and the rulers and said unto them , “ Ye exact usury , every one from his brother. ” And I set a great assembly against them .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	8	And I said unto them , “ We , according to our ability , have redeemed our brethren the Jews who were sold unto the heathen . And will ye even sell your brethren ? Or shall they be sold unto us ? ” Then they held their peace , and found nothing to answer .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	9	Also I said , “ It is not good what ye do . Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen , our enemies ?
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	10	I likewise , and my brethren and my servants , might exact from them money and corn ; I pray you , let us leave off this usury .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	11	Restore , I pray you , to them even this day their lands , their vineyards , their oliveyards , and their houses , also the hundredth part of the money and of the corn , the wine , and the oil that ye exact from them. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	12	Then said they , “ We will restore them , and will require nothing of them . So will we do as thou sayest. ” Then I called the priests and took an oath from them , that they should do according to this promise .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	13	Also I shook my lap , and said , “ So God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who performeth not this promise ; eventhus be he shaken out and emptied. ” And all the congregation said , “ Amen , ” and praised the Lord . And the people did according to this promise .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	14	Moreover , from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah , from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king ( that is , twelve years ) , I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	15	But the former governors who had been before me were chargeable unto the people , and had taken from them bread and wine , besides forty shekels of silver . Yea , even their servants ruled over the people , but so did I not , because of the fear of God .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	16	Yea , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land ; and all my servants were gathered thither for the work .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	17	Moreover there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers , besides those who came unto us from among the heathen who are about us .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	18	Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep ; also fowls were prepared for me , and once in ten days , a store of all sorts of wine ; yet for all this I required not the bread of the governor , because the bondage was heavy upon this people .
KJ21	Nehemiah	5	19	Think upon me , my God , for good , according to all that I have done for this people .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	6	wherein was written : “ It is reported among the heathen , and Geshem saith it , that thou and the Jews think to rebel ; for which cause thou buildest the wall , that thou mayest be their king according to these words .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	2	that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me , saying , “ Come , let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. ” But they thought to do me mischief .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	3	And I sent messengers unto them , saying , “ I am doing a great work , so that I can not come down . Why should the work cease , whilst I leave it and come down to you ? ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	4	Yet they sent unto me four times in this manner , and I answered them in the same manner .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	5	Then Sanballat sent his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	7	And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem , saying , ‘ There is a king in Judah ! ’ And now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . Come now therefore , and let us take counsel together. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	8	Then I sent unto him , saying , “ There are no such things done as thou sayest , but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	9	For they all made us afraid , saying , “ Their hands shall be weakened from the work , that it be not done. ” Now therefore , O God , strengthen my hands .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	10	Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel , who was shut up ; and he said , “ Let us meet together in the house of God , within the temple , and let us shut the doors of the temple ; for they will come to slay thee , yea , in the night will they come to slay thee. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	11	And I said , “ Should such a man as I flee ? And who is there that , being as I am , would go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go in. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	12	And lo , I perceived that God had not sent him , but that he pronounced this prophecy against me ; for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	13	Therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have cause for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	14	My God , think Thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works , and on the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have put me in fear .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	15	So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month of Elul , in fifty and two days .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	16	And it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof , and all the heathen who were about us saw these things , they were much cast down in their own eyes ; for they perceived that this work was wrought by our God .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	17	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah , and the letters of Tobiah came unto them .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	18	For there were many in Judah sworn unto him , because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah , and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah .
KJ21	Nehemiah	6	19	Also they reported his good deeds before me , and uttered my words to him . And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear .
KJ21	Nehemiah	7	7	who came with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Bigvai , Nehum , Baanah . The number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this :
KJ21	Nehemiah	7	2	that I gave my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the ruler of the palace , charge over Jerusalem , for he was a faithful man and feared God above many .
KJ21	Nehemiah	7	3	And I said unto them , “ Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot ; and while they stand by , let them shut the doors and bar them . And appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem , every one in his watch , and every one to be opposite his house. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	7	4	Now the city was large and great , but the people were few therein , and the houses were not built .
KJ21	Nehemiah	7	5	And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles and the rulers and the people , that they might be reckoned by genealogy . And I found a register of the genealogy of those who came up at the first , and found written therein :
KJ21	Nehemiah	7	6	these are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity , of those who had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah , every one unto his city ,

KJ21	Nehemiah	8	8	So they read in the book , in the law of God , distinctly , and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading .
KJ21	Nehemiah	8	2	And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women , and all who could hear with understanding , upon the first day of the seventh month .
KJ21	Nehemiah	8	3	And he read therein before the street that was before the Water Gate from the morning until midday , before the men and the women and those who could understand ; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the Book of the Law .
KJ21	Nehemiah	8	4	And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose .

KJ21	Nehemiah	8	10	Then he said unto them , “ Go your way , eat the fat and drink the sweet , and send portions unto those for whom nothing is prepared , for this day is holy unto our Lord ; neither be ye sorry , for the joy of the Lord is your strength. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	8	11	So the Levites stilled all the people , saying , “ Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be ye grieved. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	8	12	And all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared unto them .

KJ21	Nehemiah	8	16	So the people went forth , and brought them and made themselves booths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the Water Gate and in the street of the Gate of Ephraim .
KJ21	Nehemiah	8	17	And all the congregation of those who had come again out of the captivity made booths and sat under the booths ; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so . And there was very great gladness .
KJ21	Nehemiah	8	18	Also day by day , from the first day unto the last day , he read in the Book of the Law of God . And they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly , according unto the manner .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	9	and didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt , and heardest their cry by the Red Sea ;
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	2	And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers , and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	3	And they stood up in their place and read in the Book of the Law of the Lord their God for onefourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they confessed and worshiped the Lord their God .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	4	Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites , Jeshua and Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani , and cried with a loud voice unto the Lord their God .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	5	Then the Levites , Jeshua and Kadmiel , Bani , Hashabniah , Sherebiah , Hodijah , Shebaniah , and Pethahiah , said : “ Stand up and bless the Lord your God for ever and ever ! And blessed be Thy glorious name , which is exalted above all blessing and praise !
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	6	Thou , even Thou , art Lord alone ; Thou hast made heaven , the heaven of heavens with all their host , the earth and all things that are therein , the seas and all that is therein ; and Thou preservest them all ; and the host of heaven worshipeth Thee .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	7	Thou art the Lord the God , who didst choose Abram , and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gavest him the name of Abraham ;
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	8	and foundest his heart faithful before Thee , and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites and the Perizzites , and the Jebusites and the Girgashites—to give it , I say , to his seed , and hast performed Thy words , for Thou art righteous ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	10	and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh and on all his servants and on all the people of his land . For Thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them . So didst Thou get Thee a name , as it is this day .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	11	And Thou didst divide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and their persecutors Thou threwest into the deep , as a stone into the mighty waters .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	12	Moreover Thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar , and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way wherein they should go .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	13	Thou camest down also upon Mount Sinai and spokest with them from heaven , and gavest them right judgments and true laws , good statutes and commandments ;
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	14	and madest known unto them Thy holy Sabbath , and commandedst them precepts , statutes , and laws by the hand of Moses Thy servant ;
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	15	and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger , and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which Thou hadst sworn to give them .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	16	“ But they and our fathers dealt proudly , and hardened their necks and hearkened not to Thy commandments .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	17	And they refused to obey , neither were mindful of Thy wonders that Thou didst among them ; but hardened their necks , and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage . But Thou art a God ready to pardon , gracious and merciful , slow to anger and of great kindness , and forsookest them not .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	18	Yea , when they had made them a molten calf and said , ‘ This is thy God who brought thee up out of Egypt , ’ and had wrought great provocations ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	19	yet Thou in Thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness . The pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day , to lead them in the way ; neither the pillar of fire by night , to show them light and the way wherein they should go .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	20	Thou gavest also Thy good Spirit to instruct them , and withheldest not Thy manna from their mouth , and gavest them water for their thirst .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	21	Yea , forty years didst Thou sustain them in the wilderness , so that they lacked nothing ; their clothes waxed not old and their feet swelled not .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	22	Moreover Thou gavest them kingdoms and nations , and didst divide them into corners ; so they possessed the land of Sihon and the land of the king of Heshbon and the land of Og , king of Bashan .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	23	Their children also did Thou multiply as the stars of heaven , and broughtest them into the land which Thou hadst promised to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	24	So the children went in and possessed the land , and Thou did subdue before them the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , and gavest them into their hands , with their kings and the people of the land , that they might do with them as they would .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	25	And they took strong cities and a fat land , and possessed houses full of all goods , wells dug out , vineyards and olive yards , and fruit trees in abundance . So they ate , and were filled , and became fat , and delighted themselves in Thy great goodness .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	26	“ Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against Thee , and cast Thy law behind their backs , and slew Thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to Thee ; and they wrought great provocations .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	27	Therefore Thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies , who vexed them . And in the time of their trouble when they cried unto Thee , Thou heardest them from heaven ; and according to Thy manifold mercies Thou gavest them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their enemies .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	28	“ But after they had rest , they did evil again before Thee . Therefore leftest Thou them in the hand of their enemies , so that they had the dominion over them ; yet when they returned and cried unto Thee , Thou heardest them from heaven . And many times didst Thou deliver them according to Thy mercies ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	29	and testifiedst against them , that Thou mightest bring them again unto Thy law . Yet they dealt proudly and hearkened not unto Thy commandments , but sinned against Thy judgments ( which if a man do , he shall live in them ) , and withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	30	“ Yet many years didst Thou forbear them , and testifiedst against them by Thy Spirit in Thy prophets . Yet would they not give ear ; therefore gavest Thou them into the hand of the people of the lands .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	31	Nevertheless for Thy great mercies ’ sake Thou did not utterly consume them nor forsake them , for Thou art a gracious and merciful God .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	32	“ Now therefore , our God , the great , the mighty , and the fearsome God , who keepest covenant and mercy , let not all the trouble seem little before Thee that hath come upon us—on our kings , on our princes , and on our priests , and on our prophets , and on our fathers , and on all Thy people since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	33	Nevertheless , Thou art just in all that is brought upon us ; for Thou hast done right , but we have done wickedly .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	34	Neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers kept Thy law , nor hearkened unto Thy commandments and Thy testimonies , wherewith Thou didst testify against them .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	35	For they have not served Thee in their kingdom , and in Thy great goodness that Thou gavest them , and in the large and fat land which Thou gavest before them , neither turned they from their wicked works .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	36	Behold , we are servants this day ; and for the land that Thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof , behold , we are servants in it .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	37	And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom Thou hast set over us because of our sins ; also they have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
KJ21	Nehemiah	9	38	“ And because of all this , we make a sure covenant , and write it ; and our princes , Levites , and priests set their seal unto it . ”

KJ21	Nehemiah	12	24	And the chief of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brethren opposite them , to praise and to give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , watch opposite watch .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	25	Mattaniah and Bakbukiah , Obadiah , Meshullam , Talmon , Akkub , were porters keeping the watch at the thresholds of the gates .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	26	These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor , and of Ezra the priest , the scribe .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	27	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places , to bring them to Jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness , both with thanksgivings and with singing , with cymbals , psalteries , and with harps .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	28	And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together , both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	29	also from the house of Gilgal , and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth ; for the singers had built themselves villages round about Jerusalem .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	30	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves , and purified the people and the gates and the wall .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	31	Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of those who gave thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the Dung Gate ;
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	32	and after them went Hoshaiah and half of the princes of Judah ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	33	and Azariah , Ezra , and Meshullam ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	34	Judah , and Benjamin , and Shemaiah , and Jeremiah ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	35	and certain of the priests ’ sons with trumpets , namely , Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Michaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph ;
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	36	and his brethren , Shemaiah , and Azarel , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethaneel , and Judah , Hanani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God , and Ezra the scribe before them .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	37	And at the Fountain Gate , which was opposite them , they went up by the stairs of the City of David , at the going up of the wall , above the house of David , even unto the Water Gate eastward .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	38	And the other company of those who gave thanks went opposite them , and I after them with half of the people upon the wall , from beyond the Tower of the Furnaces even unto the Broad Wall ,
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	39	and from above the Gate of Ephraim and above the Old Gate , and above the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananeel and the Tower of Meah , even unto the Sheep Gate ; and they stood still at the Prison Gate .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	40	So stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in the house of God , and I , and half of the rulers with me ;
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	41	and the priests , Eliakim , Maaseiah , Miniamin , Michaiah , Elioenai , Zechariah , and Hananiah , with trumpets ;
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	42	and Maaseiah , and Shemaiah , and Eleazar , and Uzzi , and Jehohanan , and Malchijah , and Elam , and Ezer . And the singers sang loud , with Jezrahiah their overseer .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	43	Also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced , for God had made them rejoice with great joy ; the wives also and the children rejoiced , so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	44	And at that time some were appointed over the chambers of the treasuries for the offerings , for the firstfruits , and for the tithes , to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites ; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who waited .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	45	And both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the watch of their God and the watch of the purification , according to the commandment of David and of Solomon his son .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	46	For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chiefs of the singers , and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God .
KJ21	Nehemiah	12	47	And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers , every day his portion ; and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites , and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	13	And I made treasurers over the storehouses : Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe , and of the Levites , Pedaiah ; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur , the son of Mattaniah ; for they were counted faithful , and their office was to distribute unto their brethren .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	2	because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Balaam against them , that he should curse them . However that be , our God turned the curse into a blessing .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	3	Now it came to pass , when they had heard the law , that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	4	And before this , Eliashib the priest , having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God , was allied unto Tobiah .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	5	And he had prepared for him a great chamber , where previously they laid the meat offerings , the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of the corn , the new wine and the oil , which were commanded to be given to the Levites and the singers and the gatekeepers , and the offerings of the priests .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	6	But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem ; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came unto the king , and after certain days I obtained leave from the king .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	7	And I came to Jerusalem and learned of the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	8	And it grieved me sore ; therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	9	Then I commanded , and they cleansed the chambers ; and thither I brought back the vessels of the house of God , with the meat offering and the frankincense .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	10	And I perceived that the portions for the Levites had not been given them ; for the Levites and the singers who did the work had fled every one to his field .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	11	Then I contended with the rulers and said , “ Why is the house of God forsaken ? ” And I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	12	Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the storehouses .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	14	Remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for the offices thereof .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days I saw in Judah some treading of wine presses on the Sabbath , and bringing in sheaves and loading them on asses , as also wine , grapes , and figs , and all manner of burdens which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day . And I testified against them as to the day wherein they sold victuals .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	16	There dwelt men of Tyre also therein , who brought fish and all manner of wares , and sold on the Sabbath unto the children of Judah and in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	17	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah and said unto them , “ What evil thing is this that ye do , and profane the Sabbath day ?
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	18	Did not your fathers thus , and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city ? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath. ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	19	And it came to pass , when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath , that I commanded that the gates should be shut , and charged that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath ; and some of my servants I set at the gates , that there should no burden be brought in on the Sabbath day .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	20	So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	21	Then I testified against them and said unto them , “ Why lodge ye about the wall ? If ye do so again , I will lay hands on you. ” From that time forth they came no more on the Sabbath .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	22	And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sanctify the Sabbath day . Remember me , O my God , concerning this also , and spare me according to the greatness of Thy mercy .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	23	In those days also I saw Jews who had married wives of Ashdod , of Ammon , and of Moab ;
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	24	and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ’ language , but according to the language of each people .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	25	And I contended with them and cursed them , and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair , and made them swear by God , saying , “ Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons , nor take their daughters unto your sons or for yourselves .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things ? Yet among many nations was there no king like him , who was beloved of his God , and God made him king over all Israel : nevertheless even him did women from other lands cause to sin .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	27	Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil , to transgress against our God in marrying foreign wives ? ”
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	28	And one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite ; therefore I chased him from me .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	29	Remember them , O my God , because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites .
KJ21	Nehemiah	13	31	and for the wood offering at times appointed , and for the firstfruits . Remember me , O my God , for good .
KJ21	Esther	1	1	Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus ( this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia , over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces ) ,
KJ21	Esther	1	2	that in those days when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in the palace in Shushan ,
KJ21	Esther	1	3	in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants . The power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him ,
KJ21	Esther	1	4	he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days , even a hundred and fourscore days .
KJ21	Esther	1	5	And when these days had passed , the king made a feast unto all the people who were present in the palace at Shushan , both unto great and small , for seven days in the court of the garden of the king ’ s palace .
KJ21	Esther	1	6	There were white , green , and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings , and pillars of marble . The beds were of gold and silver , upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble .
KJ21	Esther	1	7	And they gave them drink in vessels of gold ( the vessels being diverse one from another ) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
KJ21	Esther	1	8	And the drinking was according to the law . None did compel , for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every man ’ s pleasure .
KJ21	Esther	1	9	Also , Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus .
KJ21	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day , when the heart of the king was merry with wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , and Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas , the seven chamberlains who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king ,
KJ21	Esther	1	11	to bring Vashti the queen before the king , with the crown royal , to show the people and the princes her beauty ; for she was fair to look on .
KJ21	Esther	1	12	But the queen , Vashti , refused to come at the king ’ s commandment brought by his chamberlains . Therefore was the king very wroth , and his anger burned in him .
KJ21	Esther	1	13	Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times ( for so was the king ’ s manner toward all who knew law and judgment ;
KJ21	Esther	1	14	and the next unto him were Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , and Memucan , the seven princes of Persia and Media , who saw the king ’ s face and who sat first in the kingdom ) :
KJ21	Esther	1	15	“ What shall we do unto Queen Vashti according to law , because she hath not performed the commandment of King Ahasuerus by the chamberlains ? ”
KJ21	Esther	1	16	And Memucan answered before the king and the princes : “ Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only , but also to all the princes and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus .
KJ21	Esther	1	17	For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , ‘ King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she came not. ’
KJ21	Esther	1	18	Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king ’ s princes , who have heard of the deed of the queen . Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
KJ21	Esther	1	19	If it please the king , let there go a royal commandment from him , and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes , that it be not altered , that Vashti come no more before King Ahasuerus ; and let the king give her royal estate unto another who is better than she .
KJ21	Esther	1	20	And when the king ’ s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire ( for it is great ) , all the wives shall give to their husbands honor , both to great and small. ”
KJ21	Esther	1	21	And the saying pleased the king and the princes , and the king did according to the word of Memucan .
KJ21	Esther	1	22	For he sent letters into all the king ’ s provinces , into every province according to the writing thereof , and to every people in their language , that every man should bear rule in his own house , and that it should be published according to the language of every people .
KJ21	Esther	2	2	Then said the king ’ s servants who ministered unto him , “ Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king ;
KJ21	Esther	2	3	and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom , that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto the palace at Shushan , to the house of the women unto the custody of Hegai the king ’ s chamberlain , keeper of the women ; and let their things for purification be given them .
KJ21	Esther	2	4	And let the maiden who pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. ” And the thing pleased the king , and he did so .
KJ21	Esther	2	5	Now in the palace at Shushan there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ,
KJ21	Esther	2	6	who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
KJ21	Esther	2	7	And he brought up Hadassah ( that is , Esther ) , his uncle ’ s daughter ; for she had neither father nor mother , and the maid wasfair and beautiful , whom Mordecai , when her father and mother were dead , took for his own daughter .
KJ21	Esther	2	8	So it came to pass , when the king ’ s commandment and his decree were heard , and when many maidens were gathered together unto the palace at Shushan under the custody of Hegai , that Esther was brought also unto the king ’ s house into the custody of Hegai , keeper of the women .
KJ21	Esther	2	9	And the maiden pleased him , and she obtained kindness from him ; and he speedily gave her her things for purification , with such things as belonged to her , and seven maidens who were meet to be given to her out of the king ’ s house ; and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place in the house of the women .
KJ21	Esther	2	10	Esther had not shown her people nor her kindred , for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it .
KJ21	Esther	2	11	And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women ’ s house to know how Esther did and what should become of her .
KJ21	Esther	2	12	Now when every maid ’ s turn had come to go in to King Ahasuerus , after she had been twelve months according to the manner of the women ( for so were the days of their purifications accomplished , to wit , six months with oil of myrrh , and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women ) ,
KJ21	Esther	2	13	then thus came every maiden unto the king . Whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto he king ’ s house .
KJ21	Esther	2	14	In the evening she went , and on the morrow she returned to the second house of the women to the custody of Shaashgaz , the king ’ s chamberlain , who kept the concubines . She came in unto the king no more unless the king delighted in her and she were called by name .
KJ21	Esther	2	15	Now when the turn of Esther , the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai , who had taken her for his daughter , had come to go in unto the king , she required nothing but what Hegai the king ’ s chamberlain , the keeper of the women , appointed . And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked upon her .
KJ21	Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken unto King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month , which is the month of Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
KJ21	Esther	2	17	And the king loved Esther above all the women , and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins , so that he set the royal crown upon her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
KJ21	Esther	2	18	Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants , even Esther ’ s feast ; and he made a release to the provinces , and gave gifts according to the state of the king .
KJ21	Esther	2	19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time , then Mordecai sat at the king ’ s gate .
KJ21	Esther	2	20	Esther had not yet shown her kindred nor her people , as Mordecai had charged her , for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him .
KJ21	Esther	2	21	In those days , while Mordecai sat at the king ’ s gate , two of the king ’ s chamberlains , Bigthan and Teresh , of those who kept the door , were wroth and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus .
KJ21	Esther	2	22	And the thing was known to Mordecai , who told it unto Esther the queen , and Esther informed the king thereof in Mordecai ’ s name .
KJ21	Esther	2	23	And when inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out . Therefore they were both hanged on a tree , and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king .
KJ21	Esther	3	3	Then the king ’ s servants , who were in the king ’ s gate , said unto Mordecai , “ Why transgressest thou the king ’ s commandment ? ”
KJ21	Esther	3	2	And all the king ’ s servants who were in the king ’ s gate bowed and reverenced Haman , for the king had so commanded concerning him . But Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
KJ21	Esther	3	4	Now it came to pass , when they spoke daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them , that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai ’ s matters would stand ; for he had told them that he was a Jew .
KJ21	Esther	3	5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence , then was Haman full of wrath .
KJ21	Esther	3	6	And he scorned to lay hands on Mordecai alone , for they had shown him the people of Mordecai . Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even the people of Mordecai .
KJ21	Esther	3	7	In the first month , that is , the month of Nisan , in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus , they cast Pur ( that is , the lot ) before Haman , from day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month , that is , the month of Adar .
KJ21	Esther	3	8	And Haman said unto King Ahasuerus , “ There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom ; and their laws are diverse from all people , neither keep they the king ’ s laws . Therefore it is not to the king ’ s profit to suffer them .
KJ21	Esther	3	9	If it please the king , let it be written that they may be destroyed ; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those who have charge of the business , to bring it into the king ’ s treasuries. ”
KJ21	Esther	3	10	And the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews ’ enemy .
KJ21	Esther	3	11	And the king said unto Haman , “ The silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee. ”
KJ21	Esther	3	12	Then were the king ’ s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month , and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king ’ s lieutenants , and to the governors who were over every province , and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof , and to every people in their language . In the name of King Ahasuerus was it written , and sealed with the king ’ s ring .
KJ21	Esther	3	13	And the letters were sent by posts into all the king ’ s provinces , to destroy , to kill , and to cause to perish all Jews , both young and old , little children and women in one day , even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month of Adar , and to take the spoil of them for plunder .
KJ21	Esther	3	14	The copy of the writing , to be given for a commandment in every province , was published unto all people , that they should be ready against that day .
KJ21	Esther	3	15	The posts went out , being hastened by the king ’ s commandment , and the decree was given in the palace of Shushan . And the king and Haman sat down to drink , but the city of Shushan was perplexed .
KJ21	Esther	4	4	So Esther ’ s maids and her chamberlains came and told it to her . Then was the queen exceedingly grieved ; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him ; but he received it not .
KJ21	Esther	4	2	and came even before the king ’ s gate ; for none might enter into the king ’ s gate clothed with sackcloth .
KJ21	Esther	4	3	And in every province whithersoever the king ’ s commandment and his decree came , there was great mourning among the Jews , and fasting and weeping and wailing ; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
KJ21	Esther	4	5	Then called Esther for Hathach , one of the king ’ s chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend her , and gave him a commandment to Mordecai , to know what it was and why it was .
KJ21	Esther	4	6	So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city which was before the king ’ s gate .
KJ21	Esther	4	7	And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him , and of the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king ’ s treasuries for the Jews , to destroy them .
KJ21	Esther	4	8	Also he gave him the copy of the written decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them , to show it unto Esther and to explain it unto her , and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him , and to make request before him for her people .
KJ21	Esther	4	9	And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai .
KJ21	Esther	4	10	Again Esther spoke unto Hathach , and gave him a commandment unto Mordecai :
KJ21	Esther	4	11	“ All the king ’ s servants and the people of the king ’ s provinces do know that whosoever , whether man or woman , shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called , there is one law of his : to put him to death , except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter , that he may live . But I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days. ”
KJ21	Esther	4	12	And they told to Mordecai Esther ’ s words .
KJ21	Esther	4	13	Then Mordecai commanded them to answer Esther : “ Think not concerning thyself that thou shalt escape in the king ’ s house any more than all the Jews .
KJ21	Esther	4	14	For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time , then shall there arise respite and deliverance to the Jews from another place , but thou and thy father ’ s house shall be destroyed . And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this ? ”
KJ21	Esther	4	15	Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer :
KJ21	Esther	4	16	“ Go , gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan , and fast ye for me ; and neither eat nor drink three days , night or day . I also and my maidens will fast likewise . And so will I go in unto the king , which is not according to the law ; and if I perish , I perish. ”
KJ21	Esther	4	17	So Mordecai went his way , and did according to all that Esther had commanded him .
KJ21	Esther	5	5	Then the king said , “ Cause Haman to make haste , that he may do as Esther hath said. ” So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
KJ21	Esther	5	2	And it was so , when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court , that she obtained favor in his sight ; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand . So Esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter .
KJ21	Esther	5	3	Then said the king unto her , “ What wish thou , Queen Esther ? And what is thy request ? It shall be even given thee , to the half of the kingdom. ”
KJ21	Esther	5	4	And Esther answered , “ If it seem good unto the king , let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him. ”
KJ21	Esther	5	6	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine , “ What is thy petition ? And it shall be granted thee . And what is thy request ? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. ”
KJ21	Esther	5	7	Then answered Esther and said , “ My petition and my request is :
KJ21	Esther	5	8	If I have found favor in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request , let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them , and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said. ”
KJ21	Esther	5	9	Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart ; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king ’ s gate , that he stood not up nor moved for him , he was full of indignation against Mordecai .
KJ21	Esther	5	10	Nevertheless Haman refrained himself ; and when he came home , he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife .
KJ21	Esther	5	11	And Haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
KJ21	Esther	5	12	Haman said moreover , “ Yea , Esther the queen let no man but myself come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared , and tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the king .
KJ21	Esther	5	13	Yet all this availeth me nothing , so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king ’ s gate. ”
KJ21	Esther	5	14	Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him , “ Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high , and tomorrow speak thou unto the king , that Mordecai may be hanged thereon . Then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. ” And the thing pleased Haman , and he caused the gallows to be made .
KJ21	Esther	6	6	So Haman came in . And the king said unto him , “ What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor ? ” Now Haman thought in his heart , “ To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself ? ”
KJ21	Esther	6	2	And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh , two of the king ’ s chamberlains , the keepers of the door , who sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus .
KJ21	Esther	6	3	And the king said , “ What honor and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this ? ” Then said the king ’ s servants who ministered unto him , “ There is nothing done for him. ”
KJ21	Esther	6	4	And the king said , “ Who is in the court ? ” Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king ’ s house to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
KJ21	Esther	6	5	And the king ’ s servants said unto him , “ Behold , Haman standeth in the court. ” And the king said , “ Let him come in. ”
KJ21	Esther	6	7	And Haman answered the king , “ For the man whom the king delighteth to honor ,
KJ21	Esther	6	8	let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear , and the horse that the king rideth upon , and the crown royal which is set upon his head .
KJ21	Esther	6	9	And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king ’ s most noble princes , that they may array the man thereby whom the king delighteth to honor ; and bring him on horseback through the street of the city , and proclaim before him : ‘ Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor ! ’ ”
KJ21	Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman , “ Make haste , and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said , and do even so to Mordecai the Jew who sitteth at the king ’ s gate . Let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. ”
KJ21	Esther	6	11	Then Haman took the apparel and the horse , and arrayed Mordecai and brought him on horseback through the street of the city , and proclaimed before him , “ Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor ! ”
KJ21	Esther	6	12	And Mordecai came again to the king ’ s gate . But Haman hastened to his house , mourning and having his head covered .
KJ21	Esther	6	13	And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him . Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him , “ If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews , before whom thou hast begun to fall , thou shalt not prevail against him , but shalt surely fall before him. ”
KJ21	Esther	6	14	And while they were yet talking with him , the king ’ s chamberlains came and hastened to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared .
KJ21	Esther	7	7	And the king , arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath , went into the palace garden ; and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen , for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
KJ21	Esther	7	2	And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , “ What is thy petition , Queen Esther ? And it shall be granted thee . And what is thy request ? And it shall be performed , even to the half of the kingdom. ”
KJ21	Esther	7	3	Then Esther the queen answered and said , “ If I have found favor in thy sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
KJ21	Esther	7	4	For we are sold , I and my people , to be destroyed , to be slain and to perish . But if we had been sold as bondmen and bondwomen , I would have held my tongue , although the enemy could not compensate for the king ’ s damage. ”
KJ21	Esther	7	5	Then King Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen , “ Who is he , and where is he , who dared presume in his heart to do so ? ”
KJ21	Esther	7	6	And Esther said , “ The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. ” Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen .
KJ21	Esther	7	8	Then the king returned from the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine , and Haman had fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was . Then said the king , “ Will he force the queen also before me in the house ? ” As the word went out of the king ’ s mouth , they covered Haman ’ s face .
KJ21	Esther	7	9	And Harbonah , one of the chamberlains , said before the king , “ Behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which Haman had made for Mordecai , who had spoken good for the king , standeth in the house of Haman. ” Then the king said , “ Hang him thereon ! ”
KJ21	Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai . Then was the king ’ s wrath pacified .
KJ21	Esther	8	8	Write ye also for the Jews , as it pleaseth you , in the king ’ s name , and seal it with the king ’ s ring ; for the writing which is written in the king ’ s name and sealed with the king ’ s ring may no man reverse. ”
KJ21	Esther	8	2	And the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it unto Mordecai . And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman .
KJ21	Esther	8	3	And Esther spoke yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the wickedness of Haman the Agagite and his plot that he had devised against the Jews .
KJ21	Esther	8	4	Then the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther . So Esther arose and stood before the king ,
KJ21	Esther	8	5	and said , “ If it please the king and if I have found favor in his sight , and the thing seem right before the king and I am pleasing in his eyes , let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king ’ s provinces .
KJ21	Esther	8	6	For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred ? ”
KJ21	Esther	8	7	Then King Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew , “ Behold , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the Jews .
KJ21	Esther	8	9	Then were the king ’ s scribes called at that time in the third month ( that is , the month of Sivan ) , on the three and twentieth day thereof ; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded , unto the Jews and to the lieutenants , and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia , a hundred twenty and seven provinces , unto every province according to the writing thereof and unto every people in their language , and to the Jews according to their writing and according to their language .
KJ21	Esther	8	10	And he wrote in King Ahasuerus ’ name and sealed it with the king ’ s ring , and sent letters by posts on horseback , and riders on mules , camels , and young dromedaries .
KJ21	Esther	8	11	Therein the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life ” to destroy , to slay , and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them , both little ones and women , and to take the spoil of them for a prey
KJ21	Esther	8	12	upon one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus , namely , upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month of Adar .
KJ21	Esther	8	13	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
KJ21	Esther	8	14	So the posts who rode upon mules and camels went out , being hastened and pressed on by the king ’ s commandment . And the decree was given at the palace at Shushan .
KJ21	Esther	8	15	And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold and with a garment of fine linen and purple ; and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad .
KJ21	Esther	8	16	The Jews had light and gladness , and joy and honor .
KJ21	Esther	8	17	And in every province and in every city , whithersoever the king ’ s commandment and his decree came , the Jews had joy and gladness , a feast and a good day . And many of the people of the land became Jews , for the fear of the Jews fell upon them .
KJ21	Esther	9	9	and Parmashta and Arisai and Aridai and Vajezatha
KJ21	Esther	9	2	the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on such as sought their hurt ; and no man could withstand them , for the fear of them fell upon all people .
KJ21	Esther	9	3	And all the rulers of the provinces , and the lieutenants and the deputies , and those who did the business that belonged to the king , helped the Jews , because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them .
KJ21	Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the king ’ s house , and his fame went out throughout all the provinces ; for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater .
KJ21	Esther	9	5	Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction , and did what they would unto those who hated them .
KJ21	Esther	9	6	And in the palace in Shushan the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men .
KJ21	Esther	9	7	And Parshandatha and Dalphon and Aspatha ,
KJ21	Esther	9	8	and Poratha and Adalia and Aridatha ,
KJ21	Esther	9	10	( the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha , the enemy of the Jews ) they slew ; but on the spoil they laid not their hand .
KJ21	Esther	9	11	On that day the number of those who were slain in the palace at Shushan was brought before the king .
KJ21	Esther	9	12	And the king said unto Esther the queen , “ The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the palace in Shushan , and the ten sons of Haman . What have they done in the rest of the king ’ s provinces ? Now what is thy petition ? And it shall be granted thee . Or what is thy further request ? And it shall be done. ”
KJ21	Esther	9	13	Then said Esther , “ If it please the king , let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day ’ s decree , and let Haman ’ s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows. ”
KJ21	Esther	9	14	And the king commanded it so to be done ; and the decree was given at Shushan , and they hanged Haman ’ s ten sons .
KJ21	Esther	9	15	For the Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month of Adar , and slew three hundred men at Shushan ; but on the spoil they laid not their hand .
KJ21	Esther	9	16	But the other Jews who were in the king ’ s provinces gathered themselves together and stood for their lives , and had rest from their enemies , and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand ; but they laid not their hands on the spoil .
KJ21	Esther	9	17	On the thirteenth day of the month of Adar , and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
KJ21	Esther	9	18	But the Jews who were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof ; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
KJ21	Esther	9	19	Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of gladness and feasting , and a good day , and of sending portions one to another .
KJ21	Esther	9	20	And Mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters unto all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus , both nigh and far ,
KJ21	Esther	9	21	to establish this among them : that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and the fifteenth day of the same yearly ,
KJ21	Esther	9	22	as the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies , and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day ; that they should make them days of feasting and joy , and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor .
KJ21	Esther	9	23	And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun , and as Mordecai had written unto them ,
KJ21	Esther	9	24	because Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , had schemed against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast Pur ( that is , the lot ) to consume them and to destroy them .
KJ21	Esther	9	25	But when Esther came before the king , he commanded by letters that this wicked scheme which Haman devised against the Jews should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
KJ21	Esther	9	26	Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur [ that is , Lot ] . Therefore for all the words of this letter , and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and what had come upon them ,
KJ21	Esther	9	27	the Jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them , that without fail they would keep these two days according to their writing and according to their appointed time every year ;
KJ21	Esther	9	28	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation , every family , every province , and every city , and that these days of Purim should not pass from among the Jews , nor the memorial of them perish from their seed .
KJ21	Esther	9	29	Then Esther the queen , the daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the Jew , wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim .
KJ21	Esther	9	30	And he sent the letters unto all the Jews , to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , with words of peace and truth
KJ21	Esther	9	31	to confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed , according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them , and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed regarding the matters of the fastings and their cry .
KJ21	Esther	9	32	And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim , and it was written in the book .
KJ21	Esther	10	10	And King Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the isles of the sea .
KJ21	Esther	10	2	And all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
KJ21	Esther	10	3	For Mordecai the Jew was next unto King Ahasuerus , and great among the Jews and accepted by the multitude of his brethren , seeking the wellbeing of his people and speaking peace to all his seed .
KJ21	Job	1	1	There was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job ; and that man was perfect and upright , and one who feared God and eschewed evil .
KJ21	Job	1	2	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters .
KJ21	Job	1	3	His substance also was seven thousand sheep , and three thousand camels , and five hundred yoke of oxen , and five hundred sheasses , and a very great household , so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East .
KJ21	Job	1	4	And his sons went and feasted in their houses , every one his day , and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
KJ21	Job	1	5	And it was so , that when the days of their feasting were ended , Job sent and sanctified them , and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all ; for Job said , “ It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. ” Thus did Job continually .
KJ21	Job	1	6	Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan also came among them .
KJ21	Job	1	7	And the Lord said unto Satan , “ From whence comest thou ? ” Then Satan answered the Lord and said , “ From going to and fro on the earth , and from walking up and down upon it. ”
KJ21	Job	1	8	And the Lord said unto Satan , “ Hast thou considered My servant Job , that there is none like him on the earth , a perfect and an upright man , one who feareth God and escheweth evil ? ”
KJ21	Job	1	9	Then Satan answered the Lord and said , “ Doth Job fear God for nought ?
KJ21	Job	1	10	Hast not Thou made a hedge about him and about his house , and about all that he hath on every side ? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands , and his substance hath increased in the land .
KJ21	Job	1	11	But put forth Thine hand now and touch all that he hath , and he will curse Thee to Thy face ! ”
KJ21	Job	1	12	And the Lord said unto Satan , “ Behold , all that he hath is in thy power ; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. ” So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord .
KJ21	Job	1	13	And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother ’ s house ,
KJ21	Job	1	14	and there came a messenger unto Job and said , “ The oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them ,
KJ21	Job	1	15	and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away . Yea , they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword , and I only have escaped alone to tell thee ! ”
KJ21	Job	1	16	While he was yet speaking , there came also another and said , “ The fire of God hath fallen from heaven , and hath burned up the sheep and the servants , and consumed them ; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee ! ”
KJ21	Job	1	17	While he was yet speaking , there came also another and said , “ The Chaldeans made up three bands , and fell upon the camels and have carried them away , yea , and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee ! ”
KJ21	Job	1	18	While he was yet speaking , there came also another and said , “ Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother ’ s house ,
KJ21	Job	1	19	and behold , there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house , and it fell upon the young men , and they are dead ; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee ! ”
KJ21	Job	1	20	Then Job arose , and rent his mantle and shaved his head , and fell down upon the ground and worshiped ,
KJ21	Job	1	21	and said , “ Naked came I out of my mother ’ s womb , and naked shall I return thither . The Lord gave , and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Job	1	22	In all this Job sinned not , nor charged God foolishly .
KJ21	Job	2	2	And the Lord said unto Satan , “ From whence comest thou ? ” And Satan answered the Lord and said , “ From going to and fro on the earth , and from walking up and down upon it. ”
KJ21	Job	2	3	And the Lord said unto Satan , “ Hast thou considered My servant Job , that there is none like him on the earth , a perfect and an upright man , one who feareth God and escheweth evil ? And still he holdeth fast his integrity , although thou movedst Me against him to destroy him without cause. ”
KJ21	Job	2	4	And Satan answered the Lord and said , “ Skin for skin , yea , all that a man hath will he give for his life .
KJ21	Job	2	5	But put forth Thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will curse Thee to Thy face ! ”
KJ21	Job	2	6	And the Lord said unto Satan , “ Behold , he is in thine hand ; only spare his life. ”
KJ21	Job	2	7	So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord , and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
KJ21	Job	2	8	And he took him a potsherd with which to scrape himself , and he sat down among the ashes .
KJ21	Job	2	9	Then said his wife unto him , “ Dost thou still retain thine integrity ? Curse God , and die ! ”
KJ21	Job	2	10	But he said unto her , “ Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh . What ? Shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? ” In all this did not Job sin with his lips .
KJ21	Job	2	11	Now when Job ’ s three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him , they came every one from his own place : Eliphaz the Temanite , and Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite.For they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him .
KJ21	Job	2	12	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not , they lifted up their voice and wept ; and they rent every one his mantle , and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven .
KJ21	Job	2	13	So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights , and none spoke a word unto him ; for they saw that his grief was very great .
KJ21	Job	3	3	“ Let the day perish wherein I was born , and the night in which it was said , ‘ There is a manchild conceived. ’
KJ21	Job	3	2	And Job spoke and said :
KJ21	Job	3	4	Let that day be darkness ; let not God regard it from above , neither let the light shine upon it .
KJ21	Job	3	5	Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it ; let a cloud dwell upon it ; let the blackness of the day terrify it .
KJ21	Job	3	6	As for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
KJ21	Job	3	7	Lo , let that night be solitary ; let no joyful voice come therein .
KJ21	Job	3	8	Let them curse it that curse the day , who are ready to raise up their mourning .
KJ21	Job	3	9	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the dawning of the day ,
KJ21	Job	3	10	because it shut not up the doors of my mother ’ s womb , nor hid sorrow from mine eyes .
KJ21	Job	3	11	“ Why died I not from the womb ? Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly ?
KJ21	Job	3	12	Why did the knees precede me , or why the breasts that I should suck ?
KJ21	Job	3	13	For now should I have lain still and been quiet , I should have slept ; then would I have been at rest
KJ21	Job	3	14	with kings and counselors of the earth , who built desolate places for themselves ,
KJ21	Job	3	15	or with princes that had gold , who filled their houses with silver ;
KJ21	Job	3	16	or as a hidden untimely birth I would not have been , as infants who never saw light .
KJ21	Job	3	17	There the wicked cease from troubling , and there the weary be at rest .
KJ21	Job	3	18	There the prisoners rest together ; they hear not the voice of the oppressor .
KJ21	Job	3	19	The small and great are there , and the servant is free from his master .
KJ21	Job	3	20	“ Why is light given to him that is in misery , and life unto the bitter in soul ,
KJ21	Job	3	21	who long for death but it cometh not , and dig for it more than for hidden treasures ;
KJ21	Job	3	22	who rejoice exceedingly , and are glad when they can find the grave ?
KJ21	Job	3	23	Why is light given to a man whose way is hid , and whom God hath hedged in ?
KJ21	Job	3	24	For my sighing cometh before I eat , and my roarings are poured out like the waters .
KJ21	Job	3	25	For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come unto me .
KJ21	Job	3	26	I was not in safety , neither had I rest , neither was I quiet ; yet trouble came . ”
KJ21	Job	4	4	Thy words have upheld him that was falling , and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees .
KJ21	Job	4	2	“ If we attempt to commune with thee , wilt thou be grieved ? But who can withhold himself from speaking ?
KJ21	Job	4	3	Behold , thou hast instructed many , and thou hast strengthened the weak hands .
KJ21	Job	4	5	But now it is come upon thee , and thou faintest ; it toucheth thee , and thou art troubled .
KJ21	Job	4	6	Is not this thy fear , thy confidence , thy hope , and the uprightness of thy ways ?
KJ21	Job	4	7	“ Remember , I pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ? Or where were the righteous cut off ?
KJ21	Job	4	8	Even as I have seen , they that plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap the same .
KJ21	Job	4	9	By the blast of God they perish , and by the breath of His nostrils are they consumed .
KJ21	Job	4	10	The roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the teeth of the young lions are broken .
KJ21	Job	4	11	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey , and the stout lion ’ s whelps are scattered abroad .
KJ21	Job	4	12	“ Now a thing was secretly brought to me , and mine ear received a little thereof .
KJ21	Job	4	13	In thoughts from the visions of the night , when deep sleep falleth on men ,
KJ21	Job	4	14	fear came upon me and trembling , which made all my bones to shake .
KJ21	Job	4	15	Then a spirit passed before my face ; the hair of my flesh stood up .
KJ21	Job	4	16	It stood still , but I could not discern the form thereof ; an image was before mine eyes . There was silence and I heard a voice , saying ,
KJ21	Job	4	17	‘ Shall mortal man be more just than God ? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker ?
KJ21	Job	4	18	Behold , He put no trust in His servants , and His angels He charged with folly :
KJ21	Job	4	19	How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , who are crushed before the moth ?
KJ21	Job	4	20	They are destroyed from morning to evening ; they perish for ever without any regarding it .
KJ21	Job	4	21	Doth not their excellence which is in them go away ? They die , even without wisdom . ’
KJ21	Job	5	5	His harvest the hungry eateth up and taketh it even out of the thorns , and the robber swalloweth up their substance .
KJ21	Job	5	2	For wrath killeth the foolish man , and envy slayeth the silly one .
KJ21	Job	5	3	I have seen the foolish taking root , but suddenly I cursed his habitation .
KJ21	Job	5	4	His children are far from safety , and they are crushed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them .
KJ21	Job	5	6	Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust , neither doth trouble spring out of the ground ;
KJ21	Job	5	7	yet man is born unto trouble , as the sparks fly upward .
KJ21	Job	5	8	“ I would seek unto God , and unto God would I commit my cause .
KJ21	Job	5	9	He doeth great things and unsearchable , marvelous things without number :
KJ21	Job	5	10	He giveth rain upon the earth , and sendeth waters upon the fields ,
KJ21	Job	5	11	to set up on high those that are low , that those who mourn may be exalted to safety .
KJ21	Job	5	12	He disappointeth the devices of the crafty , so that their hands can not perform their enterprise .
KJ21	Job	5	13	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness , and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong .
KJ21	Job	5	14	They meet with darkness in the daytime , and grope in the noonday as in the night .
KJ21	Job	5	15	But He saveth the poor from the sword , from the mouth and from the hand of the mighty .
KJ21	Job	5	16	So the poor hath hope , and iniquity stoppeth her mouth .
KJ21	Job	5	17	“ Behold , happy is the man whom God correcteth ; therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty .
KJ21	Job	5	18	For He maketh sore , and bindeth up ; He woundeth , and His hands make whole .
KJ21	Job	5	19	He shall deliver thee in six troubles ; yea , in seven there shall no evil touch thee .
KJ21	Job	5	20	In famine He shall redeem thee from death , and in war from the power of the sword .
KJ21	Job	5	21	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue , neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh .
KJ21	Job	5	22	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh ; neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth .
KJ21	Job	5	23	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field , and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee .
KJ21	Job	5	24	And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace ; and thou shalt visit thy habitation , and shalt not sin .
KJ21	Job	5	25	Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great , and thine offspring as the grass of the earth .
KJ21	Job	5	26	Thou shalt come to thy grave at a full age , as a shock of corn cometh in in his season .
KJ21	Job	5	27	Lo , this we have searched out ; so it is . Hear it , and know thou it for thy good . ”
KJ21	Job	6	6	Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt ? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg ?
KJ21	Job	6	2	“ Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed , and my calamity laid in the balances together !
KJ21	Job	6	3	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea ; therefore my words are swallowed up .
KJ21	Job	6	4	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me ; the poison thereof drinketh up my spirit ; the terrors of God set themselves in array against me .
KJ21	Job	6	5	Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass ? Or loweth the ox over his fodder ?
KJ21	Job	6	7	The things that my soul refused to touch are as my distressing meat .
KJ21	Job	6	8	“ Oh that I might have my request , and that God would grant me the thing that I long for :
KJ21	Job	6	9	even that it would please God to destroy me , that He would let loose His hand and cut me off !
KJ21	Job	6	10	Then should I yet have comfort ; yea , I would harden myself in sorrow . Let Him not spare , for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One .
KJ21	Job	6	11	What is my strength , that I should hope ? And what is mine end , that I should prolong my life ?
KJ21	Job	6	12	Is my strength the strength of stones ? Or is my flesh of brass ?
KJ21	Job	6	13	Is not my help in me ? And is wisdom driven quite from me ?
KJ21	Job	6	14	“ To him that is afflicted , pity should be shown by his friend ; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty .
KJ21	Job	6	15	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook , and as the stream of brooks they pass away ,
KJ21	Job	6	16	which are blackish by reason of the ice , and wherein the snow is hid .
KJ21	Job	6	17	When in time they wax warm , they vanish ; when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
KJ21	Job	6	18	The paths of their way are turned aside ; they go to nothing and perish .
KJ21	Job	6	19	The troops of Tema looked ; the companies of Sheba waited for them .
KJ21	Job	6	20	They were confounded because they had hoped ; they came thither and were ashamed .
KJ21	Job	6	21	For now ye are nothing ; ye see my casting down and are afraid .
KJ21	Job	6	22	Did I say , ‘ Bring unto me ’ ? or , ‘ Give a reward for me of your substance ’ ?
KJ21	Job	6	23	Or , ‘ Deliver me from the enemy ’ s hand ’ ? or , ‘ Redeem me from the hand of the mighty ’ ?
KJ21	Job	6	24	“ Teach me , and I will hold my tongue ; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred .
KJ21	Job	6	25	How forceful are right words ! But what doth your arguing reprove ?
KJ21	Job	6	26	Do ye imagine to reprove words , and the speeches of one that is desperate , which are as wind ?
KJ21	Job	6	27	Yea , ye overwhelm the fatherless , and ye dig a pit for your friend .
KJ21	Job	6	28	“ Now therefore be content , look upon me ; for it is evident unto you if I lie .
KJ21	Job	6	29	Return , I pray you , let there be no iniquity ; yea , return again ; my righteousness is in it .
KJ21	Job	6	30	Is there iniquity on my tongue ? Can not my taste discern perverse things ?
KJ21	Job	7	7	“ O remember that my life is wind ; mine eye shall no more see good .
KJ21	Job	7	2	As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow , and as a hireling looketh for the reward of his work ,
KJ21	Job	7	3	so am I made to possess months of vanity , and wearisome nights are appointed to me .
KJ21	Job	7	4	When I lie down , I say , ‘ When shall I arise and the night be gone ? ’ And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day .
KJ21	Job	7	5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust ; my skin is broken , and has become loathsome .
KJ21	Job	7	6	My days are swifter than a weaver ’ s shuttle , and are spent without hope .
KJ21	Job	7	8	The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more ; Thine eyes are upon me , and I am not .
KJ21	Job	7	9	As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away , so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more .
KJ21	Job	7	10	He shall return no more to his house , neither shall his place know him any more .
KJ21	Job	7	11	Therefore I will not restrain my mouth ; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit ; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
KJ21	Job	7	12	Am I a sea , or a whale , that Thou settest a watch over me ?
KJ21	Job	7	13	When I say , ‘ My bed shall comfort me , my couch shall ease my complaint , ’
KJ21	Job	7	14	then Thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me through visions ,
KJ21	Job	7	15	so that my soul chooseth strangling , and death rather than my life .
KJ21	Job	7	16	I loathe it ; I would not live always . Let me alone , for my days are vanity .
KJ21	Job	7	17	“ What is man , that Thou shouldest magnify him , and that Thou shouldest set Thine heart upon him ?
KJ21	Job	7	18	And that Thou shouldest visit him every morning , and try him every moment ?
KJ21	Job	7	19	How long wilt Thou not depart from me , nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle ?
KJ21	Job	7	20	I have sinned . What shall I do unto Thee , O Thou preserver of men ? Why hast Thou set me as a mark against Thee , so that I am a burden to myself ?
KJ21	Job	7	21	And why dost Thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ? For now shall I sleep in the dust , and Thou shalt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be . ”
KJ21	Job	8	8	“ For inquire , I pray thee , of the former age , and prepare thyself for the searching of their fathers ;
KJ21	Job	8	2	“ How long wilt thou speak these things ? And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind ?
KJ21	Job	8	3	Doth God pervert judgment ? Or doth the Almighty pervert justice ?
KJ21	Job	8	4	If thy children have sinned against Him and He have cast them away for their transgression ,
KJ21	Job	8	5	if thou wouldest seek unto God speedily and make thy supplication to the Almighty ,
KJ21	Job	8	6	if thou wert pure and upright , surely now He would awake for thee and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous .
KJ21	Job	8	7	Though thy beginning was small , yet thy latter end should greatly increase .
KJ21	Job	8	9	for we are but of yesterday and know nothing , because our days upon earth are a shadow .
KJ21	Job	8	10	Shall not they teach thee and tell thee , and utter words out of their heart ?
KJ21	Job	8	11	Can the rush grow up without mire ? Can the reed grow without water ?
KJ21	Job	8	12	Whilst it is yet in his greenness and not cut down , it withereth before any other herb .
KJ21	Job	8	13	So are the paths of all that forget God ; and the hypocrite ’ s hope shall perish ,
KJ21	Job	8	14	whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall be a spider ’ s web .
KJ21	Job	8	15	He shall lean upon his house , but it shall not stand ; he shall hold it fast , but it shall not endure .
KJ21	Job	8	16	He is green before the sun , and his branch shooteth forth in his garden .
KJ21	Job	8	17	His roots are wrapped about the heap , and seeth the place of stones .
KJ21	Job	8	18	If he destroy him from his place , then it shall deny him , saying , ‘ I have not seen thee. ’
KJ21	Job	8	19	Behold , this is the joy of His way , and out of the earth shall others grow .
KJ21	Job	8	20	“ Behold , God will not cast away a perfect man , neither will He help the evildoers ,
KJ21	Job	8	21	till He fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with rejoicing .
KJ21	Job	8	22	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame , and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought . ”
KJ21	Job	9	9	Who maketh Arcturus , Orion and Pleiades , and the chambers of the south ;
KJ21	Job	9	2	“ I know in truth it is so , but how should man be just before God ?
KJ21	Job	9	3	If he will contend with Him , he can not answer Him one in a thousand .
KJ21	Job	9	4	He is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who hath hardened himself against Him and hath prospered—
KJ21	Job	9	5	Who removeth the mountains , and they know not ; Who overturneth them in His anger ;
KJ21	Job	9	6	Who shaketh the earth out of her place , and the pillars thereof tremble ;
KJ21	Job	9	7	Who commandeth the sun , and it riseth not , and sealeth up the stars ;
KJ21	Job	9	8	Who alone spreadeth out the heavens , and treadeth upon the waves of the sea ;
KJ21	Job	9	10	Who doeth great things past finding out , yea , and wonders without number ?
KJ21	Job	9	11	Lo , He goeth by me , and I see Him not ; He passeth on also , but I perceive Him not .
KJ21	Job	9	12	Behold , He taketh away . Who can hinder Him ? Who will say unto him , ‘ What doest Thou ? ’
KJ21	Job	9	13	“ If God will not withdraw His anger , the proud helpers do stoop under Him .
KJ21	Job	9	14	How much less shall I answer Him , and choose out my words to reason with Him—
KJ21	Job	9	15	whom , though I were righteous , yet would I not answer , but I would make supplication to my Judge ?
KJ21	Job	9	16	If I had called and He had answered me , yet would I not believe that He had hearkened unto my voice .
KJ21	Job	9	17	For He breaketh me with a tempest , and multiplieth my wounds without cause .
KJ21	Job	9	18	He will not suffer me to take my breath , but filleth me with bitterness .
KJ21	Job	9	19	If I speak of strength , lo , He is strong ; and if of judgment , who shall set me a time to plead ?
KJ21	Job	9	20	If I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me ; if I say , ‘ I am perfect , ’ it shall also prove me perverse .
KJ21	Job	9	21	Though I were perfect , yet would I not know my soul ; I would despise my life .
KJ21	Job	9	22	This is all one thing . Therefore I said it : ‘ He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. ’
KJ21	Job	9	23	If the scourge slay suddenly , He will laugh at the trial of the innocent .
KJ21	Job	9	24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked . He covereth the faces of the judges thereof . If not , where and who is He ?
KJ21	Job	9	25	“ Now my days are swifter than a courier ; they flee away , they see no good .
KJ21	Job	9	26	They are passed away as the swift ships , as the eagle that hasteneth to the prey .
KJ21	Job	9	27	If I say , ‘ I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my heaviness and comfort myself , ’
KJ21	Job	9	28	I am afraid of all my sorrows ; I know that Thou wilt not hold me innocent .
KJ21	Job	9	29	If I be wicked , why then labor I in vain ?
KJ21	Job	9	30	If I wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean ,
KJ21	Job	9	31	yet shalt Thou plunge me in the ditch , and mine own clothes shall abhor me .
KJ21	Job	9	32	For He is not a man as I am , that I should answer Him and we should come together in judgment .
KJ21	Job	9	33	Neither is there any mediator between us who might lay his hand upon us both .
KJ21	Job	9	34	Let Him take His rod away from me , and let not fear of Him terrify me .
KJ21	Job	9	35	Then would I speak and not fear Him , but it is not so with me .
KJ21	Job	10	10	Hast Thou not poured me out as milk , and curdled me like cheese ?
KJ21	Job	10	2	I will say unto God : ‘ Do not condemn me ; show me why Thou contendest with me .
KJ21	Job	10	3	Is it good unto Thee that Thou shouldest oppress , that Thou shouldest despise the work of Thine hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
KJ21	Job	10	4	Hast Thou eyes of flesh , or seest Thou as man seeth ?
KJ21	Job	10	5	Are Thy days as the days of man ? Are Thy years as man ’ s days ,
KJ21	Job	10	6	that Thou inquirest after mine iniquity , and searchest after my sin ?
KJ21	Job	10	7	Thou knowest that I am not wicked , and there is none that can deliver out of Thine hand .
KJ21	Job	10	8	“ ‘ Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about ; yet Thou dost destroy me .
KJ21	Job	10	9	Remember , I beseech Thee , that Thou hast made me as the clay . And wilt Thou bring me into dust again ?
KJ21	Job	10	11	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh , and hast protected me with bones and sinews .
KJ21	Job	10	12	Thou hast granted me life and favor , and Thy visitation hath preserved my spirit .
KJ21	Job	10	13	“ ‘ And these things hast Thou hid in Thine heart ; I know that this is with Thee :
KJ21	Job	10	14	If I sin , then Thou markest me , and Thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity .
KJ21	Job	10	15	If I be wicked , woe unto me ! And if I be righteous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of confusion ; therefore see Thou mine affliction ,
KJ21	Job	10	16	for it increaseth . Thou huntest me as a fierce lion , and again Thou showest Thyself marvelous upon me .
KJ21	Job	10	17	Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me , and increasest Thine indignation upon me ; changes and war are against me .
KJ21	Job	10	18	Why then hast Thou brought me forth out of the womb ? Oh that I had given up the ghost , and no eye had seen me !
KJ21	Job	10	19	I should have been as though I had not been ; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave .
KJ21	Job	10	20	Are not my days few ? Cease then and let me alone , that I may take comfort a little
KJ21	Job	10	21	before I go whence I shall not return , even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death ”
KJ21	Job	10	22	a land of darkness , as darkness itself , and of the shadow of death without any order , and where the light is as darkness . ’ ”
KJ21	Job	11	11	For He knoweth vain men ; He seeth wickedness also . Will He not then consider it ?
KJ21	Job	11	2	“ Should not the multitude of words be answered ? And should a man full of talk be justified ?
KJ21	Job	11	3	Should thy lies make men hold their peace ? And when thou mockest , shall no man make thee ashamed ?
KJ21	Job	11	4	For thou hast said , ‘ My doctrine is pure , and I am clean in Thine eyes. ’
KJ21	Job	11	5	But oh , that God would speak and open His lips against thee ,
KJ21	Job	11	6	and that He would show thee the secrets of wisdom , that they are double to that which is ! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth .
KJ21	Job	11	7	“ Canst thou by searching find out God ? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection ?
KJ21	Job	11	8	It is as high as heaven : What canst thou do ? Deeper than hell : What canst thou know ?
KJ21	Job	11	9	The measure thereof is longer than the earth , and broader than the sea .
KJ21	Job	11	10	If He cut off , and shut up , or gather together , then who can hinder Him ?
KJ21	Job	11	12	For vain man would be wise , though man be born like a wild ass ’ s colt .
KJ21	Job	11	13	“ If thou prepare thine heart , and stretch out thine hands toward Him ,
KJ21	Job	11	14	if iniquity be in thine hand , put it far away , and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles .
KJ21	Job	11	15	For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot ; yea , thou shalt be steadfast and shalt not fear ,
KJ21	Job	11	16	because thou shalt forget thy misery , and remember it as waters that pass away .
KJ21	Job	11	17	And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday ; thou shalt shine forth , thou shalt be as the morning .
KJ21	Job	11	18	And thou shalt be secure , because there is hope ; yea , thou shalt dig about thee , and thou shalt take thy rest in safety .
KJ21	Job	11	19	Also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ; yea , many shall make suit unto thee .
KJ21	Job	11	20	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail , and they shall not escape ; and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost . ”
KJ21	Job	12	12	With the ancient is wisdom , and in length of days , understanding .
KJ21	Job	12	2	“ No doubt but ye are the people , and wisdom shall die with you .
KJ21	Job	12	3	But I have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to you ; yea , who knoweth not such things as these ?
KJ21	Job	12	4	I am as one mocked by his neighbor , who calleth upon God , and He answereth him ; the just and upright man is laughed to scorn .
KJ21	Job	12	5	He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease .
KJ21	Job	12	6	The tabernacles of robbers prosper , and they that provoke God are secure , into whose hand God bringeth abundantly .
KJ21	Job	12	7	“ But ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowls of the air , and they shall tell thee .
KJ21	Job	12	8	Or speak to the earth , and it shall teach thee ; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee .
KJ21	Job	12	9	Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this ,
KJ21	Job	12	10	in whose hand is the soul of every living thing , and the breath of all mankind ?
KJ21	Job	12	11	Doth not the ear test words , and the mouth taste his meat ?
KJ21	Job	12	13	“ With Him are wisdom and strength ; He hath counsel and understanding .
KJ21	Job	12	14	Behold , He breaketh down , and it can not be built again ; He shutteth up a man , and there can be no opening .
KJ21	Job	12	15	Behold , He withholdeth the waters , and they dry up ; also He sendeth them out , and they overturn the earth .
KJ21	Job	12	16	With Him are strength and wisdom ; the deceived and the deceiver are His .
KJ21	Job	12	17	He leadeth counselors away despoiled , and maketh the judges fools .
KJ21	Job	12	18	He looseth the bond of kings , and girdeth their loins with a girdle .
KJ21	Job	12	19	He leadeth princes away despoiled , and overthroweth the mighty .
KJ21	Job	12	20	He removeth away the speech of the trusted , and taketh away the understanding of the aged .
KJ21	Job	12	21	He poureth contempt upon princes , and weakeneth the strength of the mighty .
KJ21	Job	12	22	He discovereth deep things out of darkness , and bringeth out to light the shadow of death .
KJ21	Job	12	23	He increaseth the nations , and destroyeth them ; He enlargeth the nations , and straiteneth them again .
KJ21	Job	12	24	He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth , and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way .
KJ21	Job	12	25	They grope in the dark without light , and He maketh them to stagger like a drunken man .
KJ21	Job	13	13	“ Hold your peace ; let me alone that I may speak , and let come on me what will .
KJ21	Job	13	2	What ye know , the same do I know also ; I am not inferior unto you .
KJ21	Job	13	3	Surely I would speak to the Almighty , and I desire to reason with God .
KJ21	Job	13	4	But ye are forgers of lies ; ye are all physicians of no value .
KJ21	Job	13	5	O that ye would altogether hold your peace , and it should be your wisdom !
KJ21	Job	13	6	Hear now my reasoning , and hearken to the pleadings of my lips .
KJ21	Job	13	7	Will ye speak wickedly for God , and talk deceitfully for Him ?
KJ21	Job	13	8	Will ye accept His person ; will ye contend for God ?
KJ21	Job	13	9	Is it good that He should search you out ? Or as one man mocketh another , do ye so mock Him ?
KJ21	Job	13	10	He will surely reprove you , if ye do secretly accept persons .
KJ21	Job	13	11	Shall not His excellency make you afraid , and His dread fall upon you ?
KJ21	Job	13	12	Your remembrances are like unto ashes , your bodies to bodies of clay .
KJ21	Job	13	14	Why do I take my flesh in my teeth , and put my life in mine hand ?
KJ21	Job	13	15	Though He slay me , yet will I trust in Him ; but I will argue mine own ways before Him .
KJ21	Job	13	16	He also shall be my salvation , for a hypocrite shall not come before Him .
KJ21	Job	13	17	Hear diligently my speech , and my declaration with your ears .
KJ21	Job	13	18	Behold now , I have prepared my cause ; I know that I shall be justified .
KJ21	Job	13	19	Who is he that will plead with me ? For now , if I hold my tongue , I shall give up the ghost .
KJ21	Job	13	20	“ Only do not two things unto me ; then will I not hide myself from Thee :
KJ21	Job	13	21	Withdraw Thine hand far from me , and let not Thy dread make me afraid .
KJ21	Job	13	22	Then call Thou , and I will answer ; or let me speak , and answer Thou me .
KJ21	Job	13	23	How many are mine iniquities and sins ? Make me to know my transgression and my sin .
KJ21	Job	13	24	Why hidest Thou Thy face , and holdest me for Thine enemy ?
KJ21	Job	13	25	Wilt Thou break a leaf driven to and fro ? And wilt Thou pursue the dry stubble ?
KJ21	Job	13	26	For Thou writest bitter things against me , and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth .
KJ21	Job	13	27	Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly unto all my paths ; Thou settest a mark upon the heels of my feet .
KJ21	Job	13	28	And he , as a rotten thing , consumeth , as a garment that is motheaten .
KJ21	Job	14	14	If a man die , shall he live again ? All the days of my appointed time will I wait , till my change come .
KJ21	Job	14	2	He cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down ; he fleeth also as a shadow , and continueth not .
KJ21	Job	14	3	And dost Thou open Thine eyes upon such a one , and bringest me into judgment with Thee ?
KJ21	Job	14	4	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? Not one !
KJ21	Job	14	5	Seeing his days are determined , the number of his months are with Thee ; Thou hast appointed his bounds , that he can not pass .
KJ21	Job	14	6	Turn from him , that he may rest , till , as a hireling , he shall accomplish his day .
KJ21	Job	14	7	For there is hope for a tree , if it be cut down , that it will sprout again , and that the tender branch thereof will not cease .
KJ21	Job	14	8	Though the root thereof wax old in the earth , and the stock thereof die in the ground ,
KJ21	Job	14	9	yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant .
KJ21	Job	14	10	But man dieth and wasteth away ; yea , man giveth up the ghost , and where is he ?
KJ21	Job	14	11	As the waters fail from the sea , and the flood decayeth and drieth up ,
KJ21	Job	14	12	so man lieth down and riseth not ; till the heavens be no more they shall not awake , nor be raised out of their sleep .
KJ21	Job	14	13	“ O that Thou wouldest hide me in the grave , that Thou wouldest keep me secret until Thy wrath be past ; that Thou wouldest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
KJ21	Job	14	15	Thou shalt call , and I will answer Thee ; Thou wilt desire the work of Thine hands .
KJ21	Job	14	16	For now Thou numberest my steps ; dost Thou not watch over my sin ?
KJ21	Job	14	17	My transgression is sealed up in a bag , and Thou sewest up mine iniquity .
KJ21	Job	14	18	And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought , and the rock is removed out of his place .
KJ21	Job	14	19	The waters wear away the stones ; Thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth , and Thou destroyest the hope of man .
KJ21	Job	14	20	Thou prevailest for ever against him , and he passeth ; Thou changest his countenance , and sendest him away .
KJ21	Job	14	21	His sons come to honor , and he knoweth it not ; and they are brought low , but he perceiveth it not of them .
KJ21	Job	14	22	But his flesh upon him shall have pain , and his soul within him shall mourn . ”
KJ21	Job	15	15	Behold , He putteth no trust in His saints ; yea , the heavens are not clean in His sight .
KJ21	Job	15	2	“ Should a wise man utter vain knowledge , and fill his belly with the east wind ?
KJ21	Job	15	3	Should he reason with unprofitable talk , or with speeches wherewith he can do no good ?
KJ21	Job	15	4	Yea , thou castest off fear , and restrainest prayer before God .
KJ21	Job	15	5	For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity , and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty .
KJ21	Job	15	6	Thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not I ; yea , thine own lips testify against thee .
KJ21	Job	15	7	“ Art thou the first man that was born ? Or wast thou made before the hills ?
KJ21	Job	15	8	Hast thou heard the secret of God ? And dost thou withhold wisdom for thyself ?
KJ21	Job	15	9	What knowest thou , that we know not ? What understandest thou , which is not in us ?
KJ21	Job	15	10	With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men , much elder than thy father .
KJ21	Job	15	11	Are the consolations of God small with thee ? Is there any secret thing with thee ?
KJ21	Job	15	12	Why doth thine heart carry thee away , and what do thine eyes wink at ,
KJ21	Job	15	13	that thou turnest thy spirit against God , and lettest such words go out of thy mouth ?
KJ21	Job	15	14	What is man , that he should be clean ? And he that is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
KJ21	Job	15	16	How much more abominable and filthy is man , who drinketh iniquity like water ?
KJ21	Job	15	17	“ I will show thee , hear me ; and that which I have seen I will declare ,
KJ21	Job	15	18	what wise men have told from their fathers and have not hid it ,
KJ21	Job	15	19	unto whom alone the earth was given and no stranger passed among them :
KJ21	Job	15	20	The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days , and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor .
KJ21	Job	15	21	A dreadful sound is in his ears ; in his prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him .
KJ21	Job	15	22	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness , and he is waited for by the sword .
KJ21	Job	15	23	He wandereth abroad for bread , saying , ‘ Where is it ? ’ He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
KJ21	Job	15	24	Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid ; they shall prevail against him , as a king ready for the battle :
KJ21	Job	15	25	for he stretcheth out his hand against God , and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty ;
KJ21	Job	15	26	he runneth upon Him , even on His neck , with the thick bosses of his bucklers .
KJ21	Job	15	27	Because he covereth his face with his fatness and maketh dollops of fat on his flanks ,
KJ21	Job	15	28	and he dwelleth in desolate cities and in houses which no man inhabiteth , which are ready to become heaps ,
KJ21	Job	15	29	he shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue ; neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth .
KJ21	Job	15	30	He shall not depart out of darkness ; the flame shall dry up his branches , and by the breath of His mouth shall he go away .
KJ21	Job	15	31	Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity , for vanity shall be his recompense .
KJ21	Job	15	32	It shall be accomplished before his time , and his branch shall not be green .
KJ21	Job	15	33	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive .
KJ21	Job	15	34	For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate , and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery .
KJ21	Job	15	35	They conceive evil and bring forth vanity , and their belly prepareth deceit . ”
KJ21	Job	16	16	My face is foul with weeping , and on my eyelids is the shadow of death ,
KJ21	Job	16	2	“ I have heard many such things ; miserable comforters are ye all !
KJ21	Job	16	3	Shall vain words have an end ? Or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest ?
KJ21	Job	16	4	I also could speak as ye do ; if your soul were in my soul ’ s stead , I could heap up words against you , and shake mine head at you .
KJ21	Job	16	5	But I would strengthen you with my mouth , and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief .
KJ21	Job	16	6	“ Though I speak , my grief is not assuaged ; and though I forbear , what am I eased ?
KJ21	Job	16	7	But now He hath made me weary ; Thou hast made desolate all my company .
KJ21	Job	16	8	And Thou hast filled me with wrinkles , which is a witness against me ; and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face .
KJ21	Job	16	9	He teareth me in his wrath , who hateth me ; he gnasheth upon me with his teeth ; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me .
KJ21	Job	16	10	They have gaped upon me with their mouth ; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully ; they have gathered themselves together against me .
KJ21	Job	16	11	God hath delivered me to the ungodly , and turned me over into the hands of the wicked .
KJ21	Job	16	12	“ I was at ease , but he hath broken me asunder ; he hath also taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
KJ21	Job	16	13	His archers compass me round about ; he cleaveth my reins asunder and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground .
KJ21	Job	16	14	He breaketh me with breach upon breach ; he runneth upon me like a giant .
KJ21	Job	16	15	“ I have sewn sackcloth upon my skin , and defiled my horn in the dust .
KJ21	Job	16	17	not for any injustice in mine hands ; also my prayer is pure .
KJ21	Job	16	18	“ O earth , cover not thou my blood , and let my cry have no place .
KJ21	Job	16	19	Also now , behold , my witness is in heaven , and my record is on high .
KJ21	Job	16	20	My friends scorn me , but mine eye poureth out tears unto God .
KJ21	Job	16	21	O , that one might plead for a man with God , as a man pleadeth for his neighbor !
KJ21	Job	16	22	When a few years have come , then I shall go the way whence I shall not return .
KJ21	Job	17	17	“ My spirit is spent , my days are extinct , the grave is ready for me .
KJ21	Job	17	2	Are there not mockers with me ? And doth not mine eye continue in their provocation ?
KJ21	Job	17	3	“ Lay it down now , give me a surety with Thee . Who is he that will strike hands with me ?
KJ21	Job	17	4	For Thou hast hid their heart from understanding ; therefore shalt Thou not exalt them .
KJ21	Job	17	5	He that speaketh flattery to his friends , even the eyes of his children shall fail .
KJ21	Job	17	6	“ He hath made me also a byword of the people ; and aforetime I was as a drum to beat on .
KJ21	Job	17	7	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow , and all my members are as a shadow .
KJ21	Job	17	8	Upright men shall be astonished at this , and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite .
KJ21	Job	17	9	The righteous also shall hold to his way , and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger .
KJ21	Job	17	10	“ But as for you all , do ye return and come now , for I can not find one wise man among you .
KJ21	Job	17	11	My days are past , my purposes are broken off , even the thoughts of my heart .
KJ21	Job	17	12	They change the night into day ; the light is short because of darkness .
KJ21	Job	17	13	If I wait , the grave is mine house ; I have made my bed in the darkness .
KJ21	Job	17	14	I have said to corruption , ‘ Thou art my father ’ ; to the worm , ‘ Thou art my mother and my sister. ’
KJ21	Job	17	15	And where is now my hope ? As for my hope , who shall see it ?
KJ21	Job	17	16	It shall go down to the bars of the pit , when our rest together is in the dust . ”
KJ21	Job	18	18	He shall be driven from light into darkness , and chased out of the world .
KJ21	Job	18	2	“ How long will it be ere ye make an end of words ? Mark , and afterwards we will speak .
KJ21	Job	18	3	Why are we counted as beasts , and reputed vile in your sight ?
KJ21	Job	18	4	He teareth himself in his anger . Shall the earth be forsaken for thee ? And shall the rock be removed out of his place ?
KJ21	Job	18	5	“ Yea , the light of the wicked shall be put out , and the spark of his fire shall not shine .
KJ21	Job	18	6	The light shall be dark in his tabernacle , and his candle shall be put out with him .
KJ21	Job	18	7	The steps of his strength shall be straitened , and his own counsel shall cast him down .
KJ21	Job	18	8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he walketh upon a snare .
KJ21	Job	18	9	The trap shall take him by the heel , and the robber shall prevail against him .
KJ21	Job	18	10	The snare is laid for him in the ground , and a trap for him in the way .
KJ21	Job	18	11	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side , and shall drive him to his feet .
KJ21	Job	18	12	His strength shall be hungerbitten , and destruction shall be ready at his side .
KJ21	Job	18	13	It shall devour the strength of his skin ; even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength .
KJ21	Job	18	14	His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle , and it shall bring him to the king of terrors .
KJ21	Job	18	15	It shall dwell in his tabernacle , because it is none of his ; brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation .
KJ21	Job	18	16	His roots shall be dried up beneath , and above shall his branch be cut off .
KJ21	Job	18	17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth , and he shall have no name in the street .
KJ21	Job	18	19	He shall neither have son nor descendant among his people , nor any remaining in his dwellings .
KJ21	Job	18	20	They that come after him shall be dismayed at his day , as they that went before were frightened .
KJ21	Job	18	21	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked , and this is the place of him that knoweth not God . ”
KJ21	Job	19	19	All my intimate friends abhorred me , and they whom I loved are turned against me .
KJ21	Job	19	2	“ How long will ye vex my soul , and break me in pieces with words ?
KJ21	Job	19	3	These ten times have ye reproached me ; ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me .
KJ21	Job	19	4	And if it be indeed that I have erred , mine error remaineth with myself .
KJ21	Job	19	5	If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me , and plead against me my reproach ,
KJ21	Job	19	6	know now that God hath overthrown me , and hath compassed me with His net .
KJ21	Job	19	7	“ Behold , I cry out because of wrong , but I am not heard ; I cry aloud , but there is no judgment .
KJ21	Job	19	8	He hath fenced up my way , that I can not pass , and He hath set darkness in my paths .
KJ21	Job	19	9	He hath stripped me of my glory , and taken the crown from my head .
KJ21	Job	19	10	He hath destroyed me on every side , and I am gone ; and mine hope hath He removed like a tree .
KJ21	Job	19	11	He hath also kindled His wrath against me , and He counteth me unto Him as one of His enemies .
KJ21	Job	19	12	His troops come together , and raise up their way against me , and encamp round about my tabernacle .
KJ21	Job	19	13	“ He hath put my brethren far from me , and mine acquaintances are verily estranged from me .
KJ21	Job	19	14	My kinsfolk have failed , and my familiar friends have forgotten me .
KJ21	Job	19	15	They that dwell in mine house , and my maids , count me as a stranger ; I am an alien in their sight .
KJ21	Job	19	16	I called my servant , and he gave me no answer ; I entreated him with my mouth .
KJ21	Job	19	17	My breath is strange to my wife , though I entreated for the sake of the children of my own body .
KJ21	Job	19	18	Yea , young children despised me ; I arose , and they spoke against me .
KJ21	Job	19	20	My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh , and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth .
KJ21	Job	19	21	“ Have pity upon me , have pity upon me , O ye my friends , for the hand of God hath touched me !
KJ21	Job	19	22	Why do ye persecute me as God , and are not satisfied with my flesh ?
KJ21	Job	19	23	Oh , that my words were now written ! Oh , that they were printed in a book ,
KJ21	Job	19	24	that they were graven with an iron pen and lead , in the rock for ever !
KJ21	Job	19	25	For I know that my Redeemer liveth , and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth ;
KJ21	Job	19	26	and though after my skin , worms destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall I see God ,
KJ21	Job	19	27	whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall behold , and not another , though my reins be consumed within me .
KJ21	Job	19	28	“ But should ye say , ‘ Why persecute we him ? ’ —seeing the root of the matter is found in me .
KJ21	Job	19	29	Be ye afraid of the sword ; for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword , that ye may know there is a judgment . ”
KJ21	Job	20	20	surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly ; he shall not save of that which he desired .
KJ21	Job	20	2	“ Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer , and for this I make haste .
KJ21	Job	20	3	I have heard the rebuke of my reproach , and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer .
KJ21	Job	20	4	Knowest thou not this of old , since man was placed upon earth ,
KJ21	Job	20	5	that the triumphing of the wicked is short , and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment ?
KJ21	Job	20	6	Though his excellency mount up to the heavens , and his head reach unto the clouds ,
KJ21	Job	20	7	yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung ; they that have seen him shall say , ‘ Where is he ? ’
KJ21	Job	20	8	He shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found ; yea , he shall be chased away as a vision of the night .
KJ21	Job	20	9	The eye also which saw him shall see him no more , neither shall his place any more behold him .
KJ21	Job	20	10	His children shall seek to please the poor , and his hands shall restore their goods .
KJ21	Job	20	11	His bones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the dust .
KJ21	Job	20	12	“ Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth , though he hide it under his tongue ,
KJ21	Job	20	13	though he spare it and forsake it not , but keep it still within his mouth ,
KJ21	Job	20	14	yet his meat in his stomach is turned ; it is the gall of asps within him .
KJ21	Job	20	15	He hath swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again ; God shall cast them out of his belly .
KJ21	Job	20	16	He shall suck the poison of asps ; the viper ’ s tongue shall slay him .
KJ21	Job	20	17	He shall not see the rivers , the floods , the brooks of honey and butter .
KJ21	Job	20	18	That which he labored for shall he restore , and shall not swallow it down ; according to his substance shall the restitution be , and he shall not rejoice therein .
KJ21	Job	20	19	Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor , because he hath violently taken away a house which he built not ,
KJ21	Job	20	21	There shall none of his meat be left ; therefore shall no man look for his goods .
KJ21	Job	20	22	In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits ; every hand of the wicked shall come upon him .
KJ21	Job	20	23	When he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the fury of His wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating .
KJ21	Job	20	24	He shall flee from the iron weapon , and the bow of steel shall strike him through .
KJ21	Job	20	25	It is drawn and cometh out of the body ; yea , the glittering sword cometh out of his gall ; terrors are upon him .
KJ21	Job	20	26	All darkness shall be hid in his secret places ; a fire not blown upon shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle .
KJ21	Job	20	27	The heaven shall reveal his iniquity , and the earth shall rise up against him .
KJ21	Job	20	28	The increase of his house shall depart , and his goods shall flow away in the day of His wrath .
KJ21	Job	20	29	“ This is the portion of a wicked man from God , and the heritage appointed unto him by God . ”
KJ21	Job	21	21	For what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
KJ21	Job	21	2	“ Hear diligently my speech , and let this be your consolations .
KJ21	Job	21	3	Suffer me that I may speak ; and after I have spoken , mock on .
KJ21	Job	21	4	“ As for me , is my complaint to man ? And if it were so , why should not my spirit be troubled ?
KJ21	Job	21	5	Mark me , and be astonished , and lay your hand upon your mouth !
KJ21	Job	21	6	Even when I remember I am afraid , and trembling taketh hold on my flesh .
KJ21	Job	21	7	Why do the wicked live , become old , yea , are mighty in power ?
KJ21	Job	21	8	Their seed is established in their sight with them , and their offspring before their eyes .
KJ21	Job	21	9	Their houses are safe from fear , neither is the rod of God upon them .
KJ21	Job	21	10	Their bull breeds , and faileth not ; their cow calveth and casteth not her calf .
KJ21	Job	21	11	They send forth their little ones like a flock , and their children dance .
KJ21	Job	21	12	They take the timbrel and harp , and rejoice at the sound of the organ .
KJ21	Job	21	13	They spend their days in wealth , and in a moment go down to the grave .
KJ21	Job	21	14	Therefore they say unto God , ‘ Depart from us , for we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways .
KJ21	Job	21	15	What is the Almighty , that we should serve Him ? And what profit should we have , if we pray unto Him ? ’
KJ21	Job	21	16	Lo , their good is not in their hand ; the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
KJ21	Job	21	17	“ How oft is the candle of the wicked put out ! And how oft cometh their destruction upon them ! God distributeth sorrows in His anger .
KJ21	Job	21	18	They are as stubble before the wind , and as chaff that the storm carrieth away .
KJ21	Job	21	19	God layeth up his iniquity for his children ; He rewardeth him , and he shall know it .
KJ21	Job	21	20	His eyes shall see his destruction , and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty .
KJ21	Job	21	22	“ Shall any teach God knowledge , seeing He judgeth those that are high ?
KJ21	Job	21	23	One dieth in his full strength , being wholly at ease and quiet .
KJ21	Job	21	24	His milk pails are full of milk , and his bones are moistened with marrow .
KJ21	Job	21	25	And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul , and never eateth with pleasure .
KJ21	Job	21	26	They shall lie down alike in the dust , and the worms shall cover them .
KJ21	Job	21	27	“ Behold , I know your thoughts , and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me .
KJ21	Job	21	28	For ye say , ‘ Where is the house of the prince ? And where are the dwelling places of the wicked ? ’
KJ21	Job	21	29	Have ye not asked them that go along the way ? And do ye not know their tokens ,
KJ21	Job	21	30	that the wicked are reserved for the day of destruction ? They shall be brought forth on the day of wrath .
KJ21	Job	21	31	Who shall declare his way to his face ? And who shall repay him what he hath done ?
KJ21	Job	21	32	Yet shall he be brought to the grave , and shall remain in the tomb .
KJ21	Job	21	33	The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him , and every man shall draw after him , as there are innumerable before him .
KJ21	Job	21	34	“ How then comfort ye me in vain , seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood ? ”
KJ21	Job	22	22	Receive , I pray thee , the law from His mouth , and lay up His words in thine heart .
KJ21	Job	22	2	“ Can a man be profitable unto God , as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ?
KJ21	Job	22	3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous ? Or is it gain to Him that thou makest thy ways perfect ?
KJ21	Job	22	4	Will He reprove thee for fear of thee ? Will He enter with thee into judgment ?
KJ21	Job	22	5	Is not thy wickedness great , and thine iniquities infinite ?
KJ21	Job	22	6	For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought , and stripped the naked of their clothing .
KJ21	Job	22	7	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink , and thou hast withheld bread from the hungry .
KJ21	Job	22	8	But as for the mighty man , he had the earth , and the honorable man dwelt in it .
KJ21	Job	22	9	Thou hast sent widows away empty , and the arms of the fatherless have been broken .
KJ21	Job	22	10	Therefore snares are round about thee , and sudden fear troubleth thee ,
KJ21	Job	22	11	or darkness , that thou canst not see , and abundance of waters cover thee .
KJ21	Job	22	12	“ Is not God in the height of heaven ? And behold the height of the stars , how high they are !
KJ21	Job	22	13	And thou sayest , ‘ How doth God know ? Can He judge through the dark cloud ?
KJ21	Job	22	14	Thick clouds are a covering to Him , that He seeth not ; and He walketh in the circuit of heaven. ’
KJ21	Job	22	15	Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden ,
KJ21	Job	22	16	who were cut down before their time , whose foundation was overflown with a flood ,
KJ21	Job	22	17	who said unto God , ‘ Depart from us . And what can the Almighty do to them ? ’
KJ21	Job	22	18	Yet He filled their houses with good things ; but the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
KJ21	Job	22	19	The righteous see it and are glad , and the innocent laugh them to scorn ;
KJ21	Job	22	20	whereas our substance is not cut down , but the remnant of them the fire consumeth .
KJ21	Job	22	21	“ Acquaint now thyself with Him , and be at peace ; thereby good shall come unto thee .
KJ21	Job	22	23	If thou return to the Almighty , thou shalt be built up ; thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles .
KJ21	Job	22	24	Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust , and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks .
KJ21	Job	22	25	Yea , the Almighty shall be thy gold , and thou shalt have plenty of silver .
KJ21	Job	22	26	For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty , and shalt lift up thy face unto God .
KJ21	Job	22	27	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto Him , and He shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy vows .
KJ21	Job	22	28	Thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee ; and the light shall shine upon thy ways .
KJ21	Job	22	29	When men are cast down , then thou shalt say , ‘ There is lifting up ! ’ And He shall save the humble person .
KJ21	Job	22	30	He shall deliver the island of the innocent ; and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands . ”
KJ21	Job	23	23	Then Job answered and said :
KJ21	Job	23	2	“ Even today is my complaint bitter ; my stroke is heavier than my groaning .
KJ21	Job	23	3	Oh that I knew where I might find Him , that I might come even to His seat !
KJ21	Job	23	4	I would place my cause before Him , and fill my mouth with arguments .
KJ21	Job	23	5	I would know the words which He would answer me , and understand what He would say unto me .
KJ21	Job	23	6	Will He plead against me with His great power ? No , but He would put strength in me .
KJ21	Job	23	7	There the righteous might dispute with Him ; so should I be delivered for ever from my Judge .
KJ21	Job	23	8	“ Behold , I go forward , but He is not there , and backward , but I can not perceive Him ;
KJ21	Job	23	9	on the left hand where He doth work , but I can not behold Him ; He hideth himself on the right hand , that I can not see Him .
KJ21	Job	23	10	But He knoweth the way that I take ; when He hath tried me , I shall come forth as gold .
KJ21	Job	23	11	My foot hath held His steps ; His way have I kept , and not declined .
KJ21	Job	23	12	Neither have I gone back from the commandment of His lips ; I have esteemed the words of His mouth more than my necessary food .
KJ21	Job	23	13	But He is of one mind , and who can turn Him ? And what His soul desireth , even that He doeth .
KJ21	Job	23	14	For He performeth the thing that is appointed for me ; and many such things are with Him .
KJ21	Job	23	15	Therefore am I troubled at His presence ; when I consider , I am afraid of Him .
KJ21	Job	23	16	For God maketh my heart soft , and the Almighty troubleth me ;
KJ21	Job	23	17	because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither hath He covered the darkness from my face .
KJ21	Job	24	24	They are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all others , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn .
KJ21	Job	24	2	Some remove the landmarks ; they violently take away flocks and feed thereof .
KJ21	Job	24	3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless ; they take the widow ’ s ox as a pledge .
KJ21	Job	24	4	They turn the needy out of the way ; the poor of the earth hide themselves together .
KJ21	Job	24	5	Behold , as wild asses in the desert go they forth to their work , rising early for a prey ; the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children .
KJ21	Job	24	6	They reap every one his corn in the field , and they gather the vintage of the wicked .
KJ21	Job	24	7	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing , that they have no covering in the cold .
KJ21	Job	24	8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for want of a shelter .
KJ21	Job	24	9	They pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge from the poor .
KJ21	Job	24	10	They cause him to go naked without clothing , and they take away the sheaf from the hungry ,
KJ21	Job	24	11	who make oil within their walls , and tread their wine presses , and suffer thirst .
KJ21	Job	24	12	Men groan from out of the city , and the soul of the wounded crieth out ; yet God layeth not folly to them .
KJ21	Job	24	13	“ They are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof .
KJ21	Job	24	14	The murderer , rising with the light , killeth the poor and needy , and in the night is as a thief .
KJ21	Job	24	15	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight , saying , ‘ No eye shall see me , ’ and disguiseth his face .
KJ21	Job	24	16	In the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for themselves in the daytime ; they know not the light .
KJ21	Job	24	17	For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death ; if one know them , they are in the terrors of the shadow of death .
KJ21	Job	24	18	“ He is swift as the waters ; their portion is cursed on the earth ; he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards .
KJ21	Job	24	19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters ; so doth the grave those who have sinned .
KJ21	Job	24	20	The womb shall forget him , the worm shall feed sweetly on him ; he shall be no more remembered , and wickedness shall be broken as a tree .
KJ21	Job	24	21	He evilly treateth the barren that beareth not , and doeth not good to the widow .
KJ21	Job	24	22	He draweth also the mighty with his power ; he riseth up , and no man is sure of life .
KJ21	Job	24	23	Though it be given him to be in safety whereon he resteth , yet his eyes are upon their ways .
KJ21	Job	24	25	And if it be not so now , who will make me a liar and make my speech worth nothing ? ”
KJ21	Job	25	25	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite and said :
KJ21	Job	25	2	“ Dominion and fear are with Him ; He maketh peace in His high places .
KJ21	Job	25	3	Is there any number to His armies ? And upon whom doth not His light arise ?
KJ21	Job	25	4	How then can man be justified before God ? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman ?
KJ21	Job	25	5	Behold even to the moon , and it shineth not ; yea , the stars are not pure in His sight .
KJ21	Job	25	6	How much less man , that is a worm ? And the son of man , that is a worm ? ”
KJ21	Job	26	26	But Job answered and said :
KJ21	Job	26	2	“ How hast thou helped him that is without power ? How savest thou the arm that hath no strength ?
KJ21	Job	26	3	How hast thou counseled him that hath no wisdom ? And how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is ?
KJ21	Job	26	4	To whom hast thou uttered words ? And whose spirit came from thee ?
KJ21	Job	26	5	Dead things are formed from under the waters , and the inhabitants thereof .
KJ21	Job	26	6	“ Hell is naked before Him , and destruction hath no covering .
KJ21	Job	26	7	He stretcheth out the north over the empty place , and hangeth the earth upon nothing .
KJ21	Job	26	8	He bindeth up the waters in His thick clouds , and the cloud is not rent under them .
KJ21	Job	26	9	He holdeth back the face of His throne , and spreadeth His cloud upon it .
KJ21	Job	26	10	He hath compassed the waters with bounds , until the day and night come to an end .
KJ21	Job	26	11	The pillars of heaven tremble , and are astonished at His reproof .
KJ21	Job	26	12	He divideth the sea with His power , and by His understanding He smiteth through the proud .
KJ21	Job	26	13	By His Spirit He hath garnished the heavens ; His hand hath formed the crooked serpent .
KJ21	Job	26	14	Lo , these are parts of His ways , but how little a portion is heard of Him ! But the thunder of His power , who can understand ? ”
KJ21	Job	27	27	Moreover Job continued his parable and said :
KJ21	Job	27	2	“ As God liveth , who hath taken away my judgment , and the Almighty , who hath vexed my soul ,
KJ21	Job	27	3	while my breath is in me and the spirit of God is in my nostrils ,
KJ21	Job	27	4	my lips shall not speak wickedness , nor my tongue utter deceit .
KJ21	Job	27	5	God forbid that I should justify you ; till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me .
KJ21	Job	27	6	My righteousness I hold fast , and will not let it go ; my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live .
KJ21	Job	27	7	“ Let mine enemy be as the wicked , and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous .
KJ21	Job	27	8	For what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained , when God taketh away his soul ?
KJ21	Job	27	9	Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him ?
KJ21	Job	27	10	Will he delight himself in the Almighty ? Will he always call upon God ?
KJ21	Job	27	11	I will teach you by the hand of God ; that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal .
KJ21	Job	27	12	Behold , all ye yourselves have seen it ; why then are ye thus altogether vain ?
KJ21	Job	27	13	“ This is the portion of a wicked man with God , and the heritage of oppressors , which they shall receive from the Almighty .
KJ21	Job	27	14	If his children be multiplied , it is for the sword ; and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread .
KJ21	Job	27	15	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death ; and his widows shall not weep .
KJ21	Job	27	16	Though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the clay ,
KJ21	Job	27	17	he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silver .
KJ21	Job	27	18	He buildeth his house as a moth , and as a booth that the keeper maketh .
KJ21	Job	27	19	The rich man shall lie down , but he shall not be gathered ; he openeth his eyes , and he is not .
KJ21	Job	27	20	Terrors take hold on him as waters ; a tempest stealeth him away in the night .
KJ21	Job	27	21	The east wind carrieth him away and he departeth , and as a storm , hurleth him out of his place .
KJ21	Job	27	22	For God shall cast upon him , and not spare ; he would eagerly flee out of His hand .
KJ21	Job	27	23	Men shall clap their hands at him , and shall hiss him out of his place .
KJ21	Job	28	28	And unto man He said , ‘ Behold , the fear of the Lord : that is wisdom ; and to depart from evil is understanding . ’ ”
KJ21	Job	28	2	Iron is taken out of the earth , and brass is smelted out of the stone .
KJ21	Job	28	3	Man setteth an end to darkness , and searcheth out all perfection , the stones of darkness , and the shadow of death .
KJ21	Job	28	4	The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant , even the waters forgotten by the foot ; they are dried up , they are gone away from men .
KJ21	Job	28	5	As for the earth , out of it cometh bread , and under it is turned up as it were fire .
KJ21	Job	28	6	The stones of it are the place of sapphires , and it hath dust of gold .
KJ21	Job	28	7	There is a path which no fowl knoweth , and which the vulture ’ s eye hath not seen .
KJ21	Job	28	8	The lion ’ s whelps have not trodden it , nor the fierce lion passed by it .
KJ21	Job	28	9	Man putteth forth his hand upon the rock ; he overturneth the mountains by the roots ;
KJ21	Job	28	10	he cutteth out rivers among the rocks , and his eye seeth every precious thing ;
KJ21	Job	28	11	he bindeth the floods from overflowing ; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light .
KJ21	Job	28	12	But where shall wisdom be found ? And where is the place of understanding ?
KJ21	Job	28	13	Man knoweth not the price thereof ; neither is it found in the land of the living .
KJ21	Job	28	14	The deep saith , ‘ It is not in me ’ ; and the sea saith , ‘ It is not with me. ’
KJ21	Job	28	15	It can not be gotten for gold ; neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof .
KJ21	Job	28	16	It can not be valued with the gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx or the sapphire .
KJ21	Job	28	17	The gold and the crystal can not equal it ; and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold .
KJ21	Job	28	18	No mention shall be made of coral or of pearls , for the price of wisdom is above rubies .
KJ21	Job	28	19	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it ; neither shall it be valued with pure gold .
KJ21	Job	28	20	“ Whence then cometh wisdom ? And where is the place of understanding—
KJ21	Job	28	21	seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living , and kept close from the fowls of the air ?
KJ21	Job	28	22	Destruction and death say , ‘ We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. ’
KJ21	Job	28	23	God understandeth the way thereof , and He knoweth the place thereof .
KJ21	Job	28	24	For He looketh to the ends of the earth , and seeth under the whole heaven ,
KJ21	Job	28	25	to make the weight for the winds , and He weigheth the waters by measure .
KJ21	Job	28	26	When He made a decree for the rain , and a way for the lightning of the thunder ,
KJ21	Job	28	27	then did He see it and declare it ; He prepared it , yea , and searched it out .
KJ21	Job	29	29	Moreover Job continued his parable and said :
KJ21	Job	29	2	“ Oh , that I were as in months past , as in the days when God preserved me ;
KJ21	Job	29	3	when His candle shone upon my head , and when by His light I walked through darkness ,
KJ21	Job	29	4	as I was in the days of my youth , when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle ;
KJ21	Job	29	5	when the Almighty was yet with me , when my children were about me ;
KJ21	Job	29	6	when I washed my steps with butter , and the rock poured me out rivers of oil ;
KJ21	Job	29	7	when I went out to the gate through the city , when I prepared my seat in the street !
KJ21	Job	29	8	The young men saw me and hid themselves , and the aged arose and stood up .
KJ21	Job	29	9	The princes refrained from talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
KJ21	Job	29	10	The nobles held their peace , and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth .
KJ21	Job	29	11	When the ear heard me , then it blessed me , and when the eye saw me , it gave witness to me ;
KJ21	Job	29	12	because I delivered the poor that cried , and the fatherless and him that had none to help him .
KJ21	Job	29	13	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me ; and I caused the widow ’ s heart to sing for joy .
KJ21	Job	29	14	I put on righteousness , and it clothed me ; my judgment was as a robe and a diadem .
KJ21	Job	29	15	I was eyes to the blind , and feet was I to the lame .
KJ21	Job	29	16	I was a father to the poor , and the cause which I knew not I searched out .
KJ21	Job	29	17	And I broke the jaws of the wicked , and plucked the spoil out of his teeth .
KJ21	Job	29	18	“ Then I said , ‘ I shall die in my nest , and I shall multiply my days as the sand. ’
KJ21	Job	29	19	My root was spread out by the waters , and the dew lay all night upon my branch .
KJ21	Job	29	20	My glory was fresh in me , and my bow was renewed in my hand .
KJ21	Job	29	21	“ Unto me men gave ear and waited , and kept silence at my counsel .
KJ21	Job	29	22	After my words they spoke not again , and my speech dropped upon them .
KJ21	Job	29	23	And they waited for me as for the rain , and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain .
KJ21	Job	29	24	If I laughed on them , they believed it not , and the light of my countenance they cast not down .
KJ21	Job	29	25	I chose out their way and sat as chief , and dwelt as a king in the army , as one that comforteth the mourners .
KJ21	Job	30	30	My skin is black upon me , and my bones are burned with heat .
KJ21	Job	30	2	Yea , for what might the strength of their hands profit me , in whom old age was perished ?
KJ21	Job	30	3	From want and famine they were solitary , fleeing into the wilderness , in former time desolate and waste ,
KJ21	Job	30	4	who cut up mallow by the bushes , and juniper roots for their meat .
KJ21	Job	30	5	They were driven forth from among men ; they cried after them as after a thief ,
KJ21	Job	30	6	to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys , in caves of the earth and in the rocks .
KJ21	Job	30	7	Among the bushes they brayed ; under the nettles they were gathered together .
KJ21	Job	30	8	They were children of fools , yea , children of base men ; they were viler than the earth .
KJ21	Job	30	9	“ And now am I their song ; yea , I am their byword .
KJ21	Job	30	10	They abhor me , they flee far from me , and spare not to spit in my face .
KJ21	Job	30	11	Because He hath loosed my cord and afflicted me , they have also let loose the bridle before me .
KJ21	Job	30	12	Upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destructiveness .
KJ21	Job	30	13	They mar my path , they set forward my calamity ; they have no helper .
KJ21	Job	30	14	They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters ; in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me .
KJ21	Job	30	15	Terrors are turned upon me ; they pursue my soul as the wind , and my welfare passeth away as a cloud .
KJ21	Job	30	16	“ And now my soul is poured out upon me ; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me .
KJ21	Job	30	17	My bones are pierced in me in the night season , and my sinews take no rest .
KJ21	Job	30	18	By the great force of my disease is my garment changed ; it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat .
KJ21	Job	30	19	He hath cast me into the mire , and I am become like dust and ashes .
KJ21	Job	30	20	I cry unto Thee , and Thou dost not hear me ; I stand up , and Thou regardest me not .
KJ21	Job	30	21	Thou art become cruel to me ; with Thy strong hand Thou opposest Thyself against me .
KJ21	Job	30	22	Thou liftest me up to the wind ; Thou causest me to ride upon it , and dissolvest my substance .
KJ21	Job	30	23	For I know that Thou wilt bring me to death , and to the house appointed for all living .
KJ21	Job	30	24	“ Yet He will not stretch out His hand to the grave , though they cry in His destruction .
KJ21	Job	30	25	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble ? Was not my soul grieved for the poor ?
KJ21	Job	30	26	When I looked for good , then evil came unto me ; and when I waited for light , there came darkness .
KJ21	Job	30	27	My bowels boiled , and rested not ; the days of affliction came upon me .
KJ21	Job	30	28	I went mourning without the sun ; I stood up , and I cried in the congregation .
KJ21	Job	30	29	I am a brother to dragons , and a companion to owls .
KJ21	Job	30	31	My harp also is turned to mourning , and my flute into the voice of them that weep .
KJ21	Job	31	31	If the men of my tent said not , ‘ Oh that we had of his flesh ! We can not be satisfied ’ .
KJ21	Job	31	2	For what portion from God is there from above , and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high ?
KJ21	Job	31	3	Is not destruction for the wicked , and a strange punishment for the workers of iniquity ?
KJ21	Job	31	4	Doth not He see my ways , and count all my steps ?
KJ21	Job	31	5	If I have walked with vanity , or if my foot hath hastened to deceit ,
KJ21	Job	31	6	let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may know mine integrity .
KJ21	Job	31	7	If my step hath turned out of the way , and mine heart walked after mine eyes , and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands ,
KJ21	Job	31	8	then let me sow and let another eat ; yea , let my offspring be rooted out .
KJ21	Job	31	9	“ If mine heart has been deceived by a woman , or if I have laid wait at my neighbor ’ s door ,
KJ21	Job	31	10	then let my wife grind for another , and let others bow down upon her .
KJ21	Job	31	11	For this is a heinous crime ; yea , it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges .
KJ21	Job	31	12	For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction , and would root out all mine increase .
KJ21	Job	31	13	“ If I have despised the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant when they contended with me ,
KJ21	Job	31	14	what then shall I do when God riseth up ? And when He visiteth , what shall I answer Him ?
KJ21	Job	31	15	Did not He that made me in the womb make him ? And did not One fashion us in the womb ?
KJ21	Job	31	16	“ If I have withheld the poor from their desire , or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail ;
KJ21	Job	31	17	or have eaten my morsel myself alone , and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof
KJ21	Job	31	18	( for from my youth he was brought up with me as with a father , and I have guided her from my mother ’ s womb ) ;
KJ21	Job	31	19	if I have seen any perish for want of clothing , or any poor without covering ;
KJ21	Job	31	20	if his loins have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep ;
KJ21	Job	31	21	if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless , when I saw my help in the gate ”
KJ21	Job	31	22	then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade , and mine arm be broken from the bone .
KJ21	Job	31	23	For destruction from God was a terror to me , and by reason of His highness I could not endure .
KJ21	Job	31	24	“ If I have made gold my hope , or have said to the fine gold , ‘ Thou art my confidence ’ ;
KJ21	Job	31	25	if I rejoiced because my wealth was great , and because mine hand had gotten much ;
KJ21	Job	31	26	if I beheld the sun when it shined , or the moon walking in brightness ,
KJ21	Job	31	27	and my heart hath been secretly enticed , or my mouth hath kissed my hand—
KJ21	Job	31	28	this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge , for I should have denied the God that is above .
KJ21	Job	31	29	“ If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him ,
KJ21	Job	31	30	neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul .
KJ21	Job	31	32	The stranger did not lodge in the street , but I opened my doors to the traveler .
KJ21	Job	31	33	If I covered my transgressions as Adam , by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom ,
KJ21	Job	31	34	did I fear a great multitude , or did the contempt of families terrify me , that I kept silence and went not out of the door ?
KJ21	Job	31	35	Oh , that One would hear me ! Behold , my desire is that the Almighty would answer me , and that mine adversary had written a book !
KJ21	Job	31	36	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder , and bind it as a crown to me .
KJ21	Job	31	37	I would declare unto Him the number of my steps ; as a prince would I go near unto Him .
KJ21	Job	31	38	“ If my land cry against me , or that the furrows likewise thereof complain ,
KJ21	Job	31	39	if I have eaten the fruits thereof without money , or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life ,
KJ21	Job	31	40	let thistles grow instead of wheat , and cockle instead of barley. ” The words of Job are ended .
KJ21	Job	32	32	So these three men ceased to answer Job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
KJ21	Job	32	2	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu , the son of Barachel the Buzite , of the kindred of Ram . Against Job was his wrath kindled , because he justified himself rather than God .
KJ21	Job	32	3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled , because they had found no answer and yet had condemned Job .
KJ21	Job	32	4	Now Elihu had waited until Job had spoken , because they were older than he .
KJ21	Job	32	5	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men , then his wrath was kindled .
KJ21	Job	32	6	And Elihu , the son of Barachel the Buzite , answered and said : “ I am young , and ye are very old ; therefore I was afraid , and dared not show you mine opinion .
KJ21	Job	32	7	I said , ‘ Days should speak , and multitude of years should teach wisdom. ’
KJ21	Job	32	8	But there is a spirit in man , and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding .
KJ21	Job	32	9	Great men are not always wise , neither do the aged understand judgment .
KJ21	Job	32	10	Therefore I say , ‘ Hearken to me ; I also will show mine opinion. ’
KJ21	Job	32	11	“ Behold , I waited for your words ; I gave ear to your reasons , whilst ye searched out what to say .
KJ21	Job	32	12	Yea , I attended unto you , and behold , there was none of you that convinced Job or that answered his words ,
KJ21	Job	32	13	lest ye should say , ‘ We have found out wisdom . God thrusteth him down , not man. ’
KJ21	Job	32	14	Now he hath not directed his words against me , neither will I answer him with your speeches .
KJ21	Job	32	15	“ They were amazed , they answered no more ; they left off speaking .
KJ21	Job	32	16	When I had waited ( for they spoke not , but stood still and answered no more ) ,
KJ21	Job	32	17	I said , ‘ I will answer also my part ; I also will show mine opinion .
KJ21	Job	32	18	For I am full of matters ; the spirit within me constraineth me .
KJ21	Job	32	19	Behold , my belly is as wine which hath no vent ; it is ready to burst like new wineskins. ’
KJ21	Job	32	20	I will speak , that I may be refreshed ; I will open my lips and answer .
KJ21	Job	32	21	Let me not , I pray you , accept any man ’ s person , neither let me give flattering titles unto man .
KJ21	Job	32	22	For I know not to give flattering titles ; in so doing my Maker would soon take me away .
KJ21	Job	33	33	If not , hearken unto me ; hold thy peace , and I shall teach thee wisdom . ”
KJ21	Job	33	2	Behold , now I have opened my mouth ; my tongue hath spoken in my mouth .
KJ21	Job	33	3	My words shall be from the uprightness of my heart , and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly .
KJ21	Job	33	4	The Spirit of God hath made me , and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life .
KJ21	Job	33	5	If thou canst answer me , set thy words in order before me and stand up .
KJ21	Job	33	6	Behold , I am according to thy wish in God ’ s stead , I also am formed out of the clay .
KJ21	Job	33	7	Behold , terror of me shall not make thee afraid , neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee .
KJ21	Job	33	8	“ Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing , and I have heard the voice of thy words , saying ,
KJ21	Job	33	9	‘ I am clean , without transgression , I am innocent ; neither is there iniquity in me .
KJ21	Job	33	10	Behold , He findeth occasions against me ; He counteth me for His enemy .
KJ21	Job	33	11	He putteth my feet in the stocks ; He marketh all my paths. ’
KJ21	Job	33	12	“ Behold , in this thou art not just ; I will answer thee : that God is greater than man .
KJ21	Job	33	13	Why dost thou strive against Him ? For He giveth not account of any of His matters .
KJ21	Job	33	14	For God speaketh once , yea twice , yet man perceiveth it not .
KJ21	Job	33	15	In a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth upon men , in slumberings upon the bed ,
KJ21	Job	33	16	then He openeth the ears of men , and sealeth their instruction ,
KJ21	Job	33	17	that He may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man .
KJ21	Job	33	18	He keepeth back his soul from the pit , and his life from perishing by the sword .
KJ21	Job	33	19	“ He is chastened also with pain upon his bed , and the multitude of his bones with strong pain ,
KJ21	Job	33	20	so that his life abhorreth bread , and his soul dainty meat .
KJ21	Job	33	21	His flesh is consumed away , that it can not be seen , and his bones that were not seen stick out .
KJ21	Job	33	22	Yea , his soul draweth near unto the grave , and his life to the destroyers .
KJ21	Job	33	23	If there be a messenger with him , an interpreter , one among a thousand to show unto man his uprightness ,
KJ21	Job	33	24	then he is gracious unto him and saith , ‘ Deliver him from going down to the pit ; I have found a ransom. ’
KJ21	Job	33	25	His flesh shall be fresher than a child ’ s ; he shall return to the days of his youth .
KJ21	Job	33	26	He shall pray unto God , and He will be favorable unto him ; and he shall see His face with joy , for He will render unto man His righteousness .
KJ21	Job	33	27	He looketh upon men , and if any say , ‘ I have sinned and perverted that which was right , and it profited me not , ’
KJ21	Job	33	28	He will deliver his soul from going into the pit , and his life shall see the light .
KJ21	Job	33	29	“ Lo , all these things worketh God oftentimes with man ,
KJ21	Job	33	30	to bring back his soul from the pit , to be enlightened with the light of the living .
KJ21	Job	33	31	Mark well , O Job , hearken unto me ; hold thy peace , and I will speak .
KJ21	Job	33	32	If thou hast any thing to say , answer me ; speak , for I desire to justify thee .
KJ21	Job	34	34	Let men of understanding tell me , and let a wise man hearken unto me .
KJ21	Job	34	2	“ Hear my words , O ye wise men ; and give ear unto me , ye that have knowledge .
KJ21	Job	34	3	For the ear trieth words , as the mouth tasteth meat .
KJ21	Job	34	4	Let us choose for us judgment ; let us know among ourselves what is good .
KJ21	Job	34	5	For Job hath said , ‘ I am righteous , and God hath taken away my judgment .
KJ21	Job	34	6	Should I lie against my right ? My wound is incurable , without transgression. ’
KJ21	Job	34	7	What man is like Job , who drinketh up scorning like water ,
KJ21	Job	34	8	who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity , and walketh with wicked men ?
KJ21	Job	34	9	For he hath said , ‘ It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. ’
KJ21	Job	34	10	“ Therefore hearken unto me , ye men of understanding ; far be it from God that He should do wickedness , and from the Almighty that He should commit iniquity .
KJ21	Job	34	11	For the work of a man shall He render unto him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
KJ21	Job	34	12	Yea , surely God will not do wickedly , neither will the Almighty pervert judgment .
KJ21	Job	34	13	Who hath given Him a charge over the earth ? Or who hath disposed the whole world ?
KJ21	Job	34	14	If He set His heart upon man , if He gather unto Himself his Spirit and his breath ,
KJ21	Job	34	15	all flesh shall perish together , and man shall turn again unto dust .
KJ21	Job	34	16	“ If now thou hast understanding , hear this ; hearken to the voice of my words :
KJ21	Job	34	17	Shall even he that hateth right govern ? And wilt thou condemn him that is most just ?
KJ21	Job	34	18	Is it fit to say to a king , ‘ Thou art wicked ’ ? And to princes , ‘ Ye are ungodly ’ ?
KJ21	Job	34	19	How much less to Him that accepteth not the persons of princes , nor regardeth the rich more than the poor ! For they all are the work of His hands .
KJ21	Job	34	20	In a moment shall they die , and the people shall be troubled at midnight , and pass away ; and the mighty shall be taken away without hand .
KJ21	Job	34	21	“ For His eyes are upon the ways of man , and He seeth all his goings .
KJ21	Job	34	22	There is no darkness , nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves .
KJ21	Job	34	23	For He will not lay upon man more than right , that he should enter into judgment with God .
KJ21	Job	34	24	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number , and set others in their stead .
KJ21	Job	34	25	Therefore He knoweth their works , and He overturneth them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
KJ21	Job	34	26	He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others ,
KJ21	Job	34	27	because they turned back from Him , and would not consider any of His ways ,
KJ21	Job	34	28	so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto Him , and He heareth the cry of the afflicted .
KJ21	Job	34	29	When He giveth quietness , who then can make trouble ? And when He hideth His face , who then can behold Him , whether it be done against a nation , or against a man only ? —
KJ21	Job	34	30	that the hypocrite reign not , lest the people be ensnared .
KJ21	Job	34	31	“ Surely it is meet to be said unto God , ‘ I have borne chastisement ; I will not offend any more .
KJ21	Job	34	32	That which I see not , teach Thou me ; if I have done iniquity , I will do no more. ’
KJ21	Job	34	33	Should it be according to thy mind ? He will recompense it , whether thou refuse or whether thou choose , and not I ; therefore speak what thou knowest .
KJ21	Job	34	35	“ Job hath spoken without knowledge , and his words were without wisdom .
KJ21	Job	34	36	My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end , because of his answers for wicked men .
KJ21	Job	34	37	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin ; he clappeth his hands among us , and multiplieth his words against God . ”
KJ21	Job	35	35	Elihu spoke moreover and said :
KJ21	Job	35	2	“ Thinkest thou this to be right that thou saidst , ‘ My righteousness is more than God ’ s ’ ?
KJ21	Job	35	3	For thou saidst , ‘ What advantage will it be unto Thee ? ’ and , ‘ What profit shall I have if I be cleansed from my sin ? ’
KJ21	Job	35	5	Look unto the heavens and see ; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou .
KJ21	Job	35	6	If thou sinnest , what doest thou against Him ? Or if thy transgressions be multiplied , what doest thou unto Him ?
KJ21	Job	35	7	If thou be righteous , what givest thou Him ? Or what receiveth He of thine hand ?
KJ21	Job	35	8	Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art ; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man .
KJ21	Job	35	9	“ By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry ; they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty .
KJ21	Job	35	10	But none saith , ‘ Where is God my Maker , who giveth songs in the night ,
KJ21	Job	35	11	who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth , and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven ? ’
KJ21	Job	35	12	There they cry , but none giveth answer , because of the pride of evil men .
KJ21	Job	35	13	Surely God will not hear vanity , neither will the Almighty regard it .
KJ21	Job	35	14	Although thou sayest thou shalt not see Him , yet judgment is before Him ; therefore trust thou in Him .
KJ21	Job	35	15	But now , because it is not so , He hath visited in His anger ; yet he knoweth it not in his great extremity .
KJ21	Job	35	16	Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain ; he multiplieth words without knowledge . ”
KJ21	Job	36	36	Elihu also proceeded and said :
KJ21	Job	36	2	“ Suffer me a little , and I will show thee that I have yet to speak on God ’ s behalf .
KJ21	Job	36	3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar , and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker .
KJ21	Job	36	4	For truly my words shall not be false ; He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee .
KJ21	Job	36	5	“ Behold , God is mighty and despiseth not any ; He is mighty in strength and wisdom .
KJ21	Job	36	6	He preserveth not the life of the wicked , but giveth right to the poor .
KJ21	Job	36	7	He withdraweth not His eyes from the righteous , but with kings are they on the throne ; yea , He doth establish them for ever , and they are exalted .
KJ21	Job	36	8	And if they be bound in fetters , and be held in cords of affliction ,
KJ21	Job	36	9	then He showeth them their work , and their transgressions that they have exceeded .
KJ21	Job	36	10	He openeth also their ear to discipline , and commandeth that they return from iniquity .
KJ21	Job	36	11	If they obey and serve Him , they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasures .
KJ21	Job	36	12	But if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
KJ21	Job	36	13	“ But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath ; they cry not when He bindeth them .
KJ21	Job	36	14	They die in youth , and their life is among the unclean .
KJ21	Job	36	15	He delivereth the poor in his affliction , and openeth their ears in oppression .
KJ21	Job	36	16	Even so would He have removed thee out of thy straits into a broad place where there is no straitness ; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness .
KJ21	Job	36	17	“ But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked ; judgment and justice take hold on thee .
KJ21	Job	36	18	Because there is wrath , beware lest He take thee away with His stroke ; then a great ransom can not deliver thee .
KJ21	Job	36	19	Will He esteem thy riches ? No , not gold nor all the forces of strength .
KJ21	Job	36	20	Desire not the night , when people are cut off in their place .
KJ21	Job	36	21	Take heed , regard not iniquity , for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction .
KJ21	Job	36	22	Behold , God exalteth by His power . Who teacheth like Him ?
KJ21	Job	36	23	Who hath enjoined Him His way ? Or who can say , ‘ Thou hast wrought iniquity ’ ?
KJ21	Job	36	24	“ Remember that thou magnify His work , which men behold .
KJ21	Job	36	25	Every man may see it ; man may behold it afar off .
KJ21	Job	36	26	Behold , God is great , and we know Him not ; neither can the number of His years be searched out .
KJ21	Job	36	27	For He maketh small the drops of water ; they pour down rain according to the vapor thereof ,
KJ21	Job	36	28	which the clouds do drop and distill upon man abundantly .
KJ21	Job	36	29	Also , can any understand the spreadings of the clouds , or the noise of His tabernacle ?
KJ21	Job	36	30	Behold , He spreadeth His light upon it , and covereth the bottom of the sea .
KJ21	Job	36	31	For by them judgeth He the people ; He giveth meat in abundance .
KJ21	Job	36	32	With clouds He covereth the light , and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh between .
KJ21	Job	36	33	The noise thereof showeth concerning it ; the cattle also , concerning the vapor .
KJ21	Job	37	37	“ At this also my heart trembleth , and is moved out of his place .
KJ21	Job	37	2	Hear attentively the noise of His voice , and the sound that goeth out of His mouth .
KJ21	Job	37	3	He directeth it under the whole heaven , and His lightning unto the ends of the earth .
KJ21	Job	37	4	After it a voice roareth ; He thundereth with the voice of His excellency , and He will not stay them when His voice is heard .
KJ21	Job	37	5	God thundereth marvelously with His voice ; great things doeth He , which we can not comprehend !
KJ21	Job	37	6	For He saith to the snow , ‘ Be thou on the earth ’ ; likewise to the small rain and to the great rain of His strength .
KJ21	Job	37	7	He sealeth up the hand of every man , that all men may know His work .
KJ21	Job	37	8	Then the beasts go into dens , and remain in their places .
KJ21	Job	37	9	Out of the south cometh the whirlwind , and cold out of the north .
KJ21	Job	37	10	By the breath of God frost is given , and the breadth of the waters is straitened .
KJ21	Job	37	11	Also by watering He wearieth the thick cloud ; He scattereth His bright cloud ,
KJ21	Job	37	12	and it is turned round about by His counsels , that they may do whatsoever He commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth .
KJ21	Job	37	13	He causeth it to come—whether for correction , or for His land , or for mercy .
KJ21	Job	37	14	“ Hearken unto this , O Job ; stand still and consider the wondrous works of God .
KJ21	Job	37	15	Dost thou know when God disposed them , and caused the light of His cloud to shine ?
KJ21	Job	37	16	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds , the wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge ?
KJ21	Job	37	17	How thy garments are warm , when He quieteth the earth by the south wind ?
KJ21	Job	37	18	Hast thou with Him spread out the sky , which is strong and as a molten looking glass ?
KJ21	Job	37	19	Teach us what we shall say unto Him , for we can not order our speech by reason of darkness .
KJ21	Job	37	20	Shall it be told Him that I speak ? If a man speak , surely he shall be swallowed up .
KJ21	Job	37	21	And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds , but the wind passeth and cleanseth them .
KJ21	Job	37	22	Fair weather cometh out of the north ; with God is fearsome majesty .
KJ21	Job	37	23	Concerning the Almighty , we can not find Him out ; He is excellent in power and in judgment , and abounding in justice ; He will not afflict .
KJ21	Job	37	24	Men do therefore fear Him ; He respecteth not any that are wise of heart . ”
KJ21	Job	38	38	when the dust groweth into hardness , and the clods cleave fast together ?
KJ21	Job	38	2	“ Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge ?
KJ21	Job	38	3	Gird up now thy loins like a man ; for I will demand of thee , and answer thou Me .
KJ21	Job	38	4	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth ? Declare , if thou hast understanding .
KJ21	Job	38	5	Who hath laid the measures thereof , if thou knowest ? Or who hath stretched the line upon it ?
KJ21	Job	38	6	“ Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened ? Or who laid the cornerstone thereof ,
KJ21	Job	38	7	when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ?
KJ21	Job	38	8	Or who shut up the sea with doors , when it broke forth as if it had issued out of the womb ;
KJ21	Job	38	9	when I made the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddling band for it ,
KJ21	Job	38	10	and broke up for it My decreed place , and set bars and doors ,
KJ21	Job	38	11	and said , ‘ Hitherto shalt thou come , but no further ; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed ’ ?
KJ21	Job	38	12	“ Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days , and caused the dayspring to know his place ,
KJ21	Job	38	13	that it might take hold of the ends of the earth , that the wicked might be shaken out of it ?
KJ21	Job	38	14	It is turned as clay under the seal ; and they stand out as a garment .
KJ21	Job	38	15	And from the wicked their light is withheld , and the high arm shall be broken .
KJ21	Job	38	16	“ Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea ? Or hast thou walked in the search of the depths ?
KJ21	Job	38	17	Have the gates of death been opened unto thee ? Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death ?
KJ21	Job	38	18	Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth ? Declare if thou knowest it all .
KJ21	Job	38	19	“ Where is the way where light dwelleth ? And as for darkness , where is the place thereof ,
KJ21	Job	38	20	that thou shouldest take it to the boundary thereof , and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof ?
KJ21	Job	38	21	Knowest thou it , because thou wast then born , or because the number of thy days is great ?
KJ21	Job	38	22	“ Hast thou entered into the treasure house of the snow , or hast thou seen the treasure house of the hail ,
KJ21	Job	38	23	which I have reserved against the time of trouble , against the day of battle and war ?
KJ21	Job	38	24	By what way is the light parted , which scattereth the east wind upon the earth ?
KJ21	Job	38	25	Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters , or a way for the lightning of thunder ,
KJ21	Job	38	26	to cause it to rain on the earth where no man is , on the wilderness wherein there is no man ;
KJ21	Job	38	27	to satisfy the desolate and waste ground , and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth ?
KJ21	Job	38	28	“ Hath the rain a father ? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew ?
KJ21	Job	38	29	Out of whose womb came the ice ? And the hoary frost of heaven , who hath engendered it ?
KJ21	Job	38	30	The waters are hid as with a stone , and the face of the deep is frozen .
KJ21	Job	38	31	“ Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades , or loose the bands of Orion ?
KJ21	Job	38	32	Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season ? Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons ?
KJ21	Job	38	33	Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven ? Canst thou set the dominion thereof over the earth ?
KJ21	Job	38	34	“ Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds , that abundance of waters may cover thee ?
KJ21	Job	38	35	Canst thou send lightnings , that they may go and say unto thee , ‘ Here we are ’ ?
KJ21	Job	38	36	Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts , or who hath given understanding to the heart ?
KJ21	Job	38	37	Who can number the clouds by wisdom ? Or who can stay the bottles of heaven ,
KJ21	Job	38	39	“ Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion , or fill the appetite of the young lions ,
KJ21	Job	38	40	when they crouch in their dens , and abide in the covert to lie in wait ?
KJ21	Job	38	41	Who provideth for the raven his food , when his young ones cry unto God , and wander for lack of meat ?
KJ21	Job	39	39	“ Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth ? Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve ?
KJ21	Job	39	2	Canst thou number the months that they fulfill ? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth ?
KJ21	Job	39	3	They bow themselves , they bring forth their young ones ; they cast out their sorrows .
KJ21	Job	39	4	Their young ones are sturdy ; they grow up with corn ; they go forth and return not unto them .
KJ21	Job	39	5	“ Who hath sent out the wild ass free ? Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass ,
KJ21	Job	39	6	whose house I have made the wilderness and the barren land his dwellings ?
KJ21	Job	39	7	He scorneth the multitude of the city , neither regardeth he the crying of the driver .
KJ21	Job	39	8	The range of the mountains is his pasture , and he searcheth after every green thing .
KJ21	Job	39	9	Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee , or abide by thy crib ?
KJ21	Job	39	10	Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band to the furrow ? Or will he harrow the valleys behind thee ?
KJ21	Job	39	11	Wilt thou trust him because his strength is great ? Or wilt thou leave thy labor to him ?
KJ21	Job	39	12	Wilt thou believe him , that he will bring home the seed and gather it into thy barn ?
KJ21	Job	39	13	“ Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks ? Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich ,
KJ21	Job	39	14	which leaveth her eggs in the earth , and warmeth them in dust ,
KJ21	Job	39	15	and forgetteth that the foot may crush them , or that the wild beast may break them ?
KJ21	Job	39	16	She is hardened against her young ones , as though they were not hers ; her labor is in vain without fear ;
KJ21	Job	39	17	because God hath deprived her of wisdom , neither hath He imparted to her understanding .
KJ21	Job	39	18	Yet when she lifteth up herself on high , she scorneth the horse and his rider .
KJ21	Job	39	19	“ Hast thou given the horse strength ? Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder ?
KJ21	Job	39	20	Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper ? The glory of his nostrils is terrible .
KJ21	Job	39	21	He paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in his strength ; he goeth on to meet the armed men .
KJ21	Job	39	22	He mocketh at fear , and is not frightened , neither turneth he back from the sword .
KJ21	Job	39	23	The quiver rattleth against him , the glittering spear and the shield .
KJ21	Job	39	24	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage , neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet .
KJ21	Job	39	25	He saith among the trumpets , ‘ Ha , ha ! ’ And he smelleth the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
KJ21	Job	39	26	“ Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom , and stretch her wings toward the south ?
KJ21	Job	39	27	Doth the eagle mount up at thy command , and make her nest on high ?
KJ21	Job	39	28	She dwelleth and abideth on the rock , upon the crag of the rock and the strong place .
KJ21	Job	39	29	From thence she seeketh the prey , and her eyes behold afar off .
KJ21	Job	39	30	Her young ones also suck up blood ; and where the slain are , there is she . ”
KJ21	Job	40	40	Moreover the Lord answered Job and said :
KJ21	Job	40	2	“ Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct Him ? He that reproveth God , let him answer it. ”
KJ21	Job	40	3	Then Job answered the Lord and said :
KJ21	Job	40	4	“ Behold , I am vile . What shall I answer Thee ? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth .
KJ21	Job	40	5	Once have I spoken , but I will not answer ; yea , twice , but I will proceed no further. ”
KJ21	Job	40	6	Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind and said :
KJ21	Job	40	7	“ Gird up thy loins now like a man ; I will demand of thee , and declare thou unto Me .
KJ21	Job	40	8	Wilt thou also disannul My judgment ? Wilt thou condemn Me , that thou mayest be righteous ?
KJ21	Job	40	9	Hast thou an arm like God ? Or canst thou thunder with a voice like Him ?
KJ21	Job	40	10	“ Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency ; and array thyself with glory and beauty .
KJ21	Job	40	11	Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath ; and behold every one that is proud , and abase him .
KJ21	Job	40	12	Look on every one that is proud , and bring him low ; and tread down the wicked in their place .
KJ21	Job	40	13	Hide them in the dust together ; and bind their faces in secret .
KJ21	Job	40	14	Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee .
KJ21	Job	40	15	“ Behold now Behemoth , which I made with thee ; he eateth grass as an ox .
KJ21	Job	40	16	Lo now , his strength is in his loins , and his force is in the navel of his belly .
KJ21	Job	40	17	He moveth his tail like a cedar ; the sinews of his stones are wrapped together .
KJ21	Job	40	18	His bones are as strong pieces of brass ; his bones are like bars of iron .
KJ21	Job	40	19	He is the chief of the ways of God ; He that made him can make His sword to approach unto him .
KJ21	Job	40	20	Surely the mountains bring him forth food , where all the beasts of the field play .
KJ21	Job	40	21	He lieth under the shady trees , in the covert of the reed and fens .
KJ21	Job	40	22	The shady trees cover him with their shadow ; the willows of the brook compass him about .
KJ21	Job	40	23	Behold , he drinketh up a river and hasteneth not ; he trusteth that he can draw up the Jordan into his mouth .
KJ21	Job	40	24	Will any take him with his sight , or bore his nose with a snare ?
KJ21	Job	41	41	“ Canst thou draw out Leviathan with a hook ? Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down ?
KJ21	Job	41	2	Canst thou put a hook into his nose , or bore his jaw through with a thorn ?
KJ21	Job	41	3	Will he make many supplications unto thee ? Will he speak soft words unto thee ?
KJ21	Job	41	4	Will he make a covenant with thee ? Wilt thou take him as a servant for ever ?
KJ21	Job	41	5	Wilt thou play with him as with a bird ? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens ?
KJ21	Job	41	6	Shall the companions make a banquet of him ? Shall they parcel him among the merchants ?
KJ21	Job	41	7	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons , or his head with fish spears ?
KJ21	Job	41	8	Lay thine hand upon him ; remember the battle , and do so no more !
KJ21	Job	41	9	Behold , the hope against him is in vain . Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
KJ21	Job	41	10	None is so fierce that dare stir him up . Who then is able to stand before Me ?
KJ21	Job	41	11	Who hath come before Me , that I should repay him ? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is Mine .
KJ21	Job	41	12	“ I will not conceal his parts , nor his power , nor his comely proportion .
KJ21	Job	41	13	Who can uncover the face of his garment ? Or who can come to him with his double bridle ?
KJ21	Job	41	14	Who can open the doors of his face ? His teeth are terrible round about .
KJ21	Job	41	15	His scales are his pride , shut up together as with a tight seal .
KJ21	Job	41	16	One is so near to another that no air can come between them .
KJ21	Job	41	17	They are joined one to another ; they stick together , that they can not be sundered .
KJ21	Job	41	18	By his sneezings a light doth shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning .
KJ21	Job	41	19	Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out .
KJ21	Job	41	20	Out of his nostrils goeth smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron .
KJ21	Job	41	21	His breath kindleth coals , and a flame goeth out of his mouth .
KJ21	Job	41	22	In his neck remaineth strength , and sorrow is turned into joy before him .
KJ21	Job	41	23	The folds of his flesh are joined together ; they are firm in themselves ; they can not be moved .
KJ21	Job	41	24	His heart is as firm as a stone , yea , as hard as a piece of the nether millstone .
KJ21	Job	41	25	When he raiseth up himself , the mighty are afraid ; by reason of breakings they purify themselves .
KJ21	Job	41	26	The sword of him that layeth at him can not hold the spear , the dart , nor the breastplate .
KJ21	Job	41	27	He esteemeth iron as straw , and brass as rotten wood .
KJ21	Job	41	28	The arrow can not make him flee ; slingstones are turned by him into stubble .
KJ21	Job	41	29	Darts are counted as stubble ; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear .
KJ21	Job	41	30	Sharp potsherds are his undersides ; he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire .
KJ21	Job	41	31	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot ; he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment .
KJ21	Job	41	32	He maketh a path to shine after him ; one would think the deep to be hoary .
KJ21	Job	41	33	Upon earth there is not his like , who is made without fear .
KJ21	Job	41	34	He beholdeth all high things ; he is a king over all the children of pride . ”
KJ21	Job	42	42	Then Job answered the Lord and said :
KJ21	Job	42	2	“ I know that Thou canst do every thing , and that no thought can be withheld from Thee .
KJ21	Job	42	3	‘ Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge ? ’ Therefore have I uttered what I understood not , things too wonderful for me , which I knew not .
KJ21	Job	42	4	‘ Hear , I beseech thee , and I will speak ; I will question thee , and declare thou unto Me. ’
KJ21	Job	42	5	I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear , but now mine eye seeth Thee .
KJ21	Job	42	6	Therefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes. ”
KJ21	Job	42	7	And it was so , that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job , the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite , “ My wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends ; for ye have not spoken of Me the thing that is right , as My servant Job hath .
KJ21	Job	42	8	Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams , and go to My servant Job , and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering . And My servant Job shall pray for you ; for him will I accept , lest I deal with you after your folly in that ye have not spoken of Me the thing which is right , like My servant Job. ”
KJ21	Job	42	9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did according as the Lord commanded them . The Lord also accepted Job .
KJ21	Job	42	10	And the Lord released Job from captivity when he prayed for his friends . Also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before .
KJ21	Job	42	11	Then came there unto him all his brethren and all his sisters , and all those who had been of his acquaintance before , and ate bread with him in his house . And they bemoaned him and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him . Every man also gave him a piece of money , and every one an earring of gold .
KJ21	Job	42	12	So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning ; for he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand sheasses .
KJ21	Job	42	13	He had also seven sons and three daughters .
KJ21	Job	42	14	And he called the name of the first Jemimah , and the name of the second Keziah , and the name of the third Kerenhappuch .
KJ21	Job	42	15	And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job , and their father gave them an inheritance among their brethren .
KJ21	Job	42	16	After this Job lived one hundred and forty years , and saw his sons and his sons ’ sons , even four generations .
KJ21	Job	42	17	So Job died , being old and full of days .
KJ21	Psalms	1	1	Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly , nor standeth in the way of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful ;
KJ21	Psalms	1	2	but his delight is in the law of the Lord , and on His law doth he meditate day and night .
KJ21	Psalms	1	3	And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; his leaf also shall not wither , and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper .
KJ21	Psalms	1	4	The ungodly are not so , but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away .
KJ21	Psalms	1	5	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment , nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous .
KJ21	Psalms	1	6	For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous , but the way of the ungodly shall perish .
KJ21	Psalms	2	2	The kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers take counsel together , against the Lord and against His Anointed , saying ,
KJ21	Psalms	2	3	“ Let us break Their bonds asunder , and cast away Their cords from us. ”
KJ21	Psalms	2	4	He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh ; the Lord shall hold them in derision .
KJ21	Psalms	2	5	Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath , and vex them in His sore displeasure :
KJ21	Psalms	2	6	“ Yet have I set My King upon My holy hill of Zion. ”
KJ21	Psalms	2	7	“ I will declare the decree : The Lord hath said unto Me , ‘ Thou art My Son ; this day have I begotten Thee .
KJ21	Psalms	2	8	Ask of Me , and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession .
KJ21	Psalms	2	9	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; Thou shalt dash them to pieces like a potter ’ s vessel. ’ ”
KJ21	Psalms	2	10	Be wise now therefore , O ye kings ; be instructed , ye judges of the earth .
KJ21	Psalms	2	11	Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling .
KJ21	Psalms	2	12	Kiss the Son , lest He be angry and ye perish from the way , when His wrath is kindled but a little . Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him .
KJ21	Psalms	3	3	But Thou , O Lord , art a shield for me , my glory and the lifter up of mine head .
KJ21	Psalms	3	2	Many there be that say of my soul , “ There is no help for him in God. ” Selah
KJ21	Psalms	3	4	I cried unto the Lord with my voice , and He heard me from His holy hill . Selah
KJ21	Psalms	3	5	I laid me down and slept ; I awaked , for the Lord sustained me .
KJ21	Psalms	3	6	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about .
KJ21	Psalms	3	7	Arise , O Lord ! Save me , O my God ! For Thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone ; Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly .
KJ21	Psalms	3	8	Salvation belongeth unto the Lord . Thy blessing is upon Thy people . Selah
KJ21	Psalms	4	4	Stand in awe , and sin not ; commune with your own heart upon your bed , and be still . Selah
KJ21	Psalms	4	2	O ye sons of men , how long will ye turn my glory into shame ? How long will ye love vanity and seek after lies ? Selah
KJ21	Psalms	4	3	But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for Himself ; the Lord will hear when I call unto Him .
KJ21	Psalms	4	5	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness , and put your trust in the Lord .
KJ21	Psalms	4	6	There are many that say , “ Who will show us any good ? ” Lord , lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us .
KJ21	Psalms	4	7	Thou hast put gladness in my heart , more than in the time when their corn and wine increased .
KJ21	Psalms	4	8	I will both lay me down in peace , and sleep ; for Thou Lord only , makest me dwell in safety .
KJ21	Psalms	5	5	The foolish shall not stand in Thy sight ; Thou hatest all workers of iniquity .
KJ21	Psalms	5	2	Hearken unto the voice of my cry , my King and my God , for unto Thee will I pray .
KJ21	Psalms	5	3	My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning , O Lord ; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto Thee and will look up .

KJ21	Psalms	78	6	that the generation to come might know them , even the children who should be born , who should arise and declare them to their children ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	7	that they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God , but keep His commandments ;
KJ21	Psalms	78	8	and so might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that set not their heart aright , and whose spirit was not steadfast with God .
KJ21	Psalms	78	9	The children of Ephraim , being armed and carrying bows , turned back in the day of battle .
KJ21	Psalms	78	10	They kept not the covenant of God , and refused to walk in His law ;
KJ21	Psalms	78	11	they forgot His works and His wonders that He had shown them .
KJ21	Psalms	78	12	Marvelous things did He in the sight of their fathers , in the land of Egypt , in the field of Zoan .
KJ21	Psalms	78	13	He divided the sea and caused them to pass through ; and He made the waters to stand as a heap .
KJ21	Psalms	78	14	In the daytime also He led them with a cloud , and all the night with a light of fire .
KJ21	Psalms	78	15	He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness , and gave them drink as out of the great depths .
KJ21	Psalms	78	16	He brought streams also out of the rock , and caused waters to run down like rivers .
KJ21	Psalms	78	17	And they sinned yet more against Him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness .
KJ21	Psalms	78	18	And they tempted God in their heart by asking for meat for their lust .
KJ21	Psalms	78	19	Yea , they spoke against God : they said , “ Can God furnish a table in the wilderness ?
KJ21	Psalms	78	20	Behold , He smote the rock , that the waters gushed out , and the streams overflowed . Can He give bread also ? Can He provide flesh for His people ? ”
KJ21	Psalms	78	21	Therefore the Lord heard this and was wroth ; so a fire was kindled against Jacob , and anger also rose up against Israel ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	22	because they believed not in God and trusted not in His salvation ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	23	though He had commanded the clouds from above , and opened the doors of heaven ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	24	and had rained down manna upon them to eat , and had given them of the corn of heaven .
KJ21	Psalms	78	25	Man ate angels ’ food ; He sent them meat to the full .
KJ21	Psalms	78	26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven , and by His power He brought in the south wind .
KJ21	Psalms	78	27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust , and feathered fowls as the sand of the sea .
KJ21	Psalms	78	28	And He let it fall in the midst of their camp , round about their habitations .
KJ21	Psalms	78	29	So they ate and were well filled , for He gave them their own desire .
KJ21	Psalms	78	30	But they were not estranged from their lust ; but while their meat was yet in their mouths ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	31	the wrath of God came upon them and slew the fattest of them , and smote down the chosen men of Israel .
KJ21	Psalms	78	32	For all this , they sinned still and believed not in His wondrous works .
KJ21	Psalms	78	33	Therefore their days did He consume in vanity , and their years in trouble .
KJ21	Psalms	78	34	When He slew them , then they sought Him ; and they returned and inquired early after God .
KJ21	Psalms	78	35	And they remembered that God was their rock , and the high God , their redeemer .
KJ21	Psalms	78	36	Nevertheless they flattered Him with their mouth , and they lied unto Him with their tongues .
KJ21	Psalms	78	37	For their heart was not right with Him , neither were they steadfast in His covenant .
KJ21	Psalms	78	38	But He , being full of compassion , forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not . Yea , many a time turned He His anger away , and did not stir up all His wrath ;
KJ21	Psalms	78	39	for He remembered that they were but flesh , a wind that passeth away and cometh not again .
KJ21	Psalms	78	40	How oft did they provoke Him in the wilderness , and grieve Him in the desert !
KJ21	Psalms	78	41	Yea , they turned back and tested God , and limited the Holy One of Israel .
KJ21	Psalms	78	42	They remembered not His hand , nor the day when He delivered them from the enemy ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	43	how He had wrought His signs in Egypt and His wonders in the field of Zoan ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	44	and had turned their rivers into blood , and their streams , that they could not drink .
KJ21	Psalms	78	45	He sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured them , and frogs which destroyed them .
KJ21	Psalms	78	46	He gave also their harvest unto the caterpillar , and their labor unto the locust .
KJ21	Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hail , and their sycamore trees with frost .
KJ21	Psalms	78	48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail , and their flocks to hot thunderbolts .
KJ21	Psalms	78	49	He cast upon them the fierceness of His anger , wrath , indignation , and trouble , by sending evil angels among them .
KJ21	Psalms	78	50	He made a path to His anger ; He spared not their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pestilence ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	51	and smote all the firstborn in Egypt , the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham .
KJ21	Psalms	78	52	But He made His own people to go forth like sheep , and guided them in the wilderness like a flock .
KJ21	Psalms	78	53	And He led them on safely , so that they feared not ; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies .
KJ21	Psalms	78	54	And He brought them to the border of His sanctuary , even to this mountain , which His right hand had purchased .
KJ21	Psalms	78	55	He cast out the heathen also before them , and apportioned them an inheritance by line , and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents .
KJ21	Psalms	78	56	Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God and kept not His testimonies ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	57	but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers ; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow .
KJ21	Psalms	78	58	For they provoked Him to anger with their high places , and loved Him to jealousy with their graven images .
KJ21	Psalms	78	59	When God heard this , He was wroth and greatly abhorred Israel ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	60	so that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh , the tent which He had placed among men ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	61	and delivered His strength into captivity , and His glory into the enemy ’ s hand .
KJ21	Psalms	78	62	He gave His people over also unto the sword , and was wroth with His inheritance .
KJ21	Psalms	78	63	The fire consumed their young men , and their maidens were not given to marriage .
KJ21	Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword , and their widows made no lamentation .
KJ21	Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep , like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine .
KJ21	Psalms	78	66	And He smote His enemies in the hinder parts , and laid upon them a perpetual reproach .
KJ21	Psalms	78	67	Moreover He refused the tabernacle of Joseph and chose not the tribe of Ephraim ,
KJ21	Psalms	78	68	but chose the tribe of Judah , the Mount Zion which He loved .
KJ21	Psalms	78	69	And He built His sanctuary like high palaces , like the earth which He hath established for ever .
KJ21	Psalms	78	70	He also chose David His servant , and took him from the sheepfolds ;
KJ21	Psalms	78	71	from following the ewes great with young He brought him to feed Jacob His people , and Israel His inheritance .
KJ21	Psalms	78	72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart , and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands .
KJ21	Psalms	79	79	O God , the heathen have come into Thine inheritance ; Thy holy temple have they defiled , they have laid Jerusalem in heaps .
KJ21	Psalms	79	2	The dead bodies of Thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heavens , the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth .
KJ21	Psalms	79	3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem , and there was none to bury them .
KJ21	Psalms	79	4	We have become a reproach to our neighbors , a scorn and derision to them that are round about us .
KJ21	Psalms	79	5	How long , Lord ? Wilt Thou be angry for ever ? Shall Thy jealousy burn like fire ?
KJ21	Psalms	79	6	Pour out Thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known Thee , and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon Thy name ;
KJ21	Psalms	79	7	for they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his dwelling place .
KJ21	Psalms	79	8	O remember not former iniquities against us ; let Thy tender mercies go speedily before us , for we are brought very low .
KJ21	Psalms	79	9	Help us , O God of our salvation , for the glory of Thy name ; and deliver us and purge away our sins , for Thy name ’ s sake .
KJ21	Psalms	79	10	Why should the heathen say , “ Where is their God ? ” Let Him be known among the heathen in our sight by the avenging of the blood of Thy servants which is shed .
KJ21	Psalms	79	11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before Thee ; according to the greatness of Thy power , preserve Thou those that are appointed to die .
KJ21	Psalms	79	12	And render unto the bosom of our neighbors sevenfold their reproach wherewith they have reproached Thee , O Lord .
KJ21	Psalms	79	13	So we Thy people and the sheep of Thy pasture , will give Thee thanks for ever ; we will show forth Thy praise to all generations .
KJ21	Psalms	80	80	Give ear , O Shepherd of Israel , Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock ; Thou that dwellest between the cherubims , shine forth .
KJ21	Psalms	80	2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh , stir up Thy strength , and come and save us .
KJ21	Psalms	80	3	Turn us again , O God , and cause Thy face to shine , and we shall be saved .
KJ21	Psalms	80	4	O Lord God of hosts , how long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy people ?
KJ21	Psalms	80	5	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears , and givest them tears to drink in great measure .
KJ21	Psalms	80	6	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors , and our enemies laugh among themselves .
KJ21	Psalms	80	7	Turn us again , O God of hosts , and cause Thy face to shine , and we shall be saved .
KJ21	Psalms	80	8	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt ; Thou hast cast out the heathen , and planted it .
KJ21	Psalms	80	9	Thou preparedst room for it , and didst cause it to take deep root , and it filled the land .
KJ21	Psalms	80	10	The hills were covered with the shadow of it , and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars .
KJ21	Psalms	80	11	She sent out her boughs unto the sea , and her branches unto the river .
KJ21	Psalms	80	12	Why hast Thou then broken down her hedges , so that all they that pass by the way do pluck her ?
KJ21	Psalms	80	13	The boar out of the wood doth waste it , and the wild beast of the field doth devour it .
KJ21	Psalms	80	14	Return , we beseech Thee , O God of hosts ; look down from heaven , and behold and visit this vine ,
KJ21	Psalms	80	15	and the vineyard which Thy right hand hath planted , and the branch that Thou madest strong for Thyself .
KJ21	Psalms	80	16	It is burned with fire , it is cut down ; they perish at the rebuke of Thy countenance .
KJ21	Psalms	80	17	Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand , upon the son of man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself .
KJ21	Psalms	80	18	So will we not go back from Thee ; quicken us , and we will call upon Thy name .
KJ21	Psalms	80	19	Turn us again , O Lord God of hosts ; cause Thy face to shine , and we shall be saved !
KJ21	Psalms	81	81	Sing aloud unto God our strength ; make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob .
KJ21	Psalms	81	2	Take a psalm , and bring hither the timbrel , the pleasant harp with the psaltery .
KJ21	Psalms	81	3	Blow the trumpet in the new moon , at the time appointed , on our solemn feast day .
KJ21	Psalms	81	4	For this was a statute for Israel , and a law of the God of Jacob .
KJ21	Psalms	81	5	This He ordained in Joseph as a testimony , when He went out through the land of Egypt , where I heard a language that I understood not :
KJ21	Psalms	81	6	“ I removed his shoulder from the burden ; his hands were delivered from the pots .
KJ21	Psalms	81	7	Thou called in trouble , and I delivered thee ; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder . I tested thee at the waters of Meribah . Selah
KJ21	Psalms	81	8	Hear , O My people , and I will testify unto thee , O Israel , if thou wilt hearken unto Me !
KJ21	Psalms	81	9	There shall be no strange god among thee ; neither shalt thou worship any strange god .
KJ21	Psalms	81	10	I am the Lord thy God , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt . Open thy mouth wide , and I will fill it .
KJ21	Psalms	81	11	“ But My people would not hearken to My voice , and Israel would have none of Me .
KJ21	Psalms	81	12	So I gave them up unto their own hearts ’ lust , and they walked in their own counsels .
KJ21	Psalms	81	13	Oh that My people had hearkened unto Me , and Israel had walked in My ways !
KJ21	Psalms	81	14	I should soon have subdued their enemies , and turned My and against their adversaries. ”
KJ21	Psalms	81	15	The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto Him , but their time should have endured for ever .
KJ21	Psalms	81	16	He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat , and , “ With honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee . ”
KJ21	Psalms	82	82	God standeth in the congregation of the mighty ; He judgeth among the gods .
KJ21	Psalms	82	2	How long will ye judge unjustly and accept persons of the wicked ? Selah
KJ21	Psalms	82	3	Defend the poor and fatherless ; do justice to the afflicted and needy .
KJ21	Psalms	82	4	Deliver the poor and needy ; rescue them out of the hand of the wicked .
KJ21	Psalms	82	5	They know not , neither will they understand . They walk on in darkness : all the foundations of the earth are out of course .
KJ21	Psalms	82	6	I have said , “ Ye are gods , and all of you are children of the Most High. ”
KJ21	Psalms	82	7	But ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes .
KJ21	Psalms	82	8	Arise , O God , judge the earth , for Thou shalt inherit all nations .
KJ21	Psalms	83	83	Keep Thou not silence , O God ; hold not Thy peace , and be not still , O God .
KJ21	Psalms	83	2	For lo , Thine enemies make a tumult , and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head .
KJ21	Psalms	83	3	They have taken crafty counsel against Thy people , and consulted against Thy hidden ones .
KJ21	Psalms	83	4	They have said , “ Come , and let us cut them off from being a nation , that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. ”
KJ21	Psalms	83	5	For they have consulted together with one accord ; they are confederate against Thee :
KJ21	Psalms	83	6	the tabernacles of Edom and the Ishmaelites , of Moab and the Hagarites ,
KJ21	Psalms	83	7	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek , the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre .
KJ21	Psalms	83	8	Assyria also has joined with them ; they have helped the children of Lot . Selah
KJ21	Psalms	83	9	Do unto them as unto the Midianites , as to Sisera , as to Jabin at the Brook of Kishon ,
KJ21	Psalms	83	10	who perished at Endor ; they became as dung for the earth .
KJ21	Psalms	83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb , yea , all their princes as Zebah and as Zalmunna ,
KJ21	Psalms	83	12	who said , “ Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. ”
KJ21	Psalms	83	13	O my God , make them like a wheel , as the stubble before the wind .
KJ21	Psalms	83	14	As the fire burneth a wood , and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire ,
KJ21	Psalms	83	15	so persecute them with Thy tempest , and make them afraid with Thy storm .
KJ21	Psalms	83	16	Fill their faces with shame , that they may seek Thy name , O Lord .
KJ21	Psalms	83	17	Let them be confounded and troubled for ever ; yea , let them be put to shame and perish ,
KJ21	Psalms	83	18	that men may know that Thou , whose name alone is Jehovah , art the Most High over all the earth .
KJ21	Psalms	84	84	How amiable are Thy tabernacles , O Lord of hosts !
KJ21	Psalms	84	2	My soul longeth , yea , even fainteth for the courts of the Lord ; my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God .
KJ21	Psalms	84	3	Yea , the sparrow hath found a house , and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young ” even Thine altars , O Lord of hosts , my King and my God .
KJ21	Psalms	84	4	Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house ; they will be ever praising Thee . Selah
KJ21	Psalms	84	5	Blessed is the man whose strength is in Thee , in whose heart are Thy ways ,
KJ21	Psalms	84	6	who passing through the Valley of Baca makes it a well ; the rain also filleth the pools .
KJ21	Psalms	84	7	They go from strength to strength ; every one of them in Zion appeareth before God .
KJ21	Psalms	84	8	O Lord God of hosts , hear my prayer ; give ear , O God of Jacob . Selah
KJ21	Psalms	84	9	Behold , O God our shield , and look upon the face of Thine anointed .
KJ21	Psalms	84	10	For a day in Thy courts is better than a thousand ; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
KJ21	Psalms	84	11	For the Lord God is a sun and shield ; the Lord will give grace and glory ; no good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly .
KJ21	Psalms	84	12	O Lord of hosts , blessed is the man that trusteth in Thee !
KJ21	Psalms	85	85	Lord , Thou hast been favorable unto Thy land ; Thou hast released the captives of Jacob .
KJ21	Psalms	85	2	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of Thy people ; Thou hast covered all their sin . Selah
KJ21	Psalms	85	3	Thou hast taken away all Thy wrath ; Thou hast turned Thyself from the fierceness of Thine anger .
KJ21	Psalms	85	4	Turn us , O God of our salvation , and cause Thine anger toward us to cease .
KJ21	Psalms	85	5	Wilt Thou be angry with us for ever ? Wilt Thou draw out Thine anger to all generations ?
KJ21	Psalms	85	6	Wilt Thou not revive us again , that Thy people may rejoice in Thee ?
KJ21	Psalms	85	7	Show us Thy mercy , O Lord , and grant us Thy salvation .
KJ21	Psalms	85	8	I will hear what God the Lord will speak , for He will speak peace unto His people and to His saints ; but let them not turn again to folly .
KJ21	Psalms	85	9	Surely His salvation is nigh them that fear Him , that glory may dwell in our land .
KJ21	Psalms	85	10	Mercy and truth are met together ; righteousness and peace have kissed each other .
KJ21	Psalms	85	11	Truth shall spring out of the earth , and righteousness shall look down from heaven .
KJ21	Psalms	85	12	Yea , the Lord shall give that which is good , and our land shall yield her increase .
KJ21	Psalms	85	13	Righteousness shall go before Him , and shall set us in the way of His steps .
KJ21	Psalms	86	86	Bow down Thine ear , O Lord ; hear me , for I am poor and needy .
KJ21	Psalms	86	2	Preserve my soul , for I am holy ; O Thou my God , save Thy servant that trusteth in Thee .
KJ21	Psalms	86	3	Be merciful unto me , O Lord , for I cry unto Thee daily .
KJ21	Psalms	86	4	Make the soul of Thy servant rejoice , for unto Thee , O Lord , do I lift up my soul .
KJ21	Psalms	86	5	For Thou , Lord , art good and ready to forgive , and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee .
KJ21	Psalms	86	6	Give ear , O Lord , unto my prayer ; and attend to the voice of my supplications .
KJ21	Psalms	86	7	In the day of my trouble I will call upon Thee , for Thou wilt answer me .
KJ21	Psalms	86	8	Among the gods there is none like unto Thee , O Lord ; neither are there any works like unto Thy works .
KJ21	Psalms	86	9	All nations whom Thou hast made shall come and worship before Thee , O Lord , and shall glorify Thy name .
KJ21	Psalms	86	10	For Thou art great and doest wondrous things : Thou alone art God .
KJ21	Psalms	86	11	Teach me Thy way , O Lord ; I will walk in Thy truth ; unite my heart to fear Thy name .
KJ21	Psalms	86	12	I will praise Thee , O Lord my God , with all my heart , and I will glorify Thy name for evermore .
KJ21	Psalms	86	13	For great is Thy mercy toward me , and Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell .
KJ21	Psalms	86	14	O God , the proud have risen against me , and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul , and have not set Thee before them .
KJ21	Psalms	86	15	But Thou , O Lord , art a God full of compassion , gracious , longsuffering , and plenteous in mercy and truth .
KJ21	Psalms	86	16	O turn unto me and have mercy upon me ; give Thy strength unto Thy servant , and save the son of Thine handmaid .
KJ21	Psalms	86	17	Show me a token for good , that they that hate me may see it and be ashamed , because Thou , Lord , hast helped me and comforted me .
KJ21	Psalms	87	87	His foundation is in the holy mountains .
KJ21	Psalms	87	2	The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob .
KJ21	Psalms	87	3	Glorious things are spoken of thee , O city of God ! Selah
KJ21	Psalms	87	4	“ I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know Me ; behold , Philistia and Tyre , with Ethiopia : ‘ This man was born there. ’ ”
KJ21	Psalms	87	5	And of Zion it shall be said , “ This and that man were born in her ; and the Highest Himself shall establish her. ”
KJ21	Psalms	87	6	The Lord shall count , when He writeth up the people , that this man was born there . Selah
KJ21	Psalms	87	7	Singers as well as players on instruments shall be there and say , “ All my springs are in thee . ”
KJ21	Psalms	88	88	O Lord God of my salvation , I have cried day and night before Thee .
KJ21	Psalms	88	2	Let my prayer come before Thee ; incline Thine ear unto my cry .
KJ21	Psalms	88	3	For my soul is full of troubles , and my life draweth nigh unto the grave .
KJ21	Psalms	88	4	I am counted with them that go down into the pit ; I am as a man that hath no strength ,
KJ21	Psalms	88	5	cast among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave , whom Thou rememberest no more , and who are cut off from Thy hand .
KJ21	Psalms	88	6	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit , in darkness , in the deeps .
KJ21	Psalms	88	7	Thy wrath lieth hard upon me , and Thou hast afflicted me with all Thy waves . Selah
KJ21	Psalms	88	8	Thou hast put away mine acquaintances far from me ; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them . I am shut up , and I can not come forth ;
KJ21	Psalms	88	9	mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction . Lord , I have called daily upon Thee ; I have stretched out my hands unto Thee .
KJ21	Psalms	88	10	Wilt Thou show wonders to the dead ? Shall the dead arise and praise Thee ? Selah
KJ21	Psalms	88	11	Shall Thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave ? Or Thy faithfulness in destruction ?
KJ21	Psalms	88	12	Shall Thy wonders be known in the dark ? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness ?
KJ21	Psalms	88	13	But unto Thee have I cried , O Lord , and in the morning shall my prayer come before Thee .
KJ21	Psalms	88	14	Lord , why castest Thou off my soul ? Why hidest Thou Thy face from me ?
KJ21	Psalms	88	15	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up ; while I suffer Thy terrors I am distraught .
KJ21	Psalms	88	16	Thy fierce wrath goeth over me ; Thy terrors have cut me off .
KJ21	Psalms	88	17	They came round about me daily like water ; they compassed me about together .
KJ21	Psalms	88	18	Lover and friend hast Thou put far from me , and mine acquaintances into darkness .
KJ21	Psalms	89	89	I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever ; with my mouth will I make known Thy faithfulness to all generations .
KJ21	Psalms	89	2	For I have said , “ Mercy shall be built up for ever ; Thy faithfulness shalt Thou establish in the very heavens. ”
KJ21	Psalms	89	3	“ I have made a covenant with My chosen , I have sworn unto David My servant :
KJ21	Psalms	89	4	‘ Thy Seed will I establish for ever , and build up thy throne to all generations. ’ ” Selah
KJ21	Psalms	89	5	And the heavens shall praise Thy wonders , O Lord , Thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints .
KJ21	Psalms	89	6	For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord ? Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord ?
KJ21	Psalms	89	7	God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints , and to be held in reverence by all them that are about Him .
KJ21	Psalms	89	8	O Lord God of hosts , who is a strong Lord like unto Thee ? Or to Thy faithfulness round about Thee ?
KJ21	Psalms	89	9	Thou rulest the raging of the sea ; when the waves thereof arise , Thou stillest them .
KJ21	Psalms	89	10	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces , as one that is slain ; Thou hast scattered Thine enemies with Thy strong arm .
KJ21	Psalms	89	11	The heavens are Thine , the earth also is Thine ; as for the world and the fullness thereof , Thou hast founded them .
KJ21	Psalms	89	12	The north and the south , Thou hast created them ; Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Thy name .
KJ21	Psalms	89	13	Thou hast a mighty arm ; strong is Thy hand , and high is Thy right hand .
KJ21	Psalms	89	14	Justice and judgment are the habitation of Thy throne ; mercy and truth shall go before Thy face .

KJ21	Psalms	89	16	In Thy name shall they rejoice all the day , and in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted .
KJ21	Psalms	89	17	For Thou art the glory of their strength , and in Thy favor our horn shall be exalted .
KJ21	Psalms	89	18	For the Lord is our defense , and the Holy One of Israel is our King .
KJ21	Psalms	89	19	Then Thou didst speak in a vision to Thy holy one and said , “ I have laid help upon one that is mighty ; I have exalted one chosen out of the people .
KJ21	Psalms	89	20	I have found David My servant ; with My holy oil have I anointed him .
KJ21	Psalms	89	21	With him My hand shall be established ; Mine arm shall also strengthen him .
KJ21	Psalms	89	22	The enemy shall not exact from him , nor the son of wickedness afflict him .
KJ21	Psalms	89	23	And I will beat down his foes before his face , and plague them that hate him .
KJ21	Psalms	89	24	But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him , and in My name shall his horn be exalted .
KJ21	Psalms	89	25	I will set his hand also over the sea , and his right hand over the rivers .
KJ21	Psalms	89	26	He shall cry unto Me , ‘ Thou art my Father , my God , and the rock of my salvation. ’

KJ21	Psalms	106	25	but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord .
KJ21	Psalms	106	26	Therefore He lifted up His hand against them to overthrow them in the wilderness ,
KJ21	Psalms	106	27	to overthrow their seed also among the nations and to scatter them in the lands .
KJ21	Psalms	106	28	They joined themselves also with Baal of Peor , and ate the sacrifices to the dead .
KJ21	Psalms	106	29	Thus they provoked Him to anger with their inventions , and the plague broke in upon them .
KJ21	Psalms	106	30	Then stood up Phinehas and executed judgment , and so the plague was stayed .

KJ21	Psalms	106	34	They did not destroy the nations , concerning whom the Lord commanded them ;
KJ21	Psalms	106	35	but they mingled among the heathen and learned their works ,
KJ21	Psalms	106	36	and they served their idols , which were a snare unto them .
KJ21	Psalms	106	37	Yea , they sacrificed their sons and daughters unto devils ,
KJ21	Psalms	106	38	and shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan ; and the land was polluted with blood .
KJ21	Psalms	106	39	Thus were they defiled with their own works , and went a whoring with their own schemes .
KJ21	Psalms	106	40	Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against His people , insomuch that He abhorred His own inheritance .
KJ21	Psalms	106	41	And He gave them into the hand of the heathen , and they that hated them ruled over them .
KJ21	Psalms	106	42	Their enemies also oppressed them , and they were brought into subjection under their hand .
KJ21	Psalms	106	43	Many times did He deliver them , but they provoked Him with their counsel , and were brought low for their iniquity .
KJ21	Psalms	106	44	Nevertheless He regarded their affliction when He heard their cry ,
KJ21	Psalms	106	45	and He remembered for them His covenant , and repented according to the multitude of His mercies .
KJ21	Psalms	106	46	He made them also to be pitied by all those that carried them captive .

KJ21	Psalms	107	2	Let the redeemed of the Lord say so , whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy ,
KJ21	Psalms	107	3	and gathered them out of the lands , from the east and from the west , from the north and from the south .
KJ21	Psalms	107	4	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way ; they found no city to dwell in .
KJ21	Psalms	107	5	Hungry and thirsty , their soul fainted within them .

KJ21	Psalms	107	10	They that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , being bound in affliction and irons ,
KJ21	Psalms	107	11	because they rebelled against the words of God and contemned the counsel of the Most High ,
KJ21	Psalms	107	12	therefore He brought down their heart with labor ; they fell down and there was none to help .
KJ21	Psalms	107	13	Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble , and He saved them out of their distresses .
KJ21	Psalms	107	14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death , and broke their bonds asunder .

KJ21	Psalms	107	17	Fools , because of their transgression and because of their iniquities , are afflicted .
KJ21	Psalms	107	18	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat , and they draw near unto the gates of death .
KJ21	Psalms	107	19	Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble , and He saveth them out of their distresses .
KJ21	Psalms	107	20	He sent His word and healed them , and delivered them from their destructions .
KJ21	Psalms	107	21	Oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness , and for His wonderful works to the children of men !
KJ21	Psalms	107	22	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving , and declare His works with rejoicing !
KJ21	Psalms	107	23	They that go down to the sea in ships , that do business in great waters :
KJ21	Psalms	107	24	these see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep .
KJ21	Psalms	107	25	For He commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind , which lifteth up the waves thereof .
KJ21	Psalms	107	26	They mount up to the heaven , they go down again to the depths ; their soul is melted because of trouble .
KJ21	Psalms	107	27	They reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man , and are at their wits ’ end .
KJ21	Psalms	107	28	Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble , and He bringeth them out of their distresses .
KJ21	Psalms	107	29	He maketh the storm a calm , so that the waves thereof are still .
KJ21	Psalms	107	30	Then are they glad because they are quiet ; so He bringeth them unto their desired haven .
KJ21	Psalms	107	31	Oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness , and for His wonderful works to the children of men !
KJ21	Psalms	107	32	Let them exalt Him also in the congregation of the people , and praise Him in the assembly of the elders .
KJ21	Psalms	107	33	He turneth rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry ground ,
KJ21	Psalms	107	34	a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein .
KJ21	Psalms	107	35	He turneth the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into watersprings ;
KJ21	Psalms	107	36	and there He maketh the hungry to dwell , that they may prepare a city for habitation ,
KJ21	Psalms	107	37	and sow the fields and plant vineyards , which may yield fruitful increase .
KJ21	Psalms	107	38	He blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly , and alloweth not their cattle to decrease .

KJ21	Proverbs	1	1	The Proverbs of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel :
KJ21	Proverbs	1	2	to know wisdom and instruction ; to perceive the words of understanding ;
KJ21	Proverbs	1	3	to receive the instruction of wisdom , justice , judgment , and equity ;
KJ21	Proverbs	1	4	to give subtlety to the simple , and to the young man knowledge and discretion .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	5	A wise man will hear and will increase learning , and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsel
KJ21	Proverbs	1	6	to understand a proverb and the interpretation , the words of the wise and their dark sayings .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	7	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge , but fools despise wisdom and instruction .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	8	My son , hear the instruction of thy father , and forsake not the law of thy mother ;
KJ21	Proverbs	1	9	for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head , and chains about thy neck .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	10	My son , if sinners entice thee , consent thou not .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	11	If they say , “ Come with us ; let us lie in wait for blood , let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause ;
KJ21	Proverbs	1	12	let us swallow them up alive as the grave , and whole , as those that go down to the pit ;
KJ21	Proverbs	1	13	we shall find much precious substance , we shall fill our houses with spoil ;
KJ21	Proverbs	1	14	cast in thy lot among us , let us all have one purse ”
KJ21	Proverbs	1	15	my son , walk not thou in the way with them ; restrain thy foot from their path ;
KJ21	Proverbs	1	16	for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	17	Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird !
KJ21	Proverbs	1	18	And they lie in wait for their own blood ; they lurk privily for their own lives .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	19	So are the ways of every one that is greedy for gain , which taketh away the life of the owners thereof .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	20	Wisdom crieth without ; she uttereth her voice in the streets .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	21	She crieth in the chief places of concourse , in the openings of the gates ; in the city she uttereth her words , saying ,
KJ21	Proverbs	1	22	“ How long , ye simple ones , will ye love to be simple , and the scorners delight in their scorning , and fools hate knowledge ?
KJ21	Proverbs	1	23	Turn you at my reproof : Behold , I will pour out my spirit unto you ; I will make known my words unto you .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	24	“ Because I have called and ye refused , I have stretched out my hand and no man heeded ,
KJ21	Proverbs	1	25	but ye have set at nought all my counsel and would have none of my reproof ,
KJ21	Proverbs	1	26	I also will laugh at your calamity ; I will mock when your fear cometh ,
KJ21	Proverbs	1	27	when your fear cometh as desolation , and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind , when distress and anguish cometh upon you .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	28	Then shall they call upon me , but I will not answer ; they shall seek me early , but they shall not find me ,
KJ21	Proverbs	1	29	because they hated knowledge , and did not choose the fear of the Lord .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	30	They would have none of my counsel , and they despised all my reproof :
KJ21	Proverbs	1	31	therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own ways , and be filled with their own devices .
KJ21	Proverbs	1	32	For the turning away of the simple shall slay them , and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them ;
KJ21	Proverbs	1	33	but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely , and shall have quiet from fear of evil . ”
KJ21	Proverbs	2	2	so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding ;
KJ21	Proverbs	2	3	yea , if thou criest after knowledge , and liftest up thy voice for understanding ;
KJ21	Proverbs	2	4	if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hidden treasure ,
KJ21	Proverbs	2	5	then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord , and find the knowledge of God .
KJ21	Proverbs	2	6	For the Lord giveth wisdom ; out of His mouth cometh knowledge and understanding .
KJ21	Proverbs	2	7	He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous ; He is a buckler to them that walk uprightly .
KJ21	Proverbs	2	8	He keepeth the paths of judgment , and preserveth the way of His saints .
KJ21	Proverbs	2	9	Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity , yea , every good path .
KJ21	Proverbs	2	10	When wisdom entereth into thine heart , and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul ,
KJ21	Proverbs	2	11	discretion shall preserve thee , and understanding shall keep thee ,
KJ21	Proverbs	2	12	to deliver thee from the way of the evil man , from men that speaketh froward things ,
KJ21	Proverbs	2	13	who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness ,
KJ21	Proverbs	2	14	who rejoice to do evil and delight in the frowardness of the wicked ,
KJ21	Proverbs	2	15	whose ways are crooked and who are froward in their paths .
KJ21	Proverbs	2	16	Wisdom will deliver thee from the strange woman , even from the stranger , who flattereth with her words ,
KJ21	Proverbs	2	17	who forsaketh the guide of her youth , and forgetteth the covenant of her God ;
KJ21	Proverbs	2	18	for her house inclineth unto death , and her paths unto the dead .
KJ21	Proverbs	2	19	None that go unto her return again , neither take they hold of the paths of life .
KJ21	Proverbs	2	20	Thus thou mayest walk in the way of good men , and keep to the paths of the righteous .
KJ21	Proverbs	2	21	For the upright shall dwell in the land , and the perfect shall remain in it ;
KJ21	Proverbs	2	22	but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth , and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	3	Let not mercy and truth forsake thee ; bind them about thy neck , write them upon the tablet of thine heart .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	2	for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	4	So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	5	Trust in the Lord with all thine heart , and lean not unto thine own understanding ;
KJ21	Proverbs	3	6	in all thy ways acknowledge Him , and He shall direct thy paths .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	7	Be not wise in thine own eyes ; fear the Lord and depart from evil .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	8	It shall be health to thy flesh and marrow to thy bones .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	9	Honor the Lord with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all thine increase :
KJ21	Proverbs	3	10	so shall thy barns be filled with plenty , and thy presses shall burst out with new wine .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	11	My son , despise not the chastening of the Lord , neither be weary of His correction ;
KJ21	Proverbs	3	12	for whom the Lord loveth , He correcteth , even as a father the son in whom he delighteth .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	13	Happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth understanding ;
KJ21	Proverbs	3	14	for the merchandising of it is better than the merchandising of silver , and the gain thereof than fine gold .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	15	She is more precious than rubies , and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared to her .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	16	Length of days is in her right hand , and in her left hand riches and honor .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	17	Her ways are ways of pleasantness , and all her paths are peace .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	18	She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her , and happy is everyone that retaineth her .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	19	The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth ; by understanding hath He established the heavens ;
KJ21	Proverbs	3	20	by His knowledge the depths are broken up , and the clouds drop down the dew .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	21	My son , let not these depart from thine eyes : keep sound wisdom and discretion ;
KJ21	Proverbs	3	22	so shall they be life unto thy soul , and grace around thy neck .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	23	Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely , and thy foot shall not stumble ;
KJ21	Proverbs	3	24	when thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid ; yea , thou shalt lie down , and thy sleep shall be sweet .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	25	Be not afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh ;
KJ21	Proverbs	3	26	for the Lord shall be thy confidence , and shall keep thy foot from being snared .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	27	Withhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the power of thine hand to do it .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	28	Say not unto thy neighbor , “ Go , and come again , and tomorrow I will give , ” when thou hast it with thee .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	29	Devise not evil against thy neighbor , seeing he dwelleth securely beside thee .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	30	Strive not with a man without cause if he has done thee no harm .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	31	Envy thou not the oppressor , and choose none of his ways ;
KJ21	Proverbs	3	32	for the froward is an abomination to the Lord , but His secret is with the righteous .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	33	The curse of the Lord is on the house of the wicked , but He blesseth the habitation of the just .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	34	Surely He scorneth the scorners , but He giveth grace unto the lowly .
KJ21	Proverbs	3	35	The wise shall inherit glory , but shame shall be the promotion of fools .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	4	He taught me also and said unto me , “ Let thine heart retain my words : keep my commandments and live .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	2	For I give you good doctrine ; forsake ye not my law .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	3	For I was my father ’ s son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	5	Get wisdom , get understanding ; forget it not , neither decline from the words of my mouth .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	6	Forsake her not , and she shall preserve thee ; love her , and she shall keep thee .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	7	Wisdom is the principal thing , therefore get wisdom ; and with all thy getting , get understanding .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	8	Exalt her , and she shall promote thee ; she shall bring thee honor when thou dost embrace her .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	9	She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace ; a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. ”
KJ21	Proverbs	4	10	Hear , O my son , and receive my sayings , and the years of thy life shall be many .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	11	I have taught thee in the way of wisdom ; I have led thee in right paths .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	12	When thou goest , thy steps shall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	13	Hold fast to instruction , let her not go ; keep her , for she is thy life .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	14	Enter not into the path of the wicked , and go not in the way of evil men ;
KJ21	Proverbs	4	15	avoid it , pass not by it ; turn from it and pass away .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	16	For they sleep not unless they have done mischief , and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	17	For they eat the bread of wickedness , and drink the wine of violence .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	18	But the path of the just is as the shining light , that shineth more and more unto the perfect day .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	19	The way of the wicked is as darkness ; they know not at what they stumble .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	20	My son , attend to my words ; incline thine ear unto my sayings .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	21	Let them not depart from thine eyes , keep them in the midst of thine heart ;
KJ21	Proverbs	4	22	for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	23	Keep thy heart with all diligence , for out of it are the outflowings of life .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	24	Put away from thee a froward mouth , and perverse lips put far from thee .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	25	Let thine eyes look right ahead , and let thine eyelids look straight before thee .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	26	Ponder the path of thy feet , and let all thy ways be established .
KJ21	Proverbs	4	27	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left ; remove thy foot from evil .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	5	Her feet go down to death ; her steps take hold on hell .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	2	that thou mayest have regard for discretion , and that thy lips may keep knowledge .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	3	For the lips of a strange woman drip as a honeycomb , and her mouth is smoother than oil ;
KJ21	Proverbs	5	4	but her end is as bitter as wormwood , sharp as a twoedged sword .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	6	Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life , her ways are wandering , that thou canst not know them .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	7	Hear me now therefore , O ye children , and depart not from the words of my mouth .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	8	Remove thy way far from her , and come not nigh the door of her house ,
KJ21	Proverbs	5	9	lest thou give thine honor unto others , and thy years unto the cruel ,
KJ21	Proverbs	5	10	lest strangers be filled with thy wealth and thy labors be in the house of a stranger ,
KJ21	Proverbs	5	11	and thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed ,
KJ21	Proverbs	5	12	and thou sayest , “ How have I hated instruction and my heart despised reproof ;
KJ21	Proverbs	5	13	and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me !
KJ21	Proverbs	5	14	I was almost in total evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. ”
KJ21	Proverbs	5	15	Drink waters out of thine own cistern , and running waters out of thine own well .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	16	Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad , and rivers of waters in the streets .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	17	Let them be only thine own , and not for strangers with thee .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	18	Let thy fountain be blessed , and rejoice with the wife of thy youth .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	19	Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe ; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times , and be thou ravished always with her love .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	20	And why wilt thou , my son , be ravished with a strange woman , and embrace the bosom of a stranger ?
KJ21	Proverbs	5	21	For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord , and He pondereth all his doings .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	22	His own iniquities shall entrap the wicked himself , and he shall be held by the cords of his sins .
KJ21	Proverbs	5	23	He shall die without instruction , and in the greatness of his folly shall he go astray .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	6	Look to the ant , thou sluggard ! Consider her ways and be wise ,
KJ21	Proverbs	6	2	thou art snared with the words of thy mouth ; thou art taken with the words of thy mouth .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	3	Do this now , my son , and deliver thyself when thou hast come into the hand of thy friend : Go , humble thyself , so that thou shalt prevail with thy friend .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	4	Give not sleep to thine eyes , nor slumber to thine eyelids .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	5	Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	7	which , having no guide , overseer or ruler ,
KJ21	Proverbs	6	8	provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	9	How long wilt thou sleep , O sluggard ? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep ?
KJ21	Proverbs	6	10	Yet a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep ”
KJ21	Proverbs	6	11	so shall thy poverty come as a marauder , and thy want as an armed man .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	12	A vile person , a wicked man walketh with a froward mouth ;
KJ21	Proverbs	6	13	he winketh with his eyes , he speaketh with his feet , he teacheth with his fingers ;
KJ21	Proverbs	6	14	frowardness is in his heart , he deviseth mischief continually , he soweth discord .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	15	Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly ; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	16	These six things doth the Lord hate , yea , seven are an abomination unto Him :
KJ21	Proverbs	6	17	a proud look , a lying tongue , hands that shed innocent blood ,
KJ21	Proverbs	6	18	a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations , feet that be swift in running to mischief ,
KJ21	Proverbs	6	19	a false witness that speaketh lies , and he that soweth discord among brethren .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	20	My son , keep thy father ’ s commandment , and forsake not the law of thy mother .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	21	Bind them continually upon thine heart , and tie them about thy neck .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	22	When thou goest , it shall lead thee ; when thou sleepest , it shall keep thee ; when thou awakest , it shall talk with thee .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	23	For the commandment is a lamp , and the law is light ; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life
KJ21	Proverbs	6	24	to keep thee from the evil woman , from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	25	Lust not after her beauty in thine heart , neither let her take thee with her eyelids .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	26	For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought down to a piece of bread , and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life .
KJ21	Proverbs	6	27	Can a man take fire to his bosom , and his clothes not be burned ?

KJ21	Proverbs	31	20	She stretcheth out her hand to the poor ; yea , she reacheth forth her hands to the needy .
KJ21	Proverbs	31	21	She is not afraid of the snow for her household , for all her household are clothed with scarlet .
KJ21	Proverbs	31	22	She maketh herself coverings of tapestry ; her clothing is silk and purple .
KJ21	Proverbs	31	23	Her husband is known at the gates , when he sitteth among the elders of the land .
KJ21	Proverbs	31	24	She maketh fine linen and selleth it , and delivereth girdles unto the merchant .
KJ21	Proverbs	31	25	Strength and honor are her clothing , and she shall rejoice in time to come .
KJ21	Proverbs	31	26	She openeth her mouth with wisdom , and on her tongue is the law of kindness .
KJ21	Proverbs	31	27	She looketh well to the ways of her household , and eateth not the bread of idleness .
KJ21	Proverbs	31	28	Her children arise up and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her :
KJ21	Proverbs	31	29	“ Many daughters have done virtuously , but thou excellest them all. ”
KJ21	Proverbs	31	30	Favor is deceitful , and beauty is vain ; but a woman who feareth the Lord , she shall be praised !
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	1	The words of the Preacher , the son of David , king in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	2	“ Vanity of vanities , ” saith the Preacher . “ Vanity of vanities , all is vanity. ”
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	3	What profit hath a man from all his labor which he doeth under the sun ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	4	One generation passeth away , and another generation cometh ; but the earth abideth for ever .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	5	The sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteneth to his place where he arose .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	6	The wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north ; it whirleth about continually , and the wind returneth again according to his circuits .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	7	All the rivers run into the sea , yet the sea is not full ; unto the place from whence the rivers come , thither they return again .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	8	All things are full of labor ; man can not utter it . The eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	9	The thing that hath been , it is that which shall be ; and that which is done , is that which shall be done ; and there is no new thing under the sun .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	10	Is there any thing whereof it may be said , “ See , this is new ” ? It hath been already in olden times which were before us .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	11	There is no remembrance of former things , neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come by those that shall come after .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	12	I , the Preacher , was king over Israel in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	13	And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven . This sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun , and behold , all is vanity and vexation of spirit .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	15	That which is crooked can not be made straight , and that which is wanting can not be numbered .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	16	I communed with mine own heart , saying , “ Lo , I have come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem ; yea , my heart had great experience in wisdom and knowledge. ”
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	17	And I gave my heart to know wisdom , and to know madness and folly . But I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	1	18	For in much wisdom is much grief , and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	2	I said of laughter : “ It is madness ” ; and of mirth : “ What good doeth it ? ”
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	3	I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine ( yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom ) , and to lay hold on folly , until I might see what was good for the sons of men , which they should do under heaven all the days of their life .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	4	I made me great work , I builded me houses , I planted me vineyards .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	5	I made me gardens and orchards , and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	6	I made me pools of water , to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	7	I got me servants and maidens , and had servants born in my house . Also I had great possessions of great and small cattle , above all that were in Jerusalem before me .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	8	I gathered me also silver and gold , and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces . I got me men singers and women singers , and the delights of the sons of men , and musical instruments , and those of all sorts .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	9	So I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem . Also my wisdom remained with me .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	10	And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them ; I withheld not my heart from any joy , for my heart rejoiced in all my labor , and this was my portion from all my labor .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	11	Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought , and on the labor that I had labored to do ; and behold , all was vanity and vexation of spirit , and there was no profit under the sun .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	12	Then I turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly ; for what can the man do that cometh after the king ? Even that which hath been already done .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	13	Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkness .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	14	The wise man ’ s eyes are in his head , but the fool walketh in darkness . And I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	15	Then I said in my heart , “ As it happeneth to the fool , so it happeneth even to me , and why was I then more wise ? ” Then I said in my heart , “ This also is vanity. ”
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	16	For there is no more remembrance of the wise for ever than of the fool , since all that now is shall be forgotten in the days to come . And how dieth the wise man ? As the fool !
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	17	Therefore I hated life , because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me . For all is vanity and vexation of spirit .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	18	Yea , I hated all my labor which I had done under the sun , because I must leave it unto the man who shall be after me .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	19	And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool ? Yet shall he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored , and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun . This is also vanity .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	20	Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor which I had done under the sun .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	21	For a man may labor in wisdom and in knowledge and in equity ; yet to a man who hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion . This also is vanity and a great evil .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	22	For what hath man for all his labor and for the vexation of his heart wherewith he hath labored under the sun ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	23	For all his days are sorrows and his travail grief . Yea , his heart taketh not rest in the night . This is also vanity .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	24	There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor . This also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	25	For who can eat , or who else can hasten hereunto more than I ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	2	26	For God giveth to a man what is good in His sight : wisdom and knowledge and joy ; but to the sinner He giveth travail to gather and to heap up , that he may give to him that is good before God . This also is vanity and vexation of spirit .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	3	a time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	2	a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	4	a time to weep , and a time to laugh ; a time to mourn , and a time to dance ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	5	a time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	6	a time to get , and a time to lose ; a time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	7	a time to rend , and a time to sew ; a time to keep silence , and a time to speak ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	8	a time to love , and a time to hate ; a time of war , and a time of peace .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	9	What profit hath he that worketh in that for which he laboreth ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	11	He hath made every thing beautiful in his time . Also He hath set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	12	I know that there is no good in them , but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life ,
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	13	and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor : it is the gift of God .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I know that whatsoever God doeth , it shall be for ever ; nothing can be added to it , nor anything taken from it . And God doeth it , that men should fear before Him .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	15	That which hath been is now , and that which is to be hath already been ; and God requireth that which is past .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	16	And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment , that wickedness was there ; and the place of righteousness , that iniquity was there .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	17	I said in mine heart , “ God shall judge the righteous and the wicked , for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. ”
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men , that God might manifest them , and that they might see that they themselves are beasts .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	19	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts ; even one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth , so dieth the other . Yea , they have all one breath , so that man hath no preeminence above a beast , for all is vanity .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	20	All go unto one place ; all are of the dust , and all turn to dust again .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	21	Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	3	22	Therefore I perceived that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works , for that is his portion ; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	4	Again , I considered all travail and every right work for which a man is envied by his neighbor . This is also vanity and vexation of spirit .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	2	Therefore I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	3	yea , better than both of them is he who hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	5	The fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	6	Better is a handful with quietness , than both the hands full with travail and vexation of the spirit .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Again I returned , and I saw vanity under the sun :
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	8	There is one who is alone , and there is not a second ; yea , he hath neither child nor brother , yet there is no end to all his labor . Neither is his eye satisfied with riches ; nor saith he , “ For whom do I labor and bereave my soul of good ? ” This is also vanity ; yea , it is a sore travail .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two are better than one , because they have a good reward for their labor .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	10	For if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow . But woe to him that is alone when he falleth , for he hath not another to help him up .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	11	Again , if two lie down together , then they have heat , but how can one be warm alone ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	12	And if one prevail against him , two shall withstand him ; and a threestrand cord is not quickly broken .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	13	Better is a poor and wise child , than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonished .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	14	For out of prison he cometh to reign ; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I considered all the living who walk under the sun , with the second child who shall stand up in his stead .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	4	16	There is no end of all the people , even of all that have been before them ; they also who came after shall not rejoice in him . Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	5	Better is it that thou shouldest not vow , than that thou shouldest vow and not pay .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	2	Be not rash with thy mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before God . For God is in heaven and thou upon earth : therefore let thy words be few .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	3	For a dream cometh through a multitude of business , and a fool ’ s voice is known by a multitude of words .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	4	When thou vowest a vow unto God , defer not to pay it , for He hath no pleasure in fools ; pay that which thou hast vowed .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	6	Let not thy mouth cause thy flesh to sin , neither say thou before God ’ s angel that the vow was an error . Why should God be angry at thy voice , and destroy the work of thine hands ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	7	For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities . But fear thou God .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	8	If thou seest the oppression of the poor , and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province , marvel not at the matter ; for he that is higher than the highest regardeth , and there are higher than they .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	9	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all ; the king himself is served by the field .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	10	He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver , nor he that loveth abundance with increase . This is also vanity .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	11	When goods increase , they are increased who eat them ; and what good is there to the owners thereof , except the beholding of them with their eyes ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	12	The sleep of the laboring man is sweet whether he eat little or much , but the abundance of the rich will not permit him to sleep .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	13	There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun , namely : riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	14	But those riches perish by evil travail ; and when he begetteth a son , there is nothing in his hand .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	15	As he came forth from his mother ’ s womb , naked shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labor which he may carry away in his hand .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	16	And this also is a sore evil : that in all ways as he came , so shall he go . And what profit hath he that hath labored for the wind ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	17	All his days also he eateth in darkness , and hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	18	Behold that which I have seen : It is good and comely for one to eat and to drink , and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life , which God giveth him ; for it is his portion .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	19	Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth , and hath given power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labor , this is the gift of God .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	5	20	For he shall not much remember the days of his life , because God answereth him in the joy of his heart .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	6	yea , though he live a thousand years twicetold , yet he hath seen no good . Do not all go to one place ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	2	a man to whom God hath given riches , wealth and honor , so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth , yet God giveth him not the power to eat thereof , but a stranger eateth it . This is vanity , and it is an evil disease .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	3	If a man beget a hundred children and live many years , so that the days of his years be many , and his soul be not filled with good , and also that he have no burial , I say that an untimely birth is better than he ,
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	4	for he cometh in with vanity and departeth in darkness , and his name shall be covered with darkness ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	5	moreover he hath not seen the sun , nor known any thing . This one hath more rest than the other :
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	7	All the labor of man is for his mouth , and yet the appetite is not filled .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	8	For what hath the wise more than the fool ? What hath the poor , who knoweth how to walk before the living ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	9	Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire . This is also vanity and vexation of spirit .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	10	That which hath been is named already , and it is known what man is ; neither may he contend with Him that is mightier than he .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	11	Seeing there are many things that increase vanity , how is man the better ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	6	12	For who knoweth what is good for man in this life , all the days of his vain life being spent as a shadow ? For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	7	Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad , and a bribe destroyeth the heart .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	2	It is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of feasting ; for that is the end of all men , and the living will lay it to his heart .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Sorrow is better than laughter , for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning , but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	5	It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	6	For as is the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool . This also is vanity .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	8	Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof , and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry , for anger resteth in the bosom of fools .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Say not thou , “ Why were the former days better than these ? ” For thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Wisdom is good with an inheritance , and by it there is profit to them that see the sun .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	12	For wisdom is a safeguard , as money is a safeguard , but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Consider the work of God ; for who can make straight that which He hath made crooked ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	14	In the day of prosperity be joyful , but in the day of adversity consider this : God also hath set the one over against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	15	All things have I seen in the days of my vanity : There is a just man who perisheth in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man who prolongeth his life in his wickedness .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	16	Be not righteous overmuch , neither make thyself overwise : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	17	Be not overmuch wicked , neither be thou foolish . Why shouldest thou die before thy time ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	18	It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from the other withdraw not thine hand . For he that feareth God shall come forth from them all .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	19	Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men who are in the city .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	20	For there is not a just man upon earth who doeth good and sinneth not .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken , lest thou hear thy servant curse thee .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	22	For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	23	All this have I tested by wisdom : I said , “ I will be wise , ” but it was far from me .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	24	That which is far off and exceedingly deep ” who can find it out ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	25	I applied mine heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason for things , and to know the wickedness of folly , even of foolishness and madness .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	26	And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets , and whose hands are as bonds . Whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her , but the sinner shall be taken by her .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	27	“ Behold , this have I found , ” saith the Preacher , “ counting one by one to find out the account ,
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	28	which yet my soul seeketh , but I find not : One man among a thousand have I found , but a woman among all those have I not found .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	7	29	Lo , this only have I found : that God hath made man upright , but they have sought out many inventions . ”
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	8	There is no man who hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit , neither hath he power in the day of death . And there is no discharge in that war , neither shall wickedness deliver those who are given to it .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	2	I counsel thee to keep the king ’ s commandment , and that because of thy oath to God .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	3	Be not hasty to go out of his sight . Stand not for an evil cause , for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	4	Where the word of a king is , there is power ; and who may say unto him , “ What doest thou ? ”
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	5	Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing , and a wise man ’ s heart discerneth both time and judgment .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	6	Because for every purpose there is a time and a judgment , therefore the misery of man is great upon him .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	7	For he knoweth not that which shall be ; for who can tell him when it shall be ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	9	All this have I seen , and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun : there is a time wherein a man ruleth over another to his own hurt .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	10	And so I saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the holy , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done . This is also vanity .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	11	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	12	Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and his days be prolonged , yet surely I know that it shall be well with those who fear God , who fear before Him .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	13	But it shall not be well with the wicked ; neither shall he prolong his days , which are as a shadow , because he feareth not before God .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	14	There is a vanity which is done upon the earth : that there be just men , unto whom it happeneth according to the works of the wicked ; again , there be wicked men , to whom it happeneth according to the works of the righteous . I said that this also is vanity .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	15	Then I commended mirth , because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry , for that shall abide with him from his labor the days of his life , which God giveth him under the sun .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	16	When I applied mine heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done upon the earth ( for also is there that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes ) ,
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	8	17	then I beheld all the work of God , that a man can not find out the work that is done under the sun , because though a man labor to seek it out , yet shall he not find it ; yea further , though even a wise man think to know it , yet shall he not be able to find it .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	9	Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity , which He hath given thee under the sun , all the days of thy vanity ; for that is thy portion in this life , and in thy labor which thou hast done under the sun .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	2	All things come alike to all : there is one event that happeneth to the righteous and to the wicked ; to the good and to the clean , and to the unclean ; to him that sacrificeth , and to him that doth not sacrifice : As is the good , so is the sinner , and he that taketh an oath , as he that feareth an oath .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	3	This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun : that there is one event that happeneth unto all . Yea , also the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil , and madness is in their hearts while they live ; and after that they go to the dead .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	4	For him that is joined to all the living there is hope , for a living dog is better than a dead lion .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	5	For the living know that they shall die ; but the dead know not anything , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is forgotten .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	6	Also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished ; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	7	Go thy way , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a merry heart ; for God now accepteth thy works .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Let thy garments be always white , and let thy head lack no ointment .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	10	Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy might , for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	11	I returned and saw under the sun , that the race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , neither yet bread to the wise , nor yet riches to men of understanding , nor yet favor to men of skill ; but time and chance happeneth to them all .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	12	For man also knoweth not his time : As the fishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare , so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon them .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	13	This wisdom have I seen also under the sun , and it seemed great unto me :
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	14	There was a little city and few men within it . And there came a great king against it , and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	15	Now there was found in it a poor wise man , and he by his wisdom delivered the city ; yet no man remembered that same poor man .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	16	Then said I , “ Wisdom is better than strength ” ; nevertheless the poor man ’ s wisdom is despised , and his words are not heard .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	17	The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war , but one sinner destroyeth much good .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	10	If the ax be blunt and one does not whet the edge , then must he put to it more strength ; but wisdom is profitable to direct him .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	2	A wise man ’ s heart is at his right hand , but a fool ’ s heart at his left .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	3	Yea also , when he that is a fool walketh along the way , his wisdom faileth him , and he saith to everyone that he is a fool .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	4	If the ire of the ruler rise up against thee , leave not thy station ; for yielding pacifieth great offenses .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	5	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun as an error which proceedeth from the ruler :
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	6	folly is set in great dignity , and the rich sit in lowly places .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have seen servants upon horses , and princes walking as servants upon the earth .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	8	He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it ; and whoso breaketh through a hedge , a serpent shall bite him .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	9	Whoso removeth out stones shall be hurt therewith ; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	11	Surely the serpent will bite if not charmed , and a babbler is no better .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	12	The words of a wise man ’ s mouth are gracious , but the lips of a fool will swallow himself up ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	13	the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness , and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	14	A fool also is full of words : A man can not tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him — who can tell him ?
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	15	The labor of the foolish wearieth every one of them , because he knoweth not how to go to the city .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	16	Woe to thee , O land , when thy king is a child and thy princes feast in the morning !
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	17	Blessed art thou , O land , when thy king is the son of nobles , and thy princes eat in due season , for strength and not for drunkenness !
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	18	By much slothfulness the building decayeth , and through idleness of the hands the house leaks .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	19	A feast is made for laughter , and wine maketh merry ; but money answereth all things .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	10	20	Curse not the king , no , not even in thy thoughts , and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber ; for a bird of the air shall carry thy voice , and that which hath wings shall tell the matter .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	11	11	Cast thy bread upon the waters , for thou shalt find it after many days .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	11	2	Give a portion to seven and also to eight , for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	11	3	If the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth ; and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	11	4	He that observeth the wind shall not sow , and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	11	5	As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the bones grow in the womb of her that is with child , even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	11	6	In the morning sow thy seed , and in the evening withhold not thine hand ; for thou knowest not whether either this or that shall prosper , or whether they both shall be alike good .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	11	7	Truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	11	8	but if a man live many years and rejoice in them all , yet let him remember the days of darkness , for they shall be many . All that cometh is vanity .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	11	9	Rejoice , O young man , in thy youth , and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth . And walk in the ways of thine heart , and in the sight of thine eyes ; but know thou that for all these things , God will bring thee into judgment .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	11	10	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart , and put away evil from thy flesh , for childhood and youth are vanity .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	12	And further , my son , by these words be admonished : of making many books there is no end , and much study is a weariness to the flesh .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	2	while neither the sun nor the light , nor the moon nor the stars be darkened , nor the clouds return after the rain ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	3	in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and the eyes that look out of the windows be darkened ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	4	and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the grinding is low ; and he shall rise up at the voice of a bird , and all the daughters of music shall be brought low ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	5	also when they shall be afraid of that which is high , and fears shall be in the way ; and the almond tree shall flourish , and the grasshopper shall be a burden , and desire shall fail ; because man goeth to his long home , and the mourners go about the streets ;
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	6	or ever the silver cord be loosed , or the golden bowl be broken , or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , or the wheel broken at the cistern—
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	7	then shall the dust return to the earth as it was , and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	8	“ Vanity of vanities , ” saith the Preacher . “ All is vanity. ”
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	9	And moreover because the Preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge ; yea , he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many proverbs .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	10	The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words : and that which was written was upright , even words of truth !
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	11	The words of the wise are as goads , and as nails fastened by the master builders , which are given from one Shepherd .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	13	Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter : Fear God and keep His commandments , for this is the whole duty of man .
KJ21	Ecclesiastes	12	14	For God shall bring every work into judgment , including every secret thing , whether it be good or whether it be evil .

KJ21	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	6	I opened to my beloved , but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone . My soul failed when he spoke ; I sought him , but I could not find him ; I called him , but he gave me no answer .
KJ21	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	7	The watchmen that went about the city found me . They smote me , they wounded me ; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me .

KJ21	Isaiah	1	31	And the strong shall be as tow , and the maker of it as a spark ; and they shall both burn together , and none shall quench them .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	2	And it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord ’ S house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be exalted above the hills , and all nations shall flow unto it .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	3	And many people shall go and say , “ Come ye , and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , to the house of the God of Jacob ; and He will teach us of His ways , and we will walk in His paths. ” For out of Zion shall go forth the law , and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	4	And He shall judge among the nations , and shall rebuke many people ; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks ; nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war anymore .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	5	O house of Jacob , come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	6	For Thou hast forsaken Thy people , the house of Jacob , because they are replenished from the East , and are soothsayers like the Philistines ; and they please themselves with the children of strangers .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	7	Their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	8	Their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	9	And the lowly man boweth down , and the great man humbleth himself ; therefore forgive them not .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	10	Enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , for fear of the Lord and for the glory of His majesty .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	11	The lofty looks of man shall be humbled , and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down ; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	12	For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty , and upon every one that is lifted up—and he shall be brought low ”
KJ21	Isaiah	2	13	and upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up , and upon all the oaks of Bashan ;
KJ21	Isaiah	2	14	and upon all the high mountains , and upon all the hills that are lifted up ;
KJ21	Isaiah	2	15	and upon every high tower , and upon every fortified wall ;
KJ21	Isaiah	2	16	and upon all the ships of Tarshish , and upon all pleasant sights .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	17	And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low ; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day ,
KJ21	Isaiah	2	18	and the idols He shall utterly abolish .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	19	And they shall go into the holes of the rocks , and into the caves of the earth , for fear of the Lord and for the glory of His majesty , when He ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	20	In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold ( which he made each one for himself to worship ) to the moles and to the bats ,
KJ21	Isaiah	2	21	to go into the clefts of the rocks , and into the tops of the ragged rocks , for fear of the Lord and for the glory of His majesty , when He ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
KJ21	Isaiah	2	22	Cease ye from man , whose breath is in his nostrils ; for of what account is he ?
KJ21	Isaiah	3	3	the captain of fifty and the honorable man , and the counselor and the skilled artificer and the eloquent orator .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	2	the mighty man and the man of war , the judge and the prophet , and the prudent and the ancient ,
KJ21	Isaiah	3	4	“ And I will give children to be their princes , and babes shall rule over them .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	5	And the people shall be oppressed , every one by another and every one by his neighbor ; the child shall behave himself proudly against the elder , and the base against the honorable. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	3	6	When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father , saying , “ Thou hast clothing ; be thou our ruler , and let this ruin be under thy hand , ”
KJ21	Isaiah	3	7	in that day he shall swear , saying , “ I will not be a healer , for in my house is neither bread nor clothing : Make me not a ruler of the people ! ”
KJ21	Isaiah	3	8	For Jerusalem is ruined , and Judah is fallen , because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord , to provoke the eyes of His glory .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	9	The show of their countenance doth witness against them , and they declare their sin as Sodom ; they hide it not . Woe unto their soul ! For they have rewarded evil unto themselves .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	10	Say ye to the righteous that it shall be well with them , for they shall eat the fruits of their doings .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	11	Woe unto the wicked ! It shall be ill with him , for the reward of his hands shall be given him .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	12	As for My people , children are their oppressors , and women rule over them ! O My people , they that lead thee cause thee to err , and destroy the way of thy paths .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	13	The Lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the people .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	14	The Lord will enter into judgment with the elders of His people and the princes thereof : “ For ye have eaten up the vineyard , and the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	15	What mean ye that ye beat My people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor ? ” saith the Lord God of hosts .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	16	Moreover the Lord saith : “ Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes , walking and mincing as they go , and making a tinkling with their feet ,
KJ21	Isaiah	3	17	therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion , and the Lord will uncover their secret parts. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	3	18	In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet , and their hair nets and their round ornaments like the moon ,
KJ21	Isaiah	3	19	the chains and the bracelets and the spangled ornaments ,
KJ21	Isaiah	3	20	the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs , and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings ,
KJ21	Isaiah	3	21	the rings and nose jewels ,
KJ21	Isaiah	3	22	the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the shawls and the crisping pins ,
KJ21	Isaiah	3	23	the mirrors and the fine linen , and the hoods and the veils .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	24	And it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stench ; and instead of a girdle , a rent ; and instead of wellset hair , baldness ; and instead of a sash , a girding of sackcloth ; and branding instead of beauty .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	25	Thy men shall fall by the sword , and thy mighty in the war .
KJ21	Isaiah	3	26	And her gates shall lament and mourn ; and she , being desolate , shall sit upon the ground .
KJ21	Isaiah	4	4	when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from her midst by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning .
KJ21	Isaiah	4	2	In that day shall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious ; and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for those who have escaped of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	4	3	And it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem shall be called holy — even every one who is written among the living in Jerusalem —
KJ21	Isaiah	4	5	And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion , and upon her assemblies , a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night ; for upon all the glory shall be a defense .
KJ21	Isaiah	4	6	And there shall be a tabernacle for shade in the daytime from the heat , and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	5	“ And now , I will tell you what I will do to My vineyard : I will take away the hedge thereof , and it shall be eaten up ; and break down the wall thereof , and it shall be trodden down .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	2	And He fenced it , and gathered out the stones thereof , and planted it with the choicest vine ; and built a tower in the midst of it , and also made a wine press therein . And He looked for it to bring forth grapes , and it brought forth wild grapes .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	3	“ And now , O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah , judge , I pray you , between Me and My vineyard .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	4	What could have been done more to My vineyard than I have not done in it ? Why , when I looked for it to bring forth good grapes , brought it forth wild grapes ?
KJ21	Isaiah	5	6	And I will lay it waste ; it shall not be pruned nor dug , but there shall come up briers and thorns . I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	5	7	For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel , and the men of Judah , His pleasant plant . And He looked for judgment , but behold , oppression ; for righteousness , but behold , a cry .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	8	Woe unto them that join house to house , that lay field to field , till there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth !
KJ21	Isaiah	5	9	In mine ears said the Lord of hosts : “ In truth many houses shall be desolate , even the great and fair , without inhabitant .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	10	Yea , ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath , and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	5	11	Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning , that they may pursue strong drink ; that continue until night , till wine inflame them !
KJ21	Isaiah	5	12	And the harp and the viol , and the taboret and pipe , and wine are in their feasts ; but they regard not the work of the Lord , neither consider the operation of His hands .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	13	Therefore my people are gone into captivity , because they have no knowledge ; and their honorable men are famished , and their multitude dried up with thirst .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	14	Therefore hell hath enlarged herself , and opened her mouth beyond measure ; and their glory and their multitude and their pomp , and he that rejoiceth , shall descend into it .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	15	And the lowly man shall be brought down , and the mighty man shall be humbled , and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	16	But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment , and God who is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	17	Then shall the lambs feed according to their manner , and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	18	Woe unto them that draw along iniquity with cords of vanity , and sin as it were with a cart rope ;
KJ21	Isaiah	5	19	who say , “ Let Him make speed and hasten His work , that we may see it ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come , that we may know it. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	5	20	Woe unto them that call evil good , and good evil ; that count darkness as light , and light as darkness ; that put bitter for sweet , and sweet for bitter !
KJ21	Isaiah	5	21	Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes , and prudent in their own sight !
KJ21	Isaiah	5	22	Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine , and men of strength to mingle strong drink ,
KJ21	Isaiah	5	23	who justify the wicked for a reward , and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him !
KJ21	Isaiah	5	24	Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble , and the flame consumeth the chaff , so their root shall be rottenness , and their blossom shall go up as dust ; because they have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts , and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	25	Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against His people , and He hath stretched forth His hand against them , and hath smitten them ; and the hills did tremble , and their carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets . For all this , His anger is not turned away , but His hand is stretched out still .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	26	And He will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar , and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth ; and behold , they shall come with speed swiftly .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	27	None shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken ;
KJ21	Isaiah	5	28	whose arrows are sharp , and all their bows bent , their horses ’ hoofs shall be counted like flint , and their wheels like a whirlwind .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	29	Their roaring shall be like a lion ; they shall roar like young lions ; yea , they shall roar and lay hold of the prey , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
KJ21	Isaiah	5	30	And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea ; and if one look unto the land , behold darkness and sorrow ; and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof .
KJ21	Isaiah	6	6	Then flew one of the seraphims unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar .
KJ21	Isaiah	6	2	Above it stood the seraphims ; each one had six wings : with two he covered his face , and with two he covered his feet , and with two he flew .
KJ21	Isaiah	6	3	And one cried unto another and said , “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord of hosts ; the whole earth is full of His glory. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	6	4	And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried , and the house was filled with smoke .
KJ21	Isaiah	6	5	Then said I , “ Woe is me ! For I am undone , because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips ; for mine eyes have seen the King , the Lord of hosts. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	6	7	And he laid it upon my mouth and said , “ Lo , this hath touched thy lips ; and thine iniquity is taken away , and thy sin purged. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	6	8	Also I heard the voice of the Lord saying , “ Whom shall I send , and who will go for Us ? ” Then said I , “ Here am I . Send me ! ”
KJ21	Isaiah	6	9	And He said , “ Go , and tell this people : “ ‘ Hear ye indeed , but understand not ; and see ye indeed , but perceive not. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	6	10	Make the heart of this people fat , and make their ears heavy , and shut their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and convert and be healed. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	6	11	Then said I , “ Lord , how long ? ” And He answered , “ Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant , and the houses without man , and the land be utterly desolate ,
KJ21	Isaiah	6	12	and the Lord have removed men far away , and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land .
KJ21	Isaiah	6	13	“ But yet in it shall be a tenth , and it shall return and shall be eaten , as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves : so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	7	7	thus saith the Lord God : It shall not stand , neither shall it come to pass .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	2	And it was told the house of David , saying , “ Syria is confederate with Ephraim. ” And his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	3	Then said the Lord unto Isaiah , “ Go forth now to meet Ahaz , thou and Shearjashub [ that is , The remnant shall return ] , thy son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the Fuller ’ s Field ,
KJ21	Isaiah	7	4	and say unto him : ‘ Take heed , and be quiet . Fear not , neither be fainthearted at the two tails of these smoking firebrands — at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria , and of the son of Remaliah .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	5	Because Syria , Ephraim , and the son of Remaliah have taken evil counsel against thee , saying ,
KJ21	Isaiah	7	6	“ Let us go up against Judah and vex it , and let us make a breach therein for us , and set a king in the midst of it , even the son of Tabeel , ”
KJ21	Isaiah	7	8	For the head of Syria is Damascus , and the head of Damascus is Rezin ; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken , that it be not a people .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	9	And the head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is Remaliah ’ s son . If ye will not believe , surely ye shall not be established. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	7	10	Moreover the Lord spoke again unto Ahaz , saying ,
KJ21	Isaiah	7	11	“ Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God ; ask it either in the depth or in the height above. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	7	12	But Ahaz said , “ I will not ask , neither will I tempt the Lord. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	7	13	And Isaiah said , “ Hear ye now , O house of David ! Is it a small thing for you to weary men , but will ye weary my God also ?
KJ21	Isaiah	7	14	Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign : Behold , a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son , and shall call His name Immanuel .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	15	Butter and honey shall He eat , that He may know to refuse the evil and choose the good .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	16	For before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good , the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	17	The Lord shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy father ’ s house days that have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah : even the king of Assyria. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	7	18	And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	19	And they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thorns and upon all bushes .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	20	In the same day shall the Lord shave with a hired razor ( namely , by those beyond the river , by the king of Assyria ) the head and the hair of the feet , and it shall also consume the beard .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	21	And it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep ;
KJ21	Isaiah	7	22	and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give , that he shall eat butter , for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	23	And it shall come to pass in that day in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silverlings , that it shall be even for briers and thorns .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	24	With arrows and with bows shall men come thither , because all the land shall become briers and thorns .
KJ21	Isaiah	7	25	And on all hills that shall be dug with the mattock , there shall not be a coming thither for fear of briers and thorns , but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattle .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	8	And he shall pass through Judah ; he shall overflow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck . And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , O Immanuel. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	8	2	And I took unto me faithful witnesses to attest : Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	3	And I went unto the prophetess , and she conceived and bore a son . Then said the Lord to me , “ Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	4	For before the child shall have knowledge to cry ‘ My father , ’ and ‘ My mother , ’ the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away to the king of Assyria. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	8	5	The Lord spoke also unto me again , saying ,
KJ21	Isaiah	8	6	“ Inasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that flow softly , and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah ’ s son ,
KJ21	Isaiah	8	7	now therefore , behold , the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river , strong and many , even the king of Assyria and all his glory ; and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	9	Associate yourselves , O ye people , yet ye shall be broken in pieces ! And give ear , all ye of far countries . Gird yourselves , and ye shall be broken in pieces ; gird yourselves , and ye shall be broken in pieces !
KJ21	Isaiah	8	10	Take counsel together , and it shall come to nought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand , for God is with us .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	11	For the Lord spoke thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
KJ21	Isaiah	8	12	“ Say ye not , ‘ A confederacy , ’ to all those to whom this people shall say , ‘ A confederacy ’ ; neither fear ye their fear , nor be afraid .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	13	Sanctify the Lord of hosts Himself ; and let Him be your fear , and let Him be your dread .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	14	And He shall be for you a sanctuary , but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel , for a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	15	And many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken , and be snared and be taken. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	8	16	Bind up the testimony , seal the law among my disciples .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	17	And I will wait upon the Lord , who hideth His face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for Him .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	18	Behold , I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts , who dwelleth in Mount Zion .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	19	And when they shall say unto you , “ Seek unto those who have familiar spirits and wizards , who peep and who mutter , ” should not a people seek unto their God ? For the living , to the dead ?
KJ21	Isaiah	8	20	To the law and to the testimony ! If they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
KJ21	Isaiah	8	21	And they shall pass through it sorely beset and hungry ; and it shall come to pass that , when they shall be hungry , they shall fret themselves and curse their king and their God , and look upward ;
KJ21	Isaiah	8	22	and they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble and darkness , dimness of anguish , and they shall be driven to darkness .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	9	And all the people shall know—even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria ” that say in the pride and stoutness of heart :
KJ21	Isaiah	9	2	The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light ; they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death , upon them hath the light shined .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	3	Thou hast multiplied the nation and not increased the joy ; they joy before Thee according to the joy in harvest , and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	4	For Thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , as in the day of Midian .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	5	For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood , but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	6	For unto us a Child is born , unto us a Son is given ; and the government shall be upon His shoulder . And His name shall be called Wonderful , Counselor , The Mighty God , The Everlasting Father , The Prince of Peace .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	7	Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end , upon the throne of David and upon His Kingdom , to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever . The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	8	The Lord sent a word into Jacob , and it hath lighted upon Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	10	“ The bricks are fallen down , but we will build with hewn stones ; the sycamores are cut down , but we will change them into cedars. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	9	11	Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him and join his enemies together ,
KJ21	Isaiah	9	12	the Syrians before and the Philistines behind ; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth . For all this His anger is not turned away , but His hand is stretched out still .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	13	For the people turneth not unto Him that smiteth them , neither do they seek the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	14	Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail , branch and rush , in one day .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	15	The ancient and honorable , he is the head ; and the prophet that teacheth lies , he is the tail .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	16	For the leaders of this people cause them to err , and they that are led by them are destroyed .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	17	Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men , neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows ; for every one is a hypocrite and an evildoer , and every mouth speaketh folly . For all this His anger is not turned away , but His hand is stretched out still .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	18	For wickedness burneth as the fire ; it shall devour the briers and thorns , and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest , and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	19	Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened , and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire ; no man shall spare his brother .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	20	And he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied ; they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm .
KJ21	Isaiah	9	21	Manasseh , Ephraim ; and Ephraim , Manasseh ; and they together shall be against Judah . For all this His anger is not turned away , but His hand is stretched out still .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	10	As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols and whose graven images excelled them of Jerusalem and of Samaria ,
KJ21	Isaiah	10	2	to turn aside the needy from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of My people , that widows may be their prey , and that they may rob the fatherless !
KJ21	Isaiah	10	3	And what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which shall come from far ? To whom will ye flee for help ? And where will ye leave your glory ?
KJ21	Isaiah	10	4	Without Me they shall bow down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the slain. ” For all this His anger is not turned away , but His hand is stretched out still .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	5	“ Woe to the Assyrian , the rod of Mine anger , and the staff in their hand is Mine indignation !
KJ21	Isaiah	10	6	I will send him against a hypocritical nation , and against the people of My wrath will I give him a charge , to take the spoil and to take the prey , and to tread them down like the mire of the streets .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	7	Yet he meaneth not so , neither doth his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	8	For he saith , ‘ Are not my princes altogether kings ?
KJ21	Isaiah	10	9	Is not Calno as Carchemish ? Is not Hamath as Arpad ? Is not Samaria as Damascus ?
KJ21	Isaiah	10	11	shall I not , as I have done unto Samaria and her idols , so do to Jerusalem and her idols ? ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	10	12	Therefore it shall come to pass when the Lord hath performed His whole work upon Mount Zion and on Jerusalem : “ I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his high looks .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	13	For he saith , “ ‘ By the strength of my hand I have done it , and by my wisdom , for I am prudent ; and I have removed the bounds of the people and have robbed their treasures , and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	14	And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people , and as one gathereth eggs that are left , have I gathered all the earth ; and there was none that moved the wing , or opened the mouth , or peeped. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	10	15	Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth therewith ? Or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it ? As if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up , or as if the staff should lift up itself , as if it were no wood !
KJ21	Isaiah	10	16	Therefore shall the Lord , the Lord of hosts , send among His fat ones leanness ; and under His glory He shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	17	And the Light of Israel shall be for a fire and his Holy One for a flame ; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day ,
KJ21	Isaiah	10	18	and shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field , both soul and body ; and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	19	And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few , that a child may write them .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	20	And it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel , and such as have escaped of the house of Jacob , shall no more again depend upon him that smote them , but shall stand upon the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	21	The remnant shall return , even the remnant of Jacob , unto the mighty God .
KJ21	Isaiah	10	22	For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea , yet a remnant of them shall return ; the consuming decreed shall overflow with righteousness .

KJ21	Isaiah	17	8	And he shall not look to the altars , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fingers have made , either the Asherah poles or the sun images .
KJ21	Isaiah	17	9	In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough and an uppermost branch , which they left because of the children of Israel ; and there shall be desolation .
KJ21	Isaiah	17	10	Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation and hast not been mindful of the Rock of thy strength , therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants , and shalt set them with strange slips .

KJ21	Isaiah	17	12	Woe to the multitude of many people , who make a noise like the noise of the seas , and to the rushing of nations , that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters !
KJ21	Isaiah	17	13	The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters ; but God shall rebuke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind .
KJ21	Isaiah	17	14	And behold , at eventide , trouble ; and before the morning , he is no more . This is the portion of them that despoil us , and the lot of them that rob us .
KJ21	Isaiah	18	18	Woe to the land shadowing with wings , which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia ,
KJ21	Isaiah	18	2	that sendeth ambassadors by the sea , even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters , saying , “ Go , ye swift messengers , to a nation scattered and peeled , to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto ; a nation meted out and trodden down , whose land the rivers have spoiled ! ”
KJ21	Isaiah	18	3	All ye inhabitants of the world and dwellers on the earth , see ye , when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains ; and when He bloweth a trumpet , hear ye .

KJ21	Isaiah	21	13	The burden upon Arabia : In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge , O ye traveling companies of Dedanites .
KJ21	Isaiah	21	14	The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty ; they were ready with their bread for him that fled .
KJ21	Isaiah	21	15	For they fled from the swords , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow and from the grievousness of war .
KJ21	Isaiah	21	16	For thus hath the Lord said unto me : “ Within a year , according to the years of a hireling , all the glory of Kedar shall fail .
KJ21	Isaiah	21	17	And the residue of the number of archers , the mighty men of the children of Kedar , shall be diminished . For the Lord God of Israel hath spoken it . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	22	22	And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder ; so he shall open and none shall shut , and he shall shut and none shall open .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	2	Thou that art full of stirrings , a tumultuous city , a joyous city ; thy slain men are not slain with the sword , nor dead in battle .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	3	All thy rulers have fled together ; they are bound by the archers . All that are found in thee are bound together , who have fled from afar .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	4	Therefore said I , “ Look away from me ; I will be bitter in weeping . Labor not to comfort me , because of the despoiling of the daughter of my people. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	22	5	For it is a day of trouble and of treading down , and of perplexity by the Lord God of hosts in the Valley of Vision , breaking down the walls , and of crying to the mountains .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	6	And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen , and Kir uncovered the shield .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	7	And it shall come to pass that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots , and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	8	And He uncovered the covering of Judah , and thou didst look in that day to the armor of the House of the Forest .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	9	Ye have seen also the breaches of the City of David , that they are many ; and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	10	And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	11	Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool ; but ye have not looked unto the Maker thereof , neither had respect unto Him that fashioned it long ago .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	12	And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and to mourning , and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	13	But behold , joy and gladness , slaying oxen and killing sheep , eating flesh and drinking wine ! “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we shall die ! ”
KJ21	Isaiah	22	14	And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hosts : “ Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die , ” saith the Lord God of hosts .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	15	Thus saith the Lord God of hosts : “ Go , get thee unto this treasurer , even unto Shebna , who is over the house , and say :
KJ21	Isaiah	22	16	What hast thou here ? And whom hast thou here , that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulcher here , as he that heweth him out a sepulcher on high and that carves out a habitation for himself in a rock ?
KJ21	Isaiah	22	17	Behold , the Lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity , and will surely cover thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	18	He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country . There shalt thou die , and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord ’ s house .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	19	And I will drive thee from thy station , and from thy state shall he pull thee down .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	20	“ And it shall come to pass in that day that I will call My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	21	And I will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle , and I will commit thy government into his hand ; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	23	And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place , and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father ’ s house .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	24	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father ’ s house , the offspring and the issue , all vessels of small quantity , from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagons .
KJ21	Isaiah	22	25	In that day , ” saith the Lord of hosts , “ shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed and be cut down and fall , and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off ; for the Lord hath spoken it . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	23	23	The burden of Tyre : Howl , ye ships of Tarshish ! For it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in ; from the land of Cyprus it is revealed to them .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	2	Be still , ye inhabitants of the isle , thou whom the merchants of Sidon that pass over the sea have replenished .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	3	And by great waters the seed of Shihor , the harvest of the river , is her revenue ; and she is a mart of nations .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	4	Be thou ashamed , O Sidon ; for the sea hath spoken , even the strength of the sea , saying , “ I travail not , nor bring forth children , neither do I nourish up young men nor bring up virgins. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	23	5	As at the report concerning Egypt , so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	6	Pass ye over to Tarshish ; howl , ye inhabitants of the isle !
KJ21	Isaiah	23	7	Is this your joyous city , whose antiquity is of ancient days ? Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	8	Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre , the crowning city , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honorableof the earth ?
KJ21	Isaiah	23	9	The Lord of hosts hath purposed it , to stain the pride of all glory , and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	10	Pass through thy land as a river , O daughter of Tarshish ; there is no more strength .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	11	He stretched out His hand over the sea , He shook the kingdoms ; the Lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city , to destroy the strongholds thereof .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	12	And He said , “ Thou shalt no more rejoice , O thou oppressed virgin , daughter of Sidon . Arise , pass over to Cyprus ; there also shalt thou have no rest. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	23	13	Behold the land of the Chaldeans . This people was not , till the Assyrian founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness . They set up the towers thereof , they raised up the palaces thereof , and he brought it to ruin .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	14	Howl , ye ships of Tarshish , for your strength is laid waste !
KJ21	Isaiah	23	15	And it shall come to pass in that day that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years , according to the days of one king ; after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as a harlot .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	16	“ Take a harp , go about the city , thou harlot that hast been forgotten ; make sweet melody , sing many songs , that thou mayest be remembered. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	23	17	And it shall come to pass , after the end of seventy years , that the Lord will visit Tyre ; and she shall turn to her hire and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth .
KJ21	Isaiah	23	18	And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord . It shall not be treasured nor laid up , for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord , to eat sufficiently and for durable clothing .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	24	Behold , the Lord maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste , and turneth it upside down , and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	2	And it shall be , as with the people , so with the priest ; as with the servant , so with his master ; as with the maid , so with her mistress ; as with the buyer , so with the seller ; as with the lender , so with the borrower ; as with the taker of interest , so with the giver of interest to him .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	3	The land shall be utterly emptied and utterly despoiled ; for the Lord hath spoken this word .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	4	The earth mourneth and fadeth away ; the world languisheth and fadeth away ; the haughty people of the earth do languish .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	5	The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof , because they have transgressed the laws , changed the ordinance , broken the everlasting covenant .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	6	Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth , and they that dwell therein are desolate ; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	7	The new wine mourneth , the vine languisheth , all the merryhearted do sigh .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	8	The mirth of taborets ceaseth , the noise of them that rejoice endeth , the joy of the harp ceaseth .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	9	They shall not drink wine with a song ; strong drink shall bebitter to them that drink it .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	10	The city of confusion is broken down ; every house is shut up , that no man may come in .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	11	There is a crying for wine in the streets ; all joy is darkened , the mirth of the land is gone .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	12	In the city is left desolation , and the gate is smitten with destruction .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	13	When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree , and as the gleaning of grapes when the vintage is done .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	14	They shall lift up their voice , they shall sing ; for the majesty of the Lord , they shall cry aloud from the sea .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	15	Therefore glorify ye the Lord in the valleys , even the name of the Lord God of Israel in the isles of the sea .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	16	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs , even glory to the righteous . But I said , “ My leanness , my leanness , woe unto me ! The treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously , yea , the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	24	17	Fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee , O inhabitant of the earth .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	18	And it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit , and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare ; for the windows from on high are open , and the foundations of the earth do shake .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	19	The earth is utterly broken down , the earth is clean dissolved , the earth is moved exceedingly .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	20	The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard , and shall be removed like a cottage ; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	21	And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the earth upon the earth .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	22	And they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
KJ21	Isaiah	24	23	Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed , when the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and before His elders gloriously .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	25	O Lord , Thou art my God . I will exalt Thee , I will praise Thy name , for Thou hast done wonderful things ; Thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	2	For Thou hast made of a city a heap , of a fortified city a ruin , a palace of strangers to be no city ; it shall never be rebuilt .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	3	Therefore shall the strong people glorify Thee ; the city of the terrible nations shall fear Thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	4	For Thou hast been a strength to the poor , a strength to the needy in his distress , a refuge from the storm , a shadow from the heat , when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	5	Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers , as the heat in a dry place , even the heat with the shadow of a cloud ; the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	6	And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	7	And He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people , and the veil that is spread over all nations .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	8	He will swallow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces , and the rebuke of His people shall He take away from off all the earth ; for the Lord hath spoken it .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	9	And it shall be said in that day : “ Lo , this is our God ; we have waited for Him , and He will save us . This is the Lord ; we have waited for Him ; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	25	10	For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest , and Moab shall be trodden down under Him , even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	11	And He shall spread forth His hands in the midst of them , as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim ; and He shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands .
KJ21	Isaiah	25	12	And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall He bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the dust .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	26	In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah : “ We have a strong city ; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	2	Open ye the gates , that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	3	Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on Thee , because he trusteth in Thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	4	Trust ye in the Lord for ever , for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	5	For He bringeth down them that dwell on high ; the lofty city , He layeth it low ; He layeth it low , even to the ground ; He bringeth it even to the dust .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	6	The foot shall tread it down , even the feet of the poor and the steps of the needy. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	26	7	The way of the just is uprightness ; Thou , Most Upright , dost weigh the path of the just .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	8	Yea , in the way of Thy judgments , O Lord , have we waited for Thee ; the desire of our soul is to Thy name and to the remembrance of Thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	9	With my soul have I desired Thee in the night ; yea , with my spirit within me will I seek Thee early ; for when Thy judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	10	Let favor be shown to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness ; in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly , and will not behold the majesty of the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	11	Lord , when Thy hand is lifted up , they will not see ; but they shall see and be ashamed for their envy at the people ; yea , the fire of Thine enemies shall devour them .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	12	Lord , Thou wilt ordain peace for us ; for Thou also hast wrought all our works in us .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	13	O Lord our God , other lords besides Thee have had dominion over us ; but by Thee only will we make mention of Thy name .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	14	They are dead , they shall not live ; they are deceased , they shall not rise ; therefore hast Thou visited and destroyed them , and made all their memory to perish .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	15	Thou hast increased the nation , O Lord , Thou hast increased the nation . Thou art glorified ; Thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	16	Lord , in trouble have they visited Thee , they poured out a prayer when Thy chastening was upon them .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	17	As a woman with child , that draweth near the time of her delivery , is in pain and crieth out in her pangs , so have we been in Thy sight , O Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	18	We have been with child , we have been in pain ; we have , as it were , brought forth wind ; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth , neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	19	Thy dead men shall live ; together with my dead body shall they arise . Awake and sing , ye that dwell in dust ; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs , and the earth shall cast out the dead .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	20	Come , my people , enter thou into thy chambers , and shut thy doors about thee ; hide thyself as it were for a little moment , until the indignation be past .
KJ21	Isaiah	26	21	For , behold , the Lord cometh out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity ; the earth also shall disclose her blood , and shall no more cover her slain .
KJ21	Isaiah	27	27	In that day the Lord with His sore and great and strong sword shall punish Leviathan the piercing serpent , even Leviathan that crooked serpent ; and He shall slay the dragon that is in the sea .
KJ21	Isaiah	27	2	In that day sing ye unto her , “ A vineyard of red wine !
KJ21	Isaiah	27	3	I , the Lord , do keep it ; I will water it every moment . Lest any hurt it , I will keep it night and day .
KJ21	Isaiah	27	4	Fury is not in Me . Who would set the briers and thorns against Me in battle ? I would go through them ; I would burn them together .
KJ21	Isaiah	27	5	Or let him take hold of My strength , that he may make peace with Me ; and he shall make peace with Me. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	27	6	He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root ; Israel shall blossom and bud , and fill the face of the world with fruit .
KJ21	Isaiah	27	7	Hath He smitten him , as He smote those that smote him ? Or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him ?
KJ21	Isaiah	27	8	In measure , when it shooteth forth , Thou wilt debate with it ; He stayeth His rough wind in the day of the east wind .
KJ21	Isaiah	27	9	By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged ; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin : When he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten asunder , the Asherah poles and sun images shall not stand up .
KJ21	Isaiah	27	10	Yet the fortified city shall be desolate , and the habitation forsaken and left like a wilderness ; there shall the calf feed , and there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof .
KJ21	Isaiah	27	11	When the boughs thereof are withered , they shall be broken off ; the women come and set them on fire , for it is a people of no understanding . Therefore He that made them will not have mercy on them , and He that formed them will show them no favor .
KJ21	Isaiah	27	12	And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt , and ye shall be gathered one by one , O ye children of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	27	13	And it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown ; and they shall come who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria , and the outcasts in the land of Egypt , and shall worship the Lord in the holy mount at Jerusalem .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	28	Bread corn is beaten , because he will not ever be threshing it , nor break it with the wheel of his cart , nor bruise it with his horsemen .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	2	Behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters overflowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	3	The crown of pride , the drunkards of Ephraim , shall be trodden under feet ;
KJ21	Isaiah	28	4	and the glorious beauty , which is on the head of the fat valley , shall be a fading flower and as the early fruit before the summer , which when he that looketh upon it seeth ; while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	5	In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of His people ,
KJ21	Isaiah	28	6	and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment , and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	7	But they also have erred through wine , and through strong drink are out of the way . The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink ; they are swallowed up by wine , they are out of the way through strong drink ; they err in vision , they stumble in judgment .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	8	For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness , so that there is no place clean .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	9	“ Whom shall he teach knowledge ? And whom shall he make to understand doctrine ? Them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	10	For precept must be upon precept , precept upon precept , line upon line , line upon line , here a little and there a little. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	28	11	For with stammering lips and another tongue will He speak to this people ,
KJ21	Isaiah	28	12	to whom He said , “ This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest , ” and , “ This is the refreshing ” — yet they would not hear .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	13	But the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept , precept upon precept , line upon line , line upon line , here a little and there a little , that they might go , and fall backward , and be broken and snared and taken .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	14	Therefore hear the word of the Lord , ye scornful men , that rule this people which is in Jerusalem ,
KJ21	Isaiah	28	15	because ye have said , “ We have made a covenant with death , and with hell are we in agreement . When the overflowing scourge shall pass through , it shall not come unto us ; for we have made lies our refuge , and under falsehood have we hid ourselves. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	28	16	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : “ Behold , I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone , a tried stone , a precious cornerstone , a sure foundation ; he that believeth shall not make haste .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	17	Judgment also will I lay to the line , and righteousness to the plummet ; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies , and the waters shall overflow the hiding place .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	18	And your covenant with death shall be disannulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	19	From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you , for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night ; and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	28	20	For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it , and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	21	For the Lord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim ; He shall be wroth as in the Valley of Gibeon , that He may do His work , His strange work , and bring to pass His act , His strange act .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	22	Now therefore be ye not mockers , lest your bonds be made strong ; for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consuming even determined upon the whole earth .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	23	Give ye ear and hear my voice ; hearken and hear my speech .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	24	Doth the plowman plow all day to sow ? Doth he open and break the clods of his ground ?
KJ21	Isaiah	28	25	When he hath made plain the face thereof , doth he not cast abroad the dill and scatter the cummin , and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rye in their place ?
KJ21	Isaiah	28	26	For his God doth instruct him to discretion , and doth teach him .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	27	For the dill is not threshed with a threshing instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin ; but the dill is beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod .
KJ21	Isaiah	28	29	This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts , who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	29	“ Woe to Ariel , to Ariel , the city where David dwelt ! Add ye year to year ; let them kill sacrifices .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	2	Yet I will distress Ariel , and there shall be heaviness and sorrow ; and it shall be unto Me as Ariel .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	3	And I will camp against thee round about , and will lay siege against thee with a mound , and I will raise forts against thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	4	And thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the ground , and thy speech shall be low out of the dust ; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	29	5	Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away ; yea , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	6	Thou shalt be visited by the Lord of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise , with storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	7	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel , even all that fight against her and her fortifications , and that distress her , shall be as a dream of a night vision .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	8	It shall even be as when a hungry man dreameth , and behold , he eateth ; but he awaketh , and his soul is empty . Or as when a thirsty man dreameth , and behold , he drinketh ; but he awaketh , and behold , he is faint and his soul hath appetite . So shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	9	Stay yourselves , and wonder ! Cry ye out , and cry ! They are drunken , but not with wine ; they stagger , but not with strong drink .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	10	For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep , and hath closed your eyes ; the prophets and your rulers , the seers hath He covered .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	11	And the vision of all has become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed , which men deliver to one that is learned , saying , “ Read this , I pray thee ” ; and he saith , “ I can not , for it is sealed. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	29	12	And the book is delivered to him that is not learned , saying , “ Read this , I pray thee ” ; and he saith , “ I am not learned. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	29	13	Therefore the Lord said : “ Inasmuch as this people draw near Me with their mouth and with their lips do honor Me , but have removed their heart far from Me , and their fear toward Me is taught by the precept of men ,
KJ21	Isaiah	29	14	therefore , behold , I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people , even a marvelous work and a wonder ; for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	29	15	Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord and their works are in the dark , and they say , “ Who seeth us ? ” and , “ Who knoweth us ? ”
KJ21	Isaiah	29	16	Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter ’ s clay ; for shall the work say of him that made it , “ He made me not ” ? Or shall the thing formed say of him that formed it , “ He had no understanding ” ?
KJ21	Isaiah	29	17	Is it not yet a very little while and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
KJ21	Isaiah	29	18	And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	19	The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	20	For the terrible one is brought to nought , and the scorner is consumed , and all that watch for iniquity are cut off—
KJ21	Isaiah	29	21	who make a man an offender for a word , and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate , and turn aside the just for a thing of nought .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	22	Therefore thus saith the Lord , who redeemed Abraham , concerning the house of Jacob : “ Jacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall his face now wax pale .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	23	But when he seeth his children , the work of Mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sanctify My name , and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	29	24	They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding , and they that murmured shall learn doctrine . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	30	30	And the Lord shall cause His glorious voice to be heard , and shall show the lighting down of His arm , with the indignation of His anger and with the flame of a devouring fire , with scattering and tempest and hailstones .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	2	that walk to go down into Egypt , and have not asked at My mouth , to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of Egypt !
KJ21	Isaiah	30	3	Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame , and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	4	For his princes were at Zoan , and his ambassadors came to Hanes .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	5	They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them , nor be a help nor profit , but a shame and also a reproach. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	30	6	The burden of the beasts of the South : Into the land of trouble and anguish , from whence come the young and old lion , the viper and fiery flying serpent , they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses , and their treasures upon the humps of camels , to a people that shall not profit them .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	7	For the Egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose ; therefore have I cried to her concerning this , “ Their strength is to sit still. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	30	8	Now go , write it before them on a tablet and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever ,
KJ21	Isaiah	30	9	that this is a rebellious people , lying children , children that will not hear the law of the Lord ,
KJ21	Isaiah	30	10	who say to the seers , “ See not , ” and to the prophets , “ Prophesy not unto us right things ; speak unto us smooth things ; prophesy deceits .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	11	Get you out of the way , turn aside out of the path , cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	30	12	Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel : “ Because ye despise this word , and trust in oppression and perverseness , and stand thereon ,
KJ21	Isaiah	30	13	therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	14	And he shall break it as the breaking of the potter ’ s vessel that is broken in pieces ; he shall not spare , so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shard to take fire from the hearth , or to take water threby out of the pit. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	30	15	For thus saith the Lord God , the Holy One of Israel : “ In returning and rest shall ye be saved , in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength ; but ye would not .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	16	But ye said , ‘ No , for we will flee upon horses ’ ; therefore shall ye flee ! And , ‘ We will ride upon the swift ’ ; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift !
KJ21	Isaiah	30	17	One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one ; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee , till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain and as an ensign on a hill. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	30	18	And therefore will the Lord wait , that He may be gracious unto you , and therefore will He be exalted , that He may have mercy upon you . For the Lord is a God of judgment ; blessed are all they that wait for Him .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	19	For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem ; thou shalt weep no more . He will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry ; when He shall hear it , He will answer thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	20	And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction , yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more , but thine eyes shall see thy teachers .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	21	And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , “ This is the way ; walk ye in it , ” when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	22	Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver and the ornament of thy molten images of gold . Thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , “ Get thee hence. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	30	23	Then shall He give the rain of thy seed , that thou shalt sow the ground therewith , and bread of the increase of the earth , and it shall be fat and plenteous . In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	24	The oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat clean provender , which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	25	And there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	26	Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold , as the light of seven days , in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of His people and healeth the stroke of their wound .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	27	Behold , the name of the Lord cometh from far , burning with His anger , and the burden thereof is heavy ; His lips are full of indignation and His tongue as a devouring fire .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	28	And His breath , as an overflowing stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity ; and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people , causing them to err .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	29	Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept , and gladness of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the Lord , to the Mighty One of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	31	For through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten down , who smote with a rod .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	32	And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass , which the Lord shall lay upon him , it shall be with taborets and harps ; and in battles of weapon shaking will He fight with it .
KJ21	Isaiah	30	33	For Tophet is ordained of old ; yea , for the king it is prepared . He hath made it deep and large ; the pile thereof is fire and much wood . The breath of the Lord , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it .
KJ21	Isaiah	31	31	Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help , and depend upon horses and trust in chariots because they are many , and in horsemen because they are very strong , but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel , neither seek the Lord !
KJ21	Isaiah	31	2	Yet He also is wise , and will bring evil , and will not call back His words , but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity .
KJ21	Isaiah	31	3	Now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . When the Lord shall stretch out His hand , both he that helpeth shall fall and he that is helped shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
KJ21	Isaiah	31	4	For thus hath the Lord spoken unto me : As the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey , when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him , he will not be afraid of their voice , nor abase himself for the noise of them ; so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion and for the hill thereof .
KJ21	Isaiah	31	5	As birds flying , so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem ; defending , also He will deliver it ; and passing over , He will preserve it .
KJ21	Isaiah	31	6	Turn ye unto Him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted .
KJ21	Isaiah	31	7	For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold , which your own hands have made unto you for a sin .
KJ21	Isaiah	31	8	“ Then shall the Assyrian fall by the sword , but not of a mighty man ; and the sword , not of a lowly man , shall devour him ; but he shall flee from the sword , and his young men shall be discomfited .
KJ21	Isaiah	31	9	And he shall pass over to his stronghold for fear , and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign , ” saith the Lord , whose fire is in Zion and His furnace in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	32	Behold , a King shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in judgment .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	2	And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest , as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	3	And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the ears of them that hear shall hearken .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	4	The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	5	The vile person shall be no more called liberal , nor the churl said to be bountiful .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	6	For the vile person will speak villainy , and his heart will work iniquity , to practice hypocrisy and to utter error against the Lord , to make empty the soul of the hungry ; and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	7	The instruments also of the churl are evil ; he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words , even when the needy speaketh right .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	8	But the liberal deviseth liberal things ; and by liberal things shall he stand .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	9	Rise up , ye women that are at ease ; hear my voice , ye careless daughters ; give ear unto my speech .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	10	Many days and years shall ye be troubled , ye careless women ; for the vintage shall fail , the gathering shall not come .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	11	Tremble , ye women that are at ease ; be troubled , ye careless ones . Strip you and make you bare , and gird sackcloth upon your loins ;
KJ21	Isaiah	32	12	they shall lament for the teats , for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	13	Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers , yea , upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	14	Because the palaces shall be forsaken , the multitude of the city shall be left ; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever , a joy of wild asses , a pasture of flocks ,
KJ21	Isaiah	32	15	until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high , and the wilderness be a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be counted for a forest .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	16	Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness , and righteousness remain in the fruitful field .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	17	And the work of righteousness shall be peace , and the effect of righteousness , quietness and assurance for ever .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	18	And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation , and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places
KJ21	Isaiah	32	19	when it shall hail , coming down on the forest ; and the city shall be low in a low place .
KJ21	Isaiah	32	20	Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters , that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass .

KJ21	Isaiah	33	2	O Lord , be gracious unto us ; we have waited for Thee ; be Thou their arm every morning , our salvation also in the time of trouble .
KJ21	Isaiah	33	3	At the noise of the tumult the people fled ; at the lifting up of Thyself the nations were scattered .

KJ21	Isaiah	33	13	Hear , ye that are far off , what I have done , and ye that are near , acknowledge My might. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	33	14	The sinners in Zion are afraid ; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites : “ Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire ? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings ? ”
KJ21	Isaiah	33	15	He that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly , he that despiseth the gain of oppressions , that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes , that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil—
KJ21	Isaiah	33	16	he shall dwell on high ; his place of defense shall be the fortifications of rocks ; bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
KJ21	Isaiah	33	17	Thine eyes shall see the King in His beauty ; they shall behold the land that is very far off .
KJ21	Isaiah	33	18	Thine heart shall meditate terror : “ Where is the scribe ? Where is the receiver ? Where is he that counted the towers ? ”

KJ21	Isaiah	33	21	But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams , wherein shall go no galley with oars , neither shall gallant ship pass thereby .
KJ21	Isaiah	33	22	For the Lord is our judge , the Lord is our lawgiver , the Lord is our king ; He will save us .

KJ21	Isaiah	34	6	The sword of the Lord is filled with blood ; it is made fat with fatness and with the blood of lambs and goats , with the fat of the kidneys of rams ; for the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah , and a great slaughter in the land of Edom .

KJ21	Isaiah	36	36	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them .
KJ21	Isaiah	36	2	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto King Hezekiah with a great army . And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the Fuller ’ s Field .
KJ21	Isaiah	36	3	Then came forth unto him Eliakim , Hilkiah ’ s son , who was over the house , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , Asaph ’ s son , the recorder .
KJ21	Isaiah	36	4	And Rabshakeh said unto them , “ Say ye now to Hezekiah , ‘ Thus saith the great king , the king of Assyria : What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
KJ21	Isaiah	36	5	I say , thou sayest ( but they are but vain words ) , “ I have counsel and strength for war. ” Now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
KJ21	Isaiah	36	6	Lo , thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed , in Egypt , whereon if a man lean , it will go into his hand and pierce it . So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him .
KJ21	Isaiah	36	7	But if thou say to me , “ We trust in the Lord our God , ” is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away , and said to Judah and to Jerusalem , “ Ye shall worship before this altar ” ?
KJ21	Isaiah	36	8	Now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
KJ21	Isaiah	36	9	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master ’ s servants and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
KJ21	Isaiah	36	10	And have I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it ? The Lord said unto me : “ Go up against this land , and destroy it. ” ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	36	11	Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh , “ Speak , I pray thee , unto thy servants in the Aramaic language , for we understand it ; and speak not to us in the Jews ’ language in the ears of the people who are on the wall. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	36	12	But Rabshakeh said , “ Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words ? Hath he not sent me to the men who sit upon the wall , that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you ? ”
KJ21	Isaiah	36	13	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ’ language , and said , “ Hear ye the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
KJ21	Isaiah	36	14	Thus saith the king : ‘ Let not Hezekiah deceive you , for he shall not be able to deliver you .
KJ21	Isaiah	36	15	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , “ The Lord will surely deliver us ; this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	36	16	Hearken not to Hezekiah , for thus saith the king of Assyria : Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me ; and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern ,
KJ21	Isaiah	36	17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
KJ21	Isaiah	36	18	Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , “ The Lord will deliver us. ” Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
KJ21	Isaiah	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
KJ21	Isaiah	36	20	Who are they among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand , that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	36	21	But they held their peace and answered him not a word ; for the king ’ s commandment was , saying , “ Answer him not. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	36	22	Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph , the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went , and returned and dwelt at Nineveh .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	2	And he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	3	And they said unto him , “ Thus saith Hezekiah : ‘ This day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy ; for the children have come to birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	4	It may be the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God , and will reprove the words which the Lord thy God hath heard . Therefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	37	5	Thus the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	6	And Isaiah said unto them , “ Thus shall ye say unto your master , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard , wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	7	Behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	37	8	So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah , for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	9	And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , “ He has come forth to make war with thee. ” And when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
KJ21	Isaiah	37	10	“ Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying : Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , ‘ Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	37	11	Behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly . And shalt thou be delivered ?
KJ21	Isaiah	37	12	Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed , as Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden who were in Telassar ?
KJ21	Isaiah	37	13	Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arphad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ? ”
KJ21	Isaiah	37	14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it ; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	15	And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord , saying ,
KJ21	Isaiah	37	16	“ O Lord of hosts , God of Israel , who dwellest between the cherubims , Thou art the God , even Thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth ; Thou hast made heaven and earth .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	17	Incline Thine ear , O Lord , and hear ; open Thine eyes , O Lord , and see ; and hear all the words of Sennacherib , who hath sent to reproach the living God .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	18	In truth , Lord , the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries ,
KJ21	Isaiah	37	19	and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men ’ s hands , wood and stone . Therefore they have destroyed them .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	20	Now therefore , O Lord our God , save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the Lord , even Thou only. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	37	21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah , saying , “ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria ,
KJ21	Isaiah	37	22	this is the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning him : ‘ The virgin , the daughter of Zion , hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn ; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	23	“ ‘ Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high ? Even against the Holy One of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	24	By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord , and hast said , “ By the multitude of my chariots have I come up to the height of the mountains , to the sides of Lebanon ; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof , and the choice fir trees thereof ; and I will enter into the height of his border and the forest of his Carmel .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	25	I have dug and drunk water ; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	37	26	“ ‘ Hast thou not heard long ago how I have made it , and of ancient times , that I have formed it ? Now have I brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	27	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power ; they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops and as corn blighted before it be grown up .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	28	“ ‘ But I know thy sitting down , and thy going out and thy coming in , and thy rage against Me .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	29	Because thy rage against Me and thy tumult have come up into Mine ears , therefore will I put My hook in thy nose and My bridle in thy lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	37	30	“ And this shall be a sign unto thee : Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself , and the second year that which springeth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruit thereof .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	31	And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	32	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of Mount Zion . The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	33	“ Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria : ‘ He shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it with shields , nor cast a bank against it .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	34	By the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	35	‘ For I will defend this city to save it for Mine own sake and for My servant David ’ s sake. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	37	36	Then the angel of the Lord went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand ; and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
KJ21	Isaiah	37	38	And it came to pass , as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword , and they escaped into the land of Ararat ; and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	38	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death . And Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , came unto him and said unto him , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Set thine house in order , for thou shalt die and not live. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	38	2	Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall , and prayed unto the Lord
KJ21	Isaiah	38	3	and said , “ Remember now , O Lord , I beseech Thee , how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in Thy sight. ” And Hezekiah wept sorely .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	4	Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah , saying ,
KJ21	Isaiah	38	5	“ Go , and say to Hezekiah , ‘ Thus saith the Lord , the God of David thy father : I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears . Behold , I will add unto thy days fifteen years .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	6	And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria , and I will defend this city .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	7	And this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord that the Lord will do this thing that He hath spoken :
KJ21	Isaiah	38	8	Behold , I will bring again the shadow of the degrees , which has gone down in the sundial of Ahaz , ten degrees backward. ’ ” So the sun returned ten degrees by which degrees it had gone down .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	9	The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness :
KJ21	Isaiah	38	10	I said , “ In the cutting off of my days I shall go to the gates of the grave ; I am deprived of the residue of my years. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	38	11	I said , “ I shall not see the Lord , even the Lord , in the land of the living ; I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	12	Mine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherd ’ s tent ; I have cut off like a weaver my life . He will cut me off with pining sickness ; from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	13	I reckoned till morning that , as a lion , so will He break all my bones ; from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	38	14	Like a crane or a swallow , so did I chatter ; I did mourn as a dove ; mine eyes fail with looking upward . O Lord , I am oppressed ; undertake for me !
KJ21	Isaiah	38	15	What shall I say ? He hath both spoken unto me , and Himself hath done it . I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	16	O Lord , by these things men live , and in all these things is the life of my spirit ; so wilt Thou recover me and make me to live .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	17	Behold , for peace I had great bitterness ; but Thou hast in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption , for Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	18	For the grave can not praise Thee , death can not celebrate Thee ; they that go down into the pit can not hope for Thy truth .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	19	The living , the living , he shall praise Thee , as I do this day ; the father to the children shall make known Thy truth .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	20	The Lord was ready to save me ; therefore we will sing my songs with the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	38	21	For Isaiah had said , “ Let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaster upon the boil , and he shall recover. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	38	22	Hezekiah also had said , “ What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord ? ”
KJ21	Isaiah	39	39	At that time Merodachbaladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah ; for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered .
KJ21	Isaiah	39	2	And Hezekiah was glad with them , and showed them the house of his precious things — the silver and the gold , and the spices and the precious ointment , and all the house of his armor , and all that was found in his treasures . There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah showed them not .
KJ21	Isaiah	39	3	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto King Hezekiah and said unto him , “ What said these men ? And from whence came they unto thee ? ” And Hezekiah said , “ They have come from a far country unto me , even from Babylon. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	39	4	Then said he , “ What have they seen in thine house ? ” And Hezekiah answered , “ All that is in mine house have they seen . There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	39	5	Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah , “ Hear the word of the Lord of hosts :
KJ21	Isaiah	39	6	‘ Behold , the days come that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Babylon . Nothing shall be left , ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	39	7	‘ And of thy sons who shall issue from thee , whom thou shalt beget , they shall take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	39	8	Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah , “ Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. ” He said moreover , “ For there shall be peace and truth in my days . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	40	40	“ Comfort ye , comfort ye My people , ” saith your God .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	2	“ Speak ye comfortingly to Jerusalem , and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned ; for she hath received from the Lord ’ S hand double for all her sins. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	40	3	The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness : “ Prepare ye the way of the Lord ; make straight in the desert a highway for our God .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	4	Every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough places plain .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	5	And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together ; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	40	6	The voice said , “ Cry ! ” And he said , “ What shall I cry ? ” “ All flesh is grass , and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	7	The grass withereth , the flower fadeth , because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it ; surely the people is grass .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	8	The grass withereth , the flower fadeth ; but the word of our God shall stand for ever. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	40	9	O Zion , that bringest good tidings , get thee up into the high mountain ; O Jerusalem , that bringest good tidings , lift up thy voice with strength . Lift it up , be not afraid ; say unto the cities of Judah , “ Behold your God ! ”
KJ21	Isaiah	40	10	Behold , the Lord God will come with strong hand , and His arm shall rule for Him ; behold , His reward is with Him , and His work before Him .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	11	He shall feed His flock like a shepherd ; He shall gather the lambs with His arm and carry them in His bosom , and shall gently lead those that are with young .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	12	Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand , and meted out heaven with the span , and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance ?
KJ21	Isaiah	40	13	Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord , or being His counselor hath taught Him ?
KJ21	Isaiah	40	14	With whom took He counsel , and who instructed Him , and taught Him in the path of judgment , and taught Him knowledge , and showed to Him the way of understanding ?
KJ21	Isaiah	40	15	Behold , the nations are as a drop of a bucket , and are counted as the small dust of the balance ; behold , He taketh up the isles as a very little thing .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	16	And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn , nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	17	All nations before Him are as nothing , and they are counted to Him less than nothing , and vanity .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	18	To whom then will ye liken God ? Or what likeness will ye compare unto Him ?
KJ21	Isaiah	40	19	The workman melteth a graven image , and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver chains .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	20	He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot ; he seeketh unto him a skillful workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	21	Have ye not known ? Have ye not heard ? Hath it not been told you from the beginning ? Have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth ?
KJ21	Isaiah	40	22	It is He that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers , who stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in ,
KJ21	Isaiah	40	23	who bringeth the princes to nothing ; He maketh the judges of the earth as vanity .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	24	Yea , they shall not be planted , yea , they shall not be sown ; yea , their stock shall not take root in the earth . And He shall also blow upon them , and they shall wither , and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	25	“ To whom then will ye liken Me , or shall I be equal ? ” saith the Holy One .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	26	Lift up your eyes on high , and behold who hath created these things , who bringeth out their host by number . He calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might , for He is strong in power ; not one faileth .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	27	Why sayest thou , O Jacob , and speakest , O Israel : “ My way is hid from the Lord , and my judgment is passed over from my God ” ?
KJ21	Isaiah	40	28	Hast thou not known ? Hast thou not heard , that the everlasting God , the Lord , the Creator of the ends of the earth , fainteth not , neither is weary ? There is no searching of His understanding .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	29	He giveth power to the faint , and to them that have no might He increaseth strength .
KJ21	Isaiah	40	30	Even the youths shall faint and be weary , and the young men shall utterly fall ;
KJ21	Isaiah	40	31	but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength ; they shall mount up with wings as eagles , they shall run and not be weary , and they shall walk and not faint .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	41	“ Keep silence before Me , O islands , and let the people renew their strength ; let them come near , then let them speak ; let us come near together to judgment .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	2	“ Who raised up the righteous man from the east , called him to His foot , gave the nations before him , and made him rule over kings ? He gave them as the dust to his sword , and as driven stubble to his bow .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	3	He pursued them , and passed safely , even by the way that he had not gone with his feet .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	4	Who hath wrought and done it , calling the generations from the beginning ? I , the Lord , the first , and with the last ; I am He. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	41	5	The isles saw it , and feared ; the ends of the earth were afraid , drew near , and came .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	6	They helped every one his neighbor , and every one said to his brother , “ Be of good courage. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	41	7	So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith , and he that smootheth with the hammer , him that smote the anvil , saying , “ It is ready for the soldering ” ; and he fastened it with nails , that it should not be moved .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	8	“ But thou , Israel , art My servant , Jacob whom I have chosen , the seed of Abraham My friend .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	9	Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth , and called thee from the chief men thereof , and said unto thee , ‘ Thou art My servant ; I have chosen thee and not cast thee away ’ —
KJ21	Isaiah	41	10	fear thou not , for I am with thee ; be not dismayed , for I am thy God . I will strengthen thee ; yea , I will help thee ; yea , I will uphold thee with the right hand of My righteousness .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	11	Behold , all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded ; they shall be as nothing , and they that strive with thee shall perish .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	12	Thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them , even them that contended with thee . They that war against thee shall be as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	13	For I , the Lord thy God , will hold thy right hand , saying unto thee , ‘ Fear not ; I will help thee. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	41	14	“ Fear not , thou worm Jacob and ye men of Israel ; I will help thee , ” saith the Lord and thy Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	15	“ Behold , I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth ; thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small , and shalt make the hills as chaff .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	16	Thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them ; and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	17	“ When the poor and needy seek water , and there is none and their tongue faileth for thirst , I , the Lord , will hear them ; I , the God of Israel , will not forsake them .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	18	I will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the valleys ; I will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land springs of water .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	19	I will plant in the wilderness the cedar , the acacia tree , and the myrtle and the oil tree ; I will set in the desert the fir tree , and the pine and the box tree together ,
KJ21	Isaiah	41	20	that they may see and know , and consider and understand together , that the hand of the Lord hath done this , and the Holy One of Israel hath created it .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	21	“ Produce your cause , ” saith the Lord ; “ bring forth your strong reasons , ” saith the King of Jacob .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	22	“ Let them bring them forth and show us what shall happen ; let them show the former things , what they be , that we may consider them and know the latter end of them ; or declare us things to come .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	23	Show the things that are to come hereafter , that we may know that ye are gods : yea , do good or do evil , that we may be dismayed and behold it together .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	24	Behold , ye are of nothing , and your work of nought ; an abomination is he that chooseth you .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	25	“ I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come ; from the rising of the sun shall he call upon My name . And he shall come upon princes as upon mortar , and as the potter treadeth clay .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	26	Who hath declared from the beginning , that we may know ? And beforetime , that we may say , ‘ He is righteous ’ ? Yea , there is none that showeth , yea , there is none that declareth , yea , there is none that heareth your words .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	27	The first shall say to Zion , ‘ Behold , behold them ! ’ And I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	28	For I beheld , and there was no man , even among them ; and there was no counselor that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
KJ21	Isaiah	41	29	Behold , they are all vanity ! Their works are nothing ; their molten images are wind and confusion .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	42	“ Behold My Servant , whom I uphold , Mine Elect , in whom My soul delighteth : I have put My Spirit upon Him ; He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	2	He shall not cry , nor lift up , nor cause His voice to be heard in the street .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	3	A bruised reed shall He not break , and the smoking flax shall He not quench ; He shall bring forth judgment unto truth .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	4	He shall not fail nor be discouraged , till He hath set judgment in the earth ; and the isles shall wait for His law. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	42	5	Thus saith God the Lord—He that created the heavens and stretched them out , He that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it , He that giveth breath unto the people upon it , and spirit to them that walk therein :
KJ21	Isaiah	42	6	“ I , the Lord , have called Thee in righteousness , and will hold Thine hand , and will keep Thee , and give Thee for a covenant of the people , for a light of the Gentiles ;
KJ21	Isaiah	42	7	to open the blind eyes , to bring out the prisoners from the prison , and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	8	I am the Lord ; that is My name . And My glory will I not give to another , neither My praise to graven images .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	9	“ Behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do I declare ; before they spring forth I tell you of them. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	42	10	Sing unto the Lord a new song and His praise from the end of the earth , ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein , the isles and the inhabitants thereof .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	11	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that Kedar doth inhabit . Let the inhabitants of the rock sing ; let them shout from the top of the mountains .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	12	Let them give glory unto the Lord , and declare His praise in the islands .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	13	The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man ; He shall stir up jealousy like a man of war . He shall cry , yea , roar ; He shall prevail against His enemies .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	14	“ I have long time held My peace ; I have been still and refrained Myself . Now will I cry like a travailing woman ; I will destroy and devour at once .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	15	I will make waste mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs ; and I will make the rivers islands , and I will dry up the pools .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	16	And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not ; I will lead them in paths that they have not known . I will make darkness light before them , and crooked things straight . These things will I do unto them , and not forsake them .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	17	They shall be turned back , they shall be greatly ashamed , that trust in graven images , that say to the molten images , ‘ Ye are our gods. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	42	18	“ Hear , ye deaf ; and look , ye blind , that ye may see .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	19	Who is blind , but My servant ? Or deaf , as My messenger that I sent ? Who is blind as he that is perfect , and blind as the Lord ’ s servant ? ”
KJ21	Isaiah	42	20	seeing many things , but thou observest not , opening the ears , but he heareth not. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	42	21	The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness ’ sake ; He will magnify the law and make it honorable .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	22	But this is a people robbed and spoiled ; they are all of them snared in holes , and they are hid in prison houses . They are for a prey , and none delivereth ; for a spoil , and none saith , “ Restore. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	42	23	Who among you will give ear to this ? Who will hearken and hear for the time to come ?
KJ21	Isaiah	42	24	Who gave Jacob for a spoil and Israel to the robbers ? Did not the Lord , He against whom we have sinned ? For they would not walk in His ways , neither were they obedient unto His law .
KJ21	Isaiah	42	25	Therefore He hath poured upon him the fury of His anger and the strength of battle ; and it hath set him on fire round about , yet he knew not ; and it burned him , yet he laid it not to heart .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	43	But now thus saith the Lord who created thee , O Jacob , and He that formed thee , O Israel : “ Fear not , for I have redeemed thee ; I have called thee by thy name ; thou art Mine .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	2	When thou passest through the waters , I will be with thee ; and through the rivers , they shall not overflow thee . When thou walkest through the fire , thou shalt not be burned , neither shall the flame kindle upon thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	3	For I am the Lord thy God , the Holy One of Israel , thy Savior ; I gave Egypt for thy ransom , Ethiopia and Seba for thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	4	Since thou wast precious in My sight , thou hast been honorable , and I have loved thee ; therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	5	Fear not , for I am with thee ; I will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west ;
KJ21	Isaiah	43	6	I will say to the north , ‘ Give up , ’ and to the south , ‘ Keep not back. ’ Bring My sons from far and My daughters from the ends of the earth ,
KJ21	Isaiah	43	7	even every one that is called by My name : For I have created him for My glory ; I have formed him ; yea , I have made him. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	43	8	Bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	9	Let all the nations be gathered together , and let the people be assembled . Who among them can declare this and show us former things ? Let them bring forth their witnesses , that they may be justified ; or let them hear and say , “ It is truth. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	43	10	“ Ye are My witnesses , ” saith the Lord , “ and My servant whom I have chosen , that ye may know and believe Me , and understand that I am He . Before Me there was no God formed , neither shall there be after Me .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	11	I , even I , am the Lord , and besides Me there is no savior .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	12	I have declared and have saved , and I have shown , when there was no strange god among you ; therefore ye are My witnesses , ” saith the Lord , “ that I am God .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	13	Yea , before the day was , I am He , and there is none that can deliver out of My hand ; I will work , and who shall turn it back ? ”
KJ21	Isaiah	43	14	Thus saith the Lord , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : “ For your sake I have sent to Babylon and have brought down all their nobles , and the Chaldeans , whose cry is in the ships .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	15	I am the Lord , your Holy One , the Creator of Israel , your King. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	43	16	Thus saith the Lord , who maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters ,
KJ21	Isaiah	43	17	Who bringeth forth the chariot and horse , the army and the power ( they shall lie down together , they shall not rise ; they are extinct , they are quenched as tow ) :
KJ21	Isaiah	43	18	“ Remember ye not the former things , neither consider the things of old .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	19	Behold , I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	20	The beast of the field shall honor Me , the dragons and the owls , because I give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert , to give drink to My people , My chosen .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	21	This people have I formed for Myself ; they shall show forth My praise .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	22	“ But thou hast not called upon Me , O Jacob ; but thou hast been weary of Me , O Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	23	Thou hast not brought Me the lambs or kids of thy burnt offerings , neither hast thou honored Me with thy sacrifices . I have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wearied thee with incense .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	24	Thou hast bought Me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled Me with the fat of thy sacrifices . But thou hast made Me to serve with thy sins ; thou hast wearied Me with thine iniquities .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	25	“ I , even I , am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for Mine own sake , and will not remember thy sins .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	26	Put Me in remembrance ; let us plead together ; declare thou , that thou mayest be justified .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	27	Thy first father hath sinned , and thy teachers have transgressed against Me .
KJ21	Isaiah	43	28	Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary , and have given Jacob to the curse and Israel to reproaches .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	44	“ Yet now hear , O Jacob My servant , and Israel , whom I have chosen .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	2	Thus saith the Lord that made thee and formed thee from the womb , who will help thee : Fear not , O Jacob , My servant , and thou , Jeshurun , whom I have chosen .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	3	For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty , and floods upon the dry ground ; I will pour My Spirit upon thy seed , and My blessing upon thine offspring .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	4	And they shall spring up as among the grass , as willows by the watercourses .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	5	One shall say , ‘ I am the Lord ’ s ’ ; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob ; and another shall subscribe with his hand , ‘ Unto the Lord , ’ and surname himself by the name of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	6	“ Thus saith the Lord , the King of Israel , and his Redeemer , the Lord of hosts : I am the First , and I am the Last , and besides Me there is no God .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	7	And who , as I , shall call and shall declare it , and set it in order for Me , since I appointed the ancient people ? And the things that are coming and shall come , let them show unto them .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	8	Fear ye not , neither be afraid . Have not I told thee from that time and have declared it ? Ye are even My witnesses . Is there a God besides Me ? Yea , there is no God . I know not any. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	44	9	They that make a graven image are all of them vanity , and their delectable things shall not profit . And they are their own witnesses ; they see not nor know , that they may be ashamed .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	10	Who hath formed a god , or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing ?
KJ21	Isaiah	44	11	Behold , all his fellows shall be ashamed ; and the workmen , they are of men . Let them all be gathered together ; let them stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be ashamed together .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	12	The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals , and fashioneth it with hammers , and worketh it with the strength of his arms . Yea , he is hungry , and his strength faileth ; he drinketh no water and is faint .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	13	The carpenter stretcheth out his rule ; he marketh it out with a line . He fitteth it with planes , and he marketh it out with the compass , and maketh it after the figure of a man , according to the beauty of a man , that it may remain in the house .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	14	He heweth him down cedars , and taketh the cypress and the oak , which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest . He planteth an ash , and the rain doth nourish it .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	15	Then shall it be for a man to burn , for he will take thereof and warm himself . Yea , he kindleth it , and baketh bread ; yea , he maketh a god , and worshipeth it ; he maketh it a graven image , and falleth down thereto .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	16	He burneth part thereof in the fire ; with part thereof he eateth flesh ; he roasteth roast and is satisfied . Yea , he warmeth himself and saith , “ Aha , I am warm ; I have seen the fire. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	44	17	And the residue thereof he maketh a god , even his graven image . He falleth down unto it and worshipeth it , and prayeth unto it and saith , “ Deliver me , for thou art my god. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	44	18	They have not known nor understood ; for He hath shut their eyes , that they can not see , and their hearts , that they can not understand .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	19	And none considereth in his heart , neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say , “ I have burned part of it in the fire ; yea , also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof ; I have roasted flesh and eaten it . And shall I make the residue thereof an abomination ? Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree ? ”
KJ21	Isaiah	44	20	He feedeth on ashes : a deceived heart hath turned him aside , that he can not deliver his soul nor say , “ Is there not a lie in my right hand ? ”
KJ21	Isaiah	44	21	“ Remember these , O Jacob and Israel , for thou art My servant . I have formed thee ; thou art My servant . O Israel , thou shalt not be forgotten by Me .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	22	I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , thy transgressions , and as a cloud , thy sins ; return unto Me , for I have redeemed thee. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	44	23	Sing , O ye heavens , for the Lord hath done it ! Shout , ye lower parts of the earth ! Break forth into singing , ye mountains , O forest and every tree therein ; for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob , and glorified Himself in Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	44	24	“ Thus saith the Lord , thy Redeemer , and He that formed thee from the womb : I am the Lord that maketh all things , that stretcheth forth the heavens alone , that spreadeth abroad the earth by Myself ;
KJ21	Isaiah	44	25	that frustrateth the tokens of the liars , and maketh diviners mad , that turneth wise men backward , and maketh their knowledge foolish ;
KJ21	Isaiah	44	26	that confirmeth the word of His servant , and performeth the counsel of His messengers , that saith to Jerusalem , ‘ Thou shalt be inhabited , ’ and to the cities of Judah , ‘ Ye shall be built , and I will raise up the decayed places thereof ’ ;
KJ21	Isaiah	44	27	that saith to the deep , ‘ Be dry , and I will dry up thy rivers ’ ;
KJ21	Isaiah	44	28	that saith of Cyrus , ‘ He is My shepherd and shall perform all My pleasure , ’ even saying to Jerusalem , ‘ Thou shalt be built , ’ and to the temple , ‘ Thy foundation shall be laid . ’
KJ21	Isaiah	45	45	“ Thus saith the Lord to His anointed , to Cyrus , whose right hand I have held to subdue nations before him ; and I will loose the loins of kings to open before him the twoleaved gates ; and the gates shall not be shut :
KJ21	Isaiah	45	2	I will go before thee , and make the crooked places straight ; I will break in pieces the gates of brass , and cut in sunder the bars of iron .

KJ21	Isaiah	45	5	I am the Lord , and there is none else ; there is no God besides Me . I girded thee , though thou hast not known Me ,
KJ21	Isaiah	45	6	that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none besides Me . I am the Lord , and there is none else .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	7	I form the light , and create darkness ; I make peace , and create evil ; I , the Lord , do all these things .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	8	“ Drop down , ye heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness ; let the earth open , and let them bring forth salvation , and let righteousness spring up together . I , the Lord , have created it .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	9	“ Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker ! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth . Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it , ‘ What makest thou ? ’ or thy work , ‘ He hath no hands ’ ?
KJ21	Isaiah	45	10	Woe unto him that saith unto his father , ‘ What begettest thou ? ’ or to the woman , ‘ What hast thou brought forth ? ’

They shall come after thee ; in chains they shall come over , and they shall fall down unto thee ; they shall make supplication unto thee , saying , ‘ Surely God is in thee , and there is none else ; there is no god. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	45	15	Verily Thou art a God who hidest Thyself , O God of Israel , the Savior .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	16	They shall be ashamed and also confounded , all of them ; they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	17	But Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation ; ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	18	For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens , God Himself that formed the earth and made it—He hath established it , He created it not in vain , He formed it to be inhabited : “ I am the Lord , and there is none else .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	19	I have not spoken in secret , in a dark place of the earth ; I said not unto the seed of Jacob , ‘ Seek ye Me in vain. ’ I , the Lord , speak righteousness ; I declare things that are right .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	20	“ Assemble yourselves and come ; draw near together , ye that are escaped of the nations . They have no knowledge , who set up the wood of their graven image , and pray unto a god that can not save .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	21	Tell ye , and bring them near ; yea , let them take counsel together . Who hath declared this from ancient time ? Who hath told it from that time ? Have not I , the Lord ? And there is no God else besides Me , a just God and a Savior . There is none besides Me .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	22	“ Look unto Me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth ; for I am God , and there is none else .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	23	I have sworn by Myself ; the word is gone out of My mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , that unto Me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	24	Surely , shall one say , ‘ In the Lord have I righteousness and strength . Even to Him shall men come , and all that are incensed against Him shall be ashamed .
KJ21	Isaiah	45	25	In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified , and shall glory . ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	46	46	Bel boweth down , Nebo stoopeth ; their idols were upon the beasts and upon the cattle . Your carriages were heavy laden ; they are a burden to the weary beast .
KJ21	Isaiah	46	2	They stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves are gone into captivity .
KJ21	Isaiah	46	3	“ Hearken unto Me , O house of Jacob , and all the remnant of the house of Israel , who are borne by Me from the belly , who are carried from the womb :
KJ21	Isaiah	46	4	And even to your old age I am He , and even to hoary hairs will I carry you . I have made , and I will bear ; even I will carry , and will deliver you .
KJ21	Isaiah	46	5	“ To whom will ye liken Me and make Me equal , and compare Me , that we may be like ?
KJ21	Isaiah	46	6	They lavish gold out of the bag , and weigh silver in the balance , and hire a goldsmith , and he maketh it a god : they fall down , yea , they worship .
KJ21	Isaiah	46	7	They bear him upon the shoulder , they carry him and set him in his place , and he standeth . From his place shall he not remove ; yea , one shall cry unto him , yet can he not answer nor save him out of his trouble .
KJ21	Isaiah	46	8	“ Remember this , and show yourselves men ; bring it again to mind , O ye transgressors .
KJ21	Isaiah	46	9	Remember the former things of old ; for I am God , and there is none other ; I am God , and there is none like Me ,
KJ21	Isaiah	46	10	declaring the end from the beginning , and from ancient times the things that are not yet done , saying , ‘ My counsel shall stand , and I will do all My pleasure , ’
KJ21	Isaiah	46	11	calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man that executeth My counsel from a far country . Yea , I have spoken it , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed it , I will also do it .
KJ21	Isaiah	46	12	“ Hearken unto Me , ye stouthearted , that are far from righteousness :
KJ21	Isaiah	46	13	I bring near My righteousness ; it shall not be far off , and My salvation shall not tarry ; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel My glory .

KJ21	Isaiah	47	3	Thy nakedness shall be uncovered ; yea , thy shame shall be seen ; I will take vengeance , and I will not meet thee as a man. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	47	4	As for our Redeemer , the Lord of hosts is His name , the Holy One of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	47	5	“ Sit thou silent , and get thee into darkness , O daughter of the Chaldeans ; for thou shalt no more be called the Lady of Kingdoms .
KJ21	Isaiah	47	6	I was wroth with My people , I have polluted Mine inheritance and given them into thine hand . Thou didst show them no mercy ; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke .
KJ21	Isaiah	47	7	And thou saidst , ‘ I shall be a lady for ever , ’ so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart , neither didst remember the latter end of it .
KJ21	Isaiah	47	8	“ Therefore hear now this , thou that art given to pleasures , who dwellest carelessly , who sayest in thine heart , ‘ I am , and none else besides me ; I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know the loss of children. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	47	9	But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day : the loss of children , and widowhood . They shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries , and for the great abundance of thine enchantments .
KJ21	Isaiah	47	10	For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness ; thou hast said , ‘ None seeth me. ’ Thy wisdom and thy knowledge , it hath perverted thee ; and thou hast said in thine heart , ‘ I am , and none else besides me. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	47	11	Therefore shall evil come upon thee ; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth . And mischief shall fall upon thee ; thou shalt not be able to put it off . And desolation shall come upon thee suddenly , which thou shalt not know .
KJ21	Isaiah	47	12	“ Stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries , wherein thou hast labored from thy youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profit , if so be thou mayest prevail .
KJ21	Isaiah	47	13	Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels . Let now the astrologers , the stargazers , the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	47	14	Behold , they shall be as stubble ; the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame ; there shall not be a coal to warm at , nor fire to sit before it .
KJ21	Isaiah	47	15	Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast labored , even thy merchants , from thy youth ; they shall wander every one to his quarter . None shall save thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	48	“ Hear ye this , O house of Jacob , which are called by the name of Israel and have come forth out of the waters of Judah , who swear by the name of the Lord and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth nor in righteousness ;
KJ21	Isaiah	48	2	for they call themselves of the holy city and stand themselves upon the God of Israel—the Lord of Hosts is His name :
KJ21	Isaiah	48	3	I have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of My mouth , and I showed them ; I did them suddenly , and they came to pass .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	4	Because I knew that thou art obstinate , and thy neck is an iron sinew and thy brow brass ,
KJ21	Isaiah	48	5	I have even from the beginning declared it to thee ; before it came to pass I showed it thee , lest thou shouldest say , ‘ Mine idol hath done them , and my graven image , and my molten image hath commanded them. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	48	6	Thou hast heard ; see all this , and will not ye declare it ? I have shown thee new things from this time , even hidden things , and thou didst not know them .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	7	They are created now and not from the beginning , even before the day when thou heardest them not , lest thou shouldest say , ‘ Behold , I knew them. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	48	8	Yea , thou heardest not ; yea , thou knewest not , yea , from that time that thine ear was not opened ; for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously and wast called a transgressor from the womb .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	9	“ For My name ’ s sake will I defer Mine anger , and for My praise will I refrain for thee , that I cut thee not off .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	10	Behold , I have refined thee , but not with silver ; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	11	For Mine own sake , even for Mine own sake , will I do it ; for how should My name be polluted ? And I will not give My glory unto another .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	12	“ Hearken unto Me , O Jacob and Israel , My called : I am He ; I am the First , I also am the Last .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	13	Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth , and My right hand hath spanned the heavens ; when I call unto them , they stand up together .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	14	“ All ye , assemble yourselves and hear . Who among them hath declared these things ? The Lord hath loved him ; He will do His pleasure on Babylon , and His arm shall be on the Chaldeans .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	15	I , even I , have spoken ; yea , I have called him ; I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .

KJ21	Isaiah	48	17	Thus saith the Lord , thy Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : “ I am the Lord thy God who teacheth thee to profit , who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	18	O that thou hadst hearkened to My commandments ! Then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	19	Thy seed also had been as the sand , and the offspring of thy loins like the gravel thereof ; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before Me. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	48	20	Go ye forth from Babylon ! Flee ye from the Chaldeans ! With a voice of singing declare ye ; tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth ; say ye , “ The Lord hath redeemed His servant Jacob. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	48	21	And they thirsted not when He led them through the deserts ; He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; He cleaved the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
KJ21	Isaiah	48	22	“ There is no peace , ” saith the Lord , “ unto the wicked . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	49	49	“ Listen , O isles , unto Me , and hearken , ye people from afar ! The Lord hath called Me from the womb ; from the bowels of My mother hath He made mention of My name .
KJ21	Isaiah	49	2	And He hath made My mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of His hand hath He hid Me , and made Me a polished shaft . In His quiver hath He hid Me ,
KJ21	Isaiah	49	3	and said unto Me , ‘ Thou art My servant , O Israel , in whom I will be glorified. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	49	4	Then I said , ‘ I have labored in vain ; I have spent My strength for nought and in vain ; yet surely My judgment is with the Lord , and My work with My God. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	49	5	“ And now saith the Lord that formed Me from the womb to be His servant , to bring Jacob again to Him , though Israel be not gathered—yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord , and My God shall be My strength ”
KJ21	Isaiah	49	6	and He said : ‘ It is a light thing that Thou shouldest be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel . I will also give Thee for a light to the Gentiles , that Thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	49	7	Thus saith the Lord , the Redeemer of Israel , and His Holy One , to Him whom man despiseth , to Him whom the nation abhorreth , to a Servant of rulers : “ Kings shall see and arise , princes also shall worship , because of the Lord who is faithful , and the Holy One of Israel ; and He shall choose Thee. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	49	8	Thus saith the Lord : “ In an acceptable time have I heard Thee , and in a day of salvation have I helped Thee ; and I will preserve Thee and give Thee for a covenant of the people , to establish the earth , to cause to inherit the desolate heritages ,
KJ21	Isaiah	49	9	that Thou mayest say to the prisoners , ‘ Go forth , ’ to them that are in darkness , ‘ Show yourselves. ’ “ They shall feed on the paths , and their pastures shall be in all high places .

KJ21	Isaiah	49	17	Thy children shall make haste ; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	49	18	Lift up thine eyes round about and behold ; all these gather themselves together and come to thee . As I live , ” saith the Lord , “ thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament , and bind them on thee as a bride doeth .
KJ21	Isaiah	49	19	For thy waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy destruction shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants , and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away .
KJ21	Isaiah	49	20	The children whom thou shalt have , after thou hast lost the other , shall say again in thine ears , ‘ The place is too narrow for me ; give place to me that I may dwell. ’
KJ21	Isaiah	49	21	Then shalt thou say in thine heart , ‘ Who hath begotten me these , seeing I have lost my children and am desolate , a captive and removing to and fro ? And who hath brought up these ? Behold , I was left alone ; these , where had they been ? ’ ”

KJ21	Isaiah	50	2	Why , when I came , was there no man ? When I called , was there none to answer ? Is My hand shortened at all , that it can not redeem ? Or have I no power to deliver ?

KJ21	Isaiah	51	20	Thy sons have fainted ; they lie at the head of all the streets , as a wild bull in a net ; they are full of the fury of the Lord , the rebuke of thy God .
KJ21	Isaiah	51	21	Therefore hear now this , thou afflicted , and drunken , but not with wine .
KJ21	Isaiah	51	22	Thus saith thy Lord the Lord , and thy God that pleadeth the cause of His people : “ Behold , I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling , even the dregs of the cup of My fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again .

KJ21	Isaiah	52	3	For thus saith the Lord : “ Ye have sold yourselves for nought ; and ye shall be redeemed without money. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	52	4	For thus saith the Lord God : “ My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there , and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause .
KJ21	Isaiah	52	5	Now therefore , what have I here , ” saith the Lord , “ that My people are taken away for nought ? They that rule over them make them to howl , ” saith the Lord , “ and My name continually every day is blasphemed .
KJ21	Isaiah	52	6	Therefore My people shall know My name ; therefore they shall know in that day that I am He that doth speak . Behold , it is I. ”

KJ21	Isaiah	53	53	Who hath believed our report ? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed ?
KJ21	Isaiah	53	2	For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant , and as a root out of a dry ground . He hath no form nor comeliness , and when we shall see Him , there is no beauty that we should desire Him .
KJ21	Isaiah	53	3	He is despised and rejected of men , a Man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief . And we hid as it were our faces from Him ; He was despised , and we esteemed Him not .
KJ21	Isaiah	53	4	Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows ; yet we did esteem Him stricken , smitten of God , and afflicted .
KJ21	Isaiah	53	5	But He was wounded for our transgressions ; He was bruised for our iniquities . The chastisement of our peace was upon Him , and with His stripes we are healed .
KJ21	Isaiah	53	6	All we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all .
KJ21	Isaiah	53	7	He was oppressed , and He was afflicted , yet He opened not his mouth ; He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter ; and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so He openeth not His mouth .
KJ21	Isaiah	53	8	He was taken from prison and from judgment ; and who shall declare His generation ? For He was cut off out of the land of the living ; for the transgression of My people was He stricken .
KJ21	Isaiah	53	9	And He made His grave with the wicked , and with the rich in His death , because He had done no violence , neither was any deceit in His mouth .
KJ21	Isaiah	53	10	Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him ; He hath put Him to grief . When thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin , He shall see His seed , He shall prolong His days , and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand .
KJ21	Isaiah	53	11	He shall see of the travail of His soul , and shall be satisfied . By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify many , for He shall bear their iniquities .
KJ21	Isaiah	53	12	Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great , and He shall divide the spoil with the strong , because He hath poured out His soul unto death . And He was numbered with the transgressors ; and He bore the sin of many , and made intercession for the transgressors .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	54	“ Sing , O barren , thou that didst not bear ! Break forth into singing and cry aloud , thou that didst not travail with child ! For more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	2	Enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations ; spare not , lengthen thy cords , and strengthen thy stakes .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	3	For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left , and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	4	“ Fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed ; neither be thou confounded , for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	5	For thy Maker is thine husband ” the Lord of hosts is His name ” and thy Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel ; the God of the whole earth shall He be called .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	6	For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit , and a wife of youth , when thou wast refused , ” saith thy God .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	7	“ For a small moment have I forsaken thee , but with great mercies will I gather thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	8	In a little wrath I hid My face from thee for a moment , but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee , saith the Lord thy Redeemer .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	9	“ For this is as the waters of Noah unto Me ; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth , so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	10	For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed , but My kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the covenant of My peace be removed , ” saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	11	“ O thou afflicted , tossed with tempest and not comforted , behold , I will lay thy stones with fair colors and lay thy foundations with sapphires .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	12	And I will make thy windows of agates and thy gates of rubies , and all thy borders of pleasant stones .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	13	And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord , and great shall be the peace of thy children .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	14	In righteousness shalt thou be established ; thou shalt be far from oppression , for thou shalt not fear ; and from terror , for it shall not come near thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	15	Behold , they shall surely gather together , but not by Me ; whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	16	Behold , I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire , and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work ; and I have created the waster to destroy .
KJ21	Isaiah	54	17	No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper ; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn . This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord , and their righteousness is of Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	55	“ Ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye to the waters ; and he that hath no money , come ye , buy , and eat ; yea , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	2	Why do ye spend money for that which is not bread , and your labor for that which satisfieth not ? Hearken diligently unto Me , and eat ye that which is good , and let your soul delight itself in fatness .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	3	Incline your ear , and come unto Me ; hear , and your soul shall live ; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you , even the sure mercies of David .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	4	Behold , I have given him for a witness to the people , a leader and commander to the people .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	5	Behold , thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not , and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for He hath glorified thee. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	55	6	Seek ye the Lord while He may be found , call ye upon Him while He is near .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	7	Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts ; and let him return unto the Lord , and He will have mercy upon him , and to our God , for He will abundantly pardon .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	8	“ For My thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways My ways , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	9	“ For as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	10	For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth , and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater ,
KJ21	Isaiah	55	11	so shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth : It shall not return unto Me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	12	“ For ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace ; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands .
KJ21	Isaiah	55	13	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree , and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree ; and it shall be to the Lord for a name , for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	56	56	Thus saith the Lord , “ Keep ye judgment , and do justice ; for My salvation is near to come , and My righteousness to be revealed .
KJ21	Isaiah	56	2	Blessed is the man that doeth this , and the son of man that layeth hold on it ; who keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it , and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	56	3	Neither let the son of the stranger , that hath joined himself to the Lord , speak , saying , “ The Lord hath utterly separated me from His people ” ; neither let the eunuch say , “ Behold , I am a dry tree. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	56	4	For thus saith the Lord : “ Unto the eunuchs that keep My Sabbaths , and choose the things that please Me , and take hold of My covenant ,
KJ21	Isaiah	56	5	even unto them will I give in Mine house and within My walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off .
KJ21	Isaiah	56	6	Also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the Lord to serve Him , and to love the name of the Lord , to be His servants , every one that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it , and taketh hold of My covenant ,
KJ21	Isaiah	56	7	even them will I bring to My holy mountain , and make them joyful in My house of prayer ; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon Mine altar , for Mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	56	8	The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith , “ Yet will I gather others to him , beside those that are gathered unto him. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	56	9	All ye beasts of the field , come to devour , yea , all ye beasts in the forest .
KJ21	Isaiah	56	10	His watchmen are blind ; they are all ignorant ; they are all dumb dogs , they can not bark , sleeping , lying down , loving to slumber .
KJ21	Isaiah	56	11	Yea , they are greedy dogs which can never have enough , and they are shepherds that can not understand ; they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
KJ21	Isaiah	56	12	“ Come ye , ” say they , “ I will fetch wine , and we will fill ourselves with strong drink ; and tomorrow shall be as this day , and much more abundant . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	57	57	The righteous perisheth , and no man layeth it to heart ; and merciful men are taken away , none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	2	He shall enter into peace ; they shall rest in their beds , each one walking in his uprightness .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	3	“ But draw near hither , ye sons of the sorceress , the seed of the adulterer and the whore .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	4	Against whom do ye sport yourselves ? Against whom make ye a wide mouth and draw out the tongue ? Are ye not children of transgression , a seed of falsehood ,
KJ21	Isaiah	57	5	inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree , slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks ?
KJ21	Isaiah	57	6	Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion ; they , they are thy lot . Even to them hast thou poured a drink offering , thou hast offered a meat offering . Should I receive comfort in these ?
KJ21	Isaiah	57	7	Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed ; even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	8	Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance ; for thou hast uncovered thyself to another than Me , and art gone up ; thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee a covenant with them ; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	9	And thou wentest to the king with ointment , and didst increase thy perfumes , and didst send thy messengers far off , and didst debase thyself even unto hell .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	10	Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way ; yet saidst thou not , ‘ There is no hope. ’ Thou hast found the life of thine hand ; therefore thou wast not grieved .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	11	“ And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared , that thou hast lied , and hast not remembered Me , nor laid it to thy heart ? Have not I held My peace even of old , and thou fearest Me not ?
KJ21	Isaiah	57	12	I will declare thy righteousness and thy works , for they shall not profit thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	13	When thou criest , let thy companies deliver thee ; but the wind shall carry them all away , vanity shall take them . But he that putteth his trust in Me shall possess the land , and shall inherit My holy mountain ,
KJ21	Isaiah	57	14	And shall say , ‘ Cast ye up , cast ye up , prepare the way ; take up the stumbling block out of the way of My people. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	57	15	For thus saith the high and lofty One who inhabiteth eternity , whose name is Holy : “ I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	16	For I will not contend for ever , neither will I be always wroth ; for the spirit should fail before Me , and the souls which I have made .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	17	For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth and smote him ; I hid Me and was wroth , and he went on waywardly in the way of his heart .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	18	I have seen his ways and will heal him ; I will lead him also , and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	19	I create the fruit of the lips ; peace , peace to him that is far off , and to him that is near , ” saith the Lord ; “ and I will heal him .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	20	“ But the wicked are like the troubled sea when it can not rest , whose waters cast up mire and dirt .
KJ21	Isaiah	57	21	There is no peace , saith my God , to the wicked . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	58	58	“ Cry aloud , spare not ; lift up thy voice like a trumpet ! And show My people their transgression and the house of Jacob their sins .
KJ21	Isaiah	58	2	Yet they seek Me daily and delight to know My ways , as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their God . They ask of Me the ordinances of justice ; they take delight in approaching to God .
KJ21	Isaiah	58	3	‘ Why have we fasted , ’ say they , ‘ and Thou seest not ? Why have we afflicted our soul , and thou takest no note ? ’ Behold , in the day of your fast ye find pleasure , and exact all your labors .
KJ21	Isaiah	58	4	Behold , ye fast for strife and debate , and to smite with the fist of wickedness ; ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
KJ21	Isaiah	58	5	Is it such a fast that I have chosen ? A day for a man to afflict his soul ? Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush , and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him ? Wilt thou call this a fast , and an acceptable day to the Lord ?
KJ21	Isaiah	58	6	“ Is not this the fast that I have chosen : to loose the bands of wickedness , to undo the heavy burdens , and to let the oppressed go free , and that ye break every yoke ?
KJ21	Isaiah	58	7	Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry , and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house ? —when thou seest the naked , that thou cover him , and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh ?
KJ21	Isaiah	58	8	Then shall thy light break forth as the morning , and thine health shall spring forth speedily ; and thy righteousness shall go before thee ; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward .
KJ21	Isaiah	58	9	Then shalt thou call , and the Lord shall answer ; thou shalt cry , and He shall say , ‘ Here I am. ’ If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke , the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity ,
KJ21	Isaiah	58	10	and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul , then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday .
KJ21	Isaiah	58	11	And the Lord shall guide thee continually , and satisfy thy soul in drought , and make fat thy bones ; and thou shalt be like a watered garden , and like a spring of water whose waters fail not .
KJ21	Isaiah	58	12	And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places ; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations , and thou shalt be called the Repairer of the Breach , the Restorer of Paths to dwell in .
KJ21	Isaiah	58	13	“ If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath , from doing thy pleasure on My holy day , and call the Sabbath a delight , the holy of the Lord , honorable , and shalt honor Him , not doing thine own ways , nor finding thine own pleasure , nor speaking thine own words ,
KJ21	Isaiah	58	14	then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord ; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth , and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father ; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	59	59	Behold , the Lord ’ S hand is not shortened , that it can not save ; neither His ear heavy , that it can not hear .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	2	But your iniquities have separated you and your God , and your sins have hid His face from you , that He will not hear .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	3	For your hands are defiled with blood , and your fingers with iniquity ; your lips have spoken lies , your tongue hath muttered perverseness .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	4	None calleth for justice , nor any pleadeth for truth ; they trust in vanity , and speak lies ; they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	5	They hatch adders ’ eggs and weave the spider ’ s web ; he that eateth of their eggs dieth , and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	6	Their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works ; their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	7	Their feet run to evil , and they make haste to shed innocent blood ; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity ; wasting and destruction are in their paths .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	8	The way of peace they know not , and there is no judgment in their goings ; they have made them crooked paths ; whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	9	Therefore is judgment far from us , neither doth justice overtake us ; we wait for light , but behold obscurity ; for brightness , but we walk in darkness .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	10	We grope for the wall like the blind , and we grope as if we had no eyes ; we stumble at noonday as in the night ; we are in desolate places as dead men .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	11	We all roar like bears , and mourn sore like doves ; we look for judgment , but there is none ; for salvation , but it is far off from us .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	12	For our transgressions are multiplied before Thee , and our sins testify against us . For our transgressions are with us , and as for our iniquities , we know them :
KJ21	Isaiah	59	13	in transgressing and lying against the Lord , and departing away from our God , speaking oppression and revolt , conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	14	And judgment is turned away backward , and justice standeth afar off ; for truth is fallen in the street , and equity can not enter .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	15	Yea , truth faileth , and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey . And the Lord saw it , and it displeased Him that there was no judgment .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	16	And he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessor ; therefore his arm brought salvation unto Him , and his righteousness , it sustained Him .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	17	For He put on righteousness as a breastplate , and a helmet of salvation upon His head ; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeal as a cloak .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	18	According to their deeds , accordingly He will repay , fury to His adversaries , recompense to His enemies ; to the islands He will repay recompense .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	19	So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and His glory from the rising of the sun . When the enemy shall come in like a flood , the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	20	“ And the Redeemer shall come to Zion , and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	59	21	“ As for me , this is my covenant with them , ” saith the Lord ; “ My spirit that is upon thee , and My words which I have put in thy mouth , shall not depart out of thy mouth , nor out of the mouth of thy seed , nor out of the mouth of thy seed ’ s seed , ” saith the Lord , “ from henceforth and for ever . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	60	60	Arise , shine , for thy light is come , and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	2	For behold , the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people ; but the Lord shall arise upon thee , and His glory shall be seen upon thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	3	And the Gentiles shall come to thy light , and kings to the brightness of thy rising .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	4	“ Lift up thine eyes round about and see ; all they gather themselves together , they come to thee ; thy sons shall come from far , and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	5	Then thou shalt see and flow together , and thine heart shall fear and be enlarged , because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee , the wealth of the Gentiles shall come unto thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	6	The multitude of camels shall cover thee , the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah ; all they from Sheba shall come ; they shall bring gold and incense , and they shall show forth the praises of the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	7	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee , the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee ; they shall come up with acceptance on Mine altar , and I will glorify the house of My glory .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	8	“ Who are these that fly as a cloud and as the doves to their windows ?
KJ21	Isaiah	60	9	Surely the isles shall wait for Me—and the ships of Tarshish first , to bring thy sons from far , their silver and their gold with them , unto the name of the Lord thy God , and to the Holy One of Israel , because He hath glorified thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	10	“ And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls , and their kings shall minister unto thee ; for in My wrath I smote thee , but in My favor have I had mercy on thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	11	Therefore thy gates shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night , that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the Gentiles , and that their kings may be brought .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	12	For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish ; yea , those nations shall be utterly wasted .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	13	The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee , the fir tree , the pine tree , and the box together to beautify the place of My sanctuary ; and I will make the place of My feet glorious .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	14	The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee , and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet ; and they shall call thee , the City of the Lord , the Zion of the Holy One of Israel .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	15	“ Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated , so that no man went through thee , I will make thee an eternal excellency , a joy of many generations .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	16	Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles , and shalt suck the breast of kings ; and thou shalt know that I the Lord , am thy Savior and thy Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	17	“ For brass I will bring gold , and for iron I will bring silver , and for wood , brass , and for stones , iron . I will also make thy officers peace and thine exactors righteousness .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	18	Violence shall no more be heard in thy land , wasting nor destruction within thy borders ; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation and thy gates Praise .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	19	The sun shall be no more thy light by day , neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee ; but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light , and thy God thy glory .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	20	Thy sun shall no more go down , neither shall thy moon withdraw itself ; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light , and the days of thy mourning shall be ended .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	21	Thy people also shall be all righteous ; they shall inherit the land for ever , the branch of My planting , the work of My hands , that I may be glorified .
KJ21	Isaiah	60	22	A little one shall become a thousand , and a small one a strong nation ; I , the Lord , will hasten it in his time . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	61	61	“ The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me , because the Lord hath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek . He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to the captives , and the opening of the prison to them that are bound ,
KJ21	Isaiah	61	2	To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord , and the day of vengeance of our God ; to comfort all that mourn ,
KJ21	Isaiah	61	3	To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion , to give unto them beauty for ashes , the oil of joy for mourning , the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness , that they might be called trees of righteousness , the planting of the Lord , that He might be glorified. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	61	4	And they shall build the wastes of old , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
KJ21	Isaiah	61	5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks , and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers .
KJ21	Isaiah	61	6	But ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord ; men shall call you the Ministers of our God . Ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles , and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves .
KJ21	Isaiah	61	7	For your shame ye shall have double , and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion . Therefore in their land they shall possess the double ; everlasting joy shall be unto them .
KJ21	Isaiah	61	8	“ For I , the Lord , love judgment ; I hate robbery for burnt offering ; and I will direct their work in truth , and I will make an everlasting covenant with them .
KJ21	Isaiah	61	9	And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles and their offspring among the people ; all that see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	61	10	I will greatly rejoice in the Lord ; my soul shall be joyful in my God . For He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation ; He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness , as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments , and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels .
KJ21	Isaiah	61	11	For as the earth bringeth forth her bud , and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth , so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
KJ21	Isaiah	62	62	For Zion ’ s sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem ’ s sake I will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth .
KJ21	Isaiah	62	2	And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness , and all kings thy glory ; and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of the Lord shall name .
KJ21	Isaiah	62	3	Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord , and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God .
KJ21	Isaiah	62	4	Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken , neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate ; but thou shalt be called Hephzibah and thy land Beulah : for the Lord delighteth in thee , and thy land shall be married .
KJ21	Isaiah	62	5	For as a young man marrieth a virgin , so shall thy sons marry thee ; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride , so shall thy God rejoice over thee .
KJ21	Isaiah	62	6	“ I have set watchmen upon thy walls , O Jerusalem , who shall never hold their peace day nor night. ” Ye that make mention of the Lord , keep not silence ,
KJ21	Isaiah	62	7	and give Him no rest till He establish , and till He make Jerusalem a praise in the earth .
KJ21	Isaiah	62	8	The Lord hath sworn by His right hand and by the arm of His strength : “ Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies , and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine for which thou hast labored ;
KJ21	Isaiah	62	9	but they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the Lord ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	62	10	Go through , go through the gates ; prepare ye the way of the people . Cast up , cast up the highway ; gather out the stones ; lift up a standard for the people .
KJ21	Isaiah	62	11	Behold , the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world : “ Say ye to the daughter of Zion , ‘ Behold , thy salvation cometh ; behold , his reward is with Him , and His work before Him. ’ ”
KJ21	Isaiah	62	12	And they shall call them the Holy People , the Redeemed of the Lord ; and thou shalt be called Sought Out , a City Not Forsaken .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	63	Who is this that cometh from Edom , with dyed garments from Bozrah , this that is glorious in His apparel , traveling in the greatness of his strength ? “ I that speak in righteousness , mighty to save. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	63	2	Why art thou red in Thine apparel , and Thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine vat ?
KJ21	Isaiah	63	3	“ I have trodden the wine press alone ; and of the people there was none with Me . For I will tread them in Mine anger and trample them in My fury ; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon My garments , and I will stain all My raiment .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	4	For the day of vengeance is in Mine heart , and the year of My redeemed is come .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	5	And I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold . Therefore Mine own arm brought salvation unto Me , and My fury , it upheld Me .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	6	And I will tread down the people in Mine anger , and make them drunk in My fury , and I will bring down their strength to the earth. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	63	7	I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the Lord , and the praises of the Lord , according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us , and the great goodness toward the house of Israel , which He hath bestowed on them according to His mercies , and according to the multitude of His lovingkindnesses .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	8	For He said , “ Surely they are My people , children that will not lie ” ; so He was their Savior .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	9	In all their affliction He was afflicted , and the angel of His presence saved them ; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them , and He bore them , and carried them all the days of old .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	10	But they rebelled and vexed His holy Spirit ; therefore He was turned to be their enemy , and He fought against them .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	11	Then He remembered the days of old , Moses and His people , saying , “ Where is He that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of His flock ? Where is He that put His holy Spirit within him ,
KJ21	Isaiah	63	12	That led them by the right hand of Moses with His glorious arm , dividing the water before them to make Himself an everlasting name ,
KJ21	Isaiah	63	13	that led them through the deep , as a horse in the wilderness , that they should not stumble ? ”
KJ21	Isaiah	63	14	As a beast goeth down into the valley , the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest ; so didst Thou lead Thy people , to make Thyself a glorious name .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	15	Look down from heaven , and behold from the habitation of Thy holiness and of Thy glory . Where is Thy zeal and Thy strength , the sounding of Thy heart and of Thy mercies toward me ? Are they restrained ?
KJ21	Isaiah	63	16	Doubtless Thou art our Father , though Abraham be ignorant of us and Israel acknowledge us not . Thou , O Lord , art our father , our Redeemer ; Thy name is from everlasting .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	17	O Lord , why hast Thou made us to err from Thy ways , and hardened our heart from Thy fear ? Return for Thy servants ’ sake , the tribes of Thine inheritance .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	18	The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while ; our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary .
KJ21	Isaiah	63	19	We are Thine ; Thou didst never bear rule over them ; they were not called by Thy name .
KJ21	Isaiah	64	64	Oh , that Thou wouldest rend the heavens , that Thou wouldest come down , that the mountains might flow down at Thy presence—
KJ21	Isaiah	64	2	as when the melting fire burneth , the fire causeth the waters to boil— to make Thy name known to Thine adversaries , that the nations may tremble at Thy presence !
KJ21	Isaiah	64	3	When Thou didst fearsome things which we looked not for , Thou camest down , the mountains flowed down at Thy presence .
KJ21	Isaiah	64	4	For since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear , neither hath the eye seen , O God , besides thee , what He hath prepared for him that waiteth for Him .
KJ21	Isaiah	64	5	Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness , those that remember Thee in Thy ways . Behold , Thou art wroth , for we have sinned ; in those is continuance , and we shall be saved .
KJ21	Isaiah	64	6	But we are all as an unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags ; and we all do fade as a leaf , and our iniquities , like the wind , have taken us away .
KJ21	Isaiah	64	7	And there is none that calleth upon Thy name , that stirreth up himself to take hold of Thee ; for Thou hast hid Thy face from us , and hast consumed us because of our iniquities .
KJ21	Isaiah	64	8	But now , O Lord , Thou art our Father ; we are the clay , and Thou our potter ; and we all are the work of Thy hand .
KJ21	Isaiah	64	9	Be not sorely wroth , O Lord , neither remember iniquity for ever ; behold , see , we beseech Thee , we are all Thy people .
KJ21	Isaiah	64	10	Thy holy cities are a wilderness , Zion is a wilderness , Jerusalem a desolation .
KJ21	Isaiah	64	11	Our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised Thee , is burned up with fire ; and all our pleasant things are laid waste .
KJ21	Isaiah	64	12	Wilt Thou refrain Thyself for these things , O Lord ? Wilt Thou hold Thy peace and afflict us very sore ?
KJ21	Isaiah	65	65	“ I am sought of them that asked not for Me ; I am found of them that sought Me not . I said , ‘ Behold Me , behold Me , ’ unto a nation that was not called by My name .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	2	I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people , which walketh in a way that was not good , after their own thoughts ;
KJ21	Isaiah	65	3	A people that provoketh Me to anger continually to My face , that sacrificeth in gardens and burneth incense upon altars of brick ;
KJ21	Isaiah	65	4	who remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments , which eat swine ’ s flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
KJ21	Isaiah	65	5	who say , ‘ Stand by thyself ; come not near to me , for I am holier than thou ! ’ These are a smoke in My nose , a fire that burneth all the day .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	6	Behold , it is written before Me : I will not keep silence , but will recompense—even recompense into their bosom ”
KJ21	Isaiah	65	7	your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together , ” saith the Lord , “ who have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed Me upon the hills ; therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	65	8	Thus saith the Lord , “ As the new wine is found in the cluster , and one saith , ‘ Destroy it not , for a blessing is in it , ’ so will I do for my servants ’ sakes , that I may not destroy them all .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	9	And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains ; and Mine elect shall inherit it , and My servants shall dwell there .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	10	And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the Valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in , for My people that have sought Me .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	11	“ But ye are they that forsake the Lord , that forget My holy mountain , that prepare a table for that Gad , and that furnish the drink offering unto that Meni .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	12	Therefore will I number you to the sword , and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter ; because when I called , ye did not answer ; when I spoke , ye did not hear , but did evil before Mine eyes and did choose that wherein I delighted not. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	65	13	Therefore thus saith the Lord God , “ Behold , My servants shall eat , but ye shall be hungry ; behold , My servants shall drink , but ye shall be thirsty : behold , My servants shall rejoice , but ye shall be ashamed .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	14	Behold , My servants shall sing for joy of heart , but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart , and shall howl for vexation of spirit .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	15	And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto My chosen , for the Lord God shall slay thee and call His servants by another name ,
KJ21	Isaiah	65	16	that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth , and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth , because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hid from Mine eyes .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	17	“ For , behold , I create new heavens and a new earth ; and the former shall not be remembered , nor come into mind .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	18	But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create ; for behold , I create Jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	19	And I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in My people ; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	20	There shall be no more thence an infant of days , nor an old man that hath not filled his days ; for the child shall die a hundred years old ; but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	21	And they shall build houses and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	22	They shall not build and another inhabit ; they shall not plant and another eat ; for as the days of a tree are the days of My people , and Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	23	They shall not labor in vain , nor bring forth for trouble ; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord , and their offspring with them .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	24	And it shall come to pass , that before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
KJ21	Isaiah	65	25	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together , and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock ; and dust shall be the serpent ’ s meat . They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain , ” saith the Lord . ”
KJ21	Isaiah	66	66	Thus saith the Lord , “ The heaven is My throne , and the earth is My footstool . Where is the house that ye build unto Me ? And where is the place of My rest ?
KJ21	Isaiah	66	2	For all those things hath Mine hand made , and all those things have been , ” saith the Lord . “ But to this man will I look : even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit , and trembleth at My word .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	3	“ He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man ; he that sacrificeth a lamb , as if he cut off a dog ’ s neck ; he that offereth an oblation , as if he offered swine ’ s blood ; he that burneth incense , as if he blessed an idol— yea , they have chosen their own ways , and their soul delighteth in their abominations .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	4	I also will choose their delusions , and will bring their fears upon them , because when I called , none did answer , when I spoke , they did not hear ; but they did evil before Mine eyes and chose that in which I delighted not. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	66	5	Hear the word of the Lord , ye that tremble at His word : “ Your brethren that hated you , that cast you out for My name ’ s sake , said , ‘ Let the Lord be glorified , when He shall appear to your joy ’ ; and they shall be ashamed. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	66	6	A voice of noise from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompense to His enemies .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	7	“ Before she travailed , she brought forth ; before her pain came , she was delivered of a manchild .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	8	Who hath heard such a thing ? Who hath seen such things ? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day ? Or shall a nation be born at once ? For as soon as Zion travailed , she brought forth her children .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	9	Shall I bring to birth and not cease to bring forth ? ” saith the Lord . “ Shall I cause to bring forth , and shut the womb ? ” saith thy God .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	10	“ Rejoice ye with Jerusalem , and be glad with her , all ye that love her ; rejoice for joy with her , all ye that mourn for her ;
KJ21	Isaiah	66	11	that ye may suck , and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations ; that ye may milk out , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. ”
KJ21	Isaiah	66	12	For thus saith the Lord , “ Behold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream ; then shall ye suck , ye shall be borne upon her sides , and be dandled upon her knees .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	13	As one whom his mother comforteth , so will I comfort you ; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	14	And when ye see this , your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like an herb ; and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward His servants , and His indignation toward His enemies .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	15	For behold , the Lord will come with fire , and with His chariots like a whirlwind , to render His anger with fury and His rebuke with flames of fire .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	16	For by fire and by His sword will the Lord plead with all flesh ; and the slain of the Lord shall be many .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	17	“ They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst , eating swine ’ s flesh and the abomination and the mouse , shall be consumed together , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	18	“ For I know their works and their thoughts . It shall come that I will gather all nations and tongues , and they shall come and see My glory .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	19	And I will set a sign among them , and I will send those of them who escape unto the nations : to Tarshish , Pul , and Lud who draw the bow , to Tubal , and Javan , to the isles afar off who have not heard My fame , neither have seen My glory ; and they shall declare My glory among the Gentiles .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	20	And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all nations , upon horses and in chariots and in litters , and upon mules and upon swift beasts , to My holy mountain Jerusalem , ” saith the Lord , “ as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	21	And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	22	“ For as the new heavens and the new earth , which I will make , shall remain before me , ” saith the Lord , “ so shall your seed and your name remain .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	23	And it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another , and from one Sabbath to another , shall all flesh come to worship before Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Isaiah	66	24	“ And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me ; “ for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be quenched ; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	2	to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	3	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah , king of Judah , unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month .
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	4	Then the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	5	“ Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee , and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee , and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	6	Then said I , “ Ah , Lord God ! Behold , I can not speak , for I am a child. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	7	But the Lord said unto me , “ Say not , ‘ I am a child , ’ for thou shalt go to all whom I shall send thee , and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak .
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	8	Be not afraid of their faces , for I am with thee to deliver thee , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	9	Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth . And the Lord said unto me , “ Behold , I have put My words in thy mouth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	10	See , I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down , and to destroy and to throw down , to build and to plant. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	11	Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying , “ Jeremiah , what seest thou ? ” And I said , “ I see a rod of an almond tree. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	12	Then said the Lord unto me , “ Thou hast well seen , for I will hasten My word to perform it. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	13	And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time , saying , “ What seest thou ? ” And I said , “ I see a seething pot , and the face thereof is toward the north. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	14	Then the Lord said unto me , “ Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	15	For lo , I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north , ” saith the Lord ; “ and they shall come and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all the walls thereof round about , and against all the cities of Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	16	And I will utter My judgments against them concerning all their wickedness , who have forsaken Me , and have burned incense unto other gods , and worshiped the works of their own hands .
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	17	Thou therefore gird up thy loins , and arise and speak unto them all that I command thee . Be not dismayed at their faces , lest I confound thee before them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	18	For behold , I have made thee this day a fortified city , and an iron pillar , and brazen walls against the whole land — against the kings of Judah , against the princes thereof , against the priests thereof , and against the people of the land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	1	19	And they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee , for I am with thee , ” saith the Lord , “ to deliver thee . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	2	“ Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : “ ‘ I remember thee , the kindness of thy youth , the love of thine espousals , when thou wentest after Me in the wilderness , in a land that was not sown .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	3	Israel was holiness unto the Lord , and the firstfruits of His increase . All that devour him shall offend ; evil shall come upon them , ’ ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	4	Hear ye the word of the Lord , O house of Jacob , and all the families of the house of Israel .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	5	Thus saith the Lord : “ What iniquity have your fathers found in Me , that they are gone far from Me , and have walked after vanity , and have become vain ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	6	Neither said they , ‘ Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , that led us through the wilderness , through a land of deserts and of pits , through a land of drought and of the shadow of death , through a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt ? ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	7	And I brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof ; but when ye entered , ye defiled My land and made Mine heritage an abomination .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	8	The priests said not , ‘ Where is the Lord ? ’ And they that handle the law knew Me not ; the pastors also transgressed against Me ; and the prophets prophesied by Baal , and walked after things that do not profit .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	9	“ Therefore I will yet plead with you , ” saith the Lord , “ and with your children ’ s children will I plead .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	10	For pass over to the isles of Chittim and see ; and send unto Kedar and consider diligently , and see if there be such a thing .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	11	Hath a nation changed their gods , which are yet no gods ? But My people have changed their Glory for that which doth not profit .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	12	Be astonished , O ye heavens , at this , and be horribly afraid ; be ye very desolate , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	13	“ For My people have committed two evils : They have forsaken Me , the fountain of living waters , and hewn them out cisterns—broken cisterns that can hold no water .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	14	“ Is Israel a servant ? Is he a homeborn slave ? Why is he despoiled ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	15	The young lions roared at him and yelled , and they made his land waste ; his cities are burned without inhabitant .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	16	Also the children of Noph and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	17	Hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God when He led thee by the way ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	18	And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of Sihor ? Or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria , to drink the waters of the river ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	19	Thine own wickedness shall correct thee , and thy backslidings shall reprove thee . Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God , and that the fear of Me is not in thee , ” saith the Lord God of hosts .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	20	“ For of olden time I have broken thy yoke and burst thy bonds ; and thou saidst , ‘ I will not transgress , ’ when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest , playing the harlot .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	21	Yet I had planted thee , a noble vine , wholly a right seed . How then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto Me ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	22	For though thou wash thee with soda and take thee much soap , yet thine iniquity is marked before Me , ” saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	23	“ How canst thou say , ‘ I am not polluted ; I have not gone after the Baalim ’ ? See thy way in the valley ; know what thou hast done . Thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	24	a wild ass used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure . In her need who can turn her away ? All they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	25	Withhold thy foot from being unshod , and thy throat from thirst . But thou saidst , ‘ There is no hope ; no , for I have loved strangers , and after them will I go. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	26	“ As the thief is ashamed when he is found , so is the house of Israel ashamed—they , their kings , their princes , and their priests and their prophets ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	27	saying to a stock , ‘ Thou art my father , ’ and to a stone , ‘ Thou hast brought me forth. ’ For they have turned their back unto Me , and not their face ; but in the time of their trouble they will say , ‘ Arise , and save us ! ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	28	But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee ? Let them arise if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble ; for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods , O Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	29	“ Why will ye plead with Me ? Ye all have transgressed against Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	30	“ In vain have I smitten your children ; they received no correction . Your own sword hath devoured your prophets like a destroying lion .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	31	O generation , see ye the word of the Lord ! Have I been a wilderness unto Israel ? A land of darkness ? Why say My people , ‘ We are lords ; we will come no more unto Thee ’ ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	32	Can a maid forget her ornaments , or a bride her attire ? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	33	Why readiest thou thy way to seek love ? Therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	34	Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents ; I have not found it by secret search , but upon all these .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	35	Yet thou sayest , ‘ Because I am innocent , surely His anger shall turn from me. ’ Behold , I will plead with thee because thou sayest , ‘ I have not sinned. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	36	Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way ? Thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt as thou wast ashamed of Assyria .
KJ21	Jeremiah	2	37	Yea , thou shalt go forth from him with thine hands upon thine head ; for the Lord hath rejected thy confidences , and thou shalt not prosper in them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	3	Therefore the showers have been withheld , and there hath been no latter rain . And thou had a whore ’ s forehead ; thou refused to be ashamed .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	2	“ Lift up thine eyes unto the high places , and see where hast thou not been lain with . By the wayside hast thou sat for them , as the Arabian in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	4	Wilt thou not from this time cry unto Me , ‘ My Father , Thou art the guide of my youth ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	5	Will He reserve His anger for ever ? Will He keep it to the end ? ’ Behold , thou hast spoken , and done evil things as thou couldest. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	6	The Lord said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king : “ Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done ? She hath gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree , and there hath played the harlot .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	7	And I said after she had done all these things , ‘ Return thou unto Me. ’ But she returned not , and her treacherous sister Judah saw it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	8	And I saw that for all the causes for which backsliding Israel committed adultery , I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce ; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not , but went and played the harlot also .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	9	And it came to pass , because she made so light of her whoredom , that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	10	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto Me with her whole heart , but feignedly , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	11	And the Lord said unto me , “ The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	12	Go and proclaim these words toward the north , and say : “ ‘ Return , thou backsliding Israel , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ and I will not cause Mine anger to fall upon you ; for I am merciful , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ and I will not keep anger for ever .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	13	Only acknowledge thine iniquity : that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God , and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree , and ye have not obeyed My voice , ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	14	‘ Turn , O backsliding children , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ for I am married unto you ; and I will take you , one from a city and two from a family , and I will bring you to Zion .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	15	And I will give you pastors according to Mine heart , who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	16	“ And it shall come to pass when ye be multiplied and increased in the land , in those days , ” saith the Lord , “ they shall say no more , ‘ The ark of the covenant of the Lord. ’ Neither shall it come to mind , neither shall they remember it ; neither shall they visit it , neither shall that be done any more .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	17	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord , and all the nations shall be gathered unto it , to the name of the Lord , to Jerusalem ; neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	18	In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	19	“ But I said , ‘ How shall I put thee among the children and give thee a pleasant land , a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations ? ’ And I said , ‘ Thou shalt call Me “ My Father , ” and shalt not turn away from Me. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	20	Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband , so have ye dealt treacherously with Me , O house of Israel , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	21	A voice was heard upon the high places , weeping and supplications of the children of Israel ; for they have perverted their way , and they have forgotten the Lord their God .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	22	“ Return , ye backsliding children , and I will heal your backslidings. ” “ Behold , we come unto Thee , for Thou art the Lord our God .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	23	Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills and from the multitude of mountains . Truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	24	For shame hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth — their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
KJ21	Jeremiah	3	25	We lie down in our shame , and our confusion covereth us ; for we have sinned against the Lord our God , we and our fathers , from our youth even unto this day , and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	4	Circumcise yourselves to the Lord , and take away the foreskins of your heart , ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem , lest My fury come forth like fire , and burn that none can quench it , because of the evil of your doings .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	2	And thou shalt swear , ‘ The Lord liveth , ’ in truth , in judgment , and in righteousness ; and the nations shall bless themselves in Him , and in Him shall they glory. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	3	For thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem : “ Break up your fallow ground , and sow not among thorns .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	5	“ Declare ye in Judah and publish in Jerusalem , and say , ‘ Blow ye the trumpet in the land ! ’ Cry , gather together and say , ‘ Assemble yourselves , and let us go into the fortified cities ! ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	6	Set up the standard toward Zion . Retire , stay not ! For I will bring evil from the north , and a great destruction. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	7	The lion has come up from his thicket , and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way . He has gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate ; and thy cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabitant .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	8	For this , gird you with sackcloth , lament and howl ; for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned back from us .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	9	“ And it shall come to pass at that day , ” saith the Lord , “ that the heart of the king shall perish , and the heart of the princes ; and the priests shall be astonished , and the prophets shall wonder. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	10	Then said I , “ Ah , Lord God ! Surely Thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem , saying , ‘ Ye shall have peace , ’ whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	11	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem : “ A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of My people — not to fan , nor to cleanse —
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	12	even a full wind from those places shall come unto Me . Now also will I give sentence against them. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	13	Behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind . His horses are swifter than eagles ! Woe unto us , for we are despoiled !
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	14	O Jerusalem , wash thine heart from wickedness , that thou mayest be saved . How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	15	For a voice declareth from Dan , and publisheth affliction from Mount Ephraim :
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	16	“ Make ye mention to the nations . Behold , publish against Jerusalem that watchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the cities of Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	17	As keepers of a field are they against her round about , because she hath been rebellious against Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	18	“ Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee : this is thy wickedness , because it is bitter , because it reacheth unto thine heart. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	19	My heart , my heart ! I am pained at my very heart ! My heart maketh a noise in me ; I can not hold my peace , because thou hast heard , O my soul , the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	20	Destruction upon destruction is cried , for the whole land is despoiled ; suddenly are my tents despoiled , and my curtains in a moment .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	21	How long shall I see the standard , and hear the sound of the trumpet ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	22	“ For My people are foolish , they have not known Me ; they are sottish children , and they have no understanding . They are wise to do evil , but to do good they have no knowledge. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	23	I beheld the earth , and lo , it was without form , and void ; and the heavens , and they had no light .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	24	I beheld the mountains , and lo , they trembled , and all the hills moved lightly .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	25	I beheld , and lo , there was no man , and all the birds of the heavens had fled .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	26	I beheld , and lo , the fruitful place was a wilderness , and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord and by His fierce anger .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	27	For thus hath the Lord said : “ The whole land shall be desolate ; yet will I not make a full end .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	28	For this shall the earth mourn , and the heavens above be black , because I have spoken it ; I have purposed it and will not repent , neither will I turn back from it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	29	The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen ; they shall go into thickets and climb up upon the rocks ; every city shall be forsaken , and not a man dwell therein .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	30	And when thou art despoiled , what wilt thou do ? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson , though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold , though thou rendest thy face with painting , in vain shalt thou make thyself fair . Thy lovers will despise thee ; they will seek thy life .
KJ21	Jeremiah	4	31	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail , and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child , the voice of the daughter of Zion that bewaileth herself , that spreadeth her hands , saying , ‘ Woe is me now , for my soul is wearied because of murderers ! ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	5	I will get me unto the great men , and will speak unto them ; for they have known the way of the Lord , and the judgment of their God. ” But these have altogether broken the yoke , and burst the bonds .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	2	And though they say , ‘ The Lord liveth , ’ surely they swear falsely. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	3	O Lord , are not Thine eyes upon the truth ? Thou hast stricken them , but they have not grieved ; Thou hast consumed them , but they have refused to receive correction . They have made their faces harder than a rock ; they have refused to return .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	4	Therefore I said , “ Surely these are poor , they are foolish ; for they know not the way of the Lord , nor the judgment of their God .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	6	Therefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them , and a wolf of the evenings shall despoil them ; a leopard shall watch over their cities . Every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces , because their transgressions are many , and their backslidings are increased .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	7	“ How shall I pardon thee for this ? Thy children have forsaken Me , and sworn by them that are no gods . When I had fed them to the full , they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots ’ houses .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	8	They were as fed horses in the morning ; every one neighed after his neighbor ’ s wife .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	9	Shall I not visit for these things ? ” saith the Lord . “ And shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	10	“ Go ye up upon her walls and destroy , but make not a full end ; take away her battlements , for they are not the Lord ’ S .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	12	They have belied the Lord , and said , “ It is not He ; neither shall evil come upon us , neither shall we see sword nor famine .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	13	And the prophets shall become wind , and the word is not in them ; thus shall it be done unto them. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	14	Therefore , thus saith the Lord God of hosts : “ Because ye speak this word , behold , I will make My words in thy mouth fire , and this people wood , and it shall devour them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	15	Lo , I will bring a nation upon you from afar , O house of Israel , ” saith the Lord . “ It is a mighty nation , it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language thou knowest not , neither understandest what they say .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	16	Their quiver is as an open sepulcher ; they are all mighty men .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	17	And they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread , which thy sons and thy daughters should eat ; they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds ; they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees . They shall impoverish thy fortified cities , wherein thou trusted , with the sword .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	18	“ Nevertheless in those days , ” saith the Lord , “ I will not make a full end with you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	19	And it shall come to pass when ye shall say , ‘ Why doeth the Lord our God all these things unto us ? ’ Then shalt thou answer them , ‘ As ye have forsaken Me and served strange gods in your land , so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	20	“ Declare this in the house of Jacob , and publish it in Judah , saying :
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	21	Hear now this , O foolish people and without understanding , who have eyes and see not , who have ears and hear not :
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	22	Fear ye not Me ? ” saith the Lord . “ Will ye not tremble at My presence , who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree , that it can not pass it ; and though the waves thereof toss themselves , yet can they not prevail ; though they roar , yet can they not pass over it ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	23	But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart ; they have revolted and gone .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	24	Neither say they in their heart , ‘ Let us now fear the Lord our God , who giveth rain , both the former and the latter in his season ; He reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	25	Your iniquities have turned away these things , and your sins have withheld good things from you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	26	For among My people are found wicked men ; they lie in wait as he that setteth snares ; they set a trap , they catch men .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	27	As a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit ; therefore they have become great and have waxed rich .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	28	They have waxed fat , they shine ; yea , they surpass the deeds of the wicked ; they judge not the cause , the cause of the fatherless , yet they prosper ; and the right of the needy do they not judge .
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	29	Shall I not visit for these things ? ” saith the Lord . “ Shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	30	“ An astonishing and horrible thing is committed in the land :
KJ21	Jeremiah	5	31	The prophets prophesy falsely , and the priests bear rule by their means ; and My people love to have it so . And what will ye do in the end thereof ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	6	For thus hath the Lord of hosts said : “ Hew ye down trees , and cast a mound against Jerusalem . This is the city to be visited ; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	2	I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	3	The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her ; they shall pitch their tents against her round about ; they shall feed every one in his place. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	4	“ Prepare ye war against her ! Arise , and let us go up at noon . Woe unto us ! For the day goeth away , for the shadows of the evening are stretched out .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	5	Arise , and let us go by night , and let us destroy her palaces. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	7	As a fountain casteth out her waters , so she casteth out her wickedness . Violence and spoil are heard in her ; before Me continually are grief and wounds .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	8	Be thou instructed , O Jerusalem , lest My soul depart from thee ; lest I make thee desolate , a land not inhabited. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	9	Thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine ; turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	10	To whom shall I speak and give warning , that they may hear ? Behold , their ear is uncircumcised and they can not hearken ; behold , the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach ; they have no delight in it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	11	Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord ; I am weary with holding in . “ I will pour it out upon the children abroad , and upon the assembly of young men together ; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken , the aged with him that is full of days .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	12	And their houses shall be turned unto others , with their fields and wives together ; for I will stretch out My hand upon the inhabitants of the land , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	13	“ For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them , every one is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even unto the priest , every one dealeth falsely .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	14	They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of My people slightingly , saying , ‘ Peace , peace , ’ when there is no peace .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	15	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? Nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush . Therefore they shall fall among them that fall ; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	16	Thus saith the Lord : “ Stand ye in the highways and see , and ask for the old paths , where is the good way ; and walk therein , and ye shall find rest for your souls . But they said , ‘ We will not walk therein. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	17	Also I set watchmen over you , saying , ‘ Hearken to the sound of the trumpet ! ’ But they said , ‘ We will not hearken. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	18	Therefore hear , ye nations , and know , O congregation , what is among them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	19	Hear , O earth : Behold , I will bring evil upon this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not hearkened unto My words nor to My law , but rejected it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	20	To what purpose cometh there to Me incense from Sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices sweet unto Me. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	21	Therefore thus saith the Lord : “ Behold , I will lay stumbling blocks before this people , and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them ; the neighbor and his friend shall perish. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	22	Thus saith the Lord : “ Behold , a people cometh from the north country , and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	23	They shall lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel and have no mercy . Their voice roareth like the sea ; and they ride upon horses set in array as men for war against thee , O daughter of Zion. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	24	We have heard the fame thereof ; our hands wax feeble . Anguish hath taken hold of us , and pain as of a woman in travail .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	25	Go not forth into the field nor walk by the way , for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	26	O daughter of my people , gird thee with sackcloth , and wallow thyself in ashes . Make thee mourning , as for an only son , most bitter lamentation ; for the despoiler shall suddenly come upon us .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	27	“ I have set thee as a tower and a fortress among My people , that thou mayest know and try their way .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	28	They are all grievous revolters , walking with slanders ; they are brass and iron ; they are all corrupters .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	29	The bellows are burned , the lead is consumed by the fire ; the founder melteth in vain , for the wicked are not plucked away .
KJ21	Jeremiah	6	30	Reprobate silver shall men call them , because the Lord hath rejected them . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	7	then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , for ever and ever .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	2	“ Stand in the gate of the Lord ’ S house , and proclaim there this word and say , ‘ Hear the word of the Lord , all ye of Judah , who enter in at these gates to worship the Lord !
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	3	Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Amend your ways and your doings , and I will cause you to dwell in this place .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	4	Trust ye not in lying words , saying , “ The temple of the Lord , the temple of the Lord , the temple of the Lord are these. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	5	For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings , if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	6	if ye oppress not the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , and shed not innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other gods to your hurt ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	8	“ ‘ Behold , ye trust in lying words that can not profit .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	9	Will ye steal , murder , and commit adultery , and swear falsely , and burn incense unto Baal , and walk after other gods whom ye know not ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	10	and come and stand before Me in this house which is called by My name , and say , “ We are delivered ” — to do all these abominations ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	11	Has this house , which is called by My name , become a den of robbers in your eyes ? Behold , even I have seen it , saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	12	“ ‘ But go ye now unto My place which was in Shiloh , where I set My name at the first , and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	13	And now , because ye have done all these works , saith the Lord , and I spoke unto you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not , and I called you , but ye answered not ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	14	therefore will I do unto this house , which is called by My name , wherein ye trust , and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers , as I have done to Shiloh .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	15	And I will cast you out of My sight , as I have cast out all your brethren , even the whole seed of Ephraim. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	16	Therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them , neither make intercession to Me ; for I will not hear thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	17	“ Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	18	The children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods , that they may provoke Me to anger .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	19	Do they provoke Me to anger ? saith the Lord . Do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	20	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Behold , Mine anger and My fury shall be poured out upon this place — upon man and upon beast , and upon the trees of the field , and upon the fruit of the ground ; and it shall burn and shall not be quenched .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	21	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices and eat flesh .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	22	For I spoke not unto your fathers nor commanded them , in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	23	But this thing commanded I them , saying , “ Obey My voice , and I will be your God , and ye shall be My people ; and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you , that it may be well unto you. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	24	But they hearkened not nor inclined their ear , but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart , and went backward and not forward .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	25	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day , I have even sent unto you all My servants the prophets , daily rising up early and sending them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	26	Yet they hearkened not unto Me nor inclined their ear , but hardened their neck ; they did worse than their fathers. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	27	“ Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them , but they will not hearken to thee ; thou shalt also call unto them , but they will not answer thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	28	But thou shalt say unto them , ‘ This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God , nor receiveth correction . Truth has perished and is cut off from their mouth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	29	“ ‘ Cut off thine hair , O Jerusalem , and cast it away , and take up a lamentation on high places ; for the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	30	“ ‘ For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight , saith the Lord . They have set their abominations in the house which is called by My name , to pollute it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	31	And they have built the high places of Tophet , which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire , which I commanded them not , neither came it into My heart .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	32	Therefore behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that it shall no more be called Tophet , nor the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , but the Valley of Slaughter ; for they shall bury in Tophet till there be no place .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	33	And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth ; and none shall frighten them away .
KJ21	Jeremiah	7	34	Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride ; for the land shall be desolate .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	8	“ ‘ How do ye say , “ We are wise , and the law of the Lord is with us ” ? Lo , certainly in vain made he it ; the pen of the scribes is in vain .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	2	And they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven , whom they have loved , and whom they have served , and after whom they have walked , and whom they have sought , and whom they have worshiped . They shall not be gathered nor be buried : they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	3	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family , who remain in all the places whither I have driven them , saith the Lord of hosts. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	4	“ Moreover thou shalt say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : “ ‘ Shall they fall and not arise ? Shall he turn away and not return ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	5	Why then has this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding ? They hold fast deceit , they refuse to return .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	6	I hearkened and heard , but they spoke not aright ; no man repented of his wickedness , saying , “ What have I done ? ” Every one turned to his course , as the horse rusheth into the battle .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	7	Yea , the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times ; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming ; but My people know not the judgment of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	9	The wise men are ashamed ; they are dismayed and taken . Lo , they have rejected the word of the Lord : and what wisdom is in them ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	10	Therefore will I give their wives unto others , and their fields to them that shall inherit them . For every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness ; from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	11	For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people slightingly , saying “ Peace , peace , ” when there is no peace .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	12	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? Nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush . Therefore shall they fall among them that fall ; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down , saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	13	“ ‘ I will surely consume them , saith the Lord . There shall be no grapes on the vine , nor figs on the fig tree , and the leaf shall fade ; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	14	Why do we sit still ? Assemble yourselves , and let us enter into the fortified cities , and let us be silent there . For the Lord our God hath put us to silence , and given us water of gall to drink , because we have sinned against the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	15	We looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of health , and behold , trouble !
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	16	The snorting of His horses was heard from Dan ; the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of His strong ones . For they have come and have devoured the land and all that is in it , the city and those that dwell therein .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	17	“ For behold , I will send serpents , cockatrices , among you , which will not be charmed , and they shall bite you , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	18	When I would comfort myself against sorrow , my heart is faint within me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	19	Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people , because of them that dwell in a far country : “ Is not the Lord in Zion ? Is not her King in her ? ” “ Why have they provoked Me to anger with their graven images and with strange vanities ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	20	“ The harvest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saved ! ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	21	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt ; I am black ; astonishment hath taken hold on me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	8	22	Is there no balm in Gilead ? Is there no physician there ? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	9	Shall I not visit them for these things ? ” saith the Lord . “ Shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	2	Oh , that I had in the wilderness a lodging place for wayfaring men , that I might leave my people , and go from them ! For they are all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	3	“ And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies , but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	4	“ Take ye heed every one of his neighbor , and trust ye not in any brother ; for every brother will utterly supplant , and every neighbor will walk with slanders .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	5	And they will deceive every one his neighbor , and will not speak the truth . They have taught their tongue to speak lies , and weary themselves to commit iniquity .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	6	Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit ; through deceit they refuse to know Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	7	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ Behold , I will melt them and try them ; for how else shall I do for the daughter of My people ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	8	Their tongue is as an arrow shot out ; it speaketh deceit : one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth , but in heart he lieth in wait .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	10	For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing , and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation , because they are burned up , so that none can pass through them ; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle ; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast have fled ; they are gone .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	11	“ And I will make Jerusalem heaps and a den of dragons ; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate , without an inhabitant. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	12	Who is the wise man that may understand this ? And who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken , that he may declare it ? For why has the land perished and burned up like a wilderness , that none passeth through ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	13	And the Lord saith , “ Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them , and have not obeyed My voice , neither walked therein ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	14	but have walked after the imagination of their own heart , and after the Baalim , which their fathers taught them. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	15	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood and give them water of gall to drink .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	16	I will scatter them also among the heathen , whom neither they nor their fathers have known ; and I will send a sword after them till I have consumed them. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	17	Thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ Consider ye , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for skillful women , that they may come .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	18	And let them make haste and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out with waters .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion : ‘ How are we despoiled ! We are greatly confounded , because we have forsaken the land , because our dwellings have cast us out. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	20	Yet hear the word of the Lord , O ye women , and let your ear receive the word of His mouth , and teach your daughters wailing , and every one her neighbor lamentation .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	21	For death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our palaces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	22	Speak , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Even the carcasses of men shall fall as dung upon the open field , and as the handful after the harvestman , and none shall gather them. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	23	Thus saith the Lord : “ Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might ; let not the rich man glory in his riches .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	24	But let him that glorieth glory in this : that he understandeth and knoweth Me , that I am the Lord who exercise lovingkindness , judgment , and righteousness in the earth ; for in these things I delight , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	25	“ Behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that I will punish all them that are circumcised with the uncircumcised—
KJ21	Jeremiah	9	26	Egypt , and Judah , and Edom , and the children of Ammon , and Moab , and all that are in the utmost corners , that dwell in the wilderness . For all these nations are uncircumcised , and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	10	But the Lord is the true God ; He is the living God and an everlasting King . At His wrath the earth shall tremble , and the nations shall not be able to abide His indignation .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	2	Thus saith the Lord : “ Learn not the way of the heathen , and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven ; for the heathen are dismayed at them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	3	For the customs of the people are vain ; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman , with the ax .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	4	They deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	5	They are upright as the palm tree , but speak not ; they must be borne , because they can not go . Be not afraid of them , for they can not do evil , neither also is it in them to do good. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	6	Inasmuch as there is none like unto Thee , O Lord—Thou art great , and Thy name is great in might ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	7	who would not fear Thee , O King of nations ? For to Thee doth it appertain , inasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms , there is none like unto Thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	8	But they are altogether brutish and foolish ; the stock is a doctrine of vanities .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	9	Silver beaten into plates is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder . Blue and purple is their clothing ; they are all the work of skillful men .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	11	“ Thus shall ye say unto them : ‘ The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth , even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	12	He hath made the earth by His power ; He hath established the world by His wisdom , and hath stretched out the heavens by His discretion .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	13	When He uttereth His voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens ; and He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth . He maketh lightning with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	14	Every man is brutish in his knowledge ; every founder is confounded by the graven image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	15	They are vanity and the work of errors ; in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	16	The portion of Jacob is not like them , for He is the Former of all things ; and Israel is the rod of His inheritance ; the Lord of hosts is His name .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	17	Gather up thy wares out of the land , O inhabitant of the fortress .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	18	For thus saith the Lord : “ Behold , I will sling out the inhabitants of the land this once , and will distress them , that they may find it so. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	19	Woe is me for my hurt ! My wound is grievous ; but I said , “ Truly this is a grief , and I must bear it. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	20	My tabernacle is despoiled , and all my cords are broken ; my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more ; there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	21	For the pastors are become brutish , and have not sought the Lord ; therefore they shall not prosper , and all their flocks shall be scattered .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	22	Behold , the noise of the clamor is come , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the cities of Judah desolate , and a den of dragons .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	23	O Lord , I know that the way of man is not in himself ; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	24	O Lord , correct me , but with judgment , not in Thine anger , lest Thou bring me to nothing .
KJ21	Jeremiah	10	25	Pour out Thy fury upon the heathen that know Thee not , and upon the families that call not on Thy name ; for they have eaten up Jacob , and devoured him and consumed him , and have made his habitation desolate .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	11	Therefore thus saith the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will bring evil upon them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and though they shall cry unto Me , I will not hearken unto them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	2	“ Hear ye the words of this covenant , and speak unto the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	3	and say thou unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	4	which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt from the iron furnace , saying , “ Obey My voice , and do them , according to all which I command you ; so shall ye be My people and I will be your God , ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	5	that I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as it is this day. ’ ” Then answered I , and said , “ So be it , O Lord. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	6	Then the Lord said unto me , “ Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , ‘ Hear ye the words of this covenant and do them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	7	For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , even unto this day , rising early and protesting , saying , “ Obey My voice. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	8	Yet they obeyed not , nor inclined their ear , but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart . Therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant , which I commanded them to do , but they did them not. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	9	And the Lord said unto me , “ A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	10	They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers , who refused to hear My words , and they went after other gods to serve them . The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	12	Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense ; but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	13	For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods , O Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing , even altars to burn incense unto Baal. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	14	“ Therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up a cry or prayer for them ; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto Me for their trouble .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	15	What hath My beloved to do in Mine house , seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many , and the holy flesh is passed from thee ? When thou doest evil , then thou rejoicest .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	16	The Lord called thy name , ‘ A Green Olive Tree , ’ fair and of goodly fruit . With the noise of a great tumult He hath kindled fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	17	For the Lord of hosts , who planted thee , hath pronounced evil against thee for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah , which they have done against themselves to provoke Me to anger in offering incense unto Baal. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	18	And the Lord hath given me knowledge of it , and I know it ; then Thou showed me their doings .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	19	But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter ; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me , saying , “ Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof , and let us cut him off from the land of the living , that his name may be no more remembered. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	20	But , O Lord of hosts , who judgest righteously , who triest the reins and the heart , let me see Thy vengeance on them , for unto Thee have I revealed my cause .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	21	“ Therefore thus saith the Lord of the men of Anathoth , who seek thy life , saying , ‘ Prophesy not in the name of the Lord , that thou die not by our hand ’ —
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	22	therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ Behold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword , their sons and their daughters shall die by famine .
KJ21	Jeremiah	11	23	And there shall be no remnant of them ; for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	12	The despoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness ; for the sword of the Lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land . No flesh shall have peace .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	2	Thou hast planted them , yea , they have taken root ; they grow , yea , they bring forth fruit . Thou art near in their mouth , but far from their reins .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	3	But Thou , O Lord , knowest me ; Thou hast seen me and tried mine heart toward Thee . Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare them for the day of slaughter .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	4	How long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every field wither , for the wickedness of them that dwell therein ? The beasts are consumed , and the birds , because they said , “ He shall not see our last end. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	5	“ If thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee , then how canst thou contend with horses ? And if in the land of peace , wherein thou trusted , they wearied thee , then how wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	6	For even thy brethren and the house of thy father , even they have dealt treacherously with thee ; yea , they have called a multitude after thee ; believe them not , though they speak fair words unto thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	7	“ I have forsaken Mine house , I have left Mine heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of My soul into the hand of her enemies .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	8	Mine heritage is unto Me as a lion in the forest : it crieth out against Me ; therefore have I hated it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	9	Mine heritage is unto Me as a speckled bird : the birds round about are against her . Come ye , assemble all the beasts of the field ; come to devour .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	10	Many pastors have destroyed My vineyard , they have trodden My portion under foot , they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	11	They have made it desolate , and being desolate it mourneth unto Me ; the whole land is made desolate , because no man layeth it to heart .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	13	They have sown wheat , but shall reap thorns ; they have put themselves to pain , but shall not profit ; and they shall be ashamed of your produce because of the fierce anger of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	14	“ Thus saith the Lord against all Mine evil neighbors , who touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit : Behold , I will pluck them out of their land , and pluck out the house of Judah from among them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	15	And it shall come to pass after I have plucked them out , I will return and have compassion on them , and will bring them back , every man to his heritage and every man to his land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	16	And it shall come to pass , if they will diligently learn the ways of My people , to swear by My name , ‘ The Lord liveth , ’ as they taught My people to swear by Baal , then shall they be built in the midst of My people .
KJ21	Jeremiah	12	17	But if they will not obey , I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	13	Then shalt thou say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Behold , I will fill all the inhabitants of this land — even the kings that sit upon David ’ s throne , and the priests , and the prophets , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem — with drunkenness .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	2	So I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord and put it on my loins .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	3	And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	4	“ Take the girdle that thou hast got , which is upon thy loins , and arise , go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates , as the Lord commanded me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	6	And it came to pass after many days , that the Lord said unto me , “ Arise , go to the Euphrates and take the girdle from thence , which I commanded thee to hide there. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	7	Then I went to the Euphrates and dug , and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it ; and behold , the girdle was marred ; it was profitable for nothing .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	8	Then the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	9	“ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ In this manner will I mar the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	10	This evil people , who refuse to hear My words , who walk in the stubbornness of their heart , and walk after other gods to serve them and to worship them , shall even be as this girdle which is good for nothing .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	11	For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man , so have I caused to cleave unto Me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ that they might be unto Me as a people , and as a name , and as praise , and as glory ; but they would not hear. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	12	“ Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word : ‘ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : Every bottle shall be filled with wine. ’ And they shall say unto thee , ‘ Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine ? ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	14	And I will dash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , ’ saith the Lord . ‘ I will not pity , nor spare , nor have mercy , but shall destroy them. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	15	Hear ye , and give ear ; be not proud , for the Lord hath spoken .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	16	Give glory to the Lord your God before He cause darkness , and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains , and , while ye look for light , He turn it into the shadow of death , and make it gross darkness .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	17	But if ye will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride ; and mine eye shall weep sore , and run down with tears , because the Lord ’ s flock is carried away captive .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	18	Say unto the king and to the queen , “ Humble yourselves , sit down ; for your principalities shall come down , even the crown of your glory. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	19	The cities of the South shall be shut up , and none shall open them . Judah shall be carried away captive , all of it ; it shall be wholly carried away captive .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	20	Lift up your eyes , and behold them that come from the north . Where is the flock that was given thee , thy beautiful flock ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	21	What wilt thou say when He shall punish thee ? For thou hast taught them to be captains , and as chief over thee . Shall not sorrows take thee , as a woman in travail ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	22	And if thou say in thine heart , “ Why come these things upon me ? ” —for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered , and thy heels made bare .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin , or the leopard his spots ? Then may ye also do good , that are accustomed to do evil .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	24	“ Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	25	This is thy lot , the portion of thy measures from Me , ” saith the Lord ; “ because thou hast forgotten Me , and trusted in falsehood .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	26	Therefore will I uncover thy skirts upon thy face , that thy shame may appear .
KJ21	Jeremiah	13	27	I have seen thine adulteries and thy neighings , the lewdness of thy whoredom and thine abominations on the hills in the fields . Woe unto thee , O Jerusalem ! Wilt thou not be made clean ? When shall it once be ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	14	Then the Lord said unto me , “ The prophets prophesy lies in My name . I sent them not , neither have I commanded them , neither spoke unto them . They prophesy unto you a false vision and divination , and a thing of nought and the deceit of their heart .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	2	“ Judah mourneth , and the gates thereof languish ; they are black unto the ground , and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	3	And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters ; they came to the pits and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were ashamed and confounded , and covered their heads .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	4	Because the ground is chapped , for there was no rain in the earth , the plowmen were ashamed ; they covered their heads .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	5	Yea , the hind also calved in the field and forsook it , because there was no grass .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	6	And the wild asses stood in the high places ; they snuffed up the wind like dragons ; their eyes failed , because there was no grass. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	7	O Lord , though our iniquities testify against us , do Thou it for Thy name ’ s sake ; for our backslidings are many ; we have sinned against Thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	8	O the Hope of Israel , the Savior thereof in time of trouble , why shouldest Thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	9	Why shouldest Thou be as a man amazed , as a mighty man that can not save ? Yet Thou , O Lord , art in the midst of us , and we are called by Thy name ; leave us not .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	10	Thus saith the Lord unto this people : “ Thus have they loved to wander ; they have not restrained their feet . Therefore the Lord doth not accept them ; He will now remember their iniquity and visit their sins. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	11	Then said the Lord unto me , “ Pray not for this people for their good .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	12	When they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation , I will not accept them ; but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	13	Then said I , “ Ah , Lord God ! Behold , the prophets say unto them , ‘ Ye shall not see the sword , neither shall ye have famine , but I will give you assured peace in this place. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	15	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in My name , whom I sent not , yet they say , ‘ Sword and famine shall not be in this land ’ : By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword ; and they shall have none to bury them — them , their wives , nor their sons , nor their daughters — for I will pour their wickedness upon them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	17	“ Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them : ‘ Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease ; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grievous blow .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	18	If I go forth into the field , then behold , the slain with the sword ! And if I enter into the city , then behold , them that are sick with famine ! Yea , both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	19	Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah ? Hath Thy soul loathed Zion ? Why hast Thou smitten us , and there is no healing for us ? We looked for peace , and there is no good ; and for the time of healing , and behold , trouble !
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	20	We acknowledge , O Lord , our wickedness and the iniquity of our fathers ; for we have sinned against Thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	21	Do not abhor us , for Thy name ’ s sake ; do not disgrace the throne of Thy glory ; remember , break not Thy covenant with us .
KJ21	Jeremiah	14	22	Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain ? Or can the heavens give showers ? Art not Thou He , O Lord our God ? Therefore we will wait upon Thee , for Thou hast made all these things .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	15	O Lord , Thou knowest ; remember me and visit me , and avenge me on my persecutors . Take me not away in Thy longsuffering ; know that for Thy sake I have suffered rebuke .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	2	And it shall come to pass , if they say unto thee , ‘ Whither shall we go forth ? ’ then thou shalt tell them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : “ ‘ Such as are for death , to death ; and such as are for the sword , to the sword ; and such as are for the famine , to the famine ; and such as are for the captivity , to the captivity. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	3	“ And I will appoint over them four kinds , ” saith the Lord : “ the sword to slay , and the dogs to tear , and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	4	And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah , king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	5	“ For who shall have pity upon thee , O Jerusalem ? Or who shall bemoan thee ? Or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	6	Thou hast forsaken Me , ” saith the Lord , “ thou art gone backward ; therefore will I stretch out My hand against thee and destroy thee ; I am weary with repenting .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	7	And I will winnow them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will bereave them of children ; I will destroy My people , since they return not from their ways .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	8	Their widows are increased to Me above the sand of the seas ; I have brought upon them , against the mother of the young men , a despoiler at noonday ; I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly , and terrors upon the city .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	9	She that hath borne seven languisheth ; she hath given up the ghost . Her sun is gone down while it was yet day ; she hath been ashamed and confounded ; and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	10	Woe is me , my mother , that thou hast borne me , a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth ! I have neither lent on usury , nor have men lent to me on usury ; yet every one of them doth curse me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	11	The Lord said , “ Verily it shall be well with thy remnant ; verily I will cause the enemy to deal with thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	12	“ Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	13	Thy substance and thy treasures will I give as the spoil without price , and that for all thy sins , even in all thy borders .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	14	And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not ; for a fire is kindled in Mine anger , which shall burn upon you. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	16	Thy words were found , and I ate them ; and Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart ; for I am called by Thy name , O Lord God of hosts .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	17	I sat not in the assembly of the mockers , nor rejoiced ; I sat alone because of Thy hand , for Thou hast filled me with indignation .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	18	Why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable , which refuseth to be healed ? Wilt Thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as waters that fail ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord : “ If thou return , then will I bring thee back , and thou shalt stand before Me ; and if thou take forth the precious from the vile , thou shalt be as My mouth . Let them return unto thee , but return not thou unto them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	20	And I will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall , and they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee , for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	15	21	“ And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked , and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	16	“ Behold , I will send for many fishers , ” saith the Lord , “ and they shall fish them ; and after will I send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill , and out of the holes of the rocks .
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	2	“ Thou shalt not take thee a wife , neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	3	For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who bore them , and concerning their fathers who begot them in this land :
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	4	“ They shall die of grievous deaths ; they shall not be lamented , neither shall they be buried , but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth . And they shall be consumed by the sword and by famine , and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven and for the beasts of the earth. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	5	For thus saith the Lord : “ Enter not into the house of mourning , neither go to lament nor bemoan them ; for I have taken away My peace from this people , ” saith the Lord , “ even lovingkindness and mercies .
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	6	Both the great and the small shall die in this land . They shall not be buried , neither shall men lament for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	7	Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother .
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	8	Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and to drink. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	9	For thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Behold , I will cause to cease out of this place , in your eyes and in your days , the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride .
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	10	“ And it shall come to pass , when thou shalt show this people all these words , and they shall say unto thee , ‘ Why hath the Lord pronounced all this great evil against us ? Or what is our iniquity ? Or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God ? ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	11	Then shalt thou say unto them , ‘ Because your fathers have forsaken Me , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ and have walked after other gods and have served them , and have worshiped them , and have forsaken Me , and have not kept My law .
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	12	And ye have done worse than your fathers , for behold , ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart , that they may not hearken unto Me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	13	Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not , neither ye nor your fathers ; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night , where I will not show you favor. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	14	“ Therefore behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that it shall no more be said , ‘ The Lord liveth who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt , ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	15	but , ‘ the Lord liveth who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north , and from all the lands whither He had driven them. ’ And I will bring them back into their land that I gave unto their fathers .
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	17	For Mine eyes are upon all their ways . They are not hid from My face , neither is their iniquity hid from Mine eyes .
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	18	And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double , because they have defiled My land ; they have filled Mine inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	19	O Lord , my strength and my fortress , and my refuge in the day of affliction , the Gentiles shall come unto Thee from the ends of the earth and shall say , “ Surely our fathers have inherited lies , vanity , and things wherein there is no profit. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	20	Shall a man make gods unto himself , and they are no gods ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	16	21	“ Therefore behold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know Mine hand and My might ; and they shall know that My name is the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	17	Be not a terror unto me ; Thou art my hope in the day of evil .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	2	whilst their children remember their altars and their wooden idols by the green trees upon the high hills .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	3	O My mountain in the field , I will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil , and thy high places for sin throughout all thy borders .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	4	And thou , even thyself , shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee ; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not ; for ye have kindled a fire in Mine anger which shall burn for ever. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	5	Thus saith the Lord : “ Cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm , and whose heart departeth from the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	6	For he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good cometh , but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	7	“ Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord , and whose hope the Lord is .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	8	For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters , and that spreadeth out her roots by the river , and shall not see when heat cometh , but her leaf shall be green ; and shall not be disquieted in the year of drought , neither shall cease from yielding fruit. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	9	The heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked ; who can know it ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	10	“ I , the Lord , search the heart ; I try the reins , even to give every man according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	11	As the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not , so he that getteth riches , and not by right , shall leave them in the midst of his days , and at his end shall be a fool .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	12	A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	13	O Lord , the hope of Israel , all that forsake Thee shall be ashamed . “ And they that depart from Me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken the Lord , the fountain of living waters. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	14	Heal me , O Lord , and I shall be healed ; save me , and I shall be saved ; for Thou art my praise .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	15	Behold , they say unto me , “ Where is the word of the Lord ? Let it come now. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	16	As for me , I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow Thee ; neither have I desired the woeful day , Thou knowest ; that which came out of my lips was right before Thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	18	Let them be confounded that persecute me , but let not me be confounded ; let them be dismayed , but let not me be dismayed . Bring upon them the day of evil , and destroy them with double destruction .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	19	Thus said the Lord unto me : “ Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people , whereby the kings of Judah come in and by which they go out , and in all the gates of Jerusalem ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	20	and say unto them , ‘ Hear ye the word of the Lord , ye kings of Judah and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem that enter in by these gates .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	21	Thus saith the Lord : Take heed for yourselves , and bear no burden on the Sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	22	neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day , neither do ye any work , but hallow ye the Sabbath day , as I commanded your fathers .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	23	But they obeyed not , neither inclined their ear , but made their neck stiff , that they might not hear nor receive instruction .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	24	“ ‘ And it shall come to pass , if ye diligently hearken unto Me , saith the Lord , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day , but hallow the Sabbath day to do no work therein ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	25	then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , they and their princes , the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and this city shall remain for ever .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	26	And they shall come from the cities of Judah , and from the places about Jerusalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the plain , and from the mountains , and from the South , bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices , and meat offerings and incense , and bringing sacrifices of praise unto the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	17	27	But if ye will not hearken unto Me to hallow the Sabbath day , and not to bear a burden , even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day , then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof , and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem , and it shall not be quenched . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	18	Then said they , “ Come , and let us devise devices against Jeremiah ; for the law shall not perish from the priest , nor counsel from the wise , nor the word from the prophet . Come , and let us smite him with the tongue , and let us not give heed to any of his words. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	2	“ Arise and go down to the potter ’ s house , and there I will cause thee to hear My words. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	3	Then I went down to the potter ’ s house , and behold , he wrought a work on the wheels .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	4	And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter ; so he made it again another vessel , as it seemed good to the potter to make it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	5	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	6	“ O house of Israel , can not I do with you as this potter ? ” saith the Lord . “ Behold , as the clay is in the potter ’ s hand , so are ye in Mine hand , O house of Israel .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	7	At the instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	8	if that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	9	And at the instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant it ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	10	if it do evil in My sight , that it obey not My voice , then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	11	Now therefore go to speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Behold , I frame evil against you and devise a device against you . Return ye now every one from his evil way , and make your ways and your doings good. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	12	And they said , “ There is no hope ; but we will walk after our own devices , and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	13	Therefore thus saith the Lord : “ Ask ye now among the heathen : Who hath heard such things ? The virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	14	Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field ? Or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	15	Because My people hath forgotten Me , they have burned incense to vanity ; and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths , to walk in paths , on a road not cast up ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	16	to make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished , and wag his head .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	17	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will show them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	19	Give heed to me , O Lord , and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	20	Shall evil be recompensed for good ? For they have dug a pit for my soul . Remember that I stood before Thee to speak good for them , and to turn away Thy wrath from them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	21	Therefore deliver up their children to the famine , and pour out their blood by the force of the sword ; and let their wives be bereaved of their children and be widows ; and let their men be put to death ; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	22	Let a cry be heard from their houses , when Thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them ; for they have dug a pit to take me , and hid snares for my feet .
KJ21	Jeremiah	18	23	Yet , Lord , Thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me ; forgive not their iniquity , neither blot out their sin from Thy sight , but let them be overthrown before Thee ; deal thus with them in the time of Thine anger .
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	19	Thus saith the Lord : “ Go and get a potter ’ s earthen bottle , and take some of the elders of the people and the elders of the priests .
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	2	And go forth unto the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , which is by the entry of the East Gate , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	3	and say , ‘ Hear ye the word of the Lord , O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem . Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , of which whosoever heareth , his ears shall tingle .
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	4	Because they have forsaken Me and have estranged this place , and have burned incense in it unto other gods , whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have known , and have filled this place with the blood of innocents .
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	5	They have built also the high places of Baal , to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal , which I commanded not nor spoke it , neither came it into My mind .
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	6	Therefore behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that this place shall no more be called Tophet , nor the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , but the Valley of Slaughter .
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	7	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place , and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives ; and their carcasses will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	8	And I will make this city desolate and a hissing . Every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss , because of all the plagues thereof .
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	9	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters , and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straits with which their enemies and they that seek their lives shall straiten them. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	10	“ Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	11	and shalt say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : Even so will I break this people and this city , as one breaketh a potter ’ s vessel that can not be made whole again ; and they shall bury them in Tophet till there be no place to bury .
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	12	Thus will I do unto this place , saith the Lord , and to the inhabitants thereof , and even make this city as Tophet .
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	13	And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled as the place of Tophet , because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven , and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	14	Then came Jeremiah from Tophet , whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of the Lord ’ S house and said to all the people ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	19	15	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ Behold , I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it , because they have hardened their necks , that they might not hear My words . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	20	Now Pashhur the son of Immer the priest , who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord , heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	2	Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the High Gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	3	And it came to pass on the morrow that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks . Then said Jeremiah unto him , “ The Lord hath not called thy name Pashhur , but Magormissabib [ that is , Fear round about ] .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	4	For thus saith the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends ; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies , and thine eyes shall behold it ; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall carry them captive into Babylon and shall slay them with the sword .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	5	Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city and all the labors thereof , and all the precious things thereof , and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies , who shall despoil them and take them and carry them to Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	6	And thou , Pashhur , and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity ; and thou shalt come to Babylon , and there thou shalt die and shalt be buried there , thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied lies. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	7	O Lord , Thou hast deceived me , and I was deceived ; Thou art stronger than I , and hast prevailed . I am in derision daily ; every one mocketh me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	8	For when I spoke , I cried out ; I cried , “ Violence and despoliation ! ” because the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me and a derision daily .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	9	Then I said , “ I will not make mention of Him , nor speak any more in His name. ” But His word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones ; and I was weary with forbearing , and I could not hold back .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	10	For I heard the defaming of many , fear on every side . “ Report , ” say they , “ and we will report it ! ” All in my company watched for my halting , saying , “ Perhaps he will be enticed , and we shall prevail against him ; and we shall take our revenge on him. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	11	But the Lord is with me as a mighty , fearsome one ; therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail . They shall be greatly ashamed , for they shall not prosper ; their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	12	But , O Lord of hosts , who triest the righteous and seest the reins and the heart , let me see Thy vengeance on them , for unto Thee have I opened my cause .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	13	Sing unto the Lord , praise ye the Lord ; for He hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	14	Cursed be the day wherein I was born ; let not the day wherein my mother bore me be blessed .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	15	Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father , saying , “ A manchild is born unto thee , ” making him very glad .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	16	And let that man be as the cities which the Lord overthrew , and repented not ; and let him hear the cry in the morning and the shouting at noontide ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	17	because he slew me not from the womb , or that my mother might have been my grave , and her womb to be always great with me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	20	18	Why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow , that my days should be consumed with shame ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	21	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent unto him Pashhur the son of Melchiah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	2	“ Inquire , I pray thee , of the Lord for us ( for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us ) , if so it be that the Lord will deal with us according to all His wondrous works , that he may go up from us. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	3	Then said Jeremiah unto them , “ Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	4	‘ Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : Behold , I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands , wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans , who besiege you outside the walls ; and I will assemble them into the midst of this city .
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	5	And I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger and in fury and in great wrath .
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	6	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast ; they shall die of a great pestilence .
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	7	And afterward , saith the Lord , I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah , and his servants and the people and such as are left in this city from the pestilence , from the sword , and from the famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those that seek their life . And he shall smite them with the edge of the sword ; he shall not spare them , neither have pity nor have mercy. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	8	“ And unto this people thou shalt say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Behold , I set before you the way of life and the way of death .
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	9	He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence ; but he that goeth out and falleth to the Chaldeans who besiege you , he shall live , and his life shall be unto him as a prey .
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	10	For I have set My face against this city for evil and not for good , saith the Lord . It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	11	“ And concerning the house of the king of Judah , say , ‘ Hear ye the word of the Lord ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	12	O house of David . Thus saith the Lord : “ ‘ Execute judgment in the morning , and deliver him that is despoiled out of the hand of the oppressor , lest My fury go out like fire and burn , that none can quench it , because of the evil of your doings .
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	13	Behold , I am against thee , O inhabitant of the valley and rock of the plain , saith the Lord , who say , “ Who shall come down against us ? Or who shall enter into our habitations ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	21	14	But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , saith the Lord ; and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof , and it shall devour all things round about it . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	22	The wind shall eat up all thy pastors , and thy lovers shall go into captivity ; surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	2	and say , ‘ Hear the word of the Lord , O king of Judah , who sittest upon the throne of David , thou and thy servants and thy people who enter in by these gates .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	3	Thus saith the Lord : Execute ye judgment and righteousness , and deliver the despoiled out of the hand of the oppressor , and do no wrong . Do no violence to the stranger , the fatherless nor the widow , neither shed innocent blood in this place .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	4	For if ye do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , he and his servants and his people .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	5	But if ye will not hear these words , I swear by Myself , saith the Lord , that this house shall become a desolation. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	6	For thus saith the Lord unto the king ’ s house of Judah : “ Thou art Gilead unto Me , and the head of Lebanon ; yet surely I will make thee a wilderness , and cities which are not inhabited .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	7	And I will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons ; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them into the fire .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	8	“ And many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbor , ‘ Why hath the Lord done thus unto this great city ? ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	9	Then they shall answer , ‘ Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God , and worshiped other gods and served them. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	10	Weep ye not for the dead , neither bemoan him , but weep sore for him that goeth away ; for he shall return no more , or see his native country .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	11	For thus saith the Lord concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah , who reigned instead of Josiah his father , who went forth out of this place : “ He shall not return thither any more ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	12	but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive and shall see this land no more .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	13	“ Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong , that useth his neighbor ’ s service without wages , and giveth him nought for his work ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	14	that saith , ‘ I will build me a wide house and large chambers , and cutteth him out windows , and it is ceiled with cedar and painted with vermilion. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	15	Shalt thou reign because thou enclosest thyself in cedar ? Did not thy father eat and drink , and do judgment and justice , and then it was well with him ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy ; then it was well with him . Was not this to know Me ? ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	17	“ But thine eyes and thine heart are for nothing but thy covetousness and to shed innocent blood , and for oppression and for violence. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	18	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah : “ They shall not lament for him , saying , ‘ Ah , my brother ! ’ or , ‘ Ah , sister ! ’ They shall not lament for him , saying , ‘ Ah , lord ! ’ or , ‘ Ah , his glory ! ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	19	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	20	“ Go up to Lebanon and cry , and lift up thy voice in Bashan , and cry from the Abarim ; for all thy lovers are destroyed .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	21	I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity , but thou saidst , ‘ I will not hear. ’ This hath been thy manner from thy youth , that thou obeyedst not My voice .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	23	O inhabitant of Lebanon , that makest thy nest in the cedars , how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee , the pain as of a woman in travail ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	24	“ As I live , ” saith the Lord , “ though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , were the signet upon My right hand , yet would I pluck thee thence ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	25	and I will give thee into the hand of those who seek thy life , and into the hand of those whose face thou fearest , even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of the Chaldeans .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	26	And I will cast thee out , and thy mother who bore thee , into another country where ye were not born , and there shall ye die .
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	27	But to the land whereunto they desire to return , thither shall they not return. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	28	Is this man Coniah a despised , broken idol ? Is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure ? Why are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	29	O earth , earth , earth , hear the word of the Lord !
KJ21	Jeremiah	22	30	Thus saith the Lord : “ Write ye this man as childless , a man that shall not prosper in his days ; for no man of his seed shall prosper , sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	23	“ Am I a God at hand , ” saith the Lord , “ and not a God afar off ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	2	Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that feed My people : “ Ye have scattered My flock and driven them away , and have not visited them . Behold , I will visit upon you the evil of your doings , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	3	“ And I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all countries whither I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	4	And I will set up shepherds over them who shall feed them ; and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall they be lacking , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	5	“ Behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch ; and a King shall reign and prosper , and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	6	In His days Judah shall be saved , and Israel shall dwell safely ; and this is His name whereby He shall be called : The Lord Our Righteousness .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	7	“ Therefore , behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that they shall no more say , ‘ The Lord liveth who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt , ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	8	but , ‘ the Lord liveth who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country , and from all countries whither I had driven them. ’ And they shall dwell in their own land. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	9	Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets ; all my bones shake . I am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath overcome , because of the Lord and because of the words of His holiness .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	10	For the land is full of adulterers ; for because of cursing the land mourneth ; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up , and their course is evil , and their force is not right .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	11	“ For both prophet and priest are profane ; yea , in My house have I found their wickedness , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	12	“ Therefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness ; they shall be driven on , and fall therein ; for I will bring evil upon them , even the year of their visitation , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	13	“ And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria : They prophesied in Baal and caused My people Israel to err .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	14	I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing : They commit adultery and walk in lies ; they strengthen also the hands of evildoers , that none doth return from his wickedness . They are all of them unto Me as Sodom , and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	15	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets : “ Behold , I will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink the water of gall ; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	16	Thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you . They make you vain ; they speak a vision of their own heart , and not out of the mouth of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	17	They say still unto them that despise Me , ‘ The Lord hath said , “ Ye shall have peace. ” ’ And they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart , ‘ No evil shall come upon you. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	18	For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord , and hath perceived and heard His word ? Who hath marked His word and heard it ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	19	Behold , a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury , even a grievous whirlwind ; it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	20	The anger of the Lord shall not return , until He has executed and till He has performed the thoughts of His heart ; in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	21	“ I have not sent these prophets , yet they ran ; I have not spoken to them , yet they prophesied .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	22	But if they had stood in My counsel and had caused My people to hear My words , then they should have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	24	Can any hide himself in secret places , that I shall not see him ? ” saith the Lord . “ Do not I fill heaven and earth ? ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	25	“ I have heard what the prophets said who prophesy lies in My name , saying , ‘ I have dreamed , I have dreamed. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	26	How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies ? Yea , they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	27	who think to cause My people to forget My name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor , as their fathers have forgotten My name for Baal .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	28	The prophet that hath a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he that hath My word , let him speak My word faithfully . What is the chaff to the wheat ? ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	29	“ Is not My word like as a fire ? ” saith the Lord , “ and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	30	“ Therefore behold , I am against the prophets , ” saith the Lord , “ that steal My words every one from his neighbor .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	31	Behold , I am against the prophets , ” saith the Lord , “ that use their tongues and say , ‘ He saith. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	32	Behold , I am against them that prophesy false dreams , ” saith the Lord , “ and do tell them , and cause My people to err by their lies and by their lightness ; yet I sent them not , nor commanded them . Therefore they shall not profit this people at all , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	33	“ And when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask thee , saying , ‘ What is the burden of the Lord ? ’ thou shalt then say unto them , ‘ What burden ? I will even forsake you , saith the Lord. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	34	And as for the prophet and the priest and the people who shall say , ‘ The burden of the Lord , ’ I will even punish that man and his house .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	35	Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother , ‘ What hath the Lord answered ? ’ and , ‘ What hath the Lord spoken ? ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	36	And the burden of the Lord shall ye mention no more , for every man ’ s word shall be his burden ; for ye have perverted the words of the living God , of the Lord of hosts our God .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	37	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet , ‘ What hath the Lord answered thee ? ’ and , ‘ What hath the Lord spoken ? ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	38	But since ye say , ‘ The burden of the Lord , ’ therefore thus saith the Lord : Because ye say this word , ‘ The burden of the Lord , ’ and I have sent unto you , saying , ‘ Ye shall not say : The burden of the Lord , ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	39	therefore behold , I , even I , will utterly forget you , and I will forsake you and the city that I gave you and your fathers , and cast you out of My presence .
KJ21	Jeremiah	23	40	And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you , and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	24	24	The Lord showed me , and behold , two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the Lord , after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and the princes of Judah , with the carpenters and smiths , from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	24	2	One basket had very good figs , even like the figs that are first ripe ; and the other basket had very bad figs , which could not be eaten they were so bad .
KJ21	Jeremiah	24	3	Then said the Lord unto me , “ What seest thou , Jeremiah ? ” And I said , “ Figs : the good figs , very good ; and the evil , very evil , that can not be eaten they are so evil. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	24	4	Again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	24	5	“ Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel : ‘ Like these good figs , so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good .
KJ21	Jeremiah	24	6	For I will set Mine eyes upon them for good , and I will bring them again to this land ; and I will build them and not pull them down , and I will plant them and not pluck them up .
KJ21	Jeremiah	24	7	And I will give them a heart to know Me , that I am the Lord ; and they shall be My people , and I will be their God ; for they shall return unto Me with their whole heart .
KJ21	Jeremiah	24	8	“ ‘ And as the evil figs , which can not be eaten they are so evil ’ ” — surely thus saith the Lord — “ ‘ so will I deem Zedekiah the king of Judah , and his princes , and the residue of Jerusalem who remain in this land , and them that dwell in the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Jeremiah	24	9	And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt , to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse in all places whither I shall drive them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	24	10	And I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence among them till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	25	and all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of the Medes ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	2	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying :
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	3	From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , even unto this day ( that is , the three and twentieth year ) , the word of the Lord hath come unto me , and I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hearkened .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	4	And the Lord hath sent unto you all His servants the prophets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hearkened , nor inclined your ear to hear .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	5	They said , “ Turn ye again now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings , and dwell in the land that the Lord hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	6	And go not after other gods to serve them and to worship them , and provoke Me not to anger with the works of your hands ; and I will do you no hurt .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	7	Yet ye have not hearkened unto Me , ” saith the Lord , “ that ye might provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	8	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ Because ye have not heard My words ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	9	behold , I will send and take all the families of the north , ” saith the Lord , “ and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , My servant , and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof , and against all these nations round about , and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and a hissing and perpetual desolations .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	10	Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones and the light of the candle .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	11	And this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment , and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	12	And it shall come to pass , when seventy years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation , ” saith the Lord , “ for their iniquity , and the land of the Chaldeans , and will make it perpetual desolations .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	13	And I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	14	For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves by them also ; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	15	For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me : “ Take the wine cup of this fury at My hand , and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	16	And they shall drink and be moved , and be mad because of the sword that I will send among them. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	17	Then took I the cup at the Lord ’ S hand , and made all the nations to drink , unto whom the Lord had sent me ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	18	to wit : Jerusalem and the cities of Judah , and the kings thereof and the princes thereof , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , a hissing and a curse , as it is this day ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	19	Pharaoh king of Egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	20	and all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of Uz , and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Gaza , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	21	Edom , and Moab , and the children of Ammon ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	22	and all the kings of Tyre , and all the kings of Sidon , and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	23	Dedan , and Tema , and Buz , and all that are in the utmost corners ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	24	and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	26	and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdoms of the world which are upon the face of the earth ; and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	27	“ Therefore thou shalt say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Drink ye and be drunken , and spew and fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which I will send among you. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	28	And it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink , then shalt thou say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : Ye shall certainly drink .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	29	For lo , I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by My name . And should ye be utterly unpunished ? Ye shall not be unpunished , for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth , saith the Lord of hosts. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	30	“ Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words , and say unto them : “ ‘ The Lord shall roar from on high , and utter His voice from His holy habitation ; He shall mightily roar upon His habitation ; He shall give a shout , as they that tread the grapes , against all the inhabitants of the earth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	31	A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth , for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations . He will plead with all flesh ; He will give them that are wicked to the sword , ’ ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	32	Thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ Behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	33	And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth . They shall not be lamented , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be dung upon the ground .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	34	Howl , ye shepherds , and cry ; and wallow yourselves in the ashes , ye leaders of the flock ; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished , and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	35	And the shepherds shall have no way to flee , nor the leaders of the flock to escape .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	36	A voice of the cry of the shepherds , and a howling of the leaders of the flock shall be heard ; for the Lord hath despoiled their pasture .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	37	And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	25	38	He hath forsaken His covert as the lion ; for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the Oppressor , and because of His fierce anger .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	26	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word from the Lord , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	2	“ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Stand in the court of the Lord ’ S house , and speak unto all the cities of Judah , which come to worship in the Lord ’ S house , all the words that I command thee to speak unto them ; diminish not a word .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	3	It may so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent Me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	4	And thou shalt say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : If ye will not hearken to Me , to walk in My law which I have set before you ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	5	to hearken to the words of My servants the prophets whom I sent unto you , both rising up early and sending them , but ye have not hearkened—
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	6	then will I make this house like Shiloh , and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	7	So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	8	Now it came to pass , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him , saying , “ Thou shalt surely die !
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	9	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the Lord , saying , ‘ This house shall be like Shiloh , and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant ’ ? ” And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	10	When the princes of Judah heard these things , then they came up from the king ’ s house unto the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the New Gate of the Lord ’ S house .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	11	Then spoke the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people , saying , “ This man is worthy to die ; for he hath prophesied against this city , as ye have heard with your ears. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	12	Then spoke Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people , saying , “ The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	13	Therefore now amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of the Lord your God ; and the Lord will repent of the evil that He hath pronounced against you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	14	As for me , behold , I am in your hand : do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	15	But know ye for certain that if ye put me to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city , and upon the inhabitants thereof ; for truly the Lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	16	Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets , “ This man is not worthy to die , for he hath spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God ! ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	17	Then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spoke to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	18	“ Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah , and spoke to all the people of Judah , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ ‘ Zion shall be plowed like a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	19	“ Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death ? Did he not fear the Lord , and besought the Lord , and the Lord repented of the evil which He had pronounced against them ? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	20	And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord , Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim , who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	21	And when Jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when Urijah heard it , he was afraid and fled , and went into Egypt .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	22	And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , namely , Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him into Egypt .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	23	And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king , who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
KJ21	Jeremiah	26	24	Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	27	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	2	Thus saith the Lord to me : “ Make thee bonds and yokes and put them upon thy neck ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	3	and send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the Ammonites , and to the king of Tyre , and to the king of Sidon by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	4	And command them to say unto their masters , ‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; thus shall ye say unto your masters :
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	5	I have made the earth , the man and the beast that are upon the ground by My great power and by My outstretched arm , and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto Me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	6	And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , My servant ; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	7	And all nations shall serve him and his son and his son ’ s son , until the very time of his land comes ; and then many nations and great kings shall themselves be served by him .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	8	And it shall come to pass , that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon , that nation will I punish , saith the Lord , with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence , until I have consumed them by his hand .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	9	Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets , nor to your diviners , nor to your dreamers , nor to your enchanters , nor to your sorcerers , who speak unto you , saying , “ Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	10	For they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land , and that I should drive you out and ye should perish .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	11	But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him , those will I let remain still in their own land , saith the Lord , and they shall till it and dwell therein. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	12	I spoke also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words , saying , “ Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serve him and his people , and live .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	13	Why will ye die , thou and thy people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , as the Lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	14	Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets who speak unto you , saying , ‘ Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon , ’ for they prophesy a lie unto you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	15	‘ For I have not sent them , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ yet they prophesy a lie in My name ; that I might drive you out , and that ye might perish , ye and the prophets who prophesy unto you. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	16	Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people , saying , “ Thus saith the Lord : Hearken not to the words of your prophets who prophesy unto you , saying , ‘ Behold , the vessels of the Lord ’ S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon ’ ; for they prophesy a lie unto you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	17	Hearken not unto them : serve the king of Babylon , and live . Why should this city be laid waste ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	18	But if they are prophets , and if the word of the Lord is with them , let them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts , that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah , and at Jerusalem go not to Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	19	For thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , from Jerusalem to Babylon , and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	21	yea , thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem :
KJ21	Jeremiah	27	22	‘ They shall be carried to Babylon , and there shall they be until the day that I visit them , ’ saith the Lord . ‘ Then will I bring them up , and restore them to this place . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	28	And it came to pass the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the fourth year and in the fifth month , that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet , who was of Gibeon , spoke unto me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	2	“ Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , ‘ I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	3	Within two full years will I bring back into this place all the vessels of the Lord ’ S house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried them to Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	4	And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah who went into Babylon , ’ saith the Lord ; ‘ for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	5	Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of the Lord ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	6	even the prophet Jeremiah said , “ Amen . The Lord do so . The Lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied , to bring back the vessels of the Lord ’ S house and all that is carried away captive from Babylon into this place .
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	7	Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people :
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	8	The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms , of war and of evil and of pestilence .
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	9	The prophet who prophesieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , then shall the prophet be known that the Lord hath truly sent him. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah ’ s neck , and broke it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	11	And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people , saying , “ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. ’ ” And the prophet Jeremiah went his way .
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	12	Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet ( after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah ) , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	13	“ Go and tell Hananiah , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Thou hast broken the yokes of wood , but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron .
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	14	For thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations , that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and they shall serve him ; and I have given him the beasts of the field also. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	15	Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet , “ Hear now , Hananiah , the Lord hath not sent thee , but thou makest this people to trust in a lie .
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	16	Therefore thus saith the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will cast thee from off the face of the earth . This year thou shalt die , because thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	28	17	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	29	And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	2	( after Jeconiah the king , and the queen , and the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , and the carpenters , and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem ) ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	3	by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , saying :
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	4	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , unto all who are carried away captives , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon :
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	5	Build ye houses and dwell in them , and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	6	Take ye wives and beget sons and daughters , and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters , that ye may be increased there , and not diminished .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	7	And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives , and pray unto the Lord for it ; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	8	For thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Let not your prophets and your diviners who are in the midst of you deceive you , neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	9	For they prophesy falsely unto you in My name : I have not sent them , saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	10	“ For thus saith the Lord : That after seventy years are accomplished at Babylon , I will visit you and perform My good word toward you , causing you to return to this place .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	11	For I know the thoughts that I think toward you , saith the Lord , thoughts of peace and not of evil , to give you an expected end .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	12	Then shall ye call upon Me , and ye shall go and pray unto Me and I will hearken unto you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	13	And ye shall seek Me and find Me when ye shall search for Me with all your heart .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	14	And I will be found by you , saith the Lord , and I will return you from captivity , and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whither I have driven you , saith the Lord ; and I will bring you back into the place from whence I caused you to be carried away captive .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	15	“ Because ye have said , ‘ The Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon ’ —
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	16	know that thus saith the Lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David , and of all the people that dwelleth in this city , and of your brethren who have not gone forth with you into captivity—
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	17	thus saith the Lord of hosts : Behold , I will send upon them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like vile figs that can not be eaten , they are so evil .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	18	And I will persecute them with the sword , with the famine , and with the pestilence , and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth , to be a curse and an astonishment and a hissing , and a reproach among all the nations whither I have driven them ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	19	because they have not hearkened to My words , saith the Lord , which I sent unto them by My servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ; but ye would not hear , saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	20	“ Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord , all ye of the captivity , whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	21	Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah , and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah , who prophesy a lie unto you in My name : Behold , I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall slay them before your eyes .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	22	And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah who are in Babylon , saying , ‘ The Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab , whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire , ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	23	because they have committed villainy in Israel , and have committed adultery with their neighbors ’ wives , and have spoken lying words in My name which I have not commanded them . Indeed I know , and am a witness , saith the Lord. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	24	Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	25	“ Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying : Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people who are at Jerusalem , and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	26	‘ The Lord hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest , that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord for every man that is mad and maketh himself a prophet , that thou shouldest put him in prison , and in the stocks .
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	27	Now therefore , why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth , who maketh himself a prophet to you ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	28	For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon , saying : This captivity is long ; build ye houses and dwell in them , and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	30	Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	31	“ Send to all those of the captivity , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite : Because Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you , and I sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lie ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	29	32	therefore thus saith the Lord : Behold , I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his seed : he shall not have a man to dwell among this people , neither shall he behold the good that I will do for My people , saith the Lord , because he hath taught rebellion against the Lord . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	30	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	2	“ Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel , saying : ‘ Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	3	For lo , the days come , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ that I will bring back from captivity My people Israel and Judah , ’ saith the Lord ; ‘ and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers , and they shall possess it. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	4	And these are the words that the Lord spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah :
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	5	“ For thus saith the Lord : ‘ We have heard a voice of trembling , of fear and not of peace .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	6	Ask ye now , and see whether a man doth travail with child ? Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins , as a woman in travail , and all faces are turned into paleness ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	7	Alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it . It is even the time of Jacob ’ s trouble , but he shall be saved out of it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	8	“ ‘ For it shall come to pass in that day , ’ saith the Lord of hosts , ‘ that I will break his yoke from off thy neck , and will burst thy bonds , and strangers shall no more be served by him .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	9	But they shall serve the Lord their God , and David their king , whom I will raise up unto them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	10	“ ‘ Therefore fear thou not , O My servant Jacob , ’ saith the Lord ; ‘ neither be dismayed , O Israel ; for lo , I will save thee from afar , and thy seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and shall be in rest and be quiet , and none shall make him afraid .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	11	For I am with thee , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ to save thee ; though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee , yet will I not make a full end of thee ; but I will correct thee in measure , and will not leave thee altogether unpunished. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	12	“ For thus saith the Lord : ‘ Thy bruise is incurable , and thy wound is grievous .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	13	There is none to plead thy cause , that thou mayest be bound up ; thou hast no healing medicines .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	14	All thy lovers have forgotten thee ; they seek thee not ; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one for the multitude of thine iniquity , because thy sins were increased .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	15	Why criest thou for thine affliction ? Thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity ; because thy sins were increased , I have done these things unto thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	16	Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured , and all thine adversaries , every one of them , shall go into captivity ; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil , and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	17	For I will restore health unto thee , and I will heal thee of thy wounds , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ because they called thee an outcast , saying , “ This is Zion , whom no man seeketh after. ” ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	18	“ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will bring back from captivity Jacob ’ s tents , and have mercy on his dwelling places ; and the city shall be built upon her own heap , and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	19	And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry ; and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	20	Their children also shall be as in former time , and their congregation shall be established before Me , and I will punish all that oppress them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	21	And their nobles shall be of themselves , and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach unto Me ; for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto Me ? ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	22	‘ And ye shall be My people , and I will be your God. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	23	Behold , the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury , a continuing whirlwind ; it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked .
KJ21	Jeremiah	30	24	The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return , until He has done it , and until He has performed the intents of His heart ; in the latter days ye shall consider it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	31	“ Behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah—
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	2	Thus saith the Lord : “ The people who were left from the sword found grace in the wilderness , even Israel , when I went to cause him to rest. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	3	The Lord hath appeared of old unto me , saying , “ Yea , I have loved thee with an everlasting love ; therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	4	Again I will build thee , and thou shalt be built , O virgin of Israel ; thou shalt again be adorned with thy timbrels , and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	5	Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria ; the planters shall plant , and shall eat them as common things .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	6	For there shall be a day that the watchmen upon Mount Ephraim shall cry , ‘ Arise ye , and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	7	For thus saith the Lord : “ Sing with gladness for Jacob , and shout among the chief of the nations ; proclaim ye , praise ye , and say , ‘ O Lord , save Thy people , the remnant of Israel. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	8	Behold , I will bring them from the north country , and gather them from the coasts of the earth , and with them the blind and the lame , the woman with child , and her that travaileth with child together ; a great company shall return thither .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	9	They shall come with weeping , and with supplications will I lead them ; I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way , wherein they shall not stumble ; for I am a Father to Israel , and Ephraim is My firstborn .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	10	“ Hear the word of the Lord , O ye nations , and declare it in the isles afar off , and say , ‘ He that scattered Israel will gather him , and keep him as a shepherd doth his flock. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	11	For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob , and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	12	Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion , and shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord—for wheat and for wine and for oil , and for the young of the flock and of the herd ; and their soul shall be as a watered garden , and they shall not sorrow any more at all .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	13	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , both young men and old together ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	14	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and My people shall be satisfied with My goodness , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	15	Thus saith the Lord : “ A voice was heard in Ramah , lamentation and bitter weeping ; Rachel , weeping for her children , refused to be comforted for her children , because they were no more. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	16	Thus saith the Lord ; “ Restrain thy voice from weeping , and thine eyes from tears ; for thy work shall be rewarded , ” saith the Lord ; “ and they shall come back from the land of the enemy .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	17	And there is hope in thine end , ” saith the Lord , “ that thy children shall come back to their own border .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	18	“ I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus : ‘ Thou hast chastised me and I was chastised , as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke ; turn Thou me , and I shall be turned , for Thou art the Lord my God .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	19	Surely after I was turned , I repented ; and after I was instructed , I smote upon my thigh . I was ashamed , yea , even confounded , because I bore the reproach of my youth. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	20	Is Ephraim My dear son ? Is he a pleasant child ? For since I spoke against him , I do earnestly remember him still ; therefore My heart is troubled for him ; I will surely have mercy upon him , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	21	“ Set thee up waymarks , make thee high heaps ; set thine heart toward the highway , even the way which thou wentest ; turn back , O virgin of Israel , turn back to these thy cities .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	22	How long wilt thou go about , O thou backsliding daughter ? For the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth : a woman shall compass a man. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	23	Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof , when I shall bring them back from captivity : ‘ The Lord bless thee , O habitation of justice and mountain of holiness. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	24	And there shall dwell in Judah itself , and in all the cities thereof together , husbandmen , and they that go forth with flocks .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	25	For I have satiated the weary soul , and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	26	Upon this I awaked and beheld , and my sleep was sweet unto me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	27	“ Behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	28	And it shall come to pass , that as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down , and to throw down and to destroy and to afflict , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	29	“ In those days they shall say no more : “ ‘ The fathers have eaten a sour grape , and the children ’ s teeth are set on edge. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	30	But every one shall die for his own iniquity : every man that eateth the sour grape , his teeth shall be set on edge .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	32	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt , My covenant which they broke , although I was a husband unto them , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	33	“ But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel : After those days , ” saith the Lord , “ I will put My law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts , and will be their God , and they shall be My people .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	34	And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother , saying , ‘ Know the Lord. ’ For they shall all know Me , from the least of them unto the greatest of them , ” saith the Lord , “ for I will forgive their iniquity , and I will remember their sin no more. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	35	Thus saith the Lord , who giveth the sun for a light by day , and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night , who divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar ; the Lord of hosts is His name :
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	36	“ If those ordinances depart from before Me , ” saith the Lord , “ then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before Me for ever. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	37	Thus saith the Lord : “ If heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	38	“ Behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that the city shall be built to the Lord from the Tower of Hananeel unto the Gate of the Corner .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	39	And the measuring line shall yet go forth opposite it upon the hill Gareb , and shall compass about to Goath .
KJ21	Jeremiah	31	40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes , and all the fields unto the Brook of Kidron unto the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east shall be holy unto the Lord . It shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more for ever . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	32	because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah , which they have done to provoke Me to anger — they , their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of Judah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	2	For then the king of Babylon ’ s army besieged Jerusalem ; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Judah ’ s house .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up , saying , “ Why dost thou prophesy and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	4	and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall behold his eyes ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	5	and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon , and there shall he be until visit I him , saith the Lord ; though ye fight with the Chaldeans , ye shall not prosper ’ ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	6	And Jeremiah said , “ The word of the Lord came unto me , saying :
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	7	Behold , Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee , saying , ‘ Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth ; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	8	So Hanameel mine uncle ’ s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord , and said unto me , ‘ Buy my field , I pray thee , that is in Anathoth , which is in the country of Benjamin ; for the right of inheritance is thine , and the redemption is thine ; buy it for thyself. ’ Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	9	“ And I bought the field from Hanameel my uncle ’ s son , that was in Anathoth , and weighed out to him the money , even seventeen shekels of silver .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	10	And I subscribed the evidence and sealed it , and took witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balances .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	11	So I took the evidence of the purchase , both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	12	and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah , in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle ’ s son , and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the book of the purchase , before all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	13	And I charged Baruch before them , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	14	‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Take these deeds , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed and this evidence which is open , and put them in an earthen vessel , that they may continue many days .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	15	For thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	16	“ Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah , I prayed unto the Lord , saying :
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	17	Ah Lord God ! Behold , Thou hast made the heaven and the earth by Thy great power and outstretched arm ; and there is nothing too hard for Thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	18	Thou showest lovingkindness unto thousands , and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them . The Great , the Mighty God , the Lord of hosts is His name ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	19	great in counsel and mighty in work . For Thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men , to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	20	who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even unto this day , and in Israel and among other men , and hast made Thee a name , as at this day ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	21	and hast brought forth Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt , with signs and with wonders , and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	22	and hast given them this land which Thou didst swear to their fathers to give them , a land flowing with milk and honey .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	23	And they came in and possessed it , but they obeyed not Thy voice , neither walked in Thy law : they have done nothing of all that Thou commanded them to do . Therefore Thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	24	Behold the siege ramps ! They have come unto the city to take it ; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans , who fight against it , because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence . And what Thou hast spoken has come to pass , and behold , Thou seest it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	25	And Thou hast said unto me , O Lord God : ‘ Buy thee the field for money , and take witnesses , ’ for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	26	Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	27	“ Behold , I am the Lord , the God of all flesh . Is there any thing too hard for Me ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	28	Therefore thus saith the Lord : Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	29	And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and set fire on this city , and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal , and poured out drink offerings unto other gods to provoke Me to anger .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	30	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth ; for the children of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands , saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	31	For this city hath been to Me as a provocation of Mine anger and of My fury from the day that they built it even unto this day , so that I should remove it from before My face
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	33	And they have turned unto Me the back and not the face . Though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	34	but they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name to defile it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	35	And they built the high places of Baal , which are in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech , which I commanded them not , neither came it into My mind that they should do this abomination , to cause Judah to sin .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	36	“ And now therefore thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , concerning this city whereof ye say , ‘ It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence ’ :
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	37	Behold , I will gather them out of all countries whither I have driven them in Mine anger and in My fury and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	38	And they shall be My people , and I will be their God ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	39	and I will give them one heart and one way , that they may fear Me for ever , for the good of them and of their children after them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	40	And I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put My fear in their hearts , that they shall not depart from Me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	41	Yea , I will rejoice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assuredly with My whole heart and with My whole soul .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	42	“ For thus saith the Lord : As I have brought all this great evil upon this people , so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	43	And fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say , ‘ It is desolate without man or beast . It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	32	44	Men shall buy fields for money , and sign evidences and seal them , and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin and in the places about Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah and in the cities of the mountains , and in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the South ; for I will cause their captives to return , saith the Lord . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	33	Moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	2	“ Thus saith the Lord the maker thereof , the Lord who formed it to establish it , the Lord is His name :
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	3	‘ Call unto Me , and I will answer thee , and show thee great and mighty things , which thou knowest not. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	4	For thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah , which are thrown down by the siege mounds and by the sword :
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	5	‘ They come to fight with the Chaldeans , but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom I have slain in Mine anger and in My fury , and for all whose wickedness I have hid My face from this city .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	6	Behold , I will bring it health and cure ; and I will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	7	And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to cease , and will build them as at the first .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	8	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against Me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against Me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	9	And it shall be to Me a name of joy , a praise and an honorbefore all the nations of the earth , which shall hear all the good that I do unto them ; and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I provide unto it. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	10	“ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Again there shall be heard in this place ( which ye say shall be desolate , without man and without beast , even in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate , without man and without inhabitant and without beast ) ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	11	the voice of joy and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , the voice of them that shall say , “ Praise the Lord of hosts , for the Lord is good ; for His mercy endureth for ever ” —and of those who shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord . For I will cause to return the captives of the land , as at the first , ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	12	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ Again in this place which is desolate , without man and without beast , and in all the cities thereof shall be a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	13	In the cities of the mountains , in the cities of the vale , and in the cities of the South , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counteth them , ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	14	“ ‘ Behold , the days come , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	15	In those days and at that time will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David ; and He shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	16	In those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely . And this is the name wherewith she shall be called : The Lord Our Righteousness. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	17	“ For thus saith the Lord : ‘ David shall never be in want for a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	18	neither shall the priests , the Levites , be in want for a man before Me to offer burnt offerings , and to kindle meat offerings , and to do sacrifice continually. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	19	And the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	20	“ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ If ye can break My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night , and that there should not be day and night in their season ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	21	then may also My covenant be broken with David My servant , that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne , and with the Levites the priests , My ministers .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	22	As the host of heaven can not be numbered , neither the sand of the sea measured , so will I multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who minister unto Me. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	23	Moreover the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	24	“ Considerest thou not what this people have spoken , saying , ‘ The two families which the Lord hath chosen , He hath even cast them off ’ ? Thus they have despised My people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	25	Thus saith the Lord : ‘ If My covenant be not with day and night , and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	33	26	then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David My servant , so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; for I will cause their captivity to cease , and have mercy on them . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	34	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion , and all the people , fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	2	“ Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel : Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	3	And thou shalt not escape out of his hand , but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand ; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon , and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth , and thou shalt go to Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	4	Yet hear the word of the Lord , O Zedekiah king of Judah . Thus saith the Lord of thee : Thou shalt not die by the sword ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	5	but thou shalt die in peace ; and with the burnings of thy fathers , the former kings who were before thee , so shall they burn incense for thee ; and they will lament thee , saying , “ Ah , lord ! ” For I have pronounced the word , saith the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	7	when the king of Babylon ’ s army fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish and against Azekah ; for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	8	This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them :
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	9	that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant , being a Hebrew or a Hebrewess , go free , that none should be served by them , to wit : by a Jew , his brother .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	10	Now when all the princes and all the people , who had entered into the covenant , heard that every one should let his manservant and every one his maidservant go free , that none should be served by them any more , then they obeyed and let them go .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	11	But afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	12	Therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	13	“ Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel : I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	14	‘ At the end of seven years let go every man his brother , a Hebrew who hath been sold unto thee ; and when he hath served thee six years , thou shalt let him go free from thee. ’ But your fathers hearkened not unto Me , neither inclined their ear .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	15	And ye had now turned , and had done right in My sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor ; and ye had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	16	But ye turned and polluted My name , and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid , whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure , to return , and brought them into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaids .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	17	“ Therefore thus saith the Lord : Ye have not hearkened unto Me , in proclaiming liberty , every one to his brother and every man to his neighbor . Behold , I proclaim a ‘ liberty ’ for you , saith the Lord , to the sword , to the pestilence , and to the famine ; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	18	And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant , who have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before Me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof—
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	19	the princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem , the eunuchs , and the priests , and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf—
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	20	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life ; and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	21	And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon ’ s army which has gone up from you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	34	22	Behold , I will command , saith the Lord , and cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire . And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	35	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	2	“ Go unto the house of the Rechabites and speak unto them , and bring them into the house of the Lord , into one of the chambers , and give them wine to drink. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	3	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	4	and I brought them into the house of the Lord , into the chamber of the sons of Hanan , the son of Igdaliah , a man of God , which was by the chamber of the princes , which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum , the keeper of the door .
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	5	And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine , and cups ; and I said unto them , “ Drink ye wine. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	6	But they said , “ We will drink no wine ; for Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , commanded us , saying , ‘ Ye shall drink no wine , neither ye , nor your sons for ever .
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	7	Neither shall ye build a house , nor sow seed , nor plant a vineyard , nor have any ; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents , that ye may live many days in the land where ye are strangers. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	8	Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , in all that he hath charged us : to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , nor our daughters ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	9	nor to build houses for us to dwell in ; neither have we vineyard , nor field , nor seed .
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	10	But we have dwelt in tents , and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us .
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	11	But it came to pass , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , ‘ Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians. ’ So we dwell at Jerusalem. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	12	Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	13	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , ‘ Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to My words ? ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	14	‘ The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab , that he commanded his sons not to drink wine , are performed ; for unto this day they drink none , but obey their father ’ s commandment . Notwithstanding I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking , but ye hearkened not unto Me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	15	I have sent also unto you all My servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them , saying , “ Return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings , and go not after other gods to serve them , and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. ” But ye have not inclined your ear , nor hearkened unto Me .
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	16	Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them , but this people hath not hearkened unto Me ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	17	therefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them , because I have spoken unto them but they have not heard , and I have called unto them but they have not answered. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	18	And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites , “ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father , and kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he hath commanded you ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	35	19	therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack for a man to stand before Me for ever . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	36	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , saying :
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	2	“ Take thee a scroll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel and against Judah and against all the nations from the day I spoke unto thee , from the days of Josiah , even unto this day .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	3	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them , that they may return every man from his evil way , that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord which He had spoken unto him upon a scroll of a book .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	5	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch , saying , “ I am shut up ; I can not go into the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	6	Therefore go thou , and read in the scroll , which thou hast written from my mouth , the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord ’ S house upon the fasting day ; and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	7	It may be they will present their supplication before the Lord , and will return every one from his evil way ; for great is the anger and the fury that the Lord hath pronounced against this people. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	8	And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him , reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord ’ S house .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	9	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , in the ninth month , that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem , and to all the people who came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	10	Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan , the scribe , in the higher court at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord ’ S house in the ears of all the people .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	11	When Michaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	12	then he went down into the king ’ s house into the scribe ’ s chamber ; and lo , all the princes sat there , even Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the son of Achbor , and Gemariah the son of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the princes .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	13	Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Cushi unto Baruch , saying , “ Take in thine hand the scroll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people , and come. ” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand , and came unto them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	15	And they said unto him , “ Sit down now , and read it in our ears. ” So Baruch read it in their ears .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	16	Now it came to pass , when they had heard all the words , they were afraid both one and the other , and said unto Baruch , “ We will surely tell the king of all these words. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	17	And they asked Baruch , saying , “ Tell us now , how didst thou write all these words from his mouth ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	18	Then Baruch answered them , “ He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth , and I wrote them with ink in the book. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	19	Then said the princes unto Baruch , “ Go , hide thee , thou and Jeremiah ; and let no man know where ye be. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	20	And they went in to the king into the court , but they laid up the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe , and told all the words in the ears of the king .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	21	So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the scroll ; and he took it out of Elishama the scribe ’ s chamber . And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	22	Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month , and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	23	And it came to pass that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves , he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth , until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	24	Yet they were not afraid , nor rent their garments , neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	25	Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he should not burn the scroll ; but he would not hear them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	26	But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet ; but the Lord hid them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	27	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	28	“ Take thee again another scroll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll , which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	29	And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Thou hast burned this scroll , saying , “ Why hast thou written therein , saying : the king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land , and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	30	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah : He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David , and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost .
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	31	And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity ; and I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the men of Judah all the evil that I have pronounced against them ; but they hearkened not. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	36	32	Then took Jeremiah another scroll , and gave it to Baruch the scribe , the son of Neriah , who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire ; and there were added besides unto them many like words .
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	37	And King Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	2	But neither he nor his servants , nor the people of the land hearkened unto the words of the Lord , which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	3	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , “ Pray now unto the Lord our God for us. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	4	Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people , for they had not put him into prison .
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	5	Then Pharaoh ’ s army came forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chaldeans who besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them , they departed from Jerusalem .
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	6	Then came the word of the Lord unto the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	7	“ Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel : Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah , who sent you unto Me to inquire of Me : ‘ Behold , Pharaoh ’ s army , which has come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	8	And the Chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city , and take it and burn it with fire. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	9	Thus saith the Lord : Deceive not yourselves , saying , ‘ The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us , ’ for they shall not depart .
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	10	For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fire. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	11	And it came to pass that when the army of the Chaldeans had broken off from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh ’ s army ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	12	then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to separate himself from thence in the midst of the people .
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	13	And when he was in the Gate of Benjamin , a captain of the guard was there , whose name was Irijah the son of Shelemiah , the son of Hananiah ; and he took Jeremiah the prophet , saying , “ Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans ! ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	14	Then said Jeremiah , “ It is false ! I fall not away to the Chaldeans. ” But he hearkened not to him ; so Irijah took Jeremiah and brought him to the princes .
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	15	Thereupon the princes were wroth with Jeremiah , and smote him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe ; for they had made that the prison .
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	16	When Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon and into the cells , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	17	then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out ; and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , “ Is there any word from the Lord ? ” And Jeremiah said , “ There is ; for , said He : Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon ! ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	18	Moreover Jeremiah said unto King Zedekiah , “ How have I offended against thee or against thy servants or against this people , that ye have put me in prison ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	19	Where are now your prophets who prophesied unto you , saying , ‘ The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ’ ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	20	Therefore hear now , I pray thee , O my lord the king . Let my supplication , I pray thee , be accepted before thee , that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	37	21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison , and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers ’ street , until all the bread in the city was spent . Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	38	Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan , and Gedaliah the son of Pashur , and Jucal the son of Shelemiah , and Pashur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	2	“ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live ; for he shall have his life as a prey , and shall live. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	3	Thus saith the Lord : ‘ This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon ’ s army , which shall take it. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	4	Therefore the princes said unto the king , “ We beseech thee , let this man be put to death ; for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war who remain in this city , and the hands of all the people , by speaking such words unto them ; for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people , but the hurt. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	5	Then Zedekiah the king said , “ Behold , he is in your hand ; for the king is not he that can do any thing against you. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	6	Then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah , the son of Hammelech , which was in the court of the prison ; and they let down Jeremiah with cords . And in the dungeon there was no water , but mire ; so Jeremiah sank in the mire .
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	7	Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , one of the eunuchs who was in the king ’ s house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ( the king then sitting in the Gate of Benjamin ) ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	8	Ebedmelech went forth out of the king ’ s house and spoke to the king , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	9	“ My lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he is likely to die of hunger in the place where he is , for there is no more bread in the city. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	10	Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , saying , “ Take from hence thirty men with thee , and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	11	So Ebedmelech took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took from thence old castoff clothes and old rotten rags , and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	12	And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah , “ Put now these old castoff clothes and rotten rags under thine armpits , under the cords. ” And Jeremiah did so .
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	13	So they drew up Jeremiah with cords , and took him up out of the dungeon ; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	14	Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the principal entry that is in the house of the Lord ; and the king said unto Jeremiah , “ I will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	15	Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah , “ If I declare it unto thee , wilt thou not surely put me to death ? And if I give thee counsel , wilt thou not hearken unto me ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	16	So Zedekiah the king swore secretly unto Jeremiah , saying , “ As the Lord liveth , who made us this soul , I will not put thee to death , neither will I give thee into the hand of these men who seek thy life. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	17	Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah , “ Thus saith the Lord , the God of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon ’ s princes , then thy soul shall live , and this city shall not be burned with fire ; and thou shalt live , and thine house .
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	18	But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon ’ s princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	19	And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah , “ I am afraid of the Jews who are fallen to the Chaldeans , lest they deliver me into their hand , and they mock me. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	20	But Jeremiah said , “ They shall not deliver thee . Obey , I beseech thee , the voice of the Lord , which I speak unto thee ; so it shall be well with thee , and thy soul shall live .
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	21	But if thou refuse to go forth , this is the word that the Lord hath shown me :
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	22	And behold , all the women who are left in the king of Judah ’ s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon ’ s princes , and those women shall say , ‘ Thy friends have set thee up and have prevailed against thee . Thy feet are sunk in the mire , and they have turned away back. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	23	So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans . And thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon ; and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	24	Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah , “ Let no man know of these words , and thou shalt not die .
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee , and they come unto thee and say unto thee , ‘ Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king , also what the king said unto thee ; hide it not from us , and we will not put thee to death , ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	26	then thou shalt say unto them , ‘ I presented my supplication before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan ’ s house to die there. ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	27	Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah and asked him , and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . So they left off speaking with him , for the matter was not perceived .
KJ21	Jeremiah	38	28	So Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken , and he was there when Jerusalem was taken .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	39	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah in the tenth month , came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and they besieged it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	2	And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city was broken into .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	3	And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate : even Nergalsharezer , Samgarnebo , Sarsechim , Rabsaris , Nergalsharezer , Rabmag , with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	4	And it came to pass that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them and all the men of war , then they fled and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king ’ s garden , by the gate betwixt the two walls ; and he went out the way of the plain .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	5	But the Chaldeans ’ army pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , to Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he gave judgment upon him .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	6	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes in Riblah ; also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	7	Moreover he put out Zedekiah ’ s eyes , and bound him with chains to carry him to Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	8	And the Chaldeans burned the king ’ s house and the houses of the people with fire , and broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	9	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city and those who fell away , who fell to him , with the rest of the people who remained .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	10	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	11	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	12	“ Take him and look well to him , and do him no harm ; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent Nebushasban , Rabsaris , and Nergalsharezer , Rabmag , and all the king of Babylon ’ s princes ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	14	even they sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home . So he dwelt among the people .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	15	Now the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	16	“ Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will bring My words upon this city for evil and not for good ; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	17	But I will deliver thee in that day , saith the Lord ; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
KJ21	Jeremiah	39	18	For I will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword ; but thy life shall be as a prize unto thee , because thou hast put thy trust in Me , saith the Lord . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	40	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him bound in chains among all who were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah , who were carried away captive unto Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	2	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said unto him , “ The Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place .
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	3	Now the Lord hath brought it , and done according as He hath said : because ye have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed His voice , therefore this thing has come upon you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	4	And now behold , I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand . If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon , come , and I will look well after thee ; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon , forbear . Behold , all the land is before thee . Wherever it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go , thither go. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	5	Now while he had not yet gone back , he said , “ Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah , and dwell with him among the people ; or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. ” So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward and let him go .
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	6	Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , to Mizpah , and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	7	Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed unto him men and women and children , and the poor of the land of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	8	then they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah — even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	9	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , swore unto them and to their men , saying , “ Fear not to serve the Chaldeans . Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	10	As for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans , who will come unto us ; but ye , gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that ye have taken. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	11	Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab , and among the Ammonites and in Edom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	12	even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah at Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits in abundance .
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	13	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	14	and said unto him , “ Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee ? ” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not .
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly , saying , “ Let me go , I pray thee , and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and no man shall know it . Why should he slay thee , that all the Jews who are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant in Judah perish ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	40	16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah , “ Thou shalt not do this thing , for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	41	Now it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the royal seed and the princes of the king , came with ten men unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	2	Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him , and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , with the sword and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	3	Ishmael also slew all the Jews who were with him , even with Gedaliah at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans who were found there and the men of war .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	4	And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	5	that there came certain ones from Shechem , from Shiloh , and from Samaria , even fourscore men , having their beards shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves , with offerings and incense in their hand to bring them to the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	6	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went ; and it came to pass as he met them , he said unto them , “ Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	7	And it was so when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit , he and the men who were with him .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	8	But ten men were found among them who said unto Ishmael , “ Slay us not ; for we have treasures in the field of wheat , and of barley , and of oil , and of honey. ” So he forbore , and slew them not among their brethren .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	9	Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men , whom he had slain because of Gedaliah , was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel ; and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were slain .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	10	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people who were in Mizpah , even the king ’ s daughters and all the people that remained in Mizpah , whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam ; and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive , and departed to go over to the Ammonites .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	11	But when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	12	then they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	13	Now it came to pass , that when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	14	So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and returned , and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men , and went to the Ammonites .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam — even mighty men of war , and the women , and the children , and the eunuchs whom he had brought again from Gibeon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	17	And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham , which is by Bethlehem , to go to enter into Egypt ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	41	18	because of the Chaldeans ; for they were afraid of them , because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	42	Then all the captains of the forces , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah , and all the people from the least even unto the greatest , came near
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	2	and said unto Jeremiah the prophet , “ Let , we beseech thee , our supplication be accepted before thee , and pray for us unto the Lord thy God , even for all this remnant ( for we are left but a few of many , as thine eyes do behold us ) ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	3	that the Lord thy God may show us the way wherein we may walk and the thing that we may do. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them , “ I have heard you ; behold , I will pray unto the Lord your God according to your words , and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing the Lord shall answer you , I will declare it unto you ; I will keep nothing back from you. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	5	Then they said to Jeremiah , “ The Lord be a true and faithful witness between us , if we do not do even according to all things for which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us .
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	6	Whether it be good or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we send thee , that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our God. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	7	And it came to pass after ten days that the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	8	Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	9	and said unto them , “ Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before Him :
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	10	‘ If ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you and not pull you down , and I will plant you and not pluck you up ; for I repent of the evil that I have done unto you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	11	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom ye are afraid ; be not afraid of him , saith the Lord , for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand .
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	12	And I will show mercies unto you , that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	13	“ But if ye say , ‘ We will not dwell in this land , ’ neither obey the voice of the Lord your God ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	14	saying , ‘ No , but we will go into the land of Egypt where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger for bread , and there will we dwell ’ —
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	15	and now therefore hear the word of the Lord , ye remnant of Judah ! Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to sojourn there ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	16	then it shall come to pass that the sword which ye feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine whereof ye were afraid shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	17	So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there . They shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	18	For thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ As Mine anger and My fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so shall My fury be poured forth upon you when ye shall enter into Egypt . And ye shall be an execration and an astonishment , and a curse and a reproach ; and ye shall see this place no more. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	19	“ The Lord hath said concerning you , O ye remnant of Judah : ‘ Go ye not into Egypt ! ’ Know certainly that I have admonished you this day .
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	20	For ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me unto the Lord your God , saying , ‘ Pray for us unto the Lord our God ; and according unto all that the Lord our God shall say , so declare unto us , and we will do it. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	21	And now I have this day declared it to you , but ye have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for which He hath sent me unto you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	42	22	Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	43	And it came to pass that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the Lord their God , for which the Lord their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	2	then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the proud men , saying unto Jeremiah , “ Thou speakest falsely . The Lord our God hath not sent thee to say , ‘ Go not into Egypt to sojourn there. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	3	But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they might put us to death and carry us away captives into Babylon. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	4	So Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people obeyed not the voice of the Lord to dwell in the land of Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	5	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah , who had returned from all nations whither they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Judah—
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	6	even men , and women , and children , and the king ’ s daughters , and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , and Jeremiah the prophet , and Baruch the son of Neriah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	7	So they came into the land of Egypt , for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord ; thus came they even to Tahpanhes .
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	8	Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	9	“ Take great stones in thine hand , and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln , which is at the entry of Pharaoh ’ s house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	10	and say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , My servant , and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid ; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	11	And when he cometh , he shall smite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	12	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt , and he shall burn them and carry them away captives ; and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt , as a shepherd putteth on his garment ; and he shall go forth from thence in peace .
KJ21	Jeremiah	43	13	He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh [ the House of the Sun ] that are in the land of Egypt ; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	44	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwell in the land of Egypt , who dwell at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Noph , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	2	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah ; and behold , this day they are a desolation , and no man dwelleth therein ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	3	because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me to anger , in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods whom they knew not , neither they , ye , nor your fathers .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	4	Nevertheless , I sent unto you all My servants the prophets , rising early and sending them , saying , ‘ Oh , do not this abominable thing that I hate. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	5	But they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness , to burn no incense unto other gods .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	6	Therefore My fury and Mine anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and desolate , as at this day .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	7	“ Therefore , now thus saith the Lord , the God of hosts , the God of Israel : Why commit ye this great evil against your souls to cut off from you man and woman , child and suckling , out of Judah to leave you none to remain ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	8	in that ye provoke Me unto wrath with the works of your hands , burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt whither ye have gone to dwell , that ye might cut yourselves off and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	9	Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of Judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives which they have committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	10	They are not humbled even unto this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in My law , nor in My statutes that I set before you and before your fathers .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	11	“ Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will set My face against you for evil , and to cut off all Judah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	12	And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there , and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of Egypt ; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine . They shall die , from the least even unto the greatest , by the sword and by the famine ; and they shall be an execration and an astonishment , and a curse and a reproach .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	13	For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	14	so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain , that they should return into the land of Judah to which they have a desire to return to dwell there ; for none shall return but such as shall escape. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	15	Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods , and all the women who stood by , a great multitude , even all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt , in Pathros , answered Jeremiah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	16	“ As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord , we will not hearken unto thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	17	But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth , to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her , as we have done , we , and our fathers , our kings , and our princes in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; for then had we plenty of bread , and were well and saw no evil .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	18	But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings unto her , we have been wanting in all things , and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	19	“ And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings unto her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings unto her without our men ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	20	Then Jeremiah said unto all the people — to the men , and to the women , and to all the people who had given him that answer , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	21	“ The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem , ye and your fathers , your kings and your princes , and the people of the land , did not the Lord remember them , and came it not into His mind ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	22	So the Lord could no longer bear it , because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which ye have committed . Therefore your land is a desolation , and an astonishment and a curse , without an inhabitant , as at this day .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	23	Because ye have burned incense , and because ye have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord , nor walked in His law nor in His statutes nor in His testimonies , therefore this evil has happened unto you , as at this day. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	24	Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people and to all the women , “ Hear the word of the Lord , all Judah who are in the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	25	Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying : Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands , saying , ‘ We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her. ’ Ye will surely accomplish your vows and surely perform your vows !
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	26	Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord , all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt : ‘ Behold , I have sworn by My great name , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt , saying , “ The Lord God liveth. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	27	Behold , I will watch over them for evil and not for good ; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until there be an end of them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	28	Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah , and all the remnant of Judah that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there shall know whose words shall stand , Mine , or theirs .
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	29	And this shall be a sign unto you , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ that I will punish you in this place , that ye may know that My words shall surely stand against you for evil. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	44	30	Thus saith the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of them that seek his life , as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , his enemy who sought his life . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	45	45	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Baruch the son of Neriah , when he had written these words in a book out of the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	45	2	“ Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , unto thee , O Baruch :
KJ21	Jeremiah	45	3	Thou didst say , ‘ Woe is me now ! For the Lord hath added grief to my sorrow ; I fainted in my sighing , and I find no rest. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	45	4	Thus shalt thou say unto him , ‘ The Lord saith thus : Behold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have planted I will pluck up , even this whole land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	45	5	And seekest thou great things for thyself ? Seek them not ; for behold , I will bring evil upon all flesh , saith the Lord , but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest . ’ ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	46	The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	2	Against Egypt , against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt , which was by the River Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah :
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	3	“ Order ye the buckler and shield , and draw near to battle !
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	4	Harness the horses ; and get up , ye horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , and put on the brigandines !
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	5	Why have I seen them dismayed and turned away back ? And their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled apace and look not back , for fear was round about , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	6	“ Let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; they shall stumble and fall toward the north by the River Euphrates .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	7	“ Who is this that cometh up as a flood , whose waters are moved as the rivers ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	8	Egypt riseth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he saith , ‘ I will go up , and will cover the earth ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	9	Come up , ye horses , and rage , ye chariots ! And let the mighty men come forth : the Ethiopians and the Libyans that handle the shield , and the Lydians that handle and bend the bow .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	10	For this is the day of the Lord God of hosts , a day of vengeance , that He may avenge Him of His adversaries . And the sword shall devour , and it shall be sated and made drunk with their blood ; for the Lord God of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the River Euphrates .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	11	Go up into Gilead and take balm , O virgin , the daughter of Egypt ; in vain shalt thou use many medicines ; for thou shalt not be cured .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	12	The nations have heard of thy shame , and thy cry hath filled the land ; for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty , and they are fallen both together. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	13	The word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet , how Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt :
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	14	“ Declare ye in Egypt and publish in Migdol , and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes ; say ye , ‘ Stand fast and prepare thee , for the sword shall devour round about thee. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	15	Why are thy valiant men swept away ? They stood not , because the Lord did drive them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	16	He made many to fall , yea , one fell upon another ; and they said , ‘ Arise , and let us go again to our own people and to the land of our nativity , from the oppressing sword. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	17	They did cry there , ‘ Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise ! He hath passed the time appointed. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	18	“ As I live , ” saith the King , whose name is the Lord of hosts , “ surely as Tabor is among the mountains and as Carmel by the sea , so shall he come .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	19	O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt , furnish thyself to go into captivity ; for Noph shall be waste and desolate , without an inhabitant .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	20	“ Egypt is like a very fair heifer , but destruction cometh ; it cometh out of the north .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	21	Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks ; for they also are turned back , and have fled away together . They did not stand , because the day of their calamity had come upon them , and the time of their visitation .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	22	The voice thereof shall go like a serpent ; for they shall march with an army and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	23	They shall cut down her forest , ” saith the Lord , “ though it can not be searched , because they are more than the grasshoppers , and are innumerable .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	24	The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	25	The Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saith : “ Behold , I will punish the multitude of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , with their gods and their kings , even Pharaoh and all them that trust in him .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	26	And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of his servants ; and afterward it shall be inhabited as in the days of old , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	27	“ But fear not thou , O My servant Jacob , and be not dismayed , O Israel ; for , behold , I will save thee from afar off , and thy seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
KJ21	Jeremiah	46	28	Fear thou not , O Jacob My servant , ” saith the Lord , “ for I am with thee . For I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee , but I will not make a full end of thee , but correct thee in measure . Yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	47	47	The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines , before Pharaoh smote Gaza .
KJ21	Jeremiah	47	2	Thus saith the Lord : “ Behold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall be an overflowing flood , and shall overflow the land , and all that is therein , the city , and them that dwell therein ; then the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl .
KJ21	Jeremiah	47	3	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	47	4	because of the day that cometh to despoil all the Philistines , and to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remaineth ; for the Lord will despoil the Philistines , the remnant of the country of Caphtor .
KJ21	Jeremiah	47	5	Baldness is come upon Gaza ; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley . How long wilt thou cut thyself ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	47	6	O thou sword of the Lord , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ? Put up thyself into thy scabbard ; rest and be still .
KJ21	Jeremiah	47	7	How can it be quiet , seeing the Lord hath given it a charge against Ashkelon and against the seashore ? There hath He appointed it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	48	Against Moab , thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Woe unto Nebo ! For it is despoiled ; Kiriathaim is confounded and taken ; Misgab is confounded and dismayed .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	2	There shall be no more praise of Moab ; in Heshbon they have devised evil against it ; ‘ Come , and let us cut it off from being a nation. ’ Also thou shalt be cut down , O Madmen ; the sword shall pursue thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	3	“ A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim : ‘ Despoiling and great destruction ! ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	4	Moab is destroyed ; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	5	For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up ; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	6	Flee , save your lives , and be like a naked tree in the wilderness .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	7	For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures , thou shalt also be taken ; and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	8	And the spoiler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape ; the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed , as the Lord hath spoken .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	9	“ Give wings unto Moab , that it may flee and get away ; for the cities thereof shall be desolate , without any to dwell therein .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	10	“ Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully , and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	11	“ Moab hath been at ease from his youth , and he hath settled on his lees , and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither hath he gone into captivity ; therefore his taste remained in him , and his scent is not changed .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	12	“ Therefore , behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that I will send unto him wanderers , who shall cause him to wander , and shall empty his vessels and break their bottles .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	13	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh , as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel , their confidence .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	14	“ How say ye , ‘ We are mighty and strong men for the war ’ ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	15	Moab is despoiled and gone up out of her cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , ” saith the King , whose name is the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	16	“ The calamity of Moab is near to come , and his affliction hasteneth fast .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	17	All ye that are about him , bemoan him ; and all ye that know his name , say , ‘ How is the strong staff broken , and the beautiful rod ! ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	18	Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon , come down from thy glory , and sit in thirst ; for the despoiler of Moab shall come upon thee , and he shall destroy thy strongholds .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	19	O inhabitant of Aroer , stand by the way and espy ; ask him that fleeth and her that escapeth , and say , ‘ What is done ? ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	20	Moab is confounded , for it is broken down . Howl and cry ! Tell ye it in Arnon that Moab is despoiled !
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	21	“ And judgment has come upon the plain country : upon Holon , and upon Jahazah , and upon Mephaath ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	22	and upon Dibon , and upon Nebo , and upon Bethdiblathaim ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	23	and upon Kiriathaim , and upon Bethgamul , and upon Bethmeon ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	24	and upon Kerioth , and upon Bozrah , and upon all the cities of the land of Moab , far or near .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	25	The horn of Moab is cut off , and his arm is broken , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	26	“ Make ye him drunken , for he magnified himself against the Lord . Moab also shall wallow in his vomit , and he also shall be in derision .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	27	For was not Israel a derision unto thee ? Was he found among thieves ? For since thou spokest of him , thou skipped for joy .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	28	“ O ye that dwell in Moab , leave the cities and dwell in the rock , and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole ’ s mouth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	29	We have heard the pride of Moab ( he is exceeding proud ) — his loftiness , and his arrogancy , and his pride , and the haughtiness of his heart .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	30	I know his wrath , ” saith the Lord , “ but it shall not be so ; his lies shall not so effect it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	31	Therefore will I howl for Moab , and I will cry out for all Moab ; Mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	32	O vine of Sibmah , I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer ; thy plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of Jazer . The spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	33	and joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field and from the land of Moab . And I have caused wine to fail from the wine presses ; none shall tread with shouting ; their shouting shall be no shouting .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	34	“ From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh , and even unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice , from Zoar even unto Horonaim , as a heifer of three years old ; for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	35	Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab , ” saith the Lord , “ him that offereth in the high places and him that burneth incense to his gods .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	36	Therefore Mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes , and Mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres , because the riches that he hath gotten have perished .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	37	“ For every head shall be bald and every beard clipped ; upon all the hands shall be cuts and upon the loins sackcloth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	38	There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof ; for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	39	“ They shall howl , saying , ‘ How it is broken down ! How hath Moab turned the back with shame ! ’ So shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all those about him. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	40	For thus saith the Lord : “ Behold , he shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread his wings over Moab .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	41	Kerioth is taken , and the strongholds are surprised ; and the mighty men ’ s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	42	And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people , because he hath magnified himself against the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	43	Fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon thee , O inhabitant of Moab , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	44	“ He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit , and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring upon it , even upon Moab , the year of their visitation , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	45	“ They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force ; but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon and a flame from the midst of Sihon , and shall devour the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	46	Woe be unto thee , O Moab ! The people of Chemosh perisheth ! For thy sons are taken captive and thy daughters captive .
KJ21	Jeremiah	48	47	“ Yet will I bring back the captives of Moab in the latter days , ” saith the Lord . Thus far is the judgment of Moab .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	49	Concerning the Ammonites , thus saith the Lord : “ Hath Israel no sons ? Hath he no heir ? Why then doth their king inherit Gad , and his people dwell in his cities ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	2	Therefore behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites ; and it shall be a desolate heap , and her daughters shall be burned with fire ; then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	3	“ Howl , O Heshbon , for Ai is despoiled ! Cry , ye daughters of Rabbah ; gird you with sackcloth ! Lament , and run to and fro by the hedges ; for their king shall go into captivity , and his priests and his princes together .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	4	Why gloriest thou in the valleys , thy flowing valley , O backsliding daughter , that trusted in her treasures , saying , ‘ Who shall come unto me ? ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	5	Behold , I will bring a fear upon thee , ” saith the Lord God of hosts , “ from all those that be about thee ; and ye shall be driven out , every man straight forth , and none shall gather up him that wandereth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	6	And afterward I will bring back the captives of the children of Ammon , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	7	Concerning Edom , thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ Is wisdom no more in Teman ? Is counsel perished from the prudent ? Is their wisdom vanished ?
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	8	Flee ye , turn back , dwell deep , O inhabitants of Dedan ; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him , at the time that I will visit him .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	9	If grape-gatherers come to thee , would they not leave some gleaning grapes ? If thieves by night , they will destroy till they have enough .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	10	But I have made Esau bare ; I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself ; his seed is despoiled , and his brethren and his neighbors , and he is no more .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	11	Leave thy fatherless children ; I will preserve them alive ; and let thy widows trust in Me. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	12	For thus saith the Lord : “ Behold , they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunk . And art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished ? Thou shalt not go unpunished , but thou shalt surely drink of it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	13	For I have sworn by Myself , ” saith the Lord , “ that Bozrah shall become a desolation , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. ”

KJ21	Jeremiah	49	16	Thy terribleness hath deceived thee , and the pride of thine heart , O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock , that holdest the height of the hill ; though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle , I will bring thee down from thence , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	17	“ Also Edom shall be a desolation ; every one that goeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	18	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof , ” saith the Lord , “ no man shall abide there , neither shall a son of man dwell in it .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	19	Behold , he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan against the habitation of the strong ; but I will suddenly make him run away from her . And who is a chosen man , that I may appoint over her ? For who is like Me ? And who will appoint Me a time ? And who is that shepherd that will stand before Me ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	20	Therefore hear the counsel of the Lord that He hath taken against Edom , and His purposes that He hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman . Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out ; surely He shall make their habitations desolate with them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	21	The earth is moved at the noise of their fall ; at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red Sea .

KJ21	Jeremiah	49	23	Concerning Damascus : “ Hamath is confounded , and Arpad , for they have heard evil tidings ; they are fainthearted ; there is sorrow on the sea ; it can not be quiet .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	24	Damascus is waxed feeble and turneth herself to flee , and fear hath seized on her ; anguish and sorrows have taken her , as a woman in travail .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	25	How is the city of praise not left , the city of My joy !

KJ21	Jeremiah	49	28	Concerning Kedar and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall smite , thus saith the Lord : “ Arise ye , go up to Kedar , and despoil the men of the East .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	29	Their tents and their flocks shall they take away ; they shall take for themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels ; and they shall cry unto them , ‘ Fear is on every side ! ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	30	Flee , get you far off ! Dwell deep , O ye inhabitants of Hazor , ” saith the Lord . “ For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you , and hath conceived a purpose against you .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	31	“ Arise , get you up unto the wealthy nation , that dwelleth without cares , ” saith the Lord , “ which have neither gates nor bars , which dwell alone .

KJ21	Jeremiah	49	33	“ And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons , and a desolation for ever ; there shall no man abide there , nor any son of man dwell in it. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	34	The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	35	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ ‘ Behold , I will break the bow of Elam , the chief of their might .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	36	And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	37	For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies and before them that seek their life ; and I will bring evil upon them , even My fierce anger , ’ saith the Lord ; ‘ and I will send the sword after them till I have consumed them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	38	And I will set My throne in Elam , and will destroy from thence the king and the princes , ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	49	39	“ ‘ But it shall come to pass in the latter days , that I will bring back the captives of Elam , ’ saith the Lord . ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	50	The word that the Lord spoke against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet :
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	2	“ Declare ye among the nations , and proclaim and set up a standard ; proclaim and conceal not . Say , ‘ Babylon is taken , Bel is confounded , Merodach is broken in pieces ! Her idols are confounded , her images are broken in pieces ! ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	3	For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein ; they shall be removed , they shall depart , both man and beast .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	4	“ In those days and in that time , ” saith the Lord , “ the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Judah together , going and weeping ; they shall go , and seek the Lord their God .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	5	They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces turned thitherward , saying , ‘ Come , and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	6	My people hath been lost sheep ; their shepherds have caused them to go astray . They have turned them away on the mountains ; they have gone from mountain to hill ; they have forgotten their resting place .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	7	All who found them have devoured them ; and their adversaries said , ‘ We offend not , because they have sinned against the Lord , the habitation of justice , even the Lord , the hope of their fathers. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	8	“ Depart out of the midst of Babylon , and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans , and be as the hegoats before the flocks .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	9	For lo , I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country , and they shall set themselves in array against her . From thence she shall be taken . Their arrows shall be as of a mighty destroyer ; none shall return in vain .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	10	And Chaldea shall be a spoil ; all that despoil her shall be satisfied , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	11	“ Because ye were glad , because ye rejoiced , O ye destroyers of Mine heritage , because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass , and bellow as bulls ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	12	your mother shall be sore confounded ; she that bore you shall be ashamed . Behold , the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness , a dry land and a desert .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	13	Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited , but it shall be wholly desolate ; every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished and hiss at all her plagues .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	14	Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about ; all ye that bend the bow , shoot at her , spare no arrows , for she hath sinned against the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	15	Shout against her round about ; she hath given her hand . Her foundations are fallen , her walls are thrown down ; for it is the vengeance of the Lord . Take vengeance upon her ; as she hath done , do unto her .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	16	Cut off the sower from Babylon , and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest ; for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	17	“ Israel is a scattered sheep ; the lions have driven him away . First the king of Assyria hath devoured him , and last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	18	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	19	And I will bring Israel again to his habitation ; and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan , and his soul shall be satisfied upon Mount Ephraim and Gilead .

KJ21	Jeremiah	50	21	“ Go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it and against the inhabitants of Pekod . Waste and utterly destroy after them , ” saith the Lord , “ and do according to all that I have commanded thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	22	A sound of battle is in the land , and of great destruction .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	23	How the hammer of the whole earth is cut asunder and broken ! How Babylon hath become a desolation among the nations !
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	24	I have laid a snare for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou wast not aware ; thou art found and also caught , because thou hast striven against the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	25	The Lord hath opened His armory and hath brought forth the weapons of His indignation ; for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	26	Come against her from the utmost border ; open her storehouses . Cast her up as heaps and destroy her utterly ; let nothing of her be left .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	27	Slay all her bullocks ; let them go down to the slaughter . Woe unto them ! For their day has come , the time of their visitation .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	28	The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God , the vengeance of His temple .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	29	“ Call together the archers against Babylon . All ye that bend the bow , camp against it round about ; let none thereof escape . Recompense her according to her work ; according to all that she hath done , do unto her . For she hath been proud against the Lord , against the Holy One of Israel .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	30	Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets , and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	31	“ Behold , I am against thee , O thou most proud , ” saith the Lord God of hosts ; “ for thy day is come , the time that I will visit thee .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	32	And the most proud shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up ; and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all round about him. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	33	Thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together , and all that took them captives held them fast ; they refused to let them go .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	34	Their Redeemer is strong ; the Lord of hosts is His name . He shall thoroughly plead their cause , that He may give rest to the land , and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	35	“ A sword is upon the Chaldeans , ” saith the Lord , “ and upon the inhabitants of Babylon , and upon her princes , and upon her wise men !
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	36	A sword is upon the liars , and they shall dote ! A sword is upon her mighty men , and they shall be dismayed !
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	37	A sword is upon their horses and upon their chariots , and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her , and they shall become as women ! A sword is upon her treasures , and they shall be robbed !
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	38	A drought is upon her waters , and they shall be dried up ! For it is the land of graven images , and they are mad over their idols .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	39	Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there , and the owls shall dwell therein ; and it shall be no more inhabited for ever , neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	40	As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof , ” saith the Lord , “ so shall no man abide there , neither shall any son of man dwell therein .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	41	“ Behold , a people shall come from the north , and a great nation , and many kings shall be raised up from the borders of the earth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	42	They shall hold the bow and the lance ; they are cruel and will not show mercy ; their voice shall roar like the sea , and they shall ride upon horses , every one put in array like a man to the battle , against thee , O daughter of Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	43	The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them , and his hands waxed feeble ; anguish took hold of him , and pangs as of a woman in travail .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	44	Behold , he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan unto the habitation of the strong ; but I will make them suddenly run away from her . And who is a chosen man that I may appoint over her ? For who is like Me ? And who will appoint Me the time ? And who is that shepherd that will stand before Me ? ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	45	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord that He hath taken against Babylon , and His purposes that He hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans . Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out ; surely He shall make their habitation desolate with them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	50	46	At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved , and the cry is heard among the nations .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	51	We are confounded because we have heard reproach ; shame hath covered our faces , for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the Lord ’ S house .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	2	And will send unto Babylon winnowers that shall fan her , and shall empty her land ; for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	3	Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow , and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine ; and spare ye not her young men ; destroy ye utterly all her host .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	4	Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans , and they that are thrust through in her streets .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	5	For Israel hath not been forsaken , nor Judah by his God , by the Lord of hosts , though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	6	Flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul ; be not cut off in her iniquity , for this is the time of the Lord ’ S vengeance ; He will render unto her a recompense .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	7	Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord ’ S hand , that made all the earth drunken ; the nations have drunk of her wine ; therefore the nations are mad .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	8	Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed : Howl for her ! Take balm for her pain ; if so be she may be healed .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	9	We woud have healed Babylon , but she is not healed . Forsake her , and let us go every one into his own country , for her judgment reacheth unto heaven and is lifted up even to the skies .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	10	The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness ; come , and let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	11	Make bright the arrows ! Gather the shields ! The Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes ; for His device is against Babylon to destroy it , because it is the vengeance of the Lord , the vengeance of His temple .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	12	Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon ! Make the watch strong ! Set up the watchmen ! Prepare the ambushes ! For the Lord hath both devised and done that which He spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	13	O thou that dwellest upon many waters , abundant in treasures , thine end is come , and the measure of thy covetousness .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	14	The Lord of hosts hath sworn by Himself , saying , “ Surely I will fill thee with men , as with caterpillars , and they shall lift up a shout against thee. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	15	He hath made the earth by His power ; He hath established the world by His wisdom , and hath stretched out the heaven by His understanding .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	16	When He uttereth His voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens , and He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth . He maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of His treasures .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	17	Every man is brutish by his knowledge ; every founder is confounded by the graven image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	18	They are vanity , the work of errors ; in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	19	The portion of Jacob is not like them , for He is the former of all things ; and Israel is the rod of His inheritance ; the Lord of Hosts is His name .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	20	“ Thou art My battleax and weapons of war ; for with thee will I break in pieces the nations , and with thee will I destroy kingdoms .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	21	And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider ; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	22	With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young ; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	23	I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock ; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen ; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	24	And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	25	“ Behold , I am against thee , O destroying mountain , ” saith the Lord , who destroyest all the earth ; “ and I will stretch out Mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	26	And they shall not take from thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	27	Set ye up a standard in the land ! Blow the trumpet among the nations ! Prepare the nations against her ; call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz . Appoint a captain against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	28	Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes , the captains thereof , and all the rulers thereof , and all the land of his dominion .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	29	And the land shall tremble and sorrow ; for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Babylon , to make the land of Babylon a desolation , without an inhabitant .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	30	The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight , they have remained in their strongholds ; their might hath failed , they have become as women ; they have burned her dwelling places , her bars are broken .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	31	One courier shall run to meet another , and one messenger to meet another to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	32	and that the passages are stopped , and the reeds they have burned with fire , and the men of war are affrighted .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	33	For thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor ; it is time to thresh her ; yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	34	“ Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me ; he hath crushed me , he hath made me an empty vessel . He hath swallowed me up like a dragon ; he hath filled his belly with my delicacies , he hath cast me out .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	35	The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon , ” shall the inhabitant of Zion say ; “ and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea ! ” shall Jerusalem say .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	36	Therefore thus saith the Lord : “ Behold , I will plead thy cause , and take vengeance for thee ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her springs dry .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	37	And Babylon shall become heaps , a dwelling place for dragons , an astonishment and a hissing , without an inhabitant .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	38	They shall roar together like lions ; they shall yell as lions ’ whelps .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	39	In their heat I will make their feasts , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	40	“ I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter , like rams with hegoats .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	41	“ How Sheshach is taken ! And how the praise of the whole earth is surprised ! How Babylon has become an astonishment among the nations !
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	42	The sea has come up upon Babylon ; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	43	Her cities are a desolation , a dry land and a wilderness , a land wherein no man dwelleth , neither doth any son of man pass thereby .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	44	And I will punish Bel in Babylon , and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up ; and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him . Yea , the wall of Babylon shall fall .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	45	“ My people , go ye out of the midst of her , and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	46	And lest your heart faint and ye fear for the rumor that shall be heard in the land—a rumor shall both come one year , and after that in another year shall come a rumor and violence in the land , ruler against ruler ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	47	therefore , behold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be confounded , and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	48	Then the heaven and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for Babylon , for the despoilers shall come unto her from the north , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	49	As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall , so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	50	Ye that have escaped the sword , go away ; stand not still . Remember the Lord afar off , and let Jerusalem come into your mind .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	52	“ Therefore behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that I will do judgment upon her graven images ; and through all her land the wounded shall groan .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	53	Though Babylon should mount up to heaven , and though she should fortify the height of her strength , yet from Me shall despoilers come unto her , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	54	A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon , and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	55	because the Lord hath despoiled Babylon , and destroyed out of her the great voice . When her waves do roar like great waters , a noise of their voice is uttered ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	56	because the despoiler is come upon her , even upon Babylon , and her mighty men are taken ; every one of their bows is broken . For the Lord God of recompenses shall surely requite .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	57	“ And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men , her captains and her rulers and her mighty men ; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake , ” saith the King , whose name is the Lord of Hosts .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	58	Thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the people shall labor in vain , and the folk in the fire ; and they shall be weary. ”
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah , when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign . And this Seraiah was a quiet prince .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	60	So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon , even all these words that are written against Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah , “ When thou comest to Babylon and shalt see , and shalt read all these words ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	62	then shalt thou say , ‘ O Lord , Thou hast spoken against this place to cut it off , that none shall remain in it , neither man nor beast , but that it shall be desolate for ever. ’
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	63	And it shall be , when thou hast made an end of reading this book , that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates .
KJ21	Jeremiah	51	64	And thou shalt say , ‘ Thus shall Babylon sink , and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her ; and they shall be weary. ’ ” Thus far are the words of Jeremiah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	52	Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . And his mother ’ s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	2	And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	3	For because of the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , till He had cast them out from His presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	4	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , on the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came — he and all his army — against Jerusalem , and encamped against it and built forts against it round about .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	5	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of King Zedekiah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	6	And in the fourth month , on the ninth day of the month , the famine was sore in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	7	Then the city was broken into , and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls , which was by the king ’ s garden ( now the Chaldeans were by the city round about ) , and they went by the way of the plain .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	9	Then they took the king and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he gave judgment upon him .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	10	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes ; he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	11	Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah . And the king of Babylon bound him in chains and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	12	Now in the fifth month , on the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan , captain of the guard , who served the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	13	And he burned the house of the Lord , and the king ’ s house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem and all the houses of the great men burned he with fire .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	14	And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	15	Then Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , carried away captive certain of the poor of the people and the residue of the people who remained in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Babylon , and the rest of the multitude .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	16	But Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	17	Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans broke , and carried all their brass to Babylon .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	18	The caldrons also , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the bowls , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	19	And the basins , and the firepans , and the bowls , and the caldrons , and the candlesticks , and the spoons , and the cups — that which was of gold in gold and that which was of silver in silver — took the captain of the guard away .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	20	The two pillars , one sea , and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases , which King Solomon had made in the house of the Lord — the brass of all these vessels was beyond weighing .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	21	And concerning the pillars , the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits , and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it , and the thickness thereof was four fingers ; it was hollow .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	22	And a capital of brass was upon it ; and the height of one capital was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the capitals round about , all of brass . The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	23	And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side ; and all the pomegranates upon the network were a hundred round about .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	24	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the door .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	25	He took also out of the city a eunuch who had the charge of the men of war , and seven men from those who were near the king ’ s person who were found in the city , and the principal scribe of the host who mustered the people of the land , and threescore men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	26	So Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	27	And the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	28	These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year , three thousand Jews and three and twenty ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	30	in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	31	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the five and twentieth day of the month , that Evilmerodach king of Babylon , in the first year of his reign , lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him forth out of prison ;
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	32	and he spoke kindly unto him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon ,
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	33	and changed his prison garments . And Jehoiachin continually ate bread before him all the days of his life .
KJ21	Jeremiah	52	34	And for his diet , there was a continual diet given him by the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	1	How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people ! How she has become as a widow ! She that was great among the nations and princess among the provinces , how she has become tributary !
KJ21	Lamentations	1	2	She weepeth sorely in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her . All her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they have become her enemies .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	3	Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude . She dwelleth among the heathen , she findeth no rest ; all her persecutors overtook her in her straits .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	4	The highways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn feasts ; all her gates are desolate . Her priests sigh , her virgins are afflicted , and she is in bitterness .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	5	Her adversaries are the master , her enemies prosper ; for the Lord hath afflicted her . For the multitude of her transgressions , her children have gone into captivity before the enemy .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	6	And from the daughter of Zion , all her beauty is departed ; her princes have become like harts that find no pasture , and they have gone without strength before the pursuer .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	7	Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old . When her people fell into the hand of the enemy and none did help her , the adversaries saw her , and mocked at her Sabbaths .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	8	Jerusalem hath grievously sinned ; therefore she has become a wanderer . All that honored her despise her , because they have seen her nakedness ; yea , she sigheth , and turneth backward .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	9	Her filthiness is in her skirts ; she remembereth not her last end . Therefore she came down wondrously ; she had no comforter . “ O Lord , behold my affliction , for the enemy hath magnified himself ! ”
KJ21	Lamentations	1	10	The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things ; for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary , whom Thou didst command that they should not enter into Thy congregation .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	11	All her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul . “ See , O Lord , and consider , for I have become vile. ”
KJ21	Lamentations	1	12	“ Is it nothing to you , all ye that pass by ? Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow , which is done unto me , wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of His fierce anger .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	13	From above hath He sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them . He hath spread a net for my feet , He hath turned me back ; He hath made me desolate and faint all the day .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	14	The yoke of my transgressions is bound up by His hand ; they are wreathed , and come up upon my neck . He hath made my strength to fall ; the Lord hath delivered me into their hands , from whom I am not able to rise up .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	15	The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me ; He hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men ; the Lord hath trodden the virgin , the daughter of Judah , as in a wine press .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	16	For these things I weep ; mine eye , mine eye runneth down with water , because the Comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me . My children are desolate , because the enemy prevailed. ”
KJ21	Lamentations	1	17	Zion spreadeth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her . The Lord hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him ; Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	18	“ The Lord is righteous , for I have rebelled against His commandment . Hear , I pray you , all people , and behold my sorrow ; my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	19	I called for my lovers , but they deceived me ; my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city , while they sought their meat to relieve their souls .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	20	“ Behold , O Lord , for I am in distress ; my bowels are troubled . Mine heart is turned within me , for I have grievously rebelled . Abroad the sword bereaveth ; at home there is as death .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	21	They have heard that I sigh ; there is none to comfort me . All mine enemies have heard of my trouble ; they are glad that Thou hast done it ! Thou wilt bring the day that Thou hast proclaimed , and they shall then be like unto me .
KJ21	Lamentations	1	22	Let all their wickedness come before Thee , and do unto them as Thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions ; for my sighs are many , and my heart is faint . ”
KJ21	Lamentations	2	2	The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob , and hath not pitied ; He hath thrown down in His wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah . He hath brought them down to the ground ; He hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	3	He hath cut off in His fierce anger all the horn of Israel . He hath drawn back His right hand from before the enemy , and He burned against Jacob like a flaming fire , which devoureth round about .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	4	He hath bent His bow like an enemy ; He stood with His right hand as an adversary , and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion ; He poured out His fury like fire .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	5	The Lord was as an enemy ; He hath swallowed up Israel , He hath swallowed up all her palaces . He hath destroyed his strongholds , and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	6	And He hath violently taken away His tabernacle , as if it were of a garden ; He hath destroyed His places of the assembly . The Lord hath caused the solemn feasts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion , and hath despised in the indignation of His anger the king and the priest .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	7	The Lord hath cast off His altar ; He hath abhorred His sanctuary . He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces ; they have made a noise in the house of the Lord , as in the day of a solemn feast .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	8	The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion ; He hath stretched out a line , He hath not withdrawn His hand from destroying . Therefore He made the rampart and the wall to lament ; they languished together .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	9	Her gates are sunk into the ground ; He hath destroyed and broken her bars . Her king and her princes are among the Gentiles ; the law is no more ; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	10	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground and keep silence ; they have cast up dust upon their heads . They have girded themselves with sackcloth ; the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	11	Mine eyes do fail with tears , my soul is troubled ; my passion is poured upon the earth , because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	12	They say to their mothers , “ Where is corn and wine ? ” when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their soul was poured out into their mothers ’ bosom .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	13	What thing shall I take to witness for thee ? What thing shall I liken to thee , O daughter of Jerusalem ? What shall I equal to thee , that I may comfort thee , O virgin daughter of Zion ? For thy breach is great like the sea . Who can heal thee ?
KJ21	Lamentations	2	14	Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee ; and they have not exposed thine iniquity , to return you from captivity , but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	15	All that pass by clap their hands at thee ; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem , saying , “ Is this the city that men call ‘ The perfection of beauty , the joy of the whole earth ’ ? ”
KJ21	Lamentations	2	16	All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee ; they hiss and gnash their teeth . They say , “ We have swallowed her up . Certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it. ”
KJ21	Lamentations	2	17	The Lord hath done that which He had devised ; He hath fulfilled His word that He had commanded in the days of old . He hath thrown down , and hath not pitied ; and He hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee ; He hath set up the horn of thine adversaries .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	18	Their heart cried unto the Lord . O wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night . Give thyself no rest ; let not the apple of thine eye cease .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	19	Arise , cry out in the night ; in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord . Lift up thy hands toward Him for the life of thy young children , that faint for hunger on top of every street .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	20	Behold , O Lord , and consider to whom Thou hast done this . Shall the women eat their fruit , their children of a span long ? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
KJ21	Lamentations	2	21	The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets ; my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword . Thou hast slain them in the day of Thine anger ; Thou hast killed and not pitied .
KJ21	Lamentations	2	22	Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about , so that in the day of the Lord ’ S anger none escaped nor remained ; those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	3	Surely against me is He turned ; He turneth His hand against me all the day .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	2	He hath led me , and brought me into darkness , but not into light .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	4	My flesh and my skin hath He made old ; He hath broken my bones .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	5	He hath builded against me , and compassed me with gall and travail .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	6	He hath set me in dark places , as they that are dead of old .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	7	He hath hedged me about , that I can not get out ; He hath made my chain heavy .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	8	Also when I cry and shout , He shutteth out my prayer .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	9	He hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone ; He hath made my paths crooked .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	10	He was unto me as a bear lying in wait , and as a lion in secret places .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	11	He hath turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces ; He hath made me desolate .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	12	He hath bent His bow , and set me as a mark for the arrow .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	13	He hath caused the arrows of His quiver to enter into my reins .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	14	I was a derision to all my people , and their song all the day .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	15	He hath filled me with bitterness ; He hath made me drunken with wormwood .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	16	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones ; He hath covered me with ashes .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	17	And Thou hast removed my soul far off from peace ; I forgot prosperity .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	18	And I said , “ My strength and my hope are perished from the Lord , ”
KJ21	Lamentations	3	19	remembering mine affliction and my misery , the wormwood and the gall .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	20	My soul hath them still in remembrance , and is humbled in me .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	21	This I recall to my mind ; therefore have I hope :
KJ21	Lamentations	3	22	It is through the Lord ’ S mercies that we are not consumed , because His compassions fail not .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	23	They are new every morning ; great is Thy faithfulness .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	24	“ The Lord is my portion , ” saith my soul , “ Therefore will I hope in Him. ”
KJ21	Lamentations	3	25	The Lord is good unto them that wait for Him , to the soul that seeketh Him .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	26	It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	27	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	28	He sitteth alone and keepeth silence , because he hath borne it upon him .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	29	He putteth his mouth in the dust ; if so it be , there may be hope .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	30	He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him ; he is filled full with reproach .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	31	For the Lord will not cast off for ever .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	32	But though He cause grief , yet will He have compassion according to the multitude of His mercies .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	33	For He doth not afflict willingly , nor grieve the children of men .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	34	To crush under His feet all the prisoners of the earth ,
KJ21	Lamentations	3	35	to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High ,
KJ21	Lamentations	3	36	to subvert a man in his cause—the Lord approveth not .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	37	Who is he that saith and it cometh to pass , when the Lord commandeth it not ?
KJ21	Lamentations	3	38	Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not evil and good ?
KJ21	Lamentations	3	39	Why then doth a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ?
KJ21	Lamentations	3	40	Let us search and try our ways , and turn again to the Lord .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	41	Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	42	We have transgressed and have rebelled ; Thou hast not pardoned .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	43	Thou hast covered Thyself with anger and persecuted us ; Thou hast slain , Thou hast not pitied .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	44	Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud , that our prayer should not pass through .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	45	Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	46	All our enemies have opened their mouths against us .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	47	Fear and a snare have come upon us , desolation and destruction .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	48	Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	49	Mine eye trickleth down and ceaseth not , without any intermission ,
KJ21	Lamentations	3	50	till the Lord look down and behold from heaven .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	51	Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	52	Mine enemies chased me sorely like a bird , without cause .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	53	They have cut off my life in the dungeon , and cast a stone upon me .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	54	Waters flowed over mine head ; then I said , “ I am cut off ! ”
KJ21	Lamentations	3	55	I called upon Thy name , O Lord , out of the low dungeon .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	56	Thou hast heard my voice : “ Hide not Thine ear at my breathing , at my cry. ”
KJ21	Lamentations	3	57	Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon Thee ; Thou saidst , “ Fear not. ”
KJ21	Lamentations	3	58	O Lord , Thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul ; Thou hast redeemed my life .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	59	O Lord , Thou hast seen my wrong ; judge Thou my cause .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	60	Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginings against me .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	61	Thou hast heard their reproach , O Lord , and all their imaginings against me ,
KJ21	Lamentations	3	62	the lips of those that rose up against me , and their devices against me all the day .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	63	Behold their sitting down and their rising up ; I am their music .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	64	Render unto them a recompense , O Lord , according to the work of their hands .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	65	Give them sorrow of heart , Thy curse unto them .
KJ21	Lamentations	3	66	Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the Lord .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	4	The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst ; the young children ask bread , and no man breaketh it unto them .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	2	The precious sons of Zion , comparable to fine gold , how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the potter !
KJ21	Lamentations	4	3	Even the seamonsters draw out the breast , they give suck to their young ones ; but the daughter of my people has become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	5	They that fed on delicacies are desolate in the streets ; they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	6	For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom , that was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands stayed on her .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	7	Her Nazirites were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk ; they were more ruddy in body than rubies , their polishing was of sapphire .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	8	Now their visage is blacker than coal ; they are not known in the streets ; their skin cleaveth to their bones , it is withered , it has become like a stick .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	9	They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger ; for these pine away , stricken through for want of the fruits of the field .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	10	The hands of the pitying women have sodden their own children ; they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	11	The Lord hath accomplished His fury ; He hath poured out His fierce anger , and hath kindled a fire in Zion , and it hath devoured the foundations thereof .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	12	The kings of the earth , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	13	For the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests , that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her ,
KJ21	Lamentations	4	14	they have wandered as blind men in the streets ; they have polluted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their garments .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	15	They cried unto them , “ Depart ye ; it is unclean ! Depart , depart , touch not ! ” When they fled away and wandered , it was said among the heathen , “ They shall no more sojourn there. ”
KJ21	Lamentations	4	16	The anger of the Lord hath divided them ; He will no more regard them ; they respected not the persons of the priests , they favored not the elders .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	17	As for us , our eyes as yet failed for our vain help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	18	They hunt our steps , that we can not go in our streets ; our end is near , our days are fulfilled , for our end has come .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	19	Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heavens ; they pursued us upon the mountains , they lay in wait for us in the wilderness .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	20	The breath of our nostrils , the anointed of the Lord , was taken in their pits , of whom we said , “ Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. ”
KJ21	Lamentations	4	21	Rejoice and be glad , O daughter of Edom , that dwellest in the land of Uz . The cup also shall pass through unto thee ; thou shalt be drunken and shalt make thyself naked .
KJ21	Lamentations	4	22	The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished , O daughter of Zion ; He will no more carry thee away into captivity . He will visit thine iniquity , O daughter of Edom ; He will uncover thy sins .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	5	Our necks are under persecution ; we labor and have no rest .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	2	Our inheritance is turned to strangers , our houses to aliens .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	3	We are orphans and fatherless , our mothers are as widows .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	4	We have paid money for water we drink ; our wood is sold unto us .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	6	We have given the hand to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians to be provided with bread .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	7	Our fathers have sinned , and are no more ; and we have borne their iniquities .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	8	Servants have ruled over us ; there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	9	We got our bread with the peril of our lives , because of the sword of the wilderness .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	10	Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	11	They ravished the women in Zion , and the maids in the cities of Judah .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	12	Princes are hanged up by their hand ; the faces of elders were not honored .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	13	They took the young men to grind , and the children fell under the wood .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	14	The elders have ceased from the gate , the young men from their music .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	15	The joy of our heart is ceased ; our dance is turned into mourning .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	16	The crown is fallen from our head . Woe unto us that we have sinned !
KJ21	Lamentations	5	17	For this our heart is faint ; for these things our eyes are dim .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	18	Because of the mountain of Zion which is desolate , the foxes walk upon it .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	19	Thou , O Lord , remainest for ever , Thy throne from generation to generation .
KJ21	Lamentations	5	20	Why dost Thou forget us for ever , and forsake us so long a time ?
KJ21	Lamentations	5	21	Turn Thou us unto Thee , O Lord , and we shall be turned ! Renew our days as of old ! —
KJ21	Lamentations	5	22	But Thou hast utterly rejected us ; Thou art very wroth against us .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	1	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , on the fifth day of the month , as I was among the captives by the River of Chebar , that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	2	On the fifth day of the month ( which was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin ’ s captivity ) ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	3	the word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi , in the land of the Chaldeans by the River Chebar ; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	4	And I looked , and behold , a whirlwind came out of the north , a great cloud , and a fire infolding itself ; and a brightness was about it , and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber , out of the midst of the fire .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	5	Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures . And this was their appearance : they had the likeness of a man .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	6	And every one had four faces , and every one had four wings .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	7	And their feet were straight feet , and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf ’ s foot ; and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	8	And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and all four had their faces and their wings .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	9	Their wings were joined one to another . They turned not when they went ; they went every one straight forward .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	10	As for the likeness of their faces , all four had the face of a man , and the face of a lion on the right side , and all four had the face of an ox on the left side ; they four also had the face of an eagle .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	11	Thus were their faces . And their wings were stretched upward ; two wings of every one were joined one to another , and two covered their bodies .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	12	And they went every one straight forward ; whither the spirit was to go , they went , and they turned not when they went .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	13	As for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps ; it went up and down among the living creatures , and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	14	And the living creatures ran and returned , like the appearance of a flash of lightning .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	15	Now as I beheld the living creatures , behold , a wheel was upon the earth by each of the living creatures with his four faces .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	16	The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of beryl , and all four had the same likeness ; and their appearance and their work was , as it were , a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	17	When they went , they went upon their four sides ; and they turned not when they went .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	18	As for their rims , they were so high that they were dreadful ; and their rims were full of eyes round about the four .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	19	And when the living creatures went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	20	Whithersoever the spirit was to go , they went ; thither was their spirit to go : and the wheels were lifted up opposite them , for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	21	When those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up opposite them , for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	22	And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creatures was as the color of the terrible crystal , stretched forth over their heads above .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	23	And under the firmament were their wings straight , the one toward the other ; every one had two which covered on this side , and every one had two which covered on that side of their bodies .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	24	And when they went , I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters , as the voice of the Almighty , the voice of speech as the noise of a host . When they stood , they let down their wings ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	25	and there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wings .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	26	And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , with the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness in appearance of a man above upon it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	27	And I saw as the color of amber , with the appearance of fire round about within it . From the appearance of His loins even upward and from the appearance of His loins even downward , I saw , as it were , the appearance of fire , and it had brightness round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	1	28	As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain , so was the appearance of the brightness round about . This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord . And when I saw it , I fell upon my face , and I heard a voice of One who spoke .
KJ21	Ezekiel	2	2	And the Spirit entered into me when He spoke unto me , and set me upon my feet , so that I heard Him who spoke unto me .
KJ21	Ezekiel	2	3	And He said unto me , “ Son of man , I send thee to the children of Israel , to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against Me . They and their fathers have transgressed against Me , even unto this very day ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	2	4	for they are impudent children and stiffhearted . I send thee unto them ; and thou shalt say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	2	5	And they , whether they will hear or whether they will forbear ( for they are a rebellious house ) , yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	2	6	“ And thou , son of man , be not afraid of them , neither be afraid of their words , though briers and thorns be with thee and thou dost dwell among scorpions . Be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks , though they be a rebellious house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	2	7	And thou shalt speak My words unto them , whether they will hear or whether they will forbear , for they are most rebellious .
KJ21	Ezekiel	2	8	But thou , son of man , hear what I say unto thee . Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house . Open thy mouth , and eat what I give thee. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	2	9	And when I looked , behold , a hand was sent unto me ; and lo , a scroll of a book was therein .
KJ21	Ezekiel	2	10	And He spread it before me ; and it was written within and without , and there were written therein lamentations and mourning and woe .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	3	And He said unto me , “ Son of man , cause thy belly to eat , and fill thy bowels with this scroll that I give thee. ” Then did I eat it , and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	2	So I opened my mouth , and He caused me to eat that scroll .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	4	And He said unto me , “ Son of man , go , get thee unto the house of Israel , and speak with My words unto them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	5	For thou art not sent to a people of strange speech and of a hard language , but to the house of Israel ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	6	not to many people of strange speech and of a hard language , whose words thou canst not understand . Surely , had I sent thee to them , they would have hearkened unto thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	7	But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee , for they will not hearken unto Me ; for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	8	Behold , I have made thy face strong against their faces , and thy forehead strong against their foreheads .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	9	As an adamant , harder than flint , have I made thy forehead . Fear them not , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they be a rebellious house. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	10	Moreover He said unto me , “ Son of man , all My words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart , and hear with thine ears .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	11	And go , get thee to those of the captivity , unto the children of thy people , and speak unto them and tell them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God , ’ whether they will hear or whether they will forbear. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	12	Then the Spirit took me up , and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing , saying , “ Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	13	I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another , and the noise of the wheels opposite them , and a noise of a great rushing .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	14	So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	15	Then I came to those of the captivity at Telabib , who dwelt by the River of Chebar ; and I sat where they sat , and remained there astonished among them seven days .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	16	And it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	17	“ Son of man , I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; therefore hear the word out of My mouth , and give them warning from Me .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	18	When I say unto the wicked , ‘ Thou shalt surely die , ’ and thou givest him not warning , nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life , the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thine hand .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	19	Yet if thou warn the wicked , and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	20	Again , when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity , and I lay a stumbling block before him , he shall die . Because thou hast not given him warning , he shall die in his sin , and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered ; but his blood will I require at thine hand .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	21	Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not , and he doth not sin , he shall surely live because he is warned ; also thou hast delivered thy soul. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	22	And the hand of the Lord was there upon me ; and He said unto me , “ Arise , go forth into the plain , and I will there talk with thee. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	23	Then I arose and went forth into the plain , and behold , the glory of the Lord stood there , as the glory which I saw by the River of Chebar ; and I fell on my face .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	24	Then the Spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet , and spoke with me and said unto me , “ Go , shut thyself within thine house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	25	But thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	26	And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover , for they are a rebellious house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	3	27	But when I speak with thee , I will open thy mouth , and thou shalt say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God. ’ He that heareth , let him hear ; and he that forbeareth , let him forbear ; for they are a rebellious house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	4	“ Also lie thou upon thy left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it : according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it , thou shalt bear their iniquity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	2	and lay siege against it , and build a fort against it , and cast a mound against it . Set the camp also against it , and set battering rams against it round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	3	Moreover take thou unto thee an iron plate , and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city ; and set thy face against it , and it shall be besieged , and thou shalt lay siege against it . This shall be a sign to the house of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	5	For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and ninety days ; so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	6	And when thou hast accomplished them , lie again on thy right side , and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days : I have appointed thee each day for a year .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	7	Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem ; and thine arm shall be uncovered , and thou shalt prophesy against it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	8	And behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another until thou hast ended the days of thy siege .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	9	“ Take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans , and lentils and millet and fitches , and put them in one vessel , and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side ; three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	10	And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day . From time to time shalt thou eat it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	11	Thou shalt drink also water by measure , a sixth part of a hin . From time to time shalt thou drink .
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	12	And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes , and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man in their sight. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	13	And the Lord said , “ Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles , whither I will drive them. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	14	Then said I , “ Ah , Lord God ! Behold , my soul hath not been polluted ; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself or is torn in pieces ; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	15	Then He said unto me , “ Lo , I have given thee cow ’ s dung for man ’ s dung , and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	16	Moreover He said unto me , “ Son of man , behold , I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem ; and they shall eat bread by weight and with care , and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishment ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	4	17	that they may lack bread and water , and be stunned one with another , and be consumed away for their iniquity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	5	“ Thus saith the Lord God : This is Jerusalem . I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	2	Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city , when the days of the siege are fulfilled ; and thou shalt take a third part and smite about it with a knife , and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind ; and I will draw out a sword after them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	3	Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number , and bind them in thy skirts .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	4	Then take of them again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	6	And she hath changed My judgments into wickedness more than the nations , and My statutes more than the countries that are round about her ; for they have refused My judgments and My statutes . They have not walked in them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	7	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you , and have not walked in My statutes , neither have kept My judgments , neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	8	therefore thus saith the Lord God : Behold I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	9	And I will do in thee that which I have not done , and the like of which I will not do any more , because of all thine abominations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	10	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	11	“ Therefore as I live , saith the Lord God , surely because thou hast defiled My sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine abominations , therefore will I also diminish thee ; neither shall Mine eye spare , neither will I have any pity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	12	A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence , and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee ; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee ; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds , and I will draw out a sword after them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	13	Thus shall Mine anger be accomplished , and I will cause My fury to rest upon them , and I will be comforted ; and they shall know that I , the Lord , have spoken it in My zeal when I have accomplished My fury upon them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	14	“ Moreover I will make thee a waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee , in the sight of all that pass by .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	15	So it shall be a reproach and a taunt , an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee , when I shall execute judgments upon thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes . I , the Lord , have spoken it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	16	When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you , and I will increase the famine upon you , and will break your staff of bread ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	5	17	so will I send upon you famine and evil beasts , and they shall bereave thee ; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee , and I will bring the sword upon thee . I , the Lord , have spoken it . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	6	In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste , and the high places shall be desolate , that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate , and your idols may be broken and cease , and your images may be cut down , and your works may be abolished .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	2	“ Son of man , set thy face toward the mountains of Israel , and prophesy against them
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	3	and say : ‘ Ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God . Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains and to the hills , to the rivers and to the valleys : Behold I , even I , will bring a sword upon you , and I will destroy your high places .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	4	And your altars shall be desolate , and your images shall be broken ; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	5	And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	7	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	8	“ ‘ Yet will I leave a remnant , that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through the countries .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	9	And they that escape from among you shall remember Me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives , because I am broken with their whorish heart which hath departed from Me , and with their eyes which go a whoring after their idols . And they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	10	And they shall know that I am the Lord , and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	11	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Smite with thine hand and stamp with thy foot , and say : “ Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel ! ” For they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	12	He that is far off shall die of the pestilence , and he that is near shall fall by the sword , and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine ; thus will I accomplish My fury upon them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	13	Then shall ye know that I am the Lord , when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars , upon every high hill , on all the tops of the mountains , and under every green tree , and under every thick oak , the place where they offered sweet savor to all their idols .
KJ21	Ezekiel	6	14	So will I stretch out My hand upon them and make the land desolate , yea , more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath , in all their habitations ; and they shall know that I am the Lord . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	7	The morning is come unto thee , O thou that dwellest in the land ; the time is come , the day of trouble is near , and not the sounding again of the mountains .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	2	“ Also , thou son of man , thus saith the Lord God unto the land of Israel : “ An end ! The end is come upon the four corners of the land .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	3	Now is the end come upon thee , and I will send Mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee according to thy ways , and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	4	And Mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity ; but I will recompense thy ways upon thee , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	5	“ Thus saith the Lord God : An evil , an only evil , behold , is come !
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	6	An end is come , the end is come ! It watcheth for thee ; behold , it is come .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	8	Now will I shortly pour out My fury upon thee , and accomplish Mine anger upon thee ; and I will judge thee according to thy ways , and will recompense thee for all thine abominations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	9	And Mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity . I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	10	“ Behold the day , behold , it is come ! The morning is gone forth , the rod hath blossomed , pride hath budded .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	11	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness ; none of them shall remain , nor of their multitude , nor of any of theirs ; neither shall there be wailing for them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	12	The time is come , the day draweth near . Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn , for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	13	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive ; for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	14	“ They have blown the trumpet , even to make all ready ; but none goeth to the battle , for My wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	15	The sword is without , and the pestilence and the famine within . He that is in the field shall die with the sword , and he that is in the city , famine and pestilence shall devour him .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	16	But they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them mourning , every one for his iniquity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	17	All hands shall be feeble , and all knees shall be weak as water .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	18	They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be upon all faces , and baldness upon all their heads .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	19	They shall cast their silver in the streets , and their gold shall be removed ; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord . They shall not satisfy their souls , neither fill their bowels , because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	20	“ As for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty ; but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein ; therefore have I set it far from them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	21	And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil , and they shall pollute it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	22	My face will I turn also from them , and they shall pollute My secret place ; for the robbers shall enter into it and defile it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	23	“ Make a chain , for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	24	Therefore I will bring the worst of the heathen , and they shall possess their houses . I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease , and their holy places shall be defiled .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	25	Destruction cometh ; and they shall seek peace , and there shall be none .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	26	Mischief shall come upon mischief , and rumor shall be upon rumor . Then shall they seek a vision of the prophet , but the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the ancients .
KJ21	Ezekiel	7	27	The king shall mourn , and the prince shall be clothed with desolation , and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled . I will do unto them according to their way , and according to their deserts will I judge them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	8	Then said He unto me , “ Son of man , dig now in the wall ” ; and when I had dug in the wall , behold , a door .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	2	Then I beheld , and lo , a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of His loins even downward , fire , and from His loins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the color of amber .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	3	And He put forth the form of a hand , and took me by a lock of mine head ; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven , and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem , to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north , where was the seat of the image of jealousy , which provoketh to jealousy .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	4	And behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the vision that I saw in the plain .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	5	Then said He unto me , “ Son of man , lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. ” So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and beheld northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	6	He said furthermore unto me , “ Son of man , seest thou what they do , even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here , that I should depart far off from My sanctuary ? But turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abominations. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	7	And He brought me to the door of the court ; and when I looked , behold , a hole in the wall .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	9	And He said unto me , “ Go in , and behold the wicked abominations that they do here. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	10	So I went in and saw ; and behold , every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of Israel portrayed upon the wall round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	11	And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel , and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , with every man his censer in his hand ; and a thick cloud of incense went up .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	12	Then said He unto me , “ Son of man , hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in the chambers of his images ? For they say , ‘ The Lord seeth us not . The Lord hath forsaken the earth. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	13	He said also unto me , “ Turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	14	Then He brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord ’ S house which was toward the north ; and behold , there sat women weeping for Tammuz .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	15	Then said He unto me , “ Hast thou seen this , O son of man ? Turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abominations than these. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	16	And He brought me into the inner court of the Lord ’ S house , and behold , at the door of the temple of the Lord , between the porch and the altar , were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east ; and they worshiped the sun toward the east .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	17	Then He said unto me , “ Hast thou seen this , O son of man ? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here ? For they have filled the land with violence and have returned to provoke Me to anger ; and lo , they put the branch to their nose .
KJ21	Ezekiel	8	18	Therefore will I also deal in fury . Mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity ; and though they cry in Mine ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	9	9	Then said He unto me , “ The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great , and the land is full of blood and the city full of perverseness ; for they say , ‘ The Lord hath forsaken the earth , and the Lord seeth not. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	9	2	And behold , six men came from the way of the higher gate , which lieth toward the north , and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand ; and one man among them was clothed with linen , with a writer ’ s inkhorn by his side . And they went in and stood beside the brazen altar .
KJ21	Ezekiel	9	3	And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub , whereupon he was , to the threshold of the house . And He called to the man clothed with linen , who had the writer ’ s inkhorn by his side ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	9	4	and the Lord said unto him , “ Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and who cry because of all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	9	5	And to the others He said in mine hearing , “ Go ye after him through the city and smite . Let not your eye spare , neither have ye pity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	9	6	Slay utterly old and young , both maids and little children and women ; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark ; and begin at My sanctuary. ” Then they began with the elder men who were before the house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	9	7	And He said unto them , “ Defile the house , and fill the courts with the slain . Go ye forth. ” And they went forth and slew in the city .
KJ21	Ezekiel	9	8	And it came to pass , while they were slaying them and I was left , that I fell upon my face and cried , and said , “ Ah Lord God ! Wilt Thou destroy all the residue of Israel in Thy pouring out of Thy fury upon Jerusalem ? ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	9	10	And as for Me also , Mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will recompense their ways upon their heads. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	9	11	And behold , the man clothed with linen , who had the inkhorn by his side , reported the matter , saying , “ I have done as Thou hast commanded me . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	10	And as for their appearance , all four had one likeness , as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	2	And He spoke unto the man clothed with linen , and said , “ Go in between the wheels , even under the cherub , and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims , and scatter them over the city. ” And he went in in my sight .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	3	Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	4	Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord ’ S glory .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	5	And the sound of the cherubims ’ wings was heard even to the outer court , as the voice of the Almighty God when He speaketh .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	6	And it came to pass that when He had commanded the man clothed with linen , saying , “ Take fire from between the wheels , from between the cherubims , ” then he went in and stood beside the wheels .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	7	And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims , and took thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen , who took it and went out .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	8	And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man ’ s hand under their wings .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	9	And when I looked , behold , the four wheels by the cherubims , one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub ; and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	11	When they went , they went upon their four sides . They turned not as they went , but to the place whither the head looked they followed it ; they turned not as they went .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	12	And their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes round about — even the wheels that the four had .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	13	As for the wheels , it was cried unto them in my hearing , “ O wheel. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	14	And every one had four faces : the first face was the face of a cherub , and the second face was the face of a man , and the third the face of a lion , and the fourth the face of an eagle .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	15	And the cherubims were lifted up . This is the living creature that I saw by the River of Chebar .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	16	And when the cherubims went , the wheels went alongside them ; and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the same wheels also turned not from beside them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	17	When they stood , these stood , and when they were lifted up , these lifted up themselves also ; for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	18	Then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubims .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	19	And the cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight . When they went out , the wheels also were beside them , and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord ’ S house ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over above them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	20	This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the River of Chebar ; and I knew that they were the cherubims .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	21	Every one had four faces apiece , and every one four wings , and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
KJ21	Ezekiel	10	22	And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I saw by the River of Chebar , their appearances and themselves . They went every one straight forward .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	11	This city shall not be your caldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; but I will judge you in the border of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	2	Then said He unto me : “ Son of man , these are the men who devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this city ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	3	who say , ‘ It is not near ; let us build houses : this city is the caldron , and we are the flesh. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	4	Therefore prophesy against them , prophesy , O son of man. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	5	And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me , and said unto me , “ Speak ! Thus saith the Lord : Thus have ye said , O house of Israel ; for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	6	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city , and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	7	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron ; but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	8	Ye have feared the sword ; and I will bring a sword upon you , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	9	And I will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	10	Ye shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	12	And ye shall know that I am the Lord ; for ye have not walked in My statutes , neither executed My judgments , but have done according to the manner of the heathen who are round about you. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	13	And it came to pass when I prophesied , that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died . Then fell I down upon my face , and cried with a loud voice and said , “ Ah , Lord God ! Wilt Thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel ? ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	14	Again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	15	“ Son of man , thy brethren , even thy brethren , the men of thy kindred , and all the house of Israel wholly , are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said , ‘ Get you far from the Lord ; unto us is this land given as a possession. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	16	Therefore say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Although I have cast them far off among the heathen , and although I have scattered them among the countries , yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	17	Therefore say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	18	And they shall come thither , and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	19	And I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them a heart of flesh ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	20	that they may walk in My statutes and keep Mine ordinances , and do them . And they shall be My people , and I will be their God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	21	But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will recompense their way upon their own heads , saith the Lord God. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	22	Then the cherubims lifted up their wings , and the wheels beside them , and the glory of the God of Israel was over them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	23	And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	24	Afterwards the Spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea to those of the captivity . So the vision that I had seen went up from me .
KJ21	Ezekiel	11	25	Then I spoke unto those of the captivity all the things that the Lord had shown me .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	12	And the prince who is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight , and shall go forth ; they shall dig through the wall to carry out through it . He shall cover his face , that he see not the ground with his eyes .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	2	“ Son of man , thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house , who have eyes to see and see not ; they have ears to hear and hear not , for they are a rebellious house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	3	Therefore , thou son of man , prepare thee supplies for departure , and remove by day in their sight ; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight . It may be they will consider , though they are a rebellious house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	4	Then shalt thou bring forth thy goods by day in their sight , as supplies for removing ; and thou shalt go forth at evening in their sight , as they that go forth into captivity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	5	Dig thou through the wall in their sight , and carry out through it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	6	In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders and carry it forth in the twilight . Thou shalt cover thy face , that thou see not the ground ; for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	7	And I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my goods by day , as supplies for captivity , and in the evening I dug through the wall with mine hand . I brought them forth in the twilight , and I bore them upon my shoulder in their sight .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	8	And in the morning came the word of the Lord unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	9	“ Son of man , hath not the house of Israel , the rebellious house , said unto thee , ‘ What doest thou ? ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	10	Say thou unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel that are among them. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	11	Say , ‘ I am your sign : as I have done , so shall it be done unto them . They shall remove and go into captivity. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	13	My net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in My snare ; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	14	And I will scatter toward every wind all who are about him to help him , and all his troops ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	15	And they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the countries .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	16	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine and from the pestilence , that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come ; and they shall know that I am the Lord. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	17	Moreover the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	18	“ Son of man , eat thy bread with quaking , and drink thy water with trembling and with sorrow ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	19	and say unto the people of the land , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God of the inhabitants of Jerusalem and of the land of Israel : They shall eat their bread with sorrow , and drink their water with dismay , that her land may be desolate of all that is therein , because of the violence of all them that dwell therein .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	20	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be desolate ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	21	And the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	22	“ Son of man , what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel , saying , ‘ The days are prolonged , and every vision faileth ’ ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	23	Tell them therefore , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : I will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel. ’ But say unto them , ‘ The days are at hand , and the effect of every vision .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	24	For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	25	For I am the Lord : I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass ; it shall be no more put off . For in your days , O rebellious house , will I say the word and will perform it , saith the Lord God. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	26	Again the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	27	“ Son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , ‘ The vision that he seeth is for many days to come , and he prophesieth of the times that are far off. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	12	28	Therefore say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : There shall none of My words be put off any more , but the word which I have spoken shall be done , saith the Lord God . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	13	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : I will even rend it with a stormy wind in My fury ; and there shall be an overflowing shower in Mine anger and great hailstones in My fury to consume it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	2	“ Son of man , prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy , and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts : ‘ Hear ye the word of the Lord !
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	3	Thus saith the Lord God : Woe unto the foolish prophets , who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing !
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	4	O Israel , thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts .
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	5	Ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	6	They have seen vanity and lying divination , saying , “ The Lord saith , ” but the Lord hath not sent them ; and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	7	Have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lying divination , wherein ye say , “ The Lord saith it , ” albeit I have not spoken ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	8	“ ‘ Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Because ye have spoken vanity and seen lies , therefore , behold , I am against you , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	9	And Mine hand shall be upon the prophets who see vanity and who divine lies ; they shall not be in the assembly of My people , neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel , neither shall they enter into the land of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	10	“ ‘ Because , even because they have seduced My people , saying , “ Peace , ” and there was no peace , and one built up a wall , and lo , others daubed it with untempered mortar ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	11	say unto those who daub it with untempered mortar that it shall fall . There shall be an overflowing shower , and ye , O great hailstones , shall fall , and a stormy wind shall rend it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	12	Lo , when the wall has fallen , shall it not be said unto you , “ Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it ? ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	14	So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered , and it shall fall and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	15	Thus will I accomplish My wrath upon the wall and upon them that have daubed it with untempered mortar , and will say unto you : “ The wall is no more , neither they that daubed it ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	16	to wit , the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem , and who see visions of peace for her and there is no peace , saith the Lord God. ” ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	17	“ Likewise , thou son of man , set thy face against the daughters of thy people who prophesy out of their own heart ; and prophesy thou against them
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	18	and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Woe to the women who sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of those of every stature to hunt souls ! Will ye hunt the souls of My people , and will ye save the souls alive who come unto you ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	19	And will ye pollute Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread , to slay the souls who should not die and to save the souls alive that should not live , by your lying to My people who hear your lies ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	20	“ ‘ Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I am against your pillows , wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly ; and I will tear them from your arms and will let the souls go , even the souls whom ye hunt to make them fly .
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	21	Your kerchiefs also will I tear and deliver My people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	22	Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad , and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	13	23	therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinations ; for I will deliver My people out of your hand , and ye shall know that I am the Lord . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	14	Though these three men , Noah , Daniel , and Job were in it , they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	2	And the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	3	“ Son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face . Should I be inquired of at all by them ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	4	Therefore speak unto them and say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face , and cometh to the prophet , I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	5	that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart , because they are all estranged from Me through their idols. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	6	“ Therefore say unto the house of Israel , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Repent , and turn yourselves from your idols , and turn away your faces from all your abominations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	7	For every one of the house of Israel , or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel , who separateth himself from Me and setteth up his idols in his heart , and putteth the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face , and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him concerning Me , I the Lord will answer him by Myself .
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	8	And I will set My face against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of My people ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	9	And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing , I the Lord have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out My hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of My people Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	10	And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity . The punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	11	that the house of Israel may go no more astray from Me , neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions , but that they may be My people and I may be their God , saith the Lord God. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	12	The word of the Lord came again to me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	13	“ Son of man , when the land sinneth against Me by trespassing grievously , then will I stretch out Mine hand upon it , and will break the staff of the bread thereof , and will send famine upon it , and will cut off man and beast from it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	15	If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land , and they spoil it so that it be desolate , that no man may pass through because of the beasts ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	16	though these three men were in it , as I live , saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters . They only shall be delivered , but the land shall be desolate .
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	17	Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say , ‘ Sword , go through the land , ’ so that I cut off man and beast from it ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	18	though these three men were in it , as I live , saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters , but they only shall be delivered themselves .
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	19	Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out My fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	20	though Noah , Daniel , and Job were in it , as I live , saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter . They shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	21	“ For thus saith the Lord God : How much more when I send My four sore judgments upon Jerusalem — the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence — to cut off from it man and beast ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	22	Yet , behold , therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth , both sons and daughters . Behold , they shall come forth unto you , and ye shall see their way and their doings ; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem , even concerning all that I have brought upon it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	14	23	And they shall comfort you , when ye see their ways and their doings ; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , saith the Lord God . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	15	15	And the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	15	2	“ Son of man , what is the vine tree more than any tree , or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	15	3	Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work ? Or will men take a peg from it to hang any vessel thereon ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	15	4	Behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire devoureth both the ends of it , and the middle of it is burned . Is it meet for any work ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	15	5	Behold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work . How much less shall it be meet yet for any work when the fire hath devoured it and it is burned ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	15	6	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : As the vine tree among the trees of the forest which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Ezekiel	15	7	And I will set My face against them : they shall go out from one fire , and another fire shall devour them . And ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I set My face against them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	15	8	And I will make the land desolate , because they have committed a trespass , saith the Lord God . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	16	And of thy garments thou didst take , and decked thy high places with divers colors and played the harlot thereupon . The like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	2	“ Son of man , cause Jerusalem to know her abominations
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	3	and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem : Thy birth and thy nativity are of the land of Canaan ; thy father was an Amorite and thy mother a Hittite .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	4	And as for thy nativity , on the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut , neither wast thou washed in water to soothe thee . Thou wast not salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	5	No eye pitied thee to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the loathing of thy person on the day that thou wast born .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	6	“ ‘ And when I passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood , I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood , “ Live ” ; yea , I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood , “ Live. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	7	I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field , and thou hast increased and waxed great , and thou art come to excellent ornaments . Thy breasts are fashioned and thine hair is grown , whereas thou wast naked and bare .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	8	“ ‘ Now when I passed by thee and looked upon thee , behold , thy time was the time of love ; and I spread My skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness . Yea , I swore unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee , saith the Lord God , and thou becamest Mine .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	9	Then washed I thee with water ; yea , I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee , and I anointed thee with oil .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	10	I clothed thee also with embroidered work and shod thee with badgers ’ skin , and I girded thee about with fine linen , and I covered thee with silk .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	11	I decked thee also with ornaments , and I put bracelets upon thy hands and a chain on thy neck .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	12	And I put a jewel on thy forehead , and earrings in thine ears , and a beautiful crown upon thine head .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	13	Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver , and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk and embroidered work . Thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil ; and thou wast exceeding beautiful , and thou didst prosper into a kingdom .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	14	And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty ; for it was perfect through My comeliness , which I had put upon thee , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	15	“ ‘ But thou didst trust in thine own beauty , and played the harlot because of thy renown , and poured out thy fornications on every one that passed by : his it was .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	17	Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of My gold and of My silver , which I had given thee , and madest for thyself images of men and didst commit whoredom with them ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	18	and tookest thy embroidered garments and covered them ; and thou hast set Mine oil and Mine incense before them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	19	My meat also which I gave thee — fine flour and oil and honey , wherewith I fed thee — thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savor ; and thus it was , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	20	Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters , whom thou hast borne unto Me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured . Is this thy whoredoms a small matter ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	21	that thou hast slain My children and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	22	And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , when thou wast naked and bare and wast polluted in thy blood .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	23	“ ‘ And it came to pass after all thy wickedness ( Woe , woe unto thee ! saith the Lord God ) ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	24	that thou hast also built unto thee a brothel house , and hast made thee a high place in every street .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	25	Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way , and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred , and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by , and multiplied thy whoredoms .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	26	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbors , great of flesh , and hast increased thy whoredoms to provoke Me to anger .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	27	Behold , therefore I have stretched out My hand over thee , and have diminished thine ordinary food , and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee , the daughters of the Philistines , who are ashamed of thy lewd way .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	28	Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians , because thou wast unsatiable ; yea , thou hast played the harlot with them and yet couldest not be satisfied .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	29	Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea , and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	30	“ ‘ How weak is thine heart , saith the Lord God , seeing thou doest all these things , the work of an imperious whorish woman ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	31	in that thou buildest thine eminent place at the head of every way and makest thine high place in every street , and hast not been as a harlot in that thou scornest hire ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	32	but as a wife that committeth adultery , that taketh strangers instead of her husband !
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	33	Gifts are given to all whores , but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers , and hirest them , that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	34	And it is the contrary in thee from other women in thy whoredoms , whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms ; and in that thou givest a reward and no reward is given unto thee , therefore thou art contrary .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	35	“ ‘ Therefore , O harlot , hear the word of the Lord !
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	36	Thus saith the Lord God : Because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers , and with all the idols of thy abominations , and by the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto them ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	37	behold , therefore I will gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure , and all them that thou hast loved , with all them that thou hast hated . I will even gather them round about against thee and will uncover thy nakedness unto them , that they may see all thy nakedness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	38	And I will judge thee , as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	39	And I will also give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down thine eminent place and shall break down thy high places . They shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take thy fair jewels , and leave thee naked and bare .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	40	They shall also bring up a company against thee , and they shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	41	And they shall burn thine houses with fire , and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women ; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot , and thou also shalt give no hire any more .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	42	So will I make My fury toward thee to rest , and My jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet and will be no more angry .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	43	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , but hast made Me fret in all these things , behold , therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head , saith the Lord God ; and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	44	“ ‘ Behold , every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee , saying , “ As is the mother , so is her daughter. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	45	Thou art thy mother ’ s daughter , who loatheth her husband and her children , and thou art the sister of thy sisters , who loathed their husbands and their children . Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	46	And thine elder sister is Samaria , she and her daughters , who dwell at thy left hand ; and thy younger sister , who dwelleth at thy right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	47	Yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done according to their abominations , but , as if that were a very little thing , thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	48	As I live , saith the Lord God , Sodom thy sister hath not done , she nor her daughters , as thou hast done , thou and thy daughters .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	49	Behold , this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom : pride , fullness of bread , and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	50	and they were haughty and committed abomination before Me . Therefore I took them away as I saw good .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	51	Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins ; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they , and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	52	Thou also , who hast judged thy sisters , bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they : they are more righteous than thou . Yea , be thou confounded also and bear thy shame , in that thou hast justified thy sisters .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	53	“ ‘ When I shall bring back their captives , the captives of Sodom and her daughters and the captives of Samaria and her daughters , then will I bring back the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	54	that thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done , in that thou art a comfort unto them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	55	When thy sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate , then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	56	For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	57	before thy wickedness was uncovered , as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria and all who are round about her , the daughters of the Philistines , who despise thee round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	58	Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations , saith the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	59	“ ‘ For thus saith the Lord God : I will even deal with thee as thou hast done , who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	60	Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	61	Then thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou shalt receive thy sisters , thine elder and thy younger ; and I will give them unto thee for daughters , but not by thy covenant .
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	62	And I will establish My covenant with thee ; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	16	63	that thou mayest remember and be confounded and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame , when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done , saith the Lord God . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	17	Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war , by casting up siege mounds and building forts to cut off many persons .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	2	“ Son of man , put forth a riddle , and speak a parable unto the house of Israel ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	3	and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : A great eagle with great wings , longwinged , full of feathers which had divers colors , came unto Lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	4	He cropped off the top of it young twigs and carried it into a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of merchants .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	5	He took also of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful field . He placed it by great waters and set it as a willow tree .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	6	And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature , whose branches turned toward him and the roots thereof were under him . So it became a vine , and brought forth branches and shot forth sprigs .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	7	“ ‘ There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers ; and behold , this vine did bend her roots toward him and shot forth her branches toward him , that he might water it by the furrows of her planting .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	8	It was planted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	9	Say thou , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Shall it prosper ? Shall he not pull up the roots thereof and cut off the fruit thereof , that it wither ? It shall wither in all the leaves of her spring , even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	10	Yea , behold , being planted , shall it prosper ? Shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it ? It shall wither in the furrows where it grew. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	11	Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	12	“ Say now to the rebellious house : ‘ Know ye not what these things mean ? ’ Tell them : ‘ Behold , the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem , and hath taken the king thereof and the princes thereof , and led them with him to Babylon ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	13	and hath taken of the king ’ s seed and made a covenant with him , and hath taken an oath from him . He hath also taken the mighty of the land ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	14	that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt , that they might give him horses and many people . Shall he prosper ? Shall he escape that doeth such things ? Or shall he break the covenant and be delivered ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	16	As I live , saith the Lord God , surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king , whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke , even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	18	Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant , when , lo , he had given his hand and hath done all these things , he shall not escape .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : As I live , surely Mine oath that he hath despised and My covenant that he hath broken , even it will I recompense upon his own head .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	20	And I will spread My net upon him , and he shall be taken in My snare , and I will bring him to Babylon and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against Me .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	21	And all his fugitives with all his troops shall fall by the sword , and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds ; and ye shall know that I , the Lord , have spoken it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	22	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar , and will set it ; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one , and will plant it upon a high mountain and eminent .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	23	In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it ; and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and be a goodly cedar , and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing ; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell .
KJ21	Ezekiel	17	24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I , the Lord , have brought down the high tree , have exalted the low tree , have dried up the green tree , and have made the dry tree to flourish . I , the Lord , have spoken and have done it . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	18	As for his father , because he cruelly oppressed , despoiled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , lo , even he shall die in his iniquity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	2	“ What mean ye , that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying : ‘ The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children ’ s teeth are set on edge ’ ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	3	As I live , saith the Lord God , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	4	Behold , all souls are Mine . As the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is Mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	5	But if a man be just and do that which is lawful and right ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	6	and hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither hath defiled his neighbor ’ s wife , neither hath come near to a menstruous woman ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	7	and hath not oppressed any , but hath restored to the debtor his pledge , hath despoiled none by violence , hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	8	he that hath not given forth upon usury , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity , hath executed true judgment between man and man ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	9	hath walked in My statutes and hath kept My judgments to deal truly — he is just : he shall surely live , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	10	“ If he beget a son who is a robber , a shedder of blood , and who doeth the like to any one of these things ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	11	and who doeth not any of those duties , but even hath eaten upon the mountains and defiled his neighbor ’ s wife ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	12	hath oppressed the poor and needy , hath despoiled by violence , hath not restored the pledge and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols , hath committed abomination ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	13	hath given forth upon usury and hath taken increase — shall he then live ? He shall not live . He hath done all these abominations : he shall surely die . His blood shall be upon him .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	14	“ Now , lo , if he beget a son who seeth all his father ’ s sins which he hath done , and considereth and doeth not the like ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	15	who hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , hath not defiled his neighbor ’ s wife ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	16	neither hath oppressed any , hath not withheld the pledge , neither hath despoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	17	who hath taken off his hand from the poor , who hath not received usury nor increase , hath executed My judgments , hath walked in My statutes — he shall not die for the iniquity of his father : he shall surely live .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	19	“ Yet say ye , ‘ Why ? Doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father ? ’ When the son hath done that which is lawful and right , and hath kept all My statutes and hath done them , he shall surely live .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	20	The soul that sinneth , it shall die . The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father , neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son : the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him , and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	21	But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all My statutes and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live : he shall not die .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	22	All his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him . In his righteousness that he hath done he shall live .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	23	“ Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die , saith the Lord God , and not that he should return from his ways and live ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	24	But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth , shall he live ? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned : in his trespass that he hath trespassed and in his sin that he hath sinned , in them shall he die .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	25	“ Yet ye say , ‘ The way of the Lord is not equal. ’ Hear now , O house of Israel : Is not My way equal ? Are not your ways unequal ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	26	When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity and dieth in it , for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	27	Again , when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed , and doeth that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	28	Because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed , he shall surely live : he shall not die .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	29	Yet saith the house of Israel , ‘ The way of the Lord is not equal. ’ O house of Israel , are not My ways equal ? Are not your ways unequal ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	30	“ Therefore I will judge you , O house of Israel , every one according to his ways , saith the Lord God . Repent , and turn yourselves from all your transgressions , so iniquity shall not be your ruin .
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	31	Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed , and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit . For why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	18	32	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth , saith the Lord God . Therefore turn yourselves , and live ye .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	19	“ Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	2	and say : “ ‘ What is thy mother ? A lioness : she lay down among lions ; she nourished her whelps among young lions .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	3	And she brought up one of her whelps ; it became a young lion , and it learned to catch the prey ; it devoured men .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	4	The nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit , and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	5	Now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her whelps , and made him a young lion .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	6	And he went up and down among the lions ; he became a young lion , and learned to catch the prey and devoured men .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	7	And he knew their desolate palaces , and he laid waste their cities ; and the land was desolate and the fullness thereof by the noise of his roaring .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	8	Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces , and spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	9	And they put him under guard in chains , and brought him to the king of Babylon . They brought him into prison , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	10	“ ‘ Thy mother is like a vine in thy likeness , planted by the waters ; she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	11	And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bore rule ; and her stature was exalted among the thick branches , and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	12	But she was plucked up in fury ; she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up her fruit . Her strong rods were broken and withered ; the fire consumed them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	13	And now she is planted in the wilderness , in a dry and thirsty ground .
KJ21	Ezekiel	19	14	And fire has gone out from a rod of her branches , which hath devoured her fruit , so that she hath no strong rod to be a scepter to rule. ’ This is a lamentation , and shall be for a lamentation . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	20	and hallow My Sabbaths , and they shall be a sign between Me and you , that ye may know that I am the Lord your God. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	2	Then came the word of the Lord unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	3	“ Son of man , speak unto the elders of Israel and say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Have ye come to inquire of Me ? As I live , saith the Lord God , I will not be inquired of by you. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	4	Wilt thou judge them , son of man , wilt thou judge them ? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	5	and say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : On the day when I chose Israel , and lifted up Mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob , and made Myself known unto them in the land of Egypt , when I lifted up Mine hand unto them , saying , “ I am the Lord your God ” —
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	6	on the day that I lifted up Mine hand unto them to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	7	then said I unto them : “ Cast away every man of ye the abominations of his eyes , and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt : I am the Lord your God. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	8	But they rebelled against Me and would not hearken unto Me . They did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes , neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt . “ ‘ Then I said , “ I will pour out My fury upon them , to accomplish My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	9	But I wrought for My name ’ s sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen among whom they were , in whose sight I made Myself known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	10	Therefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	11	And I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	12	Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them , that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctify them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	13	But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness . They walked not in My statutes and they despised My judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them ; and My Sabbaths they greatly polluted . “ ‘ Then I said I would pour out My fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	14	But I wrought for My name ’ s sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , in whose sight I brought them out .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	15	Yet also I lifted up My hand unto them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	16	because they despised My judgments and walked not in My statutes , but polluted My Sabbaths ; for their heart went after their idols .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	17	Nevertheless Mine eye spared them from destroying them , neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	18	“ ‘ But I said unto their children in the wilderness : “ Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their judgments , nor defile yourselves with their idols .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	19	I am the Lord your God : Walk in My statutes , and keep My judgments , and do them ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	21	Notwithstanding , the children rebelled against Me . They walked not in My statutes , neither kept My judgments to do them , which if a man do , he shall even live in them ; they polluted My Sabbaths . “ ‘ Then I said I would pour out My fury upon them to accomplish My anger against them in the wilderness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	22	Nevertheless I withdrew Mine hand and wrought for My name ’ s sake , that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen , in whose sight I brought them forth .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	23	I lifted up Mine hand unto them also in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the heathen and disperse them through the countries ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	24	because they had not executed My judgments , but had despised My statutes and had polluted My Sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ’ idols .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	25	Therefore I gave them also statutes that were not good and judgments whereby they should not live ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	26	and I polluted them in their own gifts , in that they caused to pass through the fire all who openeth the womb , that I might make them desolate , to the end that they might know that I am the Lord. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	27	“ Therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel and say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me , in that they have committed a trespass against Me .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	28	For when I had brought them into the land for which I lifted up Mine hand to give it to them , then they saw every high hill and all the thick trees , and they offered there their sacrifices , and there they presented the provocation of their offering . There also they made their sweet savor , and poured out there their drink offerings .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	29	Then I said unto them : What is the high place whereunto ye go ? ’ ” ( And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day . )
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	30	“ Therefore say unto the house of Israel , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers ? And commit ye whoredom after their abominations ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	31	For when ye offer your gifts , when ye make your sons pass through the fire , ye pollute yourselves with all your idols , even unto this day . And shall I be inquired of by you , O house of Israel ? As I live , saith the Lord God , I will not be inquired of by you .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	32	“ ‘ And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all : in that ye say , “ We will be as the heathen , as the families of the countries , to serve wood and stone. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	33	“ ‘ As I live , saith the Lord God , surely with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out , will I rule over you .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	34	And I will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered , with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	35	and I will bring you into the wilderness of the people , and there will I plead with you face to face .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	36	As I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I plead with you , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	37	And I will cause you to pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	38	and I will purge out from among you the rebels and them that transgress against Me . I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn , and they shall not enter into the land of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	39	“ ‘ As for you , O house of Israel , thus saith the Lord God : Go ye , serve ye every one his idols , and hereafter also , if ye will not hearken unto Me ; but pollute ye My holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	40	For in Mine holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of Israel , saith the Lord God , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them in the land , serve Me . There will I accept them , and there will I require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblations , with all your holy things .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	41	I will accept you with your sweet savor when I bring you out from the people and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered ; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	42	And ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country for which I lifted up Mine hand to give it to your fathers .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	43	And there shall ye remember your ways and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	44	And ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have wrought with you for My name ’ s sake , not according to your wicked ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , O ye house of Israel , saith the Lord God. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	45	Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	46	“ Son of man , set thy face toward the south , and drop thy word toward the south , and prophesy against the forest of the southland .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	47	And say to the forest of the south : ‘ Hear the word of the Lord . Thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will kindle a fire in thee , and it shall devour every green tree in thee and every dry tree . The flaming flame shall not be quenched , and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein .
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	48	And all flesh shall see that I , the Lord , have kindled it ; it shall not be quenched. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	20	49	Then said I , “ Ah , Lord God ! They say of me , ‘ Doth he not speak parables ? ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	21	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way , at the head of the two ways , to use divination : he made his arrows bright , he consulted with images , he looked at the liver .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	2	“ Son of man , set thy face toward Jerusalem , and drop thy word toward the holy places , and prophesy against the land of Israel ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	3	and say to the land of Israel , ‘ Thus saith the Lord : Behold , I am against thee , and will draw forth My sword out of his sheath and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	4	Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall My sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	5	that all flesh may know that I , the Lord , have drawn forth My sword out of his sheath . It shall not return any more. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	6	Sigh therefore , thou son of man , with the breaking of thy loins , and with bitterness sigh before their eyes .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	7	And it shall be , when they say unto thee , ‘ Why sighest thou ? ’ that thou shalt answer , ‘ For the tidings , because it cometh ; and every heart shall melt , and all hands shall be feeble , and every spirit shall faint , and all knees shall be weak as water. ’ Behold , it cometh , and shall be brought to pass , saith the Lord God. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	8	Again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	9	“ Son of man , prophesy and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord . Say : “ ‘ A sword , a sword is sharpened and also furbished !
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	10	It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is furbished that it may glitter . Should we then make mirth ? It contemneth the rod of My son , as every tree .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	11	“ ‘ And he hath given it to be furbished , that it may be handled ; this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayer .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	12	Cry and howl , son of man ! For it shall be upon My people ; it shall be upon all the princes of Israel . Terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon My people ; smite therefore upon thy thigh .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	13	Because it is a trial , and what if the sword contemn even the rod ? It shall be no more , saith the Lord God. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	14	“ Thou therefore , son of man , prophesy , and smite thine hands together ; and let the sword be doubled the third time , the sword of the slain . It is the sword of the great men that are slain , which entereth into their secret chambers .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	15	I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint and their ruins be multiplied . Ah ! It is made bright ; it is sharpened for the slaughter .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	16	Go thee one way or other , either on the right hand or on the left , whithersoever thy face is set .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	17	I will also smite Mine hands together , and I will cause My fury to rest . I , the Lord , have said it. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	18	The word of the Lord came unto me again , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	19	“ Also , thou son of man , appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of Babylon may come ; both shall come forth out of one land . And choose thou a place ; choose it at the head of the way to the city .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	20	Appoint a way , that the sword may come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah in Jerusalem , the fortified .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	22	At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem : to appoint captains , to open the mouth in the slaughter , to lift up the voice with shouting , to appoint battering rams against the gates , to cast a siege mound , and to build a fort .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	23	And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight , to them that have sworn oaths ; but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be taken .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	24	“ Therefore thus saith the Lord God : ‘ Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered , in that your transgressions are discovered , so that in all your doings your sins do appear — because , I say , that ye have come to remembrance , ye shall be taken with the hand .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	25	And thou , profane , wicked prince of Israel , whose day is come when iniquity shall have an end ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	26	thus saith the Lord God : “ ‘ Remove the diadem and take off the crown ; this shall not be the same . Exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	27	I will overturn , overturn , overturn it . And it shall be no more , until He come whose right it is ; and I will give it to Him. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	28	“ And thou , son of man , prophesy and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach ; even say thou : “ ‘ The sword , the sword is drawn ; for the slaughter it is furbished to consume because of the glittering ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	29	while they see vanity unto thee , while they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain , of the wicked whose day is come when their iniquity shall have an end .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	30	Shall I cause it to return into his sheath ? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy nativity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	31	And I will pour out Mine indignation upon thee ; I will blow against thee in the fire of My wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skillful to destroy .
KJ21	Ezekiel	21	32	Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire ; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land . Thou shalt be no more remembered ; for I the Lord have spoken it . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	22	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof ; and ye shall know that I , the Lord , have poured out My fury upon you. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	2	“ Now , thou son of man , wilt thou judge , wilt thou judge the bloody city ? Yea , thou shalt show her all her abominations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	3	Then say thou , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it , that her time may come , and maketh idols against herself to defile herself .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	4	Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed , and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made ; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near , and art come even unto thy years . Therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen and a mocking to all countries .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	5	Those that are near and those that are far from thee shall mock thee , who art infamous and much vexed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	6	“ ‘ Behold , the princes of Israel , every one was in thee to their power to shed blood .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	7	In thee have they made light of father and mother . In the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger . In thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	8	Thou hast despised Mine holy things and hast profaned My Sabbaths .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	9	In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood , and in thee they eat upon the mountains . In the midst of thee they commit lewdness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	10	In thee have they uncovered their fathers ’ nakedness . In thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	11	And one hath committed abomination with his neighbor ’ s wife , and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law , and another in thee hath humbled his sister , his father ’ s daughter .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	12	In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood . Thou hast taken usury and increase , and thou hast greedily gained from thy neighbors by extortion , and hast forgotten Me , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	13	“ ‘ Behold , therefore I have smitten Mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	14	Can thine heart endure or can thine hands be strong in the days that I shall deal with thee ? I , the Lord , have spoken it , and will do it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	15	And I will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in the countries , and will consume thy filthiness out of thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	16	And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	17	And the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	18	“ Son of man , the house of Israel has to Me become dross . All they are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : ‘ Because ye have all become dross , behold , therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	20	As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace , to blow the fire upon it to melt it , so will I gather you in Mine anger and in My fury , and I will leave you there and melt you .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	21	Yea , I will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of My wrath , and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	23	And the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	24	“ Son of man , say unto her : ‘ Thou art the land that is not cleansed nor rained upon in the day of indignation. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	25	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof , like a roaring lion ravening the prey . They have devoured souls ; they have taken the treasure and precious things ; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	26	Her priests have violated My law and have profaned Mine holy things . They have put no difference between the holy and profane , neither have they shown difference between the unclean and the clean , and have hid their eyes from My Sabbaths , and I am profaned among them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	27	Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood and to destroy souls , to get dishonest gain .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	28	And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar , seeing vanity and divining lies unto them , saying , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God , ’ when the Lord hath not spoken .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	29	The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery , and have vexed the poor and needy ; yea , they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	30	And I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before Me for the land , that I should not destroy it ; but I found none .
KJ21	Ezekiel	22	31	Therefore have I poured out Mine indignation upon them ; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath . Their own way have I recompensed upon their heads , saith the Lord God . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	23	the Babylonians , and all the Chaldeans , Pekod , and Shoa , and Koa , and all the Assyrians with them , all of them desirable young men , captains and rulers , great lords and renowned , all of them riding upon horses .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	2	“ Son of man , there were two women , the daughters of one mother ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	3	and they committed whoredoms in Egypt ; they committed whoredoms in their youth . There were their breasts pressed , and there they bruised the teats of their virginity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	4	And the names of them were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister ; and they were Mine , and they bore sons and daughters . Thus were their names : Samaria is Oholah , and Jerusalem , Oholibah .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	5	“ And Oholah played the harlot when she was Mine ; and she doted on her lovers , on the Assyrians her neighbors ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	6	who were clothed with blue , captains and rulers , all of them desirable young men , horsemen riding upon horses .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	7	Thus she committed her whoredoms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria and with all on whom she doted . With all their idols she defiled herself .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	8	Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured their whoredom upon her .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	9	Therefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the Assyrians , upon whom she doted .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	10	These uncovered her nakedness . They took her sons and her daughters and slew her with the sword ; and she became notorious among women , for they had executed judgment upon her .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	11	“ And when her sister Oholibah saw this , she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she , and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	12	She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbors , captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously , horsemen riding upon horses , all of them desirable young men .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	13	Then I saw that she was defiled , that they both took one way ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	14	and that she increased her whoredoms . For when she saw men portrayed upon the wall , the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	15	girded with girdles upon their loins , exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads , all of them princes to look to , in the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea , the land of their nativity—
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	16	and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she doted upon them and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	17	And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their whoredom , and she was polluted with them , and her mind was alienated from them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	18	So she uncovered her whoredoms and uncovered her nakedness . Then My mind was alienated from her , as My mind was alienated from her sister .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	19	Yet she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the days of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	20	For she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	21	Thus thou called to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth , in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	22	“ Therefore , O Oholibah , thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will raise up thy lovers against thee from whom thy mind is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side :
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	24	And they shall come against thee with chariots , wagons , and wheels , and with an assembly of people , who shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about ; and I will set judgment before them , and they shall judge thee according to their judgments .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	25	And I will set My jealousy against thee , and they shall deal furiously with thee . They shall take away thy nose and thine ears , and thy remnant shall fall by the sword . They shall take thy sons and thy daughters , and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	26	They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes and take away thy fair jewels .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	27	Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt , so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them , nor remember Egypt any more .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	28	For thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will deliver thee into the hand of those whom thou hatest , into the hand of those from whom thy mind is alienated .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	29	And they shall deal with thee hatefully , and shall take away all thy labor and shall leave thee naked and bare ; and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered , both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	30	I will do these things unto thee , because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen , and because thou art polluted with their idols .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister ; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	32	“ Thus saith the Lord God : “ Thou shalt drink of thy sister ’ s cup deep and large ; thou shalt be laughed to scorn and held in derision ; it containeth much .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of dismay and desolation , with the cup of thy sister Samaria .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	34	Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt break the shards thereof , and pluck off thine own breasts . For I have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	35	“ Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Because thou hast forgotten Me and cast Me behind thy back , therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	36	The Lord said moreover unto me : “ Son of man , wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah ? Yea , declare unto them their abominations ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	37	that they have committed adultery , and blood is on their hands ; and with their idols have they committed adultery and have also caused their sons , whom they bore unto Me , to pass for them through the fire , to devour them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	38	Moreover this they have done unto Me : They have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and have profaned My Sabbaths .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	39	For when they had slain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into My sanctuary to profane it ; and lo , thus have they done in the midst of Mine house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	40	And furthermore , ye have sent for men to come from far , unto whom a messenger was sent ; and lo , they came , for whom thou didst wash thyself , painted thy eyes , and decked thyself with ornaments ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	41	and sattest upon a stately bed , and a table prepared before it , whereupon thou hast set Mine incense and Mine oil .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	42	And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her ; and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness , who put bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns upon their heads .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	43	“ Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries : ‘ Will they now commit whoredoms with her , and she with them ? ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	44	Yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot ; so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah , the lewd women .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	45	And the righteous men , they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses and after the manner of women that shed blood , because they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	46	“ For thus saith the Lord God : I will bring up a company upon them , and will give them to be removed and despoiled .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	47	And the company shall stone them with stones and dispatch them with their swords . They shall slay their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	48	Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land , that all women may be taught not to do according to your lewdness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	23	49	And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you , and ye shall bear the sins of your idols ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord God . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	24	Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign : according to all that he hath done shall ye do . And when this cometh , ye shall know that I am the Lord God. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	2	“ Son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this same day : The king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	3	And utter a parable unto the rebellious house , and say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Set on a pot , set it on , and also pour water into it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	4	Gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece — the thigh and the shoulder . Fill it with the choice bones .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	5	Take the choice of the flock , and burn also the bones under it ; and make it boil well , and let them boil the bones of it therein .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	6	“ ‘ Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Woe to the bloody city , to the pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it ! Bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall upon it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	7	For her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she poured it not upon the ground , to cover it with dust .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	8	That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance , I have set her blood upon the top of a rock , that it should not be covered .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	9	“ ‘ Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Woe to the bloody city ! I will even make the pile for fire great .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	10	Heap on wood , kindle the fire , consume the flesh , and spice it well , and let the bones be burned .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	11	Then set it empty upon the coals thereof , that the brass of it may be hot and may burn , and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it , that the scum of it may be consumed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	12	She hath wearied herself with lies , and her great scum went not forth out of her ; her scum shall be in the fire .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	13	In thy filthiness is lewdness . Because I have purged thee and thou wast not purged , thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more , till I have caused My fury to rest upon thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	14	I , the Lord , have spoken it : it shall come to pass , and I will do it . I will not go back , neither will I spare , neither will I repent . According to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee , saith the Lord God. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	15	Also the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	16	“ Son of man , behold , I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke ; yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep , neither shall thy tears run down .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	17	Forbear to cry . Make no mourning for the dead . Bind the attire of thine head upon thee , and put on thy shoes upon thy feet , and cover not thy lips , and eat not the bread of men. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	18	So I spoke unto the people in the morning , and at evening my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	19	And the people said unto me , “ Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us , that thou doest so ? ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	20	Then I answered them , “ The word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	21	Speak unto the house of Israel , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will profane My sanctuary , the excellency of your strength , the desire of your eyes , and that which your soul pitieth ; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	22	And ye shall do as I have done : Ye shall not cover your lips , nor eat the bread of men .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	23	And your attires shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet . Ye shall not mourn nor weep , but ye shall pine away for your iniquities and mourn one toward another .
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	25	“ Also , thou son of man , shall it not be on the day when I take from them their strength , the joy of their glory , the desire of their eyes , and that whereupon they set their minds , their sons and their daughters ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	26	that he that escapeth on that day shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	24	27	On that day shall thy mouth be opened to him who has escaped , and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb . And thou shalt be a sign unto them , and they shall know that I am the Lord . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	25	The word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	2	“ Son of man , set thy face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	3	and say unto the Ammonites , ‘ Hear the word of the Lord God . Thus saith the Lord God : Because thou saidst , “ Aha , ” against My sanctuary when it was profaned , and against the land of Israel when it was desolate , and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	4	behold , therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the East as a possession ; and they shall set their palaces in thee and make their dwellings in thee . They shall eat thy fruit , and they shall drink thy milk .
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	5	And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels and Ammon a couching place for flocks ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	6	For thus saith the Lord God : Because thou hast clapped thine hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced in heart with all thy contemptuous hate against the land of Israel ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	7	behold , therefore I will stretch out Mine hand upon thee and will deliver thee as spoil to the heathen ; and I will cut thee off from the people , and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries . I will destroy thee , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	8	“ Thus saith the Lord God : ‘ Because Moab and Seir do say , “ Behold , the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen , ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	9	therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country — Bethjeshimoth , Baalmeon , and Kiriathaim—
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	10	unto the men of the East with the Ammonites , and will give them in possession , that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	11	And I will execute judgments upon Moab , and they shall know that I am the Lord. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	12	“ Thus saith the Lord God : ‘ Because Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and hath greatly offended and revenged himself upon them ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	13	therefore thus saith the Lord God : I will also stretch out Mine hand upon Edom and will cut off man and beast from it , and I will make it desolate from Teman ; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword .
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	14	And I will lay My vengeance upon Edom by the hand of My people Israel , and they shall do in Edom according to Mine anger and according to My fury ; and they shall know My vengeance , saith the Lord God. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	15	“ Thus saith the Lord God : ‘ Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge and have taken vengeance with a scornful heart to destroy it for the old hatred ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	16	therefore thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will stretch out Mine hand upon the Philistines , and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast .
KJ21	Ezekiel	25	17	And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes ; and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall lay My vengeance upon them . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	26	And it came to pass in the eleventh year , on the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	2	“ Son of man , because Tyre hath said against Jerusalem , ‘ Aha , she is broken that was the gates of the people ; she is turned unto me ; I shall be replenished , now she is laid waste , ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	3	therefore thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I am against thee , O Tyre , and will cause many nations to come up against thee , as the sea causeth his waves to come up .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	4	And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers . I will also scrape her dust from her , and make her like the top of a rock .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	5	It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea , for I have spoken it , saith the Lord God ; and it shall become a spoil to the nations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	6	And her daughters who are in the field shall be slain by the sword ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	7	“ For thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , a king of kings from the north , with horses and with chariots and with horsemen and companies , and many people .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	8	He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field ; and he shall make a fort against thee , and cast a siege mound against thee , and lift up the buckler against thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	9	And he shall set engines of war against thy walls , and with his axes he shall break down thy towers .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	10	By reason of the abundance of his horses , their dust shall cover thee . Thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the chariots when he shall enter into thy gates , as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	11	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets . He shall slay thy people by the sword , and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	12	And they shall make a spoil of thy riches and make a prey of thy merchandise ; and they shall break down thy walls and destroy thy pleasant houses ; and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	13	And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease , and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	14	And I will make thee like the top of a rock ; thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon . Thou shalt be built no more ; for I the Lord have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	15	“ Thus saith the Lord God to Tyre : Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall , when the wounded cry , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	16	Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones , and lay away their robes and put off their embroidered garments . They shall clothe themselves with trembling ; they shall sit upon the ground , and shall tremble at every moment and be astonished at thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	17	And they shall take up a lamentation for thee and say to thee : “ ‘ How art thou destroyed , that wast inhabited by seafaring men , the renowned city , which wast strong in the sea , she and her inhabitants , who cause their terror to be on all that haunt it !
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	18	Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall ; yea , the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	19	“ For thus saith the Lord God : When I shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited , when I shall bring up the deep upon thee and great waters shall cover thee ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	20	when I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit with the people of olden times , and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth , in places desolate of old with them that go down to the pit , that thou be not inhabited , and I shall set glory in the land of the living ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	26	21	I will make thee a terror , and thou shalt be no more . Though thou be sought for , yet shalt thou never be found again , saith the Lord God . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	27	Thy riches and thy fairs , thy merchandise , thy mariners , and thy pilots , thy caulkers , and the traders of thy merchandise , and all thy men of war that are in thee , and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	2	“ Now , thou son of man , take up a lamentation for Tyre ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	3	and say unto Tyre , ‘ O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea , who art a merchant of the people for many isles , thus saith the Lord God : “ ‘ O Tyre , thou hast said , “ I am of perfect beauty. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	4	Thy borders are in the midst of the seas ; thy builders have perfected thy beauty .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	5	They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir ; they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	6	Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars ; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory , brought out of the isles of Cyprus .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	7	Fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail ; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	8	The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy mariners ; thy wise men , O Tyre , that were in thee , were thy pilots .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	9	The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy caulkers ; all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to trade for thy merchandise .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	10	“ ‘ They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army , thy men of war . They hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	11	The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about , and the Gammadims were in thy towers . They hanged their shields upon thy walls round about ; they have made thy beauty perfect .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	12	“ ‘ Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches ; with silver , iron , tin , and lead , they traded in thy fairs .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	13	Javan , Tubal , and Meshech , they were thy merchants ; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	14	Those of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	15	The men of Dedan were thy merchants ; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand ; they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	16	Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making ; they traded in thy fairs with emeralds , purple , and embroidered work , and fine linen , and coral , and agate .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	17	Judah and the land of Israel , they were thy merchants ; they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith , and pannag , and honey , and oil , and balm .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	18	Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making , for the multitude of all riches , in the wine of Helbon and white wool .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	19	Dan also and Javan , going to and fro , traded in thy fairs ; bright iron , cassia , and calamus were in thy market .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	20	Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	21	Arabia , and all the princes of Kedar , they traded with thee in lambs and rams and goats ; in these were they thy merchants .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	22	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah , they were thy merchants ; they traded in thy fairs with chief of all spices , and with all precious stones , and gold .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	23	Haran , and Canneh , and Eden , the merchants of Sheba , Asshur , and Chilmad were thy merchants .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	24	These were thy merchants in all sorts of things—in blue clothes , and embroidered work , and in chests of rich apparel , bound with cords and made of cedar , among thy merchandise .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	25	The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market , and thou wast replenished and made very glorious in the midst of the seas .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	26	Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters ; the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	28	The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	29	And all that handle the oar , the mariners , and all the pilots of the sea shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand upon the land ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	30	and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee , and shall cry bitterly and shall cast up dust upon their heads ; they shall wallow themselves in the ashes .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	31	And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee , and gird themselves with sackcloth , and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	32	And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee and lament over thee , saying , “ What city is like Tyre , like the destroyed in the midst of the sea ? ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	33	When thy wares went forth out of the seas , thou filled many people ; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	34	In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters , thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	35	All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee , and their kings shall be sore afraid ; they shall be troubled in their countenance .
KJ21	Ezekiel	27	36	The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee ; thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt be any more . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	28	The word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	2	“ Son of man , say unto the prince of Tyre , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : “ ‘ Because thine heart is lifted up and thou hast said , “ I am a god , I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the seas , ” yet thou art a man , and not God , though thou set thine heart as the heart of God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	3	Behold , thou art wiser than Daniel ; there is no secret that they can hide from thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	4	With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches , and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasuries .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	5	By thy great wisdom and by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches , and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	6	“ ‘ Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	7	behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom , and they shall defile thy brightness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	8	They shall bring thee down to the pit , and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	9	Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee , “ I am God ” ? But thou shalt be a man , and no god in the hand of him that slayeth thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	10	Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers ; for I have spoken it , saith the Lord God. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	11	Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	12	“ Son of man , take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre , and say unto him , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : “ ‘ Thou sealest up the sum , full of wisdom and perfect in beauty .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	13	Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God ; every precious stone was thy covering : the sardius , topaz , and the diamond , the beryl , the onyx , and the jasper , the sapphire , the emerald , and the carbuncle , and gold ; the workmanship of thy taborets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	14	Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth , and I have set thee so ; thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	15	Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created , till iniquity was found in thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	16	By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sinned ; therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God ; and I will destroy thee , O covering cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	17	Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty ; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness . I will cast thee to the ground ; I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	18	Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities , by the iniquity of thy traffic . Therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee ; it shall devour thee ; and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	19	All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee ; thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt thou be any more. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	20	Again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	21	“ Son of man , set thy face against Sidon , and prophesy against it
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	22	and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : “ ‘ Behold , I am against thee , O Sidon , and I will be glorified in the midst of thee ; and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall have executed judgments in her and shall be sanctified in her .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	23	For I will send into her pestilence , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	24	And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel , nor any grieving thorn of all who are round about them , who despised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	25	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered , and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen , then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to My servant Jacob .
KJ21	Ezekiel	28	26	And they shall dwell safely therein , and shall build houses and plant vineyards ; yea , they shall dwell with confidence when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	29	In the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twelfth day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	2	“ Son of man , set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and prophesy against him and against all Egypt .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	3	Speak , and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : “ ‘ Behold , I am against thee , Pharaoh king of Egypt , the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers , which hath said , “ My river is mine own , and I have made it for myself. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	4	But I will put hooks in thy jaws , and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales ; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers , and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	5	And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness , thee and all the fish of thy rivers ; thou shalt fall upon the open fields . Thou shalt not be brought together , nor gathered . I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	6	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	7	When they took hold of thee by thy hand , thou didst break and rend all their shoulder ; and when they leaned upon thee , thou brokest and madest all their loins to be at a halt .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	8	“ ‘ Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will bring a sword upon thee , and cut off man and beast out of thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	9	And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste ; and they shall know that I am the Lord , because he hath said , “ The river is mine , and I have made it. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	10	“ ‘ Behold , therefore I am against thee and against thy rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate , from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	11	No foot of man shall pass through it , nor foot of beast shall pass through it , neither shall it be inhabited forty years .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	12	And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years ; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	13	“ ‘ Yet thus saith the Lord God : At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	14	And I will bring back the captives of Egypt and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their habitation , and they shall be there a base kingdom .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	15	It shall be the least of the kingdoms , neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations ; for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	16	And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance when they shall look after them ; but they shall know that I am the Lord God. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	17	And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first month , on the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	18	“ Son of man , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a hard service against Tyre : every head was made bald and every shoulder was peeled ; yet had he no wages , nor his army , from Tyre for the service that he had served against it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall take her multitude , and take her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	20	I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor for which he served against it , because they wrought for Me , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	29	21	“ In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth , and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	30	The word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	2	“ Son of man , prophesy and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : “ ‘ Howl ye , “ Woe be the day ! ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	3	For the day is near ; even the day of the Lord is near , a cloudy day ; it shall be the time of the heathen .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	4	And the sword shall come upon Egypt , and great pain shall be in Ethiopia when the slain shall fall in Egypt ; and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	5	Ethiopia , and Libya , and Lydia , and all the mingled people , and Chub , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the sword .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	6	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord : They also that uphold Egypt shall fall , and the pride of her power shall come down ; from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	7	And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	8	And they shall know that I am the Lord , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and when all her helpers shall be destroyed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	9	“ ‘ In that day shall messengers go forth from Me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid , and great pain shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt ; for lo , it cometh .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	10	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	11	He and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land ; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	12	And I will make the rivers dry , and sell the land into the hand of the wicked ; and I will make the land waste and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers . I , the Lord , have spoken it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	13	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : I will also destroy the idols , and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph ; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt , and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	14	And I will make Pathros desolate , and will set fire in Zoan , and will execute judgments in No .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	15	And I will pour My fury upon Sin , the strength of Egypt , and I will cut off the multitude of No .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	16	And I will set fire in Egypt ; Sin shall have great pain , and No shall be rent asunder , and Noph shall have distresses daily .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	17	The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword ; and these cities shall go into captivity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	18	At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt , and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her . As for her , a cloud shall cover her , and her daughters shall go into captivity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	19	Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt ; and they shall know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first month , on the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	21	“ Son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and lo , it shall not be bound up to be healed , to put on a bandage to bind it , to make it strong to hold the sword .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	22	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	23	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand ; but I will break Pharaoh ’ s arms , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	25	But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down . And they shall know that I am the Lord when I shall put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Ezekiel	30	26	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the countries ; and they shall know that I am the Lord . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	31	And it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the third month , on the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	2	“ Son of man , speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude : “ ‘ Whom art thou like in thy greatness ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	3	Behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shadowing shroud , and of a high stature ; and his top was among the thick boughs .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	4	The waters made him great , the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants , and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	5	Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field , and his boughs were multiplied , and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters when he shot forth .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	6	All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young ; and under his shadow dwelt all great nations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	7	Thus was he fair in his greatness , in the length of his branches , for his root was by great waters .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	8	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him ; the fir trees were not like his boughs , and the chestnut trees were not like his branches , nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	9	I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches , so that all the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God envied him .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	10	“ ‘ Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height , and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	11	I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen . He shall surely deal with him . I have driven him out for his wickedness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	12	And strangers , the terrible of the nations , have cut him off and have left him . Upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen , and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land ; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow and have left him .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	13	Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain , and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	14	to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height , neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs , neither their trees stand up in their height—all that drink water . For they are all delivered unto death , to the nether parts of the earth , in the midst of the children of men , with them that go down to the pit .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	15	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning . I covered the deep for him , and I restrained the floods thereof , and the great waters were stayed ; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him , and all the trees of the field fainted for him .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	16	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall , when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit ; and all the trees of Eden , the choice and best of Lebanon , all that drink water , shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	17	They also went down into hell with him unto them that are slain with the sword , and they that were his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen .
KJ21	Ezekiel	31	18	To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden ? Yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth . Thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword . “ ‘ This is Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord God . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	32	For I have caused My terror in the land of the living ; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword , even Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord God . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	2	“ Son of man , take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say unto him , “ ‘ Thou art like a young lion of the nations , and thou art as a whale in the seas ; and thou camest forth with thy rivers , and troubled the waters with thy feet and fouled their rivers .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	3	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : I will therefore spread out My net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in My net .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	4	Then will I leave thee upon the land ; I will cast thee forth upon the open field and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee , and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	5	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains , and fill the valleys with thy height .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	6	I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest , even to the mountains ; and the rivers shall be full of thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	7	And when I shall put thee out , I will cover the heaven and make the stars thereof dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give her light .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	8	All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee , and set darkness upon thy land , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	9	“ ‘ I will also vex the hearts of many people when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations , into the countries which thou hast not known .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	10	Yea , I will make many people amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when I shall brandish My sword before them ; and they shall tremble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of thy fall .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	11	“ ‘ For thus saith the Lord God : The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	12	by the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall , the terrible of the nations , all of them . And they shall despoil the pomp of Egypt , and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	13	I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	14	Then will I make their waters deep , and cause their rivers to run like oil , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	15	When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full , when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the Lord. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	16	“ This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her . The daughters of the nations shall lament her ; they shall lament for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multitude , saith the Lord God. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	17	It came to pass also in the twelfth year , on the fifteenth day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	18	“ Son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt and cast them down , even her and the daughters of the famous nations , unto the nether parts of the earth with them that go down into the pit .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	19	‘ Whom dost thou pass in beauty ? Go down , and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	20	They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword . She is delivered to the sword ; draw her and all her multitudes .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	21	The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him : ‘ They are gone down ; they lie uncircumcised , slain by the sword. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	22	“ Assyria is there and all her company ; his graves are about him , all of them slain , fallen by the sword ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	23	whose graves are set in the sides of the pit and her company is round about her grave ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword , which caused terror in the land of the living .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	24	“ There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave , all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth , who caused their terror in the land of the living ; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	25	They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude . Her graves are round about him , all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword . Though their terror was caused in the land of the living , yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit . He is put in the midst of them that are slain .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	26	“ There is Meshech , Tubal , and all her multitude . Her graves are round about him , all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	27	And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised , who are gone down to hell with their weapons of war ; and they have laid their swords under their heads , but their iniquities shall be upon their bones , though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	28	Yea , thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised , and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	29	“ There is Edom , her kings and all her princes , who with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword . They shall lie with the uncircumcised and with them that go down to the pit .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	30	“ There are the princes of the north , all of them , and all the Sidonians , who are gone down with the slain . With their terror they are ashamed of their might , and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword , and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit .
KJ21	Ezekiel	32	31	“ Pharaoh shall see them , and shall be comforted over all his multitude , even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	33	And when this cometh to pass — lo , it will come — then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	2	“ Son of man , speak to the children of thy people and say unto them : ‘ When I bring the sword upon a land , if the people of the land take a man from their borders and set him as their watchman , and
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	3	if when he seeth the sword come upon the land , he blow the trumpet and warn the people ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	4	then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning , if the sword come and take him away , his blood shall be upon his own head .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	5	He heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning : his blood shall be upon him . But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	6	But if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet , and the people be not warned , if the sword come and take any person from among them , he is taken away in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at the watchman ’ s hand. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	7	“ So thou , O son of man , I have set thee as a watchman unto the house of Israel . Therefore thou shalt hear the word at My mouth and warn them from Me .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	8	When I say unto the wicked , ‘ O wicked man , thou shalt surely die , ’ if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way , that wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thine hand
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	9	Nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it , if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	10	“ Therefore , O thou son of man , speak unto the house of Israel : ‘ Thus ye speak , saying , “ If our transgressions and our sins be upon us and we pine away in them , how should we then live ? ” ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	11	Say unto them : ‘ As I live , saith the Lord God , I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked , but that the wicked turn from his way and live . Turn ye , turn ye from your evil ways ; for why will ye die , O house of Israel ? ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	12	Therefore , thou son of man , say unto the children of thy people : ‘ The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression . As for the wickedness of the wicked , he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness , neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	13	When I shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live , if he trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity , all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered ; but for his iniquity that he hath committed , he shall die for it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	14	Again , when I say unto the wicked , ‘ Thou shalt surely die , ’ if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	15	if the wicked restore the pledge , give back that which he had robbed , walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity , he shall surely live ; he shall not die .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	16	None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him . He hath done that which is lawful and right : he shall surely live .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	17	“ Yet the children of thy people say , ‘ The way of the Lord is not equal. ’ But as for them , their way is not equal .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	18	When the righteous turneth from his righteousness and committeth iniquity , he shall even die thereby .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	19	But if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	20	Yet ye say , ‘ The way of the Lord is not equal. ’ O ye house of Israel , I will judge you every one according to his ways. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth month , on the fifth day of the month , that one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me , saying , “ The city is smitten ! ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	22	Now the hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening before he that had escaped came , and He had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning ; and my mouth was opened , and I was no more dumb .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	23	Then the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	24	“ Son of man , they that inhabit those wastes in the land of Israel speak , saying , ‘ Abraham was one , and he inherited the land . But we are many ; the land is given us for inheritance. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	25	Therefore say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Ye eat meat with the blood , and lift up your eyes toward your idols , and shed blood . And shall ye possess the land ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	26	Ye stand upon your sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one his neighbor ’ s wife . And shall ye possess the land ? ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	27	Say thou thus unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : As I live , surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword , and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured , and they that are in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	28	For I will lay the land most desolate , and the pomp of her strength shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , that none shall pass through .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	29	Then shall they know that I am the Lord , when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	30	“ Also , thou son of man , the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses , and speak one to another , every one to his brother , saying , ‘ Come , I pray you , and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	31	And they come unto thee as the people cometh , and they sit before thee as My people , and they hear thy words , but they will not do them ; for with their mouth they show much love , but their heart goeth after their covetousness .
KJ21	Ezekiel	33	32	And lo , thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear thy words , but they do them not .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	34	And the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	2	“ Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel , prophesy and say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds : Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that feed themselves ! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	3	Ye eat the fat , and ye clothe yourselves with the wool , ye kill the ones that are fed ; but ye feed not the flock .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	4	The diseased have ye not strengthened , neither have ye healed that which was sick , neither have ye bound up that which was broken , neither have ye brought again that which was driven away , neither have ye sought that which was lost ; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	5	And they were scattered because there is no shepherd , and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	6	My sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high hill ; yea , My flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth , and none did search or seek after them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	7	“ ‘ Therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	8	As I live , saith the Lord God , surely because My flock became a prey and My flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no shepherd , neither did My shepherds search for My flock , but the shepherds fed themselves and fed not My flock ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	9	therefore , O ye shepherds , hear the word of the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	10	Thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I am against the shepherds ; and I will require My flock at their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock , neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more . For I will deliver My flock from their mouth , that they may not be meat for them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	11	“ ‘ For thus saith the Lord God : Behold I , even I , will both search My sheep and seek them out .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	12	As a shepherd seeketh out his flock on the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered , so will I seek out My sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered on the cloudy and dark day .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	13	And I will bring them out from the people and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers and in all the inhabited places of the country .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	14	I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be ; there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	15	I will feed My flock , and I will cause them to lie down , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	16	I will seek that which was lost and bring back that which was driven away , and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen that which was sick . But I will destroy the fat and the strong : I will feed them with judgment .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	17	“ ‘ And as for you , O My flock , thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I judge between cattle and cattle , between the rams and the hegoats .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	18	Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture , but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures ? And to have drunk of the deep waters , but ye must foul the residue with your feet ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	19	And as for My flock , they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet , and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	20	“ ‘ Therefore thus saith the Lord God unto them : Behold I , even I , will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	21	Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder , and pushed all the diseased with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	22	therefore will I save My flock , and they shall no more be a prey ; and I will judge between cattle and cattle .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	23	And I will set up one Shepherd over them , and He shall feed them , even My servant David . He shall feed them , and He shall be their Shepherd .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	24	And I , the Lord , will be their God , and My servant David a prince among them . I , the Lord , have spoken it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	25	“ ‘ And I will make with them a covenant of peace , and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land ; and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	26	And I will make them and the places round about My hill a blessing , and I will cause the shower to come down in his season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	27	And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit and the earth shall yield her increase , and they shall be safe in their land and shall know that I am the Lord , when I have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves by them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	28	And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen , neither shall the beast of the land devour them ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make them afraid .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	29	And I will raise up for them a plant of renown , and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land , neither bear the shame of the heathen any more .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	30	Thus shall they know that I , the Lord their God , am with them , and that they , even the house of Israel , are My people , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	34	31	And ye My flock , the flock of My pasture , are men , and I am your God , saith the Lord God . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	35	Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	2	“ Son of man , set thy face against Mount Seir , and prophesy against it
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	3	and say unto it , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Behold , O Mount Seir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out Mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate .
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	4	I will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be desolate , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	5	Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time that their iniquity had an end ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	6	therefore , as I live , saith the Lord God , I will prepare thee for blood , and blood shall pursue thee . Since thou hast not hated blood , even blood shall pursue thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	7	Thus will I make Mount Seir most desolate , and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth .
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	8	And I will fill his mountains with his slain men ; in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy rivers shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	9	I will make thee perpetual desolations , and thy cities shall not return ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	10	“ ‘ Because thou hast said , “ These two nations and these two countries shall be mine and we will possess it , ” though the Lord was there ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	11	therefore , as I live , saith the Lord God , I will even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them ; and I will make Myself known among them when I have judged thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	12	And thou shalt know that I am the Lord , and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , “ They are laid desolate . They are given us to consume. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	13	Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against Me and have multiplied your words against Me ; I have heard them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	14	Thus saith the Lord God : When the whole earth rejoiceth , I will make thee desolate .
KJ21	Ezekiel	35	15	As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate , so will I do unto thee . Thou shalt be desolate , O Mount Seir , and all Edom , even all of it ; and they shall know that I am the Lord . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	36	Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I , the Lord , build the ruined places and plant that which was desolate . I , the Lord , have spoken it , and I will do it. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	2	Thus saith the Lord God : Because the enemy hath said against you , “ Aha , even the ancient high places are ours in possession , ” ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	3	therefore prophesy and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Because they have made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side , that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen , and ye are taken up on the lips of talkers and are an infamy of the people ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	4	therefore , ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God . Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains and to the hills , to the rivers and to the valleys , to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken , which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	5	therefore thus saith the Lord God : Surely in the fire of My jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen and against all Edom , who have appointed My land into their possession with the joy of all their heart , with despiteful minds , to cast it out as a prey. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	6	Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel , and say unto the mountains and to the hills , to the rivers and to the valleys , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I have spoken in My jealousy and in My fury , because ye have borne the shame of the heathen .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	7	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : I have lifted up Mine hand . Surely the heathen who are about you , they shall bear their shame .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	8	“ ‘ But ye , O mountains of Israel , ye shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people of Israel , for they are at hand to come .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	9	For behold , I am for you , and I will turn unto you , and ye shall be tilled and sown .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	10	And I will multiply men upon you , all the house of Israel , even all of it ; and the cities shall be inhabited and the wastes shall be built .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	11	And I will multiply upon you man and beast , and they shall increase and bring fruit . And I will settle you according to your old estates , and will do better unto you than at your beginnings ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	12	Yea , I will cause men to walk upon you , even My people Israel ; and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance , and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	13	Thus saith the Lord God : Because they say unto you , “ Thou , land , devourest up men and hast bereaved thy nations , ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	14	therefore thou shalt devour men no more , neither bereave thy nations any more , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	15	Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more , neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more , saith the Lord God. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	16	Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	17	“ Son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their own way and by their doings ; their way was before Me as the uncleanness of a removed woman .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	18	Therefore I poured My fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	19	And I scattered them among the heathen , and they were dispersed through the countries ; according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	20	And when they entered unto the heathen whither they went , they profaned My holy name , when they said to them , ‘ These are the people of the Lord , and are gone forth out of His land. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	21	But I had pity for Mine holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen whither they went .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	22	“ Therefore say unto the house of Israel , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : I do not this for your sakes , O house of Israel , but for Mine holy name ’ s sake , which ye have profaned among the heathen whither ye went .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	23	And I will sanctify My great name which was profaned among the heathen , which ye have profaned in the midst of them ; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord , saith the Lord God , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	24	For I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	25	“ ‘ Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean ; from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	26	A new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you ; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you a heart of flesh .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	27	And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes , and ye shall keep My judgments and do them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	28	And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers ; and ye shall be My people , and I will be your God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	29	“ ‘ I will also save you from all your uncleannesses ; and I will call for the corn and will increase it , and lay no famine upon you .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	30	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	31	Then shall ye remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good , and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	32	Not for your sakes do I this , saith the Lord God , be it known unto you : be ashamed and confounded for your own ways , O house of Israel !
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	33	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be rebuilt .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	34	And the desolate land shall be tilled , whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	35	And they shall say , “ This land that was desolate has become like the Garden of Eden , and the waste and desolate and ruined cities have become fortified and are inhabited. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	37	“ Thus saith the Lord God : I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them . I will increase them with men like a flock .
KJ21	Ezekiel	36	38	As the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts , so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men ; and they shall know that I am the Lord . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	37	The hand of the Lord was upon me , and carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	2	and caused me to pass by them round about ; and behold , there were very many in the open valley , and lo , they were very dry .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	3	And He said unto me , “ Son of man , can these bones live ? ” And I answered , “ O Lord God , Thou knowest. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	4	Again He said unto me , “ Prophesy upon these bones and say unto them , ‘ O ye dry bones , hear the word of the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	5	Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones : Behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	6	And I will lay sinews upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	7	So I prophesied as I was commanded ; and as I prophesied , there was a noise , and behold , a shaking , and the bones came together , bone to his bone .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	8	And when I beheld , lo , the sinews and the flesh came up upon them , and the skin covered them above ; but there was no breath in them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	9	Then said He unto me , “ Prophesy unto the wind . Prophesy , son of man , and say to the wind , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Come from the four winds , O breath , and breathe upon these slain , that they may live. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	10	So I prophesied as He commanded me , and the breath came into them , and they lived and stood up upon their feet , an exceeding great army .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	11	Then He said unto me , “ Son of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel . Behold , they say , ‘ Our bones are dried and our hope is lost . We are cut off from our parts. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	12	Therefore prophesy and say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Behold , O My people , I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	13	And ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves , O My people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	14	and shall put My Spirit in you and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land . Then shall ye know that I , the Lord , have spoken it and performed it , saith the Lord. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	15	The word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	16	“ Moreover , thou son of man , take thee one stick and write upon it , ‘ For Judah and for the children of Israel , his companions. ’ Then take another stick and write upon it , ‘ For Joseph , the stick of Ephraim , and for all the house of Israel , his companions. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	17	And join them one to another into one stick , and they shall become one in thine hand .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	18	And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee , saying , ‘ Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these ? ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	19	say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will take the stick of Joseph , which is in the hand of Ephraim , and the tribes of Israel , his fellows , and will put them with him , even with the stick of Judah , and make them one stick , and they shall be one in Mine hand. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	20	And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	21	“ And say unto them , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen whither they have gone , and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	22	And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel , and one King shall be King to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	23	Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols , nor with their detestable things , nor with any of their transgressions ; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places wherein they have sinned and will cleanse them . So shall they be My people , and I will be their God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	24	“ ‘ And David My servant shall be King over them , and they all shall have one Shepherd . They shall also walk in My judgments , and observe My statutes , and do them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	25	And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob My servant , wherein your fathers have dwelt ; and they shall dwell therein , even they and their children and their children ’ s children for ever . And My servant David shall be their Prince for ever .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	26	Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them . It shall be an everlasting covenant with them . And I will place them , and multiply them , and will set My sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	27	My tabernacle also shall be with them . Yea , I will be their God , and they shall be My people .
KJ21	Ezekiel	37	28	And the heathen shall know that I , the Lord , do sanctify Israel , when My sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore . ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	38	And the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	2	“ Son of man , set thy face against Gog , the land of Magog , the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal , and prophesy against him
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	3	and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I am against thee , O Gog , the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	4	And I will turn thee back and put hooks into thy jaws , and I will bring thee forth and all thine army , horses and horsemen , all of them clothed with all sorts of armor , even a great company with bucklers and shields , all of them handling swords ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	5	Persia , Ethiopia , and Libya with them , all of them with shield and helmet ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	6	Gomer and all his bands ; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters and all his bands — and many people with thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	7	“ ‘ Be thou prepared and prepare for thyself , thou and all thy company that are assembled unto thee , and be thou a guard unto them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	8	After many days thou shalt be visited . In the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword and is gathered out of many people , against the mountains of Israel , which have been always waste ; but it is brought forth out of the nations and they shall dwell safely , all of them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	9	Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm . Thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou and all thy troops , and many people with thee .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	10	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : It shall also come to pass that at the same time shall things come into thy mind , and thou shalt think an evil thought ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	11	and thou shalt say , “ I will go up to the land of unwalled villages ; I will go to them that are at rest , who dwell safely , all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gates ” —
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	12	to take a spoil and to take a prey , to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited and upon the people who are gathered out of the nations , who have gotten cattle and goods , who dwell in the midst of the land .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	13	Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish , with all the young lions thereof , shall say unto thee , “ Art thou come to despoil us ? Hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey , to carry away silver and gold , to take away cattle and goods , to take a great spoil ? ” ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	14	“ Therefore , son of man , prophesy and say unto Gog , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : On that day when My people of Israel dwelleth safely , shalt thou not know it ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	15	And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts , thou and many people with thee , all of them riding upon horses , a great company and a mighty army .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	16	And thou shalt come up against My people of Israel as a cloud to cover the land . It shall be in the latter days ; and I will bring thee against My land , that the heathen may know Me when I shall be sanctified in thee , O Gog , before their eyes .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	17	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old times by My servants the prophets of Israel who prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against them ?
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	18	And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , saith the Lord God , that My fury shall come upon My face .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	19	For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath have I spoken : Surely on that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	20	so that the fishes of the sea , and the fowls of the heaven , and the beasts of the field , and all creeping things that creep upon the earth , and all the men that are upon the face of the earth , shall shake at My presence ; and the mountains shall be thrown down and the steep places shall fall , and every wall shall fall to the ground .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	21	And I will call for a sword against him throughout all My mountains , saith the Lord God . Every man ’ s sword shall be against his brother .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	22	And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood ; and I will rain upon him and upon his troops and upon the many people that are with him an overflowing rain , and great hailstones , fire , and brimstone .
KJ21	Ezekiel	38	23	Thus will I magnify Myself and sanctify Myself , and I will be known in the eyes of many nations ; and they shall know that I am the Lord . ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	39	“ Therefore , thou son of man , prophesy against Gog and say , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I am against thee , O Gog , the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	2	And I will turn thee back and leave but a sixth part of thee , and will cause thee to come up from the north parts and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	3	and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	4	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel , thou and all thy forces and the people that are with thee . I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	5	Thou shalt fall upon the open field , for I have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	6	And I will send a fire on Magog and among them that dwell confidently in the isles ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	7	“ ‘ So will I make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel , and I will not let them pollute My holy name any more ; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord , the Holy One in Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	8	Behold , it is come , and it is done , saith the Lord God . This is the day whereof I have spoken .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	9	“ ‘ And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth , and shall set on fire and burn the weapons , both the shields and the bucklers , the bows and the arrows , and the javelins and the spears ; and they shall burn them with fire seven years ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	10	so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests . For they shall burn the weapons with fire , and they shall despoil those that despoiled them , and rob those that robbed them , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	11	“ ‘ And it shall come to pass on that day that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel , the valley of the passersby on the east of the sea ; and it shall stop the noses of the passersby . And there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude ; and they shall call it the Valley of Hamongog [ that is , The multitude of Gog ] .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	12	And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them , that they may cleanse the land .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	13	Yea , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a day of renown the day that I shall be glorified , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	14	And they shall separate out men for continual employment , passing through the land , to bury with the passersby those who remain upon the face of the earth to cleanse it . At the end of seven months shall they search .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	15	And the passersby who pass through the land , when any seeth a man ’ s bone , then shall he set up a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamongog .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	16	And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah [ that is , The multitude ] . Thus shall they cleanse the land. ’
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	17	“ And , thou son of man , thus saith the Lord God : Speak unto every feathered fowl and to every beast of the field : ‘ Assemble yourselves and come . Gather yourselves on every side to My sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you , even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel , that ye may eat flesh and drink blood .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	18	Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth , of rams , of lambs and of goats , of bullocks , all of them fatlings of Bashan .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	19	And ye shall eat fat till ye be full and drink blood till ye be drunken of My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	20	Thus ye shall be filled at My table with horses and chariots , with mighty men and with all men of war , ’ saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	21	“ And I will set My glory among the heathen , and all the heathen shall see My judgment that I have executed and My hand that I have laid upon them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	22	So the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day and forward .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	23	And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity . Because they trespassed against Me , therefore hid I My face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies ; so fell they all by the sword .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	24	According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them , and hid My face from them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	25	“ Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Now will I bring back the captives of Jacob , and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel , and will be jealous for My holy name
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	26	after they have borne their shame and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against Me , when they dwelt safely in their land and none made them afraid .
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	27	When I have brought them back from the people and gathered them out of their enemies ’ lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	28	then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , who caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen . But I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	39	29	neither will I hide My face any more from them , for I have poured out My Spirit upon the house of Israel , saith the Lord God . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	40	And at the side outside , as one goeth up to the entry of the North Gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	2	In the visions of God brought He me into the land of Israel and set me upon a very high mountain , by which there was , as it were , the form of a city on the south .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	3	And He brought me thither , and behold , there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed ; and he stood in the gate .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	4	And the man said unto me , “ Son of man , behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears , and set thine heart upon all that I shall show thee ; for with the intent that I might show them unto thee art thou brought hither . Declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	5	And behold , a wall on the outside of the house round about , and in the man ’ s hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by a cubit and a hand breadth . So he measured the breadth of the building , one reed ; and the height , one reed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	6	Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east , and went up the stairs thereof and measured the threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad , and the other threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	7	And every little chamber was one reed long and one reed broad ; and between the little chambers were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	8	He measured also the porch of the gate within , one reed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	9	Then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and the posts thereof , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was inward .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	10	And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side and three on that side ; they three were of one measure , and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	11	And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate , ten cubits ; and the length of the gate , thirteen cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	12	The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side , and the space was one cubit on that side ; and the little chambers were six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	13	He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another ; the breadth was five and twenty cubits , door against door .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	14	He made also posts of threescore cubits , even unto the post of the court round about the gate .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	15	And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	16	And there were narrow windows to the little chambers , and to their posts within the gate round about and likewise to the arches ; and windows were round about within ; and upon each post were palm trees .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	17	Then he brought me into the outer court , and lo , there were chambers and a pavement made for the court round about ; thirty chambers were upon the pavement .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	18	And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	19	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court from outside , a hundred cubits eastward and northward .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	20	And the gate of the outer court that looked toward the north , he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	21	And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side ; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were the same measure as the first gate ; the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	22	And their windows and their arches and their palm trees were the same measure as the gate that looketh toward the east ; and they went up unto it by seven steps , and the arches thereof were before them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	23	And the gate of the inner court was opposite the gate toward the north and toward the east ; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	24	After that he brought me toward the south , and behold , a gate toward the south ; and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	25	And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about like those windows ; the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	26	And there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them ; and it had palm trees , one on this side and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	27	And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south ; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	28	And he brought me to the inner court by the South Gate . And he measured the South Gate according to these measures ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	29	and the little chambers thereof and the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures . And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about ; it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	30	And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long , and five cubits broad .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	31	And the arches thereof were toward the outer court , and palm trees were upon the posts thereof ; and the going up to it had eight steps .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	32	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east ; and he measured the gate according to these measures .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	33	And the little chambers thereof and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were according to these measures . And there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about ; it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	34	And the arches thereof were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side and on that side ; and the going up to it had eight steps .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	35	And he brought me to the North Gate and measured it according to these measures —
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	36	the little chambers thereof , the posts thereof and the arches thereof , and the windows to it round about . The length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	37	And the posts thereof were toward the outer court , and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side and on that side ; and the going up to it had eight steps .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	38	And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates , where they washed the burnt offering .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	39	And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side , to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	41	Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side by the side of the gate , eight tables upon which they slew their sacrifices .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	42	And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering , of a cubit and a half long and a cubit and a half broad and one cubit high , upon which also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	43	And within were hooks , a handbreadth wide , fastened round about ; and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	44	And outside the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the North Gate , and their prospect was toward the south , one at the side of the East Gate having the prospect toward the north .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	45	And he said unto me , “ This chamber whose prospect is toward the south is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	46	And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar ; these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi , who come near to the Lord to minister unto Him. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	47	So he measured the court , a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad , foursquare , and the altar that was before the house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	48	And he brought me to the porch of the house and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side ; and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side .
KJ21	Ezekiel	40	49	The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the breadth eleven cubits ; and he brought me by the steps by which they went up to it ; and there were pillars by the posts , one on this side and another on that side .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	41	Afterward he brought me to the temple and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tabernacle .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	2	And the breadth of the door was ten cubits ; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side and five cubits on the other side ; and he measured the length thereof , forty cubits , and the breadth , twenty cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	3	Then went he inward and measured the post of the door , two cubits ; and the door , six cubits ; and the breadth of the door , seven cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	4	So he measured the length thereof , twenty cubits ; and the breadth , twenty cubits , before the temple . And he said unto me , “ This is the Most Holy Place. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	5	After that , he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side chamber , four cubits , round about the house on every side .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	6	And the side chambers were three , one over another , and thirty in order ; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about , that they might have support , but they had no support in the wall of the house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	7	And there was an enlarging and a winding about still upward to the side chambers ; for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house . Therefore the breadth of the house was still upward , and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	8	I saw also the height of the house round about ; the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	9	The thickness of the wall , which was for the side chamber outside , was five cubits ; and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	10	And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	11	And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left , one door toward the north and another door toward the south ; and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	12	Now the building fronting the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about and the length thereof ninety cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	13	So he measured the house , a hundred cubits long ; and the separate place and the building with the walls thereof , a hundred cubits long ;
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	14	also the breadth of the face of the house and of the separate place toward the east , a hundred cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	15	And he measured the length of the building opposite the separate place which was behind it , and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side , a hundred cubits , with the inner temple and the porches of the court ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	16	the doorposts , and the narrow windows , and the galleries round about on their three stories opposite the door , ceiled with wood round about , and from the ground up to the windows ( and the windows were covered ) ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	17	to the space above the door , even unto the inner house and outside , and by all the wall round about within and without , by measure .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	18	And it was made with cherubims and palm trees , so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub ; and every cherub had two faces ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	19	so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side ; it was made through all the house round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	20	From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made , and on the wall of the temple .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	21	The posts of the temple were squared , and also the face of the sanctuary ; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	22	The altar of wood was three cubits high and the length thereof two cubits ; and the corners thereof and the length thereof and the walls thereof were of wood . And he said unto me , “ This is the table that is before the Lord. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	23	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	24	And the doors had two leaves apiece , two turning leaves : two leaves for the one door and two leaves for the other door .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	25	And there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubims and palm trees , as were made upon the walls ; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch outside .
KJ21	Ezekiel	41	26	And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick planks .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	42	Then he brought me forth into the outer court , the way toward the north ; and he brought me into the chamber that was opposite the separate place and which was before the building toward the north .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	2	Along the length of a hundred cubits was the north door , and the breadth was fifty cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	3	Opposite the twenty cubits which were for the inner court , and opposite the pavement which was for the outer court , was gallery upon gallery in three stories .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	4	And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward , a way of one cubit , and their doors toward the north .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	5	Now the upper chambers were shorter ; for the galleries were higher than these — than the lower and than the middlemost of the building .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	6	For they were in three stories , but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts ; therefore the upper building was narrowed more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	7	And the wall that was outside opposite the chambers , toward the outer court on the forepart of the chambers , the length thereof was fifty cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	8	For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits ; and lo , those before the temple were a hundred cubits .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	9	And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side , as one goeth into them from the outer court .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	10	The chambers were within the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , opposite the separate place and opposite the building .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	11	And the walk before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north , as long as they and as broad as they ; and all their exits were both according to their fashions , and according to their doors .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	12	And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the walk , the passage directly before the wall toward the east as one entereth into them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	13	Then said he unto me , “ The north chambers and the south chambers , which are in front of the separate place , they are holy chambers where the priests who approach unto the Lord shall eat the most holy things . There shall they lay the most holy things , and the meat offering , and the sin offering , and the trespass offering ; for the place is holy .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	14	When the priests enter therein , then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court ; but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister , for they are holy ; and they shall put on other garments and shall approach those things which are for the people. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	15	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	16	He measured the east side with the measuring reed , five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	17	He measured the north side , five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	18	He measured the south side , five hundred reeds with the measuring reed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	19	He turned about to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	42	20	He measured it on the four sides ; it had a wall round about , five hundred reeds long and five hundred broad , to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	43	Afterward he brought me to the gate , even the gate that looketh toward the east .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	2	And behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east ; and His voice was like a noise of many waters , and the earth shined with His glory .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	3	And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city . And the visions were like the vision that I saw by the River Chebar ; and I fell upon my face .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	4	And the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	5	So the Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court ; and behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	6	And I heard Him speaking unto me out of the house ; and the man stood by me .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	7	And He said unto me , “ Son of man , the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet , where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever , and My holy name , shall the house of Israel no more defile , neither they nor their kings , by their whoredom nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	8	In their setting of their threshold by My thresholds , and their post by My posts , and the wall between Me and them , they have even defiled My holy name by their abominations that they have committed . Therefore I have consumed them in Mine anger .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	9	Now let them put away their whoredom and the carcasses of their kings far from Me , and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	10	“ Thou son of man , show the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities ; and let them measure the pattern .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	11	And if they be ashamed of all that they have done , show them the form of the house and the fashion thereof , and the goings out thereof and the comings in thereof , and all the forms thereof , and all the ordinances thereof , and all the forms thereof , and all the laws thereof ; and write it in their sight , that they may keep the whole form thereof and all the ordinances thereof , and do them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	12	This is the law of the house : Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy . Behold , this is the law of the house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	13	“ And these are the mesurements of the altar in cubits ( the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth ) : even the bottom shall be a cubit and the breadth a cubit , and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span ; and this shall be the higher place of the altar .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	14	And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower ledge shall be two cubits and the breadth one cubit ; and from the lesser ledge even to the greater ledge shall be four cubits and the breadth one cubit .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	15	So the altar shall be four cubits ; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	16	And the altar shall be twelve cubits long , twelve broad , square in the four squares thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	17	And the ledge shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof ; and the border about it shall be half a cubit , and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about ; and his stairs shall look toward the east. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	18	And He said unto me , “ Son of man , thus saith the Lord God : These are the ordinances of the altar on the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings thereon and to sprinkle blood thereon .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	19	And thou shalt give to the priests , the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok , who approach Me to minister unto Me , saith the Lord God , a young bullock for a sin offering .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	20	And thou shalt take of the blood thereof , and put it on the four horns of it and on the four corners of the ledge and upon the border round about ; thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	21	Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering , and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house , outside the sanctuary .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	22	And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering ; and they shall cleanse the altar , as they cleansed it with the bullock .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	23	When thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	24	And thou shalt offer them before the Lord , and the priests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	25	Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering ; they shall also prepare a young bullock and a ram out of the flock , without blemish .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	26	Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it , and they shall consecrate themselves .
KJ21	Ezekiel	43	27	And when these days are expired , it shall be that upon the eighth day , and so forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , saith the Lord God . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	44	Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outer sanctuary which looketh toward the east , and it was shut .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	2	Then said the Lord unto me , “ This gate shall be shut . It shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it , because the Lord , the God of Israel , hath entered in by it ; therefore it shall be shut .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	3	It is for the prince ; the prince shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord . He shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate and shall go out by the way of the same. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	4	Then he brought me the way of the north gate before the house . And I looked , and behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord ; and I fell upon my face .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	5	And the Lord said unto me , “ Son of man , mark well , and behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord and all the laws thereof ; and mark well the entering in of the house , with every going forth of the sanctuary .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	6	And thou shalt say to the rebellious , even to the house of Israel , ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : O ye house of Israel , let it suffice you of all your abominations ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	7	in that ye have brought into My sanctuary strangers , uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in My sanctuary to pollute it , even My house , when ye offer My bread , the fat and the blood ; and they have broken My covenant because of all your abominations .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	8	And ye have not kept charge of Mine holy things ; but ye have set keepers of My charge in My sanctuary for yourselves .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	9	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : No stranger , uncircumcised in heart nor uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into My sanctuary , or any stranger that is among the children of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	10	And the Levites that have gone away far from Me when Israel went astray , who went astray away from Me after their idols , they shall even bear their iniquity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	11	Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary , having charge at the gates of the house and ministering to the house . They shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister unto them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	12	Because they ministered unto them before their idols and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity , therefore have I lifted up Mine hand against them , saith the Lord God , and they shall bear their iniquity .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	13	And they shall not come near unto Me to do the office of a priest unto Me , nor to come near to any of My holy things in the Most Holy Place ; but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	14	But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all the service thereof and for all that shall be done therein .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	15	But the priests , the Levites , the sons of Zadok that kept the charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me , they shall come near to Me to minister unto Me , and they shall stand before Me to offer unto Me the fat and the blood , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	16	They shall enter into My sanctuary , and they shall come near to My table to minister unto Me , and they shall keep My charge .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	17	And it shall come to pass that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linen garments ; and no wool shall come upon them while they minister in the gates of the inner court and within .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	18	They shall have linen headdresses upon their heads and shall have linen breeches upon their loins ; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	19	And when they go forth into the outer court , even into the outer court to the people , they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered and lay them in the holy chambers , and they shall put on other garments ; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	20	Neither shall they shave their heads nor suffer their locks to grow long ; they shall only trim the hair of their heads .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	21	Neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter into the inner court .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	22	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow nor her that is put away ; but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow who had a priest before .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	23	And they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and profane , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	24	And in controversy they shall stand in judgment , and they shall judge it according to My judgments ; and they shall keep My laws and My statutes in all Mine assemblies , and they shall hallow My Sabbaths .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	25	And they shall come near no dead person to defile themselves ; but for father or for mother , or for son or for daughter , for brother or for sister that hath had no husband , they may defile themselves .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	26	And after he is cleansed , they shall reckon unto him seven days .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	27	And on the day that he goeth into the sanctuary unto the inner court to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer his sin offering , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	28	“ ‘ And it shall be unto them for an inheritance . I am their inheritance , and ye shall give them no possession in Israel : I am their possession .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	29	They shall eat the meat offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering , and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	30	And the first of all the firstfruits of all things and every oblation of all , of every sort of your oblations , shall be the priest ’ s . Ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough , that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	44	31	The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself or torn , whether it be fowl or beast .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	45	“ ‘ Moreover , when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance , ye shall offer an oblation unto the Lord , a holy portion of the land . The length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds , and the breadth shall be ten thousand ; this shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	2	Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length with five hundred in breadth , square round about , and fifty cubits round about for the open places thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	3	And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand and the breadth of ten thousand ; and in it shall be the sanctuary and the Most Holy Place .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	4	The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests , the ministers of the sanctuary , who shall come near to minister unto the Lord ; and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	5	And the five and twenty thousand of length and the ten thousand of breadth shall also the Levites , the ministers of the house , have for themselves as a possession for twenty chambers .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	6	“ ‘ And ye shall appoint as the possession of the city five thousand broad , and five and twenty thousand long , opposite the oblation of the holy portion ; it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	7	“ ‘ And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion and of the possession of the city , before the oblation of the holy portion , and before the possession of the city , from the west side westward and from the east side eastward ; and the length shall be over against one of the portions , from the west border unto the east border .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	8	In the land shall be his possession in Israel ; and My princes shall no more oppress My people , and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	9	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : Let it suffice you , O princes of Israel . Remove violence and spoil , and execute judgment and justice . Take away your exactions from My people , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	10	“ ‘ Ye shall have just balances , and a just ephah , and a just bath .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	11	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain a tenth part of a homer , and the ephah a tenth part of a homer ; the measure thereof shall be according to the homer .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	12	And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs ; twenty shekels , five and twenty shekels , fifteen shekels shall be your maneh .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	13	“ ‘ This is the oblation that ye shall offer : a sixth part of an ephah of a homer of wheat , and ye shall give a sixth part of an ephah of a homer of barley .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	14	Concerning the ordinance of oil , the bath of oil , ye shall offer a tenth part of a bath out of the cor , which is a homer of ten baths ; for ten baths are a homer .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	15	And one lamb out of the flock of two hundred , out of the fat pastures of Israel , for a meat offering and for a burnt offering and for peace offerings , to make reconciliation for them , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	16	All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	17	And it shall be the prince ’ s part to give burnt offerings and meat offerings and drink offerings , in the feasts and in the new moons and in the Sabbaths , in all solemnities of the house of Israel . He shall prepare the sin offering and the meat offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings to make reconciliation for the house of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	18	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : In the first month , on the first day of the month , thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	19	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it upon the posts of the house and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	20	And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth , and for him that is simple ; so shall ye reconcile the house .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	21	“ ‘ In the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month , ye shall have the Passover , a feast of seven days . Unleavened bread shall be eaten .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	22	And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	23	And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord , seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days , and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	24	And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock , and an ephah for a ram , and a hin of oil for an ephah .
KJ21	Ezekiel	45	25	In the seventh month , on the fifteenth day of the month , shall he do the like at the feast of the seven days , according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meat offering , and according to the oil .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	46	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days , but on the Sabbath it shall be opened , and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	2	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate outside and shall stand by the post of the gate , and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings , and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate . Then he shall go forth , but the gate shall not be shut until the evening .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	3	Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the Lord on the Sabbaths and on the new moons .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	4	And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	5	And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram , and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	6	And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish and six lambs and a ram ; they shall be without blemish .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	7	And he shall prepare a meat offering : an ephah for a bullock , and an ephah for a ram , and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	8	And when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	9	“ ‘ But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord at the solemn feasts , he that entereth in by the way of the North Gate to worship shall go out by the way of the South Gate , and he that entereth by the way of the South Gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate ; he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in , but shall go forth opposite it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	10	And the prince in the midst of them , when they go in , shall go in , and when they go forth , shall go forth .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	11	“ ‘ And at the feasts and at the solemnities , the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock and an ephah to a ram , and to the lambs as he is able to give , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	12	Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering , or peace offerings voluntarily unto the Lord , one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east ; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day . Then he shall go forth , and after his going forth one shall shut the gate .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	13	“ ‘ Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the Lord of a lamb of the first year without blemish ; thou shalt prepare it every morning .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	14	And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning , a sixth part of an ephah and a third part of a hin of oil to temper with the fine flour — a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	15	Thus shall they prepare the lamb and the meat offering and the oil every morning for a continual burnt offering .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	16	“ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God : If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons , the inheritance thereof shall be his sons ’ ; it shall be their possession by inheritance .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	17	But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants , then it shall be his to the year of liberty ; afterward it shall return to the prince . But his inheritance shall be his sons ’ for them .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	18	Moreover the prince shall not take of the people ’ s inheritance by oppression to thrust them out of their possession ; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession , that My people be not scattered every man from his possession. ’ ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	19	After that he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy chambers of the priests which looked toward the north ; and behold , there was a place on the two sides westward .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	20	Then said he unto me , “ This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering , where they shall bake the meat offering , that they bear them not out into the outer court , to sanctify the people. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	21	Then he brought me forth into the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	22	In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad . These four corners were of one measure .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	23	And there was a row of building round about in them , round about the four , and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about .
KJ21	Ezekiel	46	24	Then said he unto me , “ These are the places of those who boil , where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people . ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	47	Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house , and behold , waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward ; for the forefront of the house stood toward the east , and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house , at the south side of the altar .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	2	Then he brought me out of the way of the gate northward , and led me about the way outside unto the outer gate by the way that looketh eastward ; and , behold , there ran out waters on the right side .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	3	And when the man who had the line in his hand went forth eastward , he measured a thousand cubits , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the ankles .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	4	Again he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees . Again he measured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the loins .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	5	Afterward he measured a thousand , and it was a river that I could not pass over ; for the waters had risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed over .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	6	And he said unto me , “ Son of man , hast thou seen this ? ” Then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	7	Now when I had returned , behold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	8	Then said he unto me , “ These waters issue out toward the east country and go down into the desert and go into the sea , which being brought forth into the sea , the waters shall be healed .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	9	And it shall come to pass that every thing that liveth , which moveth , whithersoever the rivers shall come , shall live . And there shall be a very great multitude of fish , because these waters shall come thither ; for they shall be healed , and every thing shall live whither the river cometh .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	10	And it shall come to pass that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim ; they shall be a place to spread forth nets . Their fish shall be according to their kinds , as the fish of the Great Sea , exceeding many .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	11	But the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed ; they shall be given to salt .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	12	And by the river upon the bank thereof , on this side and on that side , shall grow all trees for meat , whose leaf shall not fade , neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed . It shall bring forth new fruit according to his months , because their waters issued out of the sanctuary ; and the fruit thereof shall be for meat and the leaf thereof for medicine. ”
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	13	Thus saith the Lord God : “ This shall be the border whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel . Joseph shall have two portions .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	14	And ye shall inherit it , one as well as another , concerning which I lifted up Mine hand to give it unto your fathers ; and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	15	“ And this shall be the border of the land : toward the north side , from the Great Sea , the way of Hethlon , as men go to Zedad ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	16	Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath , Hazarhatticon , which is by the coast of Hauran .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	17	And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenon , the border of Damascus , and the north northward , and the border of Hamath . And this is the north side .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	18	“ And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran , and from Damascus , and from Gilead , and from the land of Israel by the Jordan , from the border unto the east sea . And this is the east side .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	19	“ And the south side southward , from Tamar even to the Waters of Strife in Kadesh , the river to the Great Sea . And this is the south side southward .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	20	“ The west side also shall be the Great Sea from the border till a man come opposite Hamath . This is the west side .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	21	“ So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	22	And it shall come to pass that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you , who shall beget children among you . And they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel ; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	47	23	And it shall come to pass that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth , there shall ye give him his inheritance , saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	48	“ Now these are the names of the tribes : From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon , as one goeth to Hamath , Hazarenan , the border of Damascus northward to the coast of Hamath ; for these are his sides east and west : a portion for Dan .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	2	And by the border of Dan , from the east side unto the west side : a portion for Asher .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	3	And by the border of Asher , from the east side even unto the west side : a portion for Naphtali .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	4	And by the border of Naphtali , from the east side unto the west side : a portion for Manasseh .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	5	And by the border of Manasseh , from the east side unto the west side : a portion for Ephraim .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	6	And by the border of Ephraim , from the east side even unto the west side : a portion for Reuben .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	7	And by the border of Reuben , from the east side unto the west side : a portion for Judah .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	8	“ And by the border of Judah , from the east side unto the west side , shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth , and in length as one of the other parts , from the east side unto the west side ; and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	9	The oblation that ye shall offer unto the Lord shall be of five and twenty thousand in length , and of ten thousand in breadth .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	10	And for them , even for the priests , shall be this holy oblation : toward the north five and twenty thousand in length , and toward the west ten thousand in breadth , and toward the east ten thousand in breadth , and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length . And the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	11	It shall be for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok , who have kept My charge , who went not astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	12	And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	13	And opposite the border of the priests , the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth ; all the length shall be five and twenty thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	14	And they shall not sell any of it , neither exchange nor alienate the firstfruits of the land ; for it is holy unto the Lord .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	15	“ And the five thousand that are left in the breadth opposite the five and twenty thousand , shall be a profane place for the city , for dwelling and for suburbs ; and the city shall be in the midst thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	16	And these shall be the measurements thereof : the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	17	And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty , and toward the south two hundred and fifty , and toward the east two hundred and fifty , and toward the west two hundred and fifty .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	18	And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward and ten thousand westward ; and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion , and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	19	And those who serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	20	All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand . Ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare , with the possession of the city .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	21	“ And the residue shall be for the prince , on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation , and of the possession of the city , over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border , and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border , over against the portions : for the prince . And it shall be the holy oblation , and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	22	Moreover from the possession of the Levites and from the possession of the city which is in the midst of that which is the prince ’ s , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the prince .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	23	“ As for the rest of the tribes , from the east side unto the west side , Benjamin shall have a portion .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	24	And by the border of Benjamin , from the east side unto the west side , Simeon shall have a portion .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	25	And by the border of Simeon , from the east side unto the west side , Issachar a portion .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	26	And by the border of Issachar , from the east side unto the west side , Zebulun a portion .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	27	And by the border of Zebulun , from the east side unto the west side , Gad a portion .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	28	And by the border of Gad at the south side southward , the border shall be even from Tamar unto the Waters of Strife in Kadesh , and to the river toward the Great Sea .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	29	This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their portions , ” saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	30	“ And these are the exits out of the city : On the north side , four thousand and five hundred measures ,
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	31	and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel , three gates northward : one gate of Reuben , one gate of Judah , one gate of Levi .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	32	And at the east side , four thousand and five hundred , and three gates : and one gate of Joseph , one gate of Benjamin , one gate of Dan .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	33	And at the south side , four thousand and five hundred measures , and three gates : one gate of Simeon , one gate of Issachar , one gate of Zebulun .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	34	At the west side , four thousand and five hundred , with their three gates : one gate of Gad , one gate of Asher , one gate of Naphtali .
KJ21	Ezekiel	48	35	It was round about eighteen thousand measures . “ And the name of the city from that day shall be : The Lord Is There . ”
KJ21	Daniel	1	1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah , came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it .
KJ21	Daniel	1	2	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God , which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god ; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
KJ21	Daniel	1	3	And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz , the master of his eunuchs , that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king ’ s seed and of the princes ,
KJ21	Daniel	1	4	youths in whom was no blemish , but well favored , and skillful in all wisdom , and cunning in knowledge , and understanding science , and such as had ability in them to stand in the king ’ s palace , and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans .
KJ21	Daniel	1	5	And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king ’ s meat and of the wine which he drank , so nourishing them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
KJ21	Daniel	1	6	Now among these of the children of Judah were : Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ,
KJ21	Daniel	1	7	unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names : for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , Shadrach ; and to Mishael , Meshach ; and to Azariah , Abednego .
KJ21	Daniel	1	8	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king ’ s meat , nor with the wine which he drank . Therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself .
KJ21	Daniel	1	9	Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs .
KJ21	Daniel	1	10	And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel , “ I fear my lord the king , who hath appointed your meat and your drink . For why should he see your faces sadder than the youths who are of your sort ? Then shall ye make me endanger my head before the king. ”
KJ21	Daniel	1	11	Then said Daniel to Melzar , whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ,
KJ21	Daniel	1	12	“ Test thy servants , I beseech thee , ten days , and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink .
KJ21	Daniel	1	13	Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee , and the countenance of the youths who eat of the portion of the king ’ s meat . And as thou seest , deal with thy servants. ”
KJ21	Daniel	1	14	So he consented to them in this matter , and tested them ten days .
KJ21	Daniel	1	15	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the portion of the king ’ s meat .
KJ21	Daniel	1	16	Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink , and gave them pulse .
KJ21	Daniel	1	17	As for these four youths , God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom ; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
KJ21	Daniel	1	18	Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
KJ21	Daniel	1	19	And the king communed with them , and among them all was found none like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah . Therefore stood they before the king .
KJ21	Daniel	1	20	And in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers who were in all his realm .
KJ21	Daniel	1	21	And Daniel continued even unto the first year of King Cyrus .
KJ21	Daniel	2	2	Then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the astrologers , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans to show the king his dreams . So they came and stood before the king .
KJ21	Daniel	2	3	And the king said unto them , “ I have dreamed a dream , and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	4	Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Syriac , “ O king , live for ever ! Tell thy servants the dream , and we will show the interpretation. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	5	The king answered and said to the Chaldeans , “ The thing is gone from me . If ye will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof , ye shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
KJ21	Daniel	2	6	But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof , ye shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor . Therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	7	They answered again and said , “ Let the king tell his servants the dream , and we will show the interpretation of it. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	8	The king answered and said , “ I know with certainty that ye would gain the time , because ye see the thing is gone from me .
KJ21	Daniel	2	9	But if ye will not make known unto me the dream , there is but one decree for you ; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me , till the time is changed . Therefore tell me the dream , and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	10	The Chaldeans answered before the king and said , “ There is not a man upon the earth who can show the king ’ s matter . Therefore there is no king , lord , or ruler who asked such things of any magician , or astrologer , or Chaldean .
KJ21	Daniel	2	11	And it is a rare thing that the king requireth , and there is no other who can show it before the king except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	12	For this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
KJ21	Daniel	2	13	And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain , and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain .
KJ21	Daniel	2	14	Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch , the captain of the king ’ s guard , who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon .
KJ21	Daniel	2	15	He answered and said to Arioch the king ’ s captain , “ Why is the decree from the king so hasty ? ” Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel .
KJ21	Daniel	2	16	Then Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time , and that he would show the king the interpretation .
KJ21	Daniel	2	17	Then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , his companions ,
KJ21	Daniel	2	18	that they would desire mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret , that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
KJ21	Daniel	2	19	Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision . Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven .
KJ21	Daniel	2	20	Daniel answered and said , “ Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever , for wisdom and might are His .
KJ21	Daniel	2	21	And He changeth the times and the seasons ; He removeth kings and setteth up kings . He giveth wisdom unto the wise , and knowledge to them that know understanding .
KJ21	Daniel	2	22	He revealeth the deep and secret things ; He knoweth what is in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with Him .
KJ21	Daniel	2	23	I thank Thee and praise Thee , O Thou God of my fathers , who hast given me wisdom and might , and hast made known unto me now what we desired of Thee ; for Thou hast now made known unto us the king ’ s matter. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	24	Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch , whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon . He went and said thus unto him : “ Destroy not the wise men of Babylon . Bring me in before the king , and I will show unto the king the interpretation. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	25	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste , and said thus unto him , “ I have found a man of the captives of Judah , who will make known unto the king the interpretation. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	26	The king answered and said to Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , “ Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen , and the interpretation thereof ? ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	27	Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said , “ The secret which the king hath demanded , the wise men , the astrologers , the magicians , and the soothsayers can not show unto the king .
KJ21	Daniel	2	28	But there is a God in heaven who revealeth secrets , and maketh known to King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . Thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these :
KJ21	Daniel	2	29	As for thee , O king , thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed , what should come to pass hereafter ; and He that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass .
KJ21	Daniel	2	30	But as for me , this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than anyone living , but for their sakes who shall make known the interpretation to the king , and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart .
KJ21	Daniel	2	31	“ Thou , O king , sawest ; and behold , a great image ! This great image , whose brightness was excellent , stood before thee ; and the form thereof was terrible .
KJ21	Daniel	2	32	This image ’ s head was of fine gold , his breast and his arms of silver , his belly and his thighs of brass ,
KJ21	Daniel	2	33	his legs of iron , his feet part of iron and part of clay .
KJ21	Daniel	2	34	Thou sawest until a stone was cut out without hands , which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay , and broke them to pieces .
KJ21	Daniel	2	35	Then were the iron , the clay , the brass , the silver , and the gold broken to pieces together , and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors ; and the wind carried them away , that no place was found for them . And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth .
KJ21	Daniel	2	36	“ This is the dream , and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king .
KJ21	Daniel	2	37	Thou , O king , art a king of kings ; for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom , power , and strength , and glory .
KJ21	Daniel	2	38	And wheresoever the children of men dwell , the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath He given into thine hand , and hath made thee ruler over them all . Thou art this head of gold .
KJ21	Daniel	2	39	And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee , and another third kingdom of brass , which shall bear rule over all the earth .
KJ21	Daniel	2	40	And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron , inasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things ; and as iron that breaketh all these , shall it break in pieces and bruise .
KJ21	Daniel	2	41	And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes , part of potter ’ s clay and part of iron , the kingdom shall be divided ; but there shall be in it the strength of the iron , inasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay .
KJ21	Daniel	2	42	And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay , so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken .
KJ21	Daniel	2	43	And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay , they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men ; but they shall not cleave one to another , even as iron is not mixed with clay .
KJ21	Daniel	2	44	And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a Kingdom which shall never be destroyed ; and the Kingdom shall not be left to other people , but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms , and it shall stand for ever .
KJ21	Daniel	2	45	Inasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands , and that it broke in pieces the iron , the brass , the clay , the silver , and the gold , the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter . And the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet incense unto him .
KJ21	Daniel	2	47	The king answered unto Daniel and said , “ In truth it is , that your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , seeing thou couldest reveal this secret. ”
KJ21	Daniel	2	48	Then the king made Daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts , and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon .
KJ21	Daniel	2	49	Then Daniel requested of the king , and he set Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon ; but Daniel sat in the gate of the king .
KJ21	Daniel	3	3	Then the princes , the governors , and captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counselors , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up ; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
KJ21	Daniel	3	2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes , the governors , and the captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counselors , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
KJ21	Daniel	3	4	Then a herald cried aloud : “ To you it is commanded , O people , nations , and languages ,
KJ21	Daniel	3	5	that at the time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , dulcimer , and all kinds of music , ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up .
KJ21	Daniel	3	6	And whoso falleth not down and worshipeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. ”
KJ21	Daniel	3	7	Therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and all kinds of music , all the people , the nations , and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
KJ21	Daniel	3	8	Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews .
KJ21	Daniel	3	9	They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar , “ O king , live for ever !
KJ21	Daniel	3	10	Thou , O king , hast made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds of music , shall fall down and worship the golden image ;
KJ21	Daniel	3	11	and whoso falleth not down and worshipeth , that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
KJ21	Daniel	3	12	There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon : Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . These men , O king , have not regarded thee . They serve not thy gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. ”
KJ21	Daniel	3	13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . Then they brought these men before the king .
KJ21	Daniel	3	14	Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them , “ Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , that ye do not serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
KJ21	Daniel	3	15	Now if ye be ready so that at the time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds of music , ye fall down and worship the image which I have made , it is well ; but if ye worship not , ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace . And who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands ? ”
KJ21	Daniel	3	16	Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego answered and said to the king , “ O Nebuchadnezzar , we do not fear to answer thee in this matter .
KJ21	Daniel	3	17	If it be so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and He will deliver us out of thine hand , O king .
KJ21	Daniel	3	18	But if not , be it known unto thee , O king , that we will not serve thy gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. ”
KJ21	Daniel	3	19	Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . Therefore he spoke , and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated .
KJ21	Daniel	3	20	And he commanded the most mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
KJ21	Daniel	3	21	Then these men were bound in their coats , their breeches , and their hats , and their other garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
KJ21	Daniel	3	22	Therefore because the king ’ s commandment was urgent and the furnace exceedingly hot , the flame of the fire slew those men who took up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego .
KJ21	Daniel	3	23	And these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
KJ21	Daniel	3	24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished , and rose up in haste and spoke , and said unto his counselors , “ Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? ” They answered and said unto the king , “ True , O king. ”
KJ21	Daniel	3	25	He answered and said , “ Lo , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God .
KJ21	Daniel	3	26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace , and spoke and said , “ Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , ye servants of the Most High God , come forth and come hither. ” Then Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego came forth from the midst of the fire .
KJ21	Daniel	3	27	And the princes , governors , and captains , and the king ’ s counselors , being gathered together , saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power , nor was a hair of their head singed , neither were their coats changed nor had the smell of fire passed onto them .
KJ21	Daniel	3	28	Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said , “ Blessed be the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , who hath sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him , and have changed the king ’ s word , and yielded their bodies , that they might not servenor worship any god except their own God .
KJ21	Daniel	3	29	Therefore I make a decree that every people , nation , and language which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill , because there is no other God who can deliver in this way. ”
KJ21	Daniel	3	30	Then the king promoted Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego in the province of Babylon .
KJ21	Daniel	4	4	“ I , Nebuchadnezzar , was at rest in mine house and flourishing in my palace .
KJ21	Daniel	4	2	I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the High God hath wrought toward me .
KJ21	Daniel	4	3	How great are His signs ! And how mighty are His wonders ! His Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and His dominion is from generation to generation .
KJ21	Daniel	4	5	I saw a dream which made me afraid , and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
KJ21	Daniel	4	6	Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
KJ21	Daniel	4	7	Then came in the magicians , the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers ; and I told the dream before them , but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof .
KJ21	Daniel	4	8	But at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods ; and before him I told the dream , saying ,
KJ21	Daniel	4	9	‘ O Belteshazzar , master of the magicians , because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee , tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen and the interpretation thereof .
KJ21	Daniel	4	10	Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
KJ21	Daniel	4	11	The tree grew and was strong , and the height thereof reached unto heaven , and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth .
KJ21	Daniel	4	12	The leaves thereof were fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all . The beasts of the field had shadow under it , and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof , and all flesh was fed from it .
KJ21	Daniel	4	13	“ ‘ I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and behold , a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven .
KJ21	Daniel	4	14	He cried aloud and said thus : “ Hew down the tree and cut off his branches , shake off his leaves and scatter his fruit ; let the beasts get away from under it , and the fowls from his branches .
KJ21	Daniel	4	15	Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven , and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth .
KJ21	Daniel	4	16	Let his heart be changed from man ’ s , and let a beast ’ s heart be given unto him ; and let seven times pass over him .
KJ21	Daniel	4	17	This matter is by the decree of the watchers , and the demand by the word of the holy ones , with the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever He will , and setteth up over it the basest of men. ”
KJ21	Daniel	4	18	This dream I , King Nebuchadnezzar , have seen . Now thou , O Belteshazzar , declare the interpretation thereof , inasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation ; but thou art able , for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. ’ ”
KJ21	Daniel	4	19	Then Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , was stunned for one hour , and his thoughts troubled him . The king spoke and said , “ Belteshazzar , let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee. ” Belteshazzar answered and said , “ My lord , the dream is for those who hate thee , and the interpretation thereof for thine enemies .
KJ21	Daniel	4	20	The tree that thou sawest , which grew and was strong , whose height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the earth ,
KJ21	Daniel	4	21	whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all , under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation—
KJ21	Daniel	4	22	it is thou , O king , who art grown and become strong ; for thy greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven , and thy dominion to the end of the earth .
KJ21	Daniel	4	23	And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven and saying , ‘ Hew the tree down and destroy it , yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven , and let his portion be with the beasts of the field , till seven times pass over him ’ —
KJ21	Daniel	4	24	this is the interpretation , O king , and this is the decree of the Most High , which has come upon my lord the king :
KJ21	Daniel	4	25	that they shall drive thee from men , and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field , and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen ; and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven , and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever He will .
KJ21	Daniel	4	26	And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots , thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule .
KJ21	Daniel	4	27	Therefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable unto thee ; and break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor , that it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility. ”
KJ21	Daniel	4	28	All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar .
KJ21	Daniel	4	29	At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon .
KJ21	Daniel	4	30	The king spoke and said , “ Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom , by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty ? ”
KJ21	Daniel	4	31	While the word was in the king ’ s mouth , there fell a voice from heaven , saying , “ O king Nebuchadnezzar , to thee it is spoken : The kingdom has departed from thee .
KJ21	Daniel	4	32	And they shall drive thee from men , and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field ; they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen . And seven times shall pass over thee , until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever He will. ”
KJ21	Daniel	4	33	The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar ; and he was driven from men , and ate grass as oxen , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven , till his hairs had grown like eagles ’ feathers , and his nails like birds ’ claws .
KJ21	Daniel	4	34	“ And at the end of the days I , Nebuchadnezzar , lifted up mine eyes unto heaven , and mine understanding returned unto me . And I blessed the Most High , and I praised and honored Him that liveth for ever , whose dominion is an everlasting dominion , and His Kingdom is from generation to generation .
KJ21	Daniel	4	35	And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing ; and He doeth according to His will in the army of heaven , and among the inhabitants of the earth . And none can stay His hand or say unto Him , ‘ What doest Thou ? ’
KJ21	Daniel	4	36	At the same time my reason returned unto me ; and for the glory of my kingdom , mine honor and brightness returned unto me . And my counselors and my lords sought unto me ; and I was established in my kingdom , and excellent majesty was added unto me .
KJ21	Daniel	4	37	Now I , Nebuchadnezzar , praise and extol and honor the King of heaven , all of whose works are truth , and His ways judgment . And those that walk in pride He is able to abase . ”
KJ21	Daniel	5	5	In the same hour came forth fingers of a man ’ s hand , and wrote opposite the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king ’ s palace ; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
KJ21	Daniel	5	2	Belshazzar , while he tasted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem , that the king and his princes , his wives , and his concubines might drink therein .
KJ21	Daniel	5	3	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his princes , his wives , and his concubines drank from them .
KJ21	Daniel	5	4	They drank wine , and praised the gods of gold and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
KJ21	Daniel	5	6	Then the king ’ s countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against another .
KJ21	Daniel	5	7	The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers . And the king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon , “ Whosoever shall read this writing and show me the interpretation thereof , shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about his neck , and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. ”
KJ21	Daniel	5	8	Then came in all the king ’ s wise men ; but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof .
KJ21	Daniel	5	9	Then was King Belshazzar greatly troubled , and his countenance was changed in him , and his lords were dismayed .
KJ21	Daniel	5	10	Now the queen , by reason of the words of the king and his lords , came into the banquet house . And the queen spoke and said , “ O king , live for ever ! Let not thy thoughts trouble thee , nor let thy countenance be changed .
KJ21	Daniel	5	11	There is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods . And in the days of thy father , light and understanding and wisdom , like the wisdom of the gods , was found in him whom King Nebuchadnezzar thy father — the king , I say , thy father — made master of the magicians , astrologers , Chaldeans , and soothsayers .
KJ21	Daniel	5	12	Inasmuch as an excellent spirit , and knowledge , and understanding , interpreting of dreams , and interpreting of hard sentences , and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel whom the king named Belteshazzar , now let Daniel be called and he will show the interpretation. ”
KJ21	Daniel	5	13	Then was Daniel brought in before the king . And the king spoke and said unto Daniel , “ Art thou that Daniel who art of the children of the captivity of Judah , whom the king my father brought out of Jewry ?
KJ21	Daniel	5	14	I have even heard of thee that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee .
KJ21	Daniel	5	15	And now the wise men , the astrologers , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing and make known unto me the interpretation thereof ; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing .
KJ21	Daniel	5	16	And I have heard of thee that thou canst make interpretations and dissolve doubts . Now if thou canst read the writing and make known to me the interpretation thereof , thou shalt be clothed with scarlet , and have a chain of gold about thy neck , and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom. ”
KJ21	Daniel	5	17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king , “ Let thy gifts be to thyself , and give thy rewards to another ; yet I will read the writing unto the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
KJ21	Daniel	5	18	O thou king , the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom , and majesty and glory and honor .
KJ21	Daniel	5	19	And for the majesty that He gave him , all people , nations , and languages trembled and feared before him . Whomever he would he slew ; and whomever he would he kept alive ; and whomever he would he set up ; and whomever he would he put down .
KJ21	Daniel	5	20	But when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him .
KJ21	Daniel	5	21	And he was driven from the sons of men ; and his heart was made like the beasts , and his dwelling was with the wild asses . They fed him with grass like oxen , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven , till he knew that the Most High God ruled in the kingdom of men , and that He appointeth over it whomsoever He will .
KJ21	Daniel	5	22	And thou his son , O Belshazzar , hast not humbled thine heart though thou knewest all this ,
KJ21	Daniel	5	23	but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven . And they have brought the vessels of His house before thee , and thou and thy lords , thy wives , and thy concubines have drunk wine from them ; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold , of brass , iron , wood , and stone , which see not nor hear nor know . And the God in whose hand thy breath is , and whose are all thy ways , hast thou not glorified .
KJ21	Daniel	5	24	“ Then was the part of the hand sent from Him , and this writing was written .
KJ21	Daniel	5	25	And this is the writing that was written : Mene , Mene , Tekel , Upharsin .
KJ21	Daniel	5	26	This is the interpretation of the thing . Mene : God hath numbered thy kingdom , and finished it .
KJ21	Daniel	5	27	Tekel : Thou art weighed in the balances , and art found wanting .
KJ21	Daniel	5	28	Peres : Thy kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians. ”
KJ21	Daniel	5	29	Then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with scarlet and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made a proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
KJ21	Daniel	5	30	In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain .
KJ21	Daniel	5	31	And Darius the Mede took the kingdom , being about threescore and two years old .
KJ21	Daniel	6	6	Then these presidents and princes assembled together before the king , and said thus unto him , “ King Darius , live for ever !
KJ21	Daniel	6	2	and over these , three presidents , of whom Daniel was first , that the princes might give account unto them and the king should have no damage .
KJ21	Daniel	6	3	Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
KJ21	Daniel	6	4	Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom , but they could find no occasion nor fault , inasmuch as he was faithful ; neither was there any error or fault found in him .
KJ21	Daniel	6	5	Then said these men , “ We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God. ”
KJ21	Daniel	6	7	All the presidents of the kingdom , the governors and the princes , the counselors and the captains , have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree , that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days , except of thee , O king , he shall be cast into the den of lions .
KJ21	Daniel	6	8	Now , O king , establish the decree and sign the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which altereth not. ”
KJ21	Daniel	6	9	Therefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree .
KJ21	Daniel	6	10	Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed , he went into his house ; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem , he kneeled upon his knees three times a day , and prayed and gave thanks before his God , as he did formerly .
KJ21	Daniel	6	11	Then these men assembled , and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God .
KJ21	Daniel	6	12	Then they came near , and spoke before the king concerning the king ’ s decree : “ Hast thou not signed a decree , that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days , except of thee , O king , shall be cast into the den of lions ? ” The king answered and said , “ The thing is true , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which altereth not. ”
KJ21	Daniel	6	13	Then answered they and said before the king , “ That Daniel , who is of the children of the captivity of Judah , regardeth not thee , O king , nor the decree that thou hast signed , but maketh his petition three times a day. ”
KJ21	Daniel	6	14	Then the king , when he heard these words , was sorely displeased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him .
KJ21	Daniel	6	15	Then these men assembled unto the king , and said unto the king , “ Know , O king , that the law of the Medes and Persians is : that no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed. ”
KJ21	Daniel	6	16	Then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions . Now the king spoke and said unto Daniel , “ Thy God whom thou servest continually , He will deliver thee. ”
KJ21	Daniel	6	17	And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den , and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords , that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
KJ21	Daniel	6	18	Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him , and his sleep went from him .
KJ21	Daniel	6	19	Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions .
KJ21	Daniel	6	20	And when he came to the den , he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel ; and the king spoke and said to Daniel , “ O Daniel , servant of the living God , is thy God , whom thou servest continually , able to deliver thee from the lions ? ”
KJ21	Daniel	6	21	Then said Daniel unto the king , “ O king , live for ever !
KJ21	Daniel	6	22	My God hath sent His angel , and hath shut the lions ’ mouths , that they have not hurt me , inasmuch as before Him innocency was found in me ; and also before thee , O king , have I done no hurt. ”
KJ21	Daniel	6	23	Then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . So Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
KJ21	Daniel	6	24	And the king commanded , and they brought those men who had accused Daniel , and they cast them into the den of lions — them , their children , and their wives ; and the lions had the mastery of them , and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den .
KJ21	Daniel	6	25	Then King Darius wrote unto all people , nations , and languages that dwell in all the earth : “ Peace be multiplied unto you .
KJ21	Daniel	6	26	I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel . For He is the living God and steadfast for ever , and His Kingdom , that which shall not be destroyed , and His dominion shall be even unto the end .
KJ21	Daniel	6	27	He delivereth and rescueth , and He worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth , who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. ”
KJ21	Daniel	6	28	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian .
KJ21	Daniel	7	7	After this I saw in the night visions , and behold , a fourth beast , dreadful and terrible , and strong exceedingly ; and it had great iron teeth . It devoured , and broke in pieces , and stamped the residue with the feet of it ; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it , and it had ten horns .
KJ21	Daniel	7	2	Daniel spoke and said , “ I saw in my vision by night , and behold , the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea .
KJ21	Daniel	7	3	And four great beasts came up from the sea , diverse one from another .
KJ21	Daniel	7	4	The first was like a lion , and had eagle ’ s wings . I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked , and it was lifted up from the earth , and made to stand upon the feet as a man , and a man ’ s heart was given to it .
KJ21	Daniel	7	5	And behold , another beast , a second , like unto a bear . And it raised up itself on one side , and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it ; and they said thus unto it , ‘ Arise , devour much flesh. ’
KJ21	Daniel	7	6	After this I beheld , and lo another , like a leopard , which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl . The beast had also four heads ; and dominion was given to it .
KJ21	Daniel	7	8	I considered the horns , and behold , there came up among them another little horn , before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots . And behold , in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man , and a mouth speaking great things .
KJ21	Daniel	7	9	“ I beheld till the thrones were cast down , and the Ancient of Days sat down , whose garment was white as snow and the hair of His head like the pure wool . His throne was like the fiery flame , and His wheels as burning fire .
KJ21	Daniel	7	10	A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him . Thousand thousands ministered unto Him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
KJ21	Daniel	7	11	“ I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke ; I beheld even till the beast was slain , and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame .
KJ21	Daniel	7	12	As concerning the rest of the beasts , they had their dominion taken away , yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time .
KJ21	Daniel	7	13	“ I saw in the night visions , and behold , one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven , and came to the Ancient of Days , and they brought Him near before Him .
KJ21	Daniel	7	14	And there was given Him dominion and glory and a Kingdom , that all people , nations , and languages should serve Him . His dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and His Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
KJ21	Daniel	7	15	“ I , Daniel , was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
KJ21	Daniel	7	16	I came near unto one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth of all this . So he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things :
KJ21	Daniel	7	17	‘ These great beasts , which are four , are four kings who shall arise out of the earth .
KJ21	Daniel	7	18	But the saints of the Most High shall take the Kingdom and possess the Kingdom for ever , even for ever and ever. ’
KJ21	Daniel	7	19	“ Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast , which was diverse from all the others , exceeding dreadful , whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass , which devoured , broke in pieces , and stamped the residue with his feet ;
KJ21	Daniel	7	20	and of the ten horns that were in his head , and of the other which came up and before whom three fell , even of the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke very great things , whose look was more stout than his fellows .
KJ21	Daniel	7	21	I beheld , and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them
KJ21	Daniel	7	22	until the Ancient of Days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High ; and the time came that the saints possessed the Kingdom .
KJ21	Daniel	7	23	“ Thus he said : ‘ The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down and break it in pieces .
KJ21	Daniel	7	24	And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise ; and another shall rise after them , and he shall be diverse from the first , and he shall subdue three kings .
KJ21	Daniel	7	25	And he shall speak great words against the Most High , and shall wear out the saints of the Most High , and think to change times and laws ; and they shall be given into his hand until a time , and times , and the dividing of time .
KJ21	Daniel	7	26	“ ‘ But the judgment shall sit , and they shall take away his dominion , to consume and to destroy it unto the end .
KJ21	Daniel	7	27	And the kingdom and dominion , and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven , shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High , whose Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom , and all dominions shall serve and obey Him. ’
KJ21	Daniel	7	28	“ Here is the end of the matter . As for me , Daniel , my cogitations much troubled me , and my countenance changed in me ; but I kept the matter in my heart . ”
KJ21	Daniel	8	8	Therefore the hegoat waxed very great ; and when he was strong , the great horn was broken , and in its place came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven .
KJ21	Daniel	8	2	And I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass when I saw , that I was at Shushan in the palace , which is in the province of Elam ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of Ulai .
KJ21	Daniel	8	3	Then I lifted up mine eyes and saw , and behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns ; and the two horns were high , but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
KJ21	Daniel	8	4	I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward , so that no beasts might stand before him , neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand ; but he did according to his will and became great .
KJ21	Daniel	8	5	And as I was considering , behold , a hegoat came from the west on the face of the whole earth , and touched not the ground ; and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes .
KJ21	Daniel	8	6	And he came to the ram that had two horns , which I had seen standing before the river , and ran unto him in the fury of his power .
KJ21	Daniel	8	7	And I saw him come close unto the ram , and he was moved with fury against him , and smote the ram and broke his two horns ; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him , but he cast him down to the ground and stamped upon him . And there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand .
KJ21	Daniel	8	9	And out of one of them came forth a little horn , which waxed exceeding great , toward the south and toward the east and toward the pleasant land .
KJ21	Daniel	8	10	And it waxed great , even to the host of heaven ; and it cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the ground , and stamped upon them .
KJ21	Daniel	8	11	Yea , he magnified himself even to the prince of the host ; and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
KJ21	Daniel	8	12	And a host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practiced , and prospered .
KJ21	Daniel	8	13	Then I heard one saint speaking , and another saint said unto that certain saint who spoke , “ How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation , to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot ? ”
KJ21	Daniel	8	14	And he said unto me , “ Until two thousand and three hundred days ; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. ”
KJ21	Daniel	8	15	And it came to pass , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision and sought for the meaning , then behold , there stood before me one with the appearance of a man .
KJ21	Daniel	8	16	And I heard a man ’ s voice between the banks of Ulai , who called and said , “ Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision. ”
KJ21	Daniel	8	17	So he came near where I stood . And when he came I was afraid and fell upon my face , but he said unto me , “ Understand , O son of man , for at the time of the end shall be the vision. ”
KJ21	Daniel	8	18	Now as he was speaking with me , I was in a deep sleep with my face toward the ground ; but he touched me and set me upright .
KJ21	Daniel	8	19	And he said , “ Behold , I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation , for at the time appointed the end shall be .
KJ21	Daniel	8	20	The ram which thou sawest having two horns , these are the kings of Media and Persia .
KJ21	Daniel	8	21	And the riugh goat is the king of Greece ; and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
KJ21	Daniel	8	22	Now that one being broken , in whose place four stood up for it , four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation , but not in his power .
KJ21	Daniel	8	23	And in the latter time of their kingdom , when the transgressors are come to the full , a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand up .
KJ21	Daniel	8	24	And his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wondrously , and shall prosper and perform , and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people .
KJ21	Daniel	8	25	And through his policy also he shall cause deceit to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magnify himself in his heart , and by using peace shall destroy many . He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes , but he shall be broken without raising a hand .
KJ21	Daniel	8	26	“ And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true . Therefore shut thou up the vision , for it shall be for many days. ”
KJ21	Daniel	8	27	And I , Daniel , fainted and was sick several days . Afterward I rose up and did the king ’ s business ; and I was astonished at the vision , but none understood it .
KJ21	Daniel	9	9	To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses , though we have rebelled against Him ;
KJ21	Daniel	9	2	in the first year of his reign I , Daniel , came to understand by books the number of the years , according to the word of the Lord as it came to Jeremiah the prophet , that He would spend seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Daniel	9	3	And I set my face unto the Lord God , seeking by prayer and supplications , with fasting , and sackcloth , and ashes .
KJ21	Daniel	9	4	And I prayed unto the Lord my God , and made my confession and said , “ O Lord , the great and fearsome God , keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love Him and to them that keep His commandments ,
KJ21	Daniel	9	5	we have sinned and have committed iniquity , and have done wickedly and have rebelled , even by departing from Thy precepts and from Thy judgments .
KJ21	Daniel	9	6	Neither have we hearkened unto Thy servants the prophets , who spoke in Thy name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
KJ21	Daniel	9	7	O Lord , righteousness belongeth unto Thee , but unto us confusion of faces , as at this day : to the men of Judah and to theinhabitants of Jerusalem , and unto all Israel who are near and who are far off , through all the countries whither Thou hast driven them , because of theirtrespass that they have trespassed against Thee .
KJ21	Daniel	9	8	O Lord , to us belongeth confusion of face , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers , because we have sinned against Thee .
KJ21	Daniel	9	10	neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God to walk in His laws , which He set before us by His servants the prophets .
KJ21	Daniel	9	11	“ Yea , all Israel have transgressed Thy law , even by departing , that they might not obey Thy voice ; therefore the curse is poured upon us , and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God , because we have sinned against Him .
KJ21	Daniel	9	12	And He hath confirmed His words which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us , by bringing upon us a great evil ; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem .
KJ21	Daniel	9	13	“ As it is written in the Law of Moses , all this evil is come upon us . Yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God , that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Thy truth .
KJ21	Daniel	9	14	Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil , and brought it upon us ; for the Lord our God is righteous in all His works which He doeth , for we obeyed not His voice .
KJ21	Daniel	9	15	“ And now , O Lord our God , who hast brought Thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast made Thee a name , as at this day — we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
KJ21	Daniel	9	16	O Lord , according to all Thy righteousness , I beseech Thee , let Thine anger and Thy fury be turned away from Thy city Jerusalem , Thy holy mountain ; because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers , Jerusalem and Thy people have become a reproach to all who are about us .
KJ21	Daniel	9	17	“ Now therefore , O our God , hear the prayer of Thy servant and his supplications , and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord ’ s sake .
KJ21	Daniel	9	18	O my God , incline Thine ear and hear . Open Thine eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by Thy name ; for we do not present our supplications before Thee because of our righteousnesses , but because of Thy great mercies .
KJ21	Daniel	9	19	O Lord , hear ! O Lord , forgive ! O Lord , hearken and do ! Defer not , for Thine own sake , O my God ; for Thy city and Thy people are called by Thy name. ”
KJ21	Daniel	9	20	And while I was speaking and praying , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God—
KJ21	Daniel	9	21	yea , while I was speaking in prayer , even the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening oblation .
KJ21	Daniel	9	22	And he informed me , and talked with me and said , “ O Daniel , I have now come forth to give thee skill and understanding .
KJ21	Daniel	9	23	At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth ; and I have come to show thee , for thou art greatly beloved . Therefore understand the matter , and heed the vision :
KJ21	Daniel	9	24	“ Seventy weeks are determined concerning thy people and concerning thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins , and to make reconciliation for iniquity , and to bring in everlasting righteousness , and to seal up the vision and prophecy , and to anoint the Most Holy .
KJ21	Daniel	9	25	Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem until the Messiah the Prince , shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks ; the street shall be built again , and the wall , even in troublesome times .
KJ21	Daniel	9	26	And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off , but not for Himself ; and the people of the prince who shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary . And the end thereof shall be with a flood , and until the end of the war desolations are determined .
KJ21	Daniel	9	27	And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week ; and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease . And for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate , even until the consummation , and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate . ”
KJ21	Daniel	10	10	And behold , a hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands .
KJ21	Daniel	10	2	In those days I , Daniel , was mourning three full weeks .
KJ21	Daniel	10	3	I ate no pleasant bread , neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth , neither did I anoint myself at all , till three whole weeks were fulfilled .
KJ21	Daniel	10	4	And in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is Hiddekel ,
KJ21	Daniel	10	5	then I lifted up mine eyes and looked , and behold , a certain man clothed in linen , whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz .
KJ21	Daniel	10	6	His body also was like beryl , and his face as the appearance of lightning , and his eyes as lamps of fire , and his arms and his feet like the color of polished brass , and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude .
KJ21	Daniel	10	7	And I , Daniel , alone saw the vision , for the men who were with me saw not the vision ; but a great quaking fell upon them , so that they fled to hide themselves .
KJ21	Daniel	10	8	Therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
KJ21	Daniel	10	9	Yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I in a deep sleep on my face , and my face was toward the ground .
KJ21	Daniel	10	11	And he said unto me , “ O Daniel , a man greatly beloved , understand the words that I speak unto thee , and stand upright ; for unto thee am I now sent. ” And when he had spoken this word unto me , I stood trembling .
KJ21	Daniel	10	12	Then said he unto me , “ Fear not , Daniel , for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy God , thy words were heard ; and I have come for thy words .
KJ21	Daniel	10	13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days ; but lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me , and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
KJ21	Daniel	10	14	Now I have come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days , for yet the vision is for many days. ”
KJ21	Daniel	10	15	And when he had spoken such words unto me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dumb .
KJ21	Daniel	10	16	And behold , one with the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips . Then I opened my mouth and spoke , and said unto him that stood before me , “ O my lord , by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me , and I have retained no strength .
KJ21	Daniel	10	17	For how can this servant of my Lord talk with thee , my lord ? For as for me , straightway there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me. ”
KJ21	Daniel	10	18	Then there came again and touched me one with the appearance of a man ; and he strengthened me
KJ21	Daniel	10	19	and said , “ O man greatly beloved , fear not . Peace be unto thee ; be strong , yea , be strong. ” And when he had spoken unto me , I was strengthened and said , “ Let my lord speak , for thou hast strengthened me. ”
KJ21	Daniel	10	20	Then said he , “ Knowest thou why I come unto thee ? And now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia ; and when I have gone forth , lo , the prince of Greece shall come .
KJ21	Daniel	10	21	But I will show thee that which is noted in the Scripture of truth ; and there is none that holdeth with me in these things , but Michael your prince .
KJ21	Daniel	11	11	And the king of the south shall be moved with anger , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north ; and he shall set forth a great multitude , but the multitude shall be given into his hand .
KJ21	Daniel	11	2	“ And now will I show thee the truth : Behold , there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia , and the fourth shall be far richer than them all ; and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece .
KJ21	Daniel	11	3	And a mighty king shall stand up , who shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will .
KJ21	Daniel	11	4	And when he shall stand up , his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven , and not to his posterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled ; for his kingdom shall be plucked up , even for others besides those .
KJ21	Daniel	11	5	“ And the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him and have dominion . His dominion shall be a great dominion .
KJ21	Daniel	11	6	And in the end of years they shall join themselves together , for the king ’ s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement . But she shall not retain the power of the arm ; neither shall he stand , nor his arm ; but she shall be given up with they that brought her , and him that begot her , and him that strengthened her in these times .
KJ21	Daniel	11	7	“ But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his place , who shall come with an army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them and shall prevail .
KJ21	Daniel	11	8	And he shall also carry captive into Egypt their gods , with their princes and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north .
KJ21	Daniel	11	9	So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom , and shall return into his own land .
KJ21	Daniel	11	10	“ But his sons shall be stirred up , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces ; and one shall certainly come , and overflow , and pass through . Then shall he return and be stirred up , even to his fortress .
KJ21	Daniel	11	12	And when he hath taken away the multitude , his heart shall be lifted up ; and he shall cast down many ten thousands , but he shall not be strengthened by it .
KJ21	Daniel	11	13	For the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former , and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches .
KJ21	Daniel	11	14	“ And in those times shall many stand up against the king of the south ; also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision , but they shall fall .
KJ21	Daniel	11	15	So the king of the north shall come and cast up a mound , and take the most fortified cities ; and the armies of the south shall not withstand , neither his chosen people , neither shall there be any strength to withstand .
KJ21	Daniel	11	16	But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will , and none shall stand before him ; and he shall stand in the glorious land , which by his hand shall be consumed .
KJ21	Daniel	11	17	He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom , and upright ones with him ; thus shall he do . And he shall give him the daughter of women , corrupting her ; but she shall not stand on his side , neither be for him .
KJ21	Daniel	11	18	After this shall he turn his face unto the isles , and shall take many . But a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ; without his own reproach , he shall cause it to turn upon him .
KJ21	Daniel	11	19	Then he shall turn his face toward the fortress of his own land ; but he shall stumble and fall , and not be found .
KJ21	Daniel	11	20	“ Then shall stand up in his place a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom ; but within few days he shall be destroyed , neither in anger nor in battle .
KJ21	Daniel	11	21	And in his place shall stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom ; but he shall come in peaceably , and obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
KJ21	Daniel	11	22	And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him and shall be broken , yea , also the prince of the covenant .
KJ21	Daniel	11	23	And after the league is made with him he shall work deceitfully , for he shall come up and shall become strong with a small people .
KJ21	Daniel	11	24	He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province ; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done , nor his fathers ’ fathers : he shall scatter among them the plunder and spoil and riches ; yea , and he shall plot his devices against the strongholds , even for a time .
KJ21	Daniel	11	25	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army ; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army , but he shall not stand , for they shall plot devices against him .
KJ21	Daniel	11	26	Yea , those who feed from the portion of his meat shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow ; and many shall fall down slain .
KJ21	Daniel	11	27	And both these kings ’ hearts shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table ; but it shall not prosper , for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
KJ21	Daniel	11	28	Then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploits , and return to his own land .
KJ21	Daniel	11	29	“ At the time appointed he shall return and come toward the south , but it shall not be as the former or as the latter ;
KJ21	Daniel	11	30	for the ships of Chittim shall come against him . Therefore he shall be grieved and return , and have indignation against the holy covenant . So shall he do ; he shall even return , and have accord with those who forsake the holy covenant .
KJ21	Daniel	11	31	And armies shall stand on his part , and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength , and shall take away the daily sacrifice , and they shall place there the abomination that maketh desolate .
KJ21	Daniel	11	32	And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries ; but the people who do know their God shall be strong , and do exploits .
KJ21	Daniel	11	33	And those who understand among the people shall instruct many ; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame , by captivity , and by spoil many days .
KJ21	Daniel	11	34	Now when they shall fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall cleave to them with flatteries .
KJ21	Daniel	11	35	And some of those of understanding shall fall , to try them , and to purge , and to make them white , even to the time of the end , because it is yet for a time appointed .
KJ21	Daniel	11	36	“ And the king shall do according to his will ; and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god , and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods , and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished ; for that which is determined shall be done .
KJ21	Daniel	11	37	Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god ; for he shall magnify himself above all .
KJ21	Daniel	11	38	But in his place shall he honor the god of forces ; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold and silver , and with precious stones and pleasant things .
KJ21	Daniel	11	39	Thus shall he do in the greatest strongholds with a strange god , whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory . And he shall cause them to rule over many , and shall divide the land for a price .
KJ21	Daniel	11	40	“ And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him . And the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind , with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships ; and he shall enter into the countries , and shall overflow and pass over .
KJ21	Daniel	11	41	He shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown ; but these shall escape out of his hand : even Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
KJ21	Daniel	11	42	He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries , and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
KJ21	Daniel	11	43	But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and ofsilver , and over all the precious things of Egypt ; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
KJ21	Daniel	11	44	But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him . Therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many .
KJ21	Daniel	11	45	And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain . Yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
KJ21	Daniel	12	12	Blessed is he that waiteth , and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days .
KJ21	Daniel	12	2	And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
KJ21	Daniel	12	3	And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament , and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
KJ21	Daniel	12	4	But thou , O Daniel , shut up the words and seal the book , even to the time of the end . Many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased. ”
KJ21	Daniel	12	5	Then I , Daniel , looked ; and behold , there stood two others , the one on this side of the bank of the river and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
KJ21	Daniel	12	6	And one said to the man clothed in linen , who was upon the waters of the river , “ How long shall it be to the end of these wonders ? ”
KJ21	Daniel	12	7	And I heard the man clothed in linen , who was upon the waters of the river , when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven , and swore by Him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time , times , and a half ; and when he shall have accomplished scattering the power of the holy people , all these things shall be finished .
KJ21	Daniel	12	8	And I heard , but I understood not . Then said I , “ O my lord , what shall be the end of these things ? ”
KJ21	Daniel	12	9	And he said , “ Go thy way , Daniel , for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end .
KJ21	Daniel	12	10	Many shall be purified and made white and tried , but the wicked shall do wickedly ; and none of the wicked shall understand , but the wise shall understand .
KJ21	Daniel	12	11	And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days .
KJ21	Daniel	12	13	But go thou thy way till the end be ; for thou shalt rest , and stand in thy lot at the end of the days . ”
KJ21	Hosea	1	1	The word of the Lord that came unto Hosea , the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
KJ21	Hosea	1	2	The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea : And the Lord said to Hosea , “ Go , take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms ; for the land hath committed great whoredom , departing from the Lord. ”
KJ21	Hosea	1	3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim , who conceived and bore him a son .
KJ21	Hosea	1	4	And the Lord said unto him , “ Call his name Jezreel ; for in yet a little while I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu , and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel .
KJ21	Hosea	1	5	And it shall come to pass at that day , that I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel. ”
KJ21	Hosea	1	6	And she conceived again , and bore a daughter . And God said unto him , “ Call her name Loruhamah [ that is , Not having obtained mercy ] ; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel , but I will utterly take them away .
KJ21	Hosea	1	7	But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah , and will save them by the Lord their God , and will not save them by bow , nor by sword , nor by battle , by horses , nor by horsemen. ”
KJ21	Hosea	1	8	Now when she had weaned Loruhamah , she conceived and bore a son .
KJ21	Hosea	1	9	Then said God , “ Call his name Loammi [ that is , Not My people ] , for ye are not My people , and I will not be your God .
KJ21	Hosea	1	10	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea , which can not be measured nor numbered ; and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them , ‘ Ye are not My people , ’ there it shall be said unto them , ‘ Ye are the sons of the living God. ’
KJ21	Hosea	1	11	Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together , and appoint themselves one head ; and they shall come up out of the land , for great shall be the day of Jezreel .
KJ21	Hosea	2	2	“ Plead with your mother , plead ; for she is not My wife , neither am I her Husband . Let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight , and her adulteries from between her breasts ,
KJ21	Hosea	2	3	lest I strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and slay her with thirst .
KJ21	Hosea	2	4	And I will not have mercy upon her children , for they are the children of whoredoms .
KJ21	Hosea	2	5	For their mother hath played the harlot ; she that conceived them hath done shamefully . For she said , ‘ I will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , mine oil and my drink. ’
KJ21	Hosea	2	6	“ Therefore , behold , I will hedge up thy way with thorns and make a wall , that she shall not find her paths .
KJ21	Hosea	2	7	And she shall follow after her lovers , but she shall not overtake them ; and she shall seek them , but shall not find them . Then shall she say , ‘ I will go and return to my first husband , for then was it better with me than now. ’
KJ21	Hosea	2	8	For she did not know that I gave her corn and wine and oil , and multiplied her silver and gold , which they prepared for Baal .
KJ21	Hosea	2	9	Therefore will I return and take away My corn at the harvest thereof , and My wine in the season thereof , and will recover My wool and My flax given to cover her nakedness .
KJ21	Hosea	2	10	And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers , and none shall deliver her out of Mine hand .
KJ21	Hosea	2	11	I will also cause all her mirth to cease , her feast days , her new moons , and her Sabbaths , and all her solemn feasts .
KJ21	Hosea	2	12	And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees , whereof she hath said , ‘ These are my rewards that my lovers have given me ’ ; and I will make them a forest , and the beasts of the field shall eat them .
KJ21	Hosea	2	13	And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim , wherein she burned incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgot Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Hosea	2	14	“ Therefore , behold , I will allure her , and bring her into the wilderness , and speak comfortingly unto her .
KJ21	Hosea	2	15	And I will give her her vineyards from thence , and the Valley of Achor for a door of hope ; and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Hosea	2	16	“ And it shall be at that day , ” saith the Lord , “ that thou shalt call Me ‘ Ishi ’ [ that is , My husband ] , and shalt call Me no more ‘ Baali ’ [ that is , My Lord ] .
KJ21	Hosea	2	17	For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth , and they shall no more be remembered by their name .
KJ21	Hosea	2	18	And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field , and with the fowls of the heavens , and with the creeping things of the ground ; and I will break the bow and the sword and warfare out of the earth , and will make them to lie down safely .
KJ21	Hosea	2	19	And I will betroth thee unto Me for ever ; yea , I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness , and in judgment , and in lovingkindness , and in mercies .
KJ21	Hosea	2	20	I will even betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness , and thou shalt know the Lord .
KJ21	Hosea	2	21	“ And it shall come to pass in that day I will hear , ” saith the Lord , “ I will hear the heavens , and they shall hear the earth .
KJ21	Hosea	2	22	And the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil , and they shall hear Jezreel .
KJ21	Hosea	2	23	And I will sow her unto Me in the earth ; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy ; and I will say to those who were not My people , ‘ Thou art My people ’ ; and they shall say , ‘ Thou art my God . ’ ”
KJ21	Hosea	3	3	And I said unto her , “ Thou shalt abide for me many days . Thou shalt not play the harlot , and thou shalt not be for another man . So will I also be for thee. ”
KJ21	Hosea	3	2	So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver , and for a homer of barley and a half homer of barley .
KJ21	Hosea	3	4	For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a prince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ephod , and without teraphim .
KJ21	Hosea	3	5	Afterward shall the children of Israel return , and seek the Lord their God and David their king , and shall fear the Lord and His goodness in the latter days .
KJ21	Hosea	4	4	Yet let no man strive with , nor reprove another ; for this people are as they that strive with the priest .
KJ21	Hosea	4	2	“ By swearing and lying , and killing and stealing and committing adultery , they break out , and blood toucheth blood .
KJ21	Hosea	4	3	Therefore shall the land mourn , and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven ; yea , the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away .
KJ21	Hosea	4	5	Therefore shalt thou fall in the day , and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night ; and I will destroy thy mother .
KJ21	Hosea	4	6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge . Because thou hast rejected knowledge , I will also reject thee , that thou shalt be no priest to Me . Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God , I will also forget thy children .
KJ21	Hosea	4	7	“ As they were increased , so they sinned against Me ; therefore will I change their glory into shame .
KJ21	Hosea	4	8	They eat up the sin of My people , and they set their heart on their iniquity .
KJ21	Hosea	4	9	And it shall be : like people , like priest ; and I will punish them for their ways , and reward them their doings .
KJ21	Hosea	4	10	For they shall eat and not have enough ; they shall commit whoredom and shall not increase , because they have left off taking heed of the Lord .
KJ21	Hosea	4	11	“ Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart .
KJ21	Hosea	4	12	My people ask counsel from their stocks , and their staff declareth unto them ; for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err , and they have gone a whoring from their God .
KJ21	Hosea	4	13	They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn incense upon the hills under oaks and poplars and elms , because the shadow thereof is good ; therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom , and your spouses shall commit adultery .
KJ21	Hosea	4	14	I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom , nor your spouses when they commit adultery ; for the men themselves consort with whores , and they sacrifice with harlots : Therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall .
KJ21	Hosea	4	15	“ Though thou , Israel , play the harlot , yet let not Judah offend ; and come not ye unto Gilgal , neither go ye up to Bethaven , nor swear , ‘ The Lord liveth. ’
KJ21	Hosea	4	16	For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer ; now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place .
KJ21	Hosea	4	17	“ Ephraim is joined to idols ; leave him alone .
KJ21	Hosea	4	18	Their drink is sour ; they have committed whoredom continually ; her rulers with shame do love , ‘ Give ye. ’
KJ21	Hosea	4	19	The wind hath bound her up in her wings , and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices .
KJ21	Hosea	5	5	And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face ; therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity ; Judah also shall fall with them .
KJ21	Hosea	5	2	And the revolters are deep in slaughter , though I have been a rebuker of them all .
KJ21	Hosea	5	3	I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hid from Me ; for now , O Ephraim , thou committest whoredom , and Israel is defiled .
KJ21	Hosea	5	4	“ They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God ; for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them , and they have not known the Lord .
KJ21	Hosea	5	6	They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord , but they shall not find Him ; He hath withdrawn Himself from them .
KJ21	Hosea	5	7	They have dealt treacherously against the Lord , for they have begotten strange children . Now shall a month devour them with their portions .
KJ21	Hosea	5	8	“ Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah , and the trumpet in Ramah ! Cry aloud at Bethaven ! After thee , O Benjamin !
KJ21	Hosea	5	9	Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke ; among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be .
KJ21	Hosea	5	10	The princes of Judah were like them that remove the landmarks ; therefore I will pour out My wrath upon them like water .
KJ21	Hosea	5	11	Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment , because he willingly walked after the commandment .
KJ21	Hosea	5	12	Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth , and to the house of Judah as rottenness .
KJ21	Hosea	5	13	“ When Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah saw his wound , then went Ephraim to the Assyrian , and sent to King Jareb . Yet could he not heal you , nor cure you of your wound .
KJ21	Hosea	5	14	For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion , and as a young lion to the house of Judah ; I , even I , will tear and go away ; I will take away , and none shall rescue him .
KJ21	Hosea	5	15	I will go and return to My place , till they acknowledge their offense and seek My face ; in their affliction they will seek Me early . ”
KJ21	Hosea	6	6	For I desired mercy , and not sacrifice ; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings .
KJ21	Hosea	6	2	After two days will He revive us ; on the third day He will raise us up , and we shall live in His sight .
KJ21	Hosea	6	3	Then shall we know , if we follow on to know the Lord ; His going forth is prepared as the morning ; and He shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
KJ21	Hosea	6	4	“ O Ephraim , what shall I do unto thee ? O Judah , what shall I do unto thee ? For your goodness is as a morning cloud , and as the early dew it goeth away .
KJ21	Hosea	6	5	Therefore have I hewn them by the prophets ; I have slain them by the words of My mouth ; and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth .
KJ21	Hosea	6	7	But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant ; there have they dealt treacherously against Me .
KJ21	Hosea	6	8	Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity , and is polluted with blood .
KJ21	Hosea	6	9	And as troops of robbers wait for a man , so the company of priests murder on the way by consent ; for they commit lewdness .
KJ21	Hosea	6	10	I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel ; there is the whoredom of Ephraim , Israel is defiled .
KJ21	Hosea	6	11	Also , O Judah , he hath set a harvest for thee , when I returned My people from captivity .
KJ21	Hosea	7	7	They are all hot as an oven , and have devoured their judges ; all their kings are fallen ; there is none among them that calleth unto Me .
KJ21	Hosea	7	2	And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness . Now their own doings have beset them about ; they are before My face .
KJ21	Hosea	7	3	They make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
KJ21	Hosea	7	4	They are all adulterers , as an oven heated by the baker , who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough , until it be leavened .
KJ21	Hosea	7	5	In the day of our king , the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine ; he stretched out his hand with scorners .
KJ21	Hosea	7	6	For they have made ready their heart like an oven , while theylie in wait ; their baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .
KJ21	Hosea	7	8	“ Ephraim , he hath mixed himself among the people ; Ephraim is a cake not turned .
KJ21	Hosea	7	9	Strangers have devoured his strength , and he knoweth it not ; yea , gray hairs are here and there upon him , yet he knoweth not .
KJ21	Hosea	7	10	And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face ; and they do not return to the Lord their God , nor seek Him for all this .
KJ21	Hosea	7	11	“ Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart ; they call to Egypt , they go to Assyria .
KJ21	Hosea	7	12	When they shall go , I will spread My net upon them ; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven ; I will chastise them , as their congregation hath heard .
KJ21	Hosea	7	13	Woe unto them , for they have fled from Me ! Destruction unto them , because they have transgressed against Me ! Though I have redeemed them , yet they have spoken lies against Me .
KJ21	Hosea	7	14	And they have not cried unto Me with their heart , when they howled upon their beds ; they assemble themselves for corn and wine , and they rebel against Me .
KJ21	Hosea	7	15	Though I have bound and strengthened their arms , yet do they contrive evil against Me .
KJ21	Hosea	7	16	They return , but not to the Most High ; they are like a deceitful bow . Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue ; this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt .
KJ21	Hosea	8	8	“ Israel is swallowed up ; now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure .
KJ21	Hosea	8	2	Israel shall cry unto Me , ‘ My God , we know Thee ! ’
KJ21	Hosea	8	3	Israel hath cast off the thing that is good ; the enemy shall pursue him .
KJ21	Hosea	8	4	They have set up kings , but not by Me ; they have made princes , and I knew it not . Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
KJ21	Hosea	8	5	“ Thy calf , O Samaria , hath cast thee off ; Mine anger is kindled against them . How long will it be ere they attain to innocency ?
KJ21	Hosea	8	6	For from Israel was it also : the workman made it , therefore it is not God ; but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces .
KJ21	Hosea	8	7	For they have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind . It hath no stalk ; the bud shall yield no meal . If so it shall yield , the strangers shall swallow it up .
KJ21	Hosea	8	9	For they are gone up to Assyria , a wild ass alone by himself ; Ephraim hath hired lovers .
KJ21	Hosea	8	10	Yea , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes .
KJ21	Hosea	8	11	“ Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin , altars shall be unto him to sin .
KJ21	Hosea	8	12	I have written to him the great things of My law , but they were counted as a strange thing .
KJ21	Hosea	8	13	They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of Mine offerings , and eat it ; but the Lord accepteth them not . Now will He remember their iniquity and visit their sins ; they shall return to Egypt .
KJ21	Hosea	8	14	For Israel hath forgotten his Maker , and buildeth temples ; and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities . But I will send a fire upon his cities , and it shall devour the palaces thereof . ”
KJ21	Hosea	9	9	They have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of Gibeah . Therefore He will remember their iniquity ; He will visit their sins .
KJ21	Hosea	9	2	The floor and the wine press shall not feed them , and the new wine shall fail in her .
KJ21	Hosea	9	3	They shall not dwell in the Lord ’ S land ; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt , and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria .
KJ21	Hosea	9	4	They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord , neither shall they be pleasing unto Him ; their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners . All that eat thereof shall be polluted , for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Hosea	9	5	What will ye do in the solemn day , and in the day of the feast of the Lord ?
KJ21	Hosea	9	6	For lo , they are gone because of destruction . Egypt shall gather them up ; Memphis shall bury them . Nettles shall possess the pleasant places for their silver ; thorns shall be in their tabernacles .
KJ21	Hosea	9	7	The days of visitation have come , the days of recompense have come ; Israel shall know it . The prophet is a fool ; the man of the spirit is mad because of the multitude of thine iniquity and great hatred .
KJ21	Hosea	9	8	The watchman of Ephraim was with my God ; but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his God .
KJ21	Hosea	9	10	“ I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness ; I saw your fathers as the first ripe of the fig tree at her first season . But they went to Baalpeor , and separated themselves unto that shame , and their abominations were according as they loved .
KJ21	Hosea	9	11	As for Ephraim , their glory shall fly away like a bird from the birth , and from the womb , and from the conception .
KJ21	Hosea	9	12	Though they bring up their children , yet will I bereave them , that there shall not be a man left ; yea , woe also to them when I depart from them !
KJ21	Hosea	9	13	Ephraim , as I saw Tyre , is planted in a pleasant place ; but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer. ”
KJ21	Hosea	9	14	Give them , O Lord — what wilt Thou give ? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts .
KJ21	Hosea	9	15	“ All their wickedness is in Gilgal , for there I hated them ; for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of Mine house . I will love them no more ; all their princes are revolters .
KJ21	Hosea	9	16	Ephraim is smitten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit ; yea , though they bring forth , yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. ”
KJ21	Hosea	9	17	My God will cast them away , because they did not hearken unto Him ; and they shall be wanderers among the nations .
KJ21	Hosea	10	10	It is in My desire that I should chastise them , and the people shall be gathered against them when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows .
KJ21	Hosea	10	2	Their heart is divided ; now shall they be found faulty . He shall break down their altars ; He shall despoil their images .
KJ21	Hosea	10	3	For now they shall say , “ We have no king , because we feared not the Lord . What then should a king do to us ? ”
KJ21	Hosea	10	4	They have spoken words , swearing falsely in making a covenant ; thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field .
KJ21	Hosea	10	5	The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven ; for the people thereof shall mourn over it , and the priests thereof who rejoiced on it for the glory thereof , because glory has departed from it .
KJ21	Hosea	10	6	It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to King Jareb . Ephraim shall receive shame , and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel .
KJ21	Hosea	10	7	As for Samaria , her king is cut off as the foam upon the water .
KJ21	Hosea	10	8	The high places also of Aven , the sin of Israel , shall be destroyed . The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars ; and they shall say to the mountains , “ Cover us ! ” and to the hills , “ Fall on us ! ”
KJ21	Hosea	10	9	“ O Israel , thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah . There they stood . The battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them .
KJ21	Hosea	10	11	And Ephraim is as a heifer that is taught and loveth to tread out the corn , but I passed over upon her fair neck . I will make Ephraim to ride , Judah shall plow , and Jacob shall break his clods. ”
KJ21	Hosea	10	12	Sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap in mercy , break up your fallow ground ; for it is time to seek the Lord , till He come and rain righteousness upon you .
KJ21	Hosea	10	13	Ye have plowed wickedness , ye have reaped iniquity , ye have eaten the fruit of lies , because thou didst trust in thy way , in the multitude of thy mighty men .
KJ21	Hosea	10	14	Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people , and all thy fortresses shall be despoiled , as Shalman despoiled Betharbel in the day of battle : the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children .
KJ21	Hosea	10	15	So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness ; in a morning shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off .
KJ21	Hosea	11	11	They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a dove out of the land of Assyria ; and I will place them in their houses , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Hosea	11	2	As they called them , so they went from them ; they sacrificed unto the Baalim , and burned incense to graven images .
KJ21	Hosea	11	3	I taught Ephraim also to go , taking them by their arms ; but they knew not that I healed them .
KJ21	Hosea	11	4	I drew them with cords of a man , with bands of love ; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke from their jaws , and Ilaid meat before them .
KJ21	Hosea	11	5	“ He shall not return into the land of Egypt ; but the Assyrian shall be his king , because they refused to return .
KJ21	Hosea	11	6	And the sword shall abide on his cities , and shall consume his branches and devour them , because of their own counsels .
KJ21	Hosea	11	7	And My people are bent on backsliding from Me ; though they called them to the Most High , none at all would exalt Him .
KJ21	Hosea	11	8	“ How shall I give thee up , Ephraim ? How shall I deliver thee , Israel ? How shall I make thee as Admah ? How shall I set thee as Zeboiim ? Mine heart is turned within Me ; My repentings are kindled together .
KJ21	Hosea	11	9	I will not execute the fierceness of Mine anger , I will not return to destroy Ephraim ; for I am God , and not man , the Holy One in the midst of thee ; and I will not enter into the city .
KJ21	Hosea	11	10	“ They shall walk after the Lord ; He shall roar like a lion . When He shall roar , then the children shall tremble from the west .
KJ21	Hosea	11	12	Ephraim compasseth me about with lies , and the house of Israel with deceit ; but Judah yet ruleth with God , and is faithful with the saints .
KJ21	Hosea	12	12	And Jacob fled into the country of Syria , and Israel served for a wife , and for a wife he kept sheep .
KJ21	Hosea	12	2	The Lord hath also a controversy with Judah , and will punish Jacob according to his ways ; according to his doings will He recompense him .
KJ21	Hosea	12	3	He took his brother by the heel in the womb , and by his strength he had power with God .
KJ21	Hosea	12	4	Yea , he had power over the angel and prevailed ; he wept , and made supplication unto Him ; he found Him in Bethel , and there He spoke with us ,
KJ21	Hosea	12	5	even the Lord God of hosts ; the Lord is his memorial .
KJ21	Hosea	12	6	Therefore turn thou to thy God ; keep mercy and judgment , and wait on thy God continually .
KJ21	Hosea	12	7	Canaan is a merchant , the balances of deceit are in his hand ; he loveth to oppress .
KJ21	Hosea	12	8	And Ephraim said , “ Yet I am become rich , I have found myself substance ; in all my labors they shall find no iniquity in me that were sin. ”
KJ21	Hosea	12	9	“ And I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles , as in the days of the solemn feast .
KJ21	Hosea	12	10	I have also spoken by the prophets , and I have multiplied visions , and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets. ”
KJ21	Hosea	12	11	Is there iniquity in Gilead ? Surely they are vanity . They sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal ; yea , their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields .
KJ21	Hosea	12	13	And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt , and by a prophet was he preserved .
KJ21	Hosea	12	14	Ephraim provoked Him to anger most bitterly ; therefore shall He leave his blood upon him , and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him .
KJ21	Hosea	13	13	The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him . He is an unwise son , for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
KJ21	Hosea	13	2	And now they sin more and more , and have made for themselves molten images of their silver , and idols according to their own understanding , all of it the work of the craftsmen . They say of them , “ Let the sacrificers of men kiss the calves ! ”
KJ21	Hosea	13	3	Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud , and as the early dew that passeth away , as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the chimney .
KJ21	Hosea	13	4	“ Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt , and thou shalt know no god but Me ; for there is no savior besides Me .
KJ21	Hosea	13	5	“ I knew thee in the wilderness , in the land of great drought .
KJ21	Hosea	13	6	According to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was exalted ; therefore have they forgotten Me .
KJ21	Hosea	13	7	Therefore I will be unto them as a lion ; as a leopard by the way will I observe them .
KJ21	Hosea	13	8	I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps , and will rend the caul of their heart , and there will I devour them like a lion ; the beast of the field shall tear them .
KJ21	Hosea	13	9	“ O Israel , thou hast destroyed thyself , but in Me is thine help .
KJ21	Hosea	13	10	I will be thy King . Where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities , and thy judges of whom thou saidst , ‘ Give me a king and princes ’ ?
KJ21	Hosea	13	11	I gave thee a king in Mine anger , and took him away in My wrath .
KJ21	Hosea	13	12	“ The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up ; his sin is hid .
KJ21	Hosea	13	14	I will ransom them from the power of the grave ; I will redeem them from death . O death , I will be thy plagues ! O grave , I will be thy destruction ! Repentance shall be hid from Mine eyes. ”
KJ21	Hosea	13	15	Though he be fruitful among his brethren , an east wind shall come ; the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness , and his spring shall become dry , and his fountain shall be dried up ; He shall despoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels .
KJ21	Hosea	13	16	Samaria shall become desolate , for she hath rebelled against her God . They shall fall by the sword , their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up .
KJ21	Hosea	14	14	O Israel , return unto the Lord thy God , for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity .
KJ21	Hosea	14	2	Take with you words , and turn to the Lord ; say unto Him , “ Take away all iniquity and receive us graciously , so will we offer the calves of our lips .
KJ21	Hosea	14	3	Assyria shall not save us ; we will not ride upon horses , neither will we say any more to the work of our hands , ‘ Ye are our gods ’ ; for in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy. ”
KJ21	Hosea	14	4	“ I will heal their backsliding , I will love them freely , for Mine anger is turned away from him .
KJ21	Hosea	14	5	I will be as the dew unto Israel ; he shall grow as the lily , and cast forth his roots as Lebanon .
KJ21	Hosea	14	6	His branches shall spread , and his beauty shall be as the olive tree , and his smell as Lebanon .
KJ21	Hosea	14	7	They that dwell under his shadow shall return . They shall revive as the corn and grow as the vine ; the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon .
KJ21	Hosea	14	8	Ephraim shall say , ‘ What have I to do any more with idols ? ’ I have heard him , and observed him ; I am like a green fir tree . From Me is thy fruit found. ”
KJ21	Hosea	14	9	Who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? Prudent , and he shall know them ? For the ways of the Lord are right , and the just shall walk in them ; but the transgressors shall fall therein .
KJ21	Joel	1	1	The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel .
KJ21	Joel	1	2	Hear this , ye old men , and give ear , all ye inhabitants of the land . Hath this been in your days , or even in the days of your fathers ?
KJ21	Joel	1	3	Tell ye your children of it , and let your children tell their children , and their children another generation .
KJ21	Joel	1	4	That which the palmer worm hath left hath the locust eaten ; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten ; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten .
KJ21	Joel	1	5	Awake , ye drunkards , and weep ; and howl , all ye drinkers of wine , because of the new wine , for it is cut off from your mouth .
KJ21	Joel	1	6	For a nation has come up upon my land , strong and without number , whose teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion .
KJ21	Joel	1	7	He hath laid my vine waste , and barked my fig tree ; he hath made it clean bare and cast it away ; the branches thereof are made white .
KJ21	Joel	1	8	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth .
KJ21	Joel	1	9	The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord ; the priests , the Lord ’ S ministers , mourn .
KJ21	Joel	1	10	The field is wasted , the land mourneth , for the corn is wasted ; the new wine is dried up , the oil languisheth .
KJ21	Joel	1	11	Be ye ashamed , O ye husbandmen ; howl , O ye vinedressers , for the wheat and for the barley , because the harvest of the field is perished .
KJ21	Joel	1	12	The vine is dried up , and the fig tree languisheth ; the pomegranate tree , the palm tree also , and the apple tree—even all the trees of the field are withered , because joy is withered away from the sons of men .
KJ21	Joel	1	13	Gird yourselves and lament , ye priests ; howl , ye ministers of the altar . Come , lie all night in sackcloth , ye ministers of my God ; for the meat offering and the drink offering is withheld from the house of your God .
KJ21	Joel	1	14	Sanctify ye a fast ; call a solemn assembly . Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God , and cry unto the Lord !
KJ21	Joel	1	15	Alas for the day ! For the day of the Lord is at hand , and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come .
KJ21	Joel	1	16	Is not the meat cut off before our eyes , yea , joy and gladness from the house of our God ?
KJ21	Joel	1	17	The seed is rotten under their clods , the garners are laid desolate , the barns are broken down ; for the corn is withered .
KJ21	Joel	1	18	How the beasts do groan ! The herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
KJ21	Joel	1	19	O Lord , to Thee will I cry ! For the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field .
KJ21	Joel	1	20	The beasts of the field cry also unto Thee ; for the rivers of waters are dried up , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
KJ21	Joel	2	2	a day of darkness and of gloominess , a day of clouds and of thick darkness , as the morning spread upon the mountains . A great people and a strong , there hath not been ever the like ; neither shall be any more after it , even to the years of many generations .
KJ21	Joel	2	3	A fire devoureth before them , and behind them a flame burneth . The land is as the Garden of Eden before them , and behind them a desolate wilderness ; yea , and nothing shall escape them .
KJ21	Joel	2	4	The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses ; and as horsemen , so shall they run .
KJ21	Joel	2	5	Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
KJ21	Joel	2	6	Before their face the people shall be much pained ; all faces shall gather blackness .
KJ21	Joel	2	7	They shall run like mighty men ; they shall climb the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks .
KJ21	Joel	2	8	Neither shall one thrust another ; they shall walk every one in his path ; and when they fall upon the sword , they shall not be wounded .
KJ21	Joel	2	9	They shall run to and fro in the city , they shall run upon the wall ; they shall climb up upon the houses , they shall enter in at the windows like a thief .
KJ21	Joel	2	10	The earth shall quake before them , the heavens shall tremble ; the sun and the moon shall be dark , and the stars shall withdraw their shining .
KJ21	Joel	2	11	And the Lord shall utter His voice before His army , for His camp is very great . For He is strong that executeth His word ; for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible , and who can abide it ?
KJ21	Joel	2	12	“ Therefore also now , ” saith the Lord , “ turn ye even to Me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning. ”
KJ21	Joel	2	13	And rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the Lord your God ; for He is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth of the evil .
KJ21	Joel	2	14	Who knoweth if He will return and repent , and leave a blessing behind Him—even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your God ?
KJ21	Joel	2	15	Blow the trumpet in Zion , sanctify a fast ! Call a solemn assembly ,
KJ21	Joel	2	16	gather the people ! Sanctify the congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children and those that suck the breasts ; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber and the bride out of her retreat .
KJ21	Joel	2	17	Let the priests , the ministers of the Lord , weep between the porch and the altar ; and let them say , “ Spare Thy people , O Lord , and give not Thine heritage to reproach , that the heathen should rule over them.Why should they say among the people , ‘ Where is their God ? ’ ”
KJ21	Joel	2	18	Then will the Lord be jealous for His land , and pity His people .
KJ21	Joel	2	19	Yea , the Lord will answer and say unto His people : “ Behold , I will send you corn and wine and oil , and ye shall be satisfied therewith ; and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen .
KJ21	Joel	2	20	But I will remove far off from you the northern army , and will drive him into a land barren and desolate , with his face toward the east sea , and his hinder part toward the utmost sea . And his stink shall come up , and his ill savor shall come up ” because He hath done great things .
KJ21	Joel	2	21	Fear not , O land ; be glad and rejoice , for the Lord will do great things !
KJ21	Joel	2	22	Be not afraid , ye beasts of the field ; for the pastures of the wilderness spring up , for the tree beareth her fruit , the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength .
KJ21	Joel	2	23	Be glad then , ye children of Zion , and rejoice in the Lord your God ; for He hath given you the early rain moderately , and He will cause to come down for you the rain , the early rain and the latter rain in the first month .
KJ21	Joel	2	24	And the floors shall be full of wheat , and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil .
KJ21	Joel	2	25	“ And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten , the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm , My great army which I sent among you .
KJ21	Joel	2	26	And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied , and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you ; and My people shall never be ashamed .
KJ21	Joel	2	27	And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am the Lord your God , and none else ; and My people shall never be ashamed .
KJ21	Joel	2	28	“ And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions ;
KJ21	Joel	2	29	and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out My Spirit .
KJ21	Joel	2	30	“ And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth— blood and fire and pillars of smoke .
KJ21	Joel	2	31	The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come .
KJ21	Joel	2	32	And it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered ; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance , as the Lord hath said , and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call .
KJ21	Joel	3	3	And they have cast lots for My people , and have given a boy for a harlot and sold a girl for wine , that they might drink .
KJ21	Joel	3	2	I will also gather all nations , and will bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat , and will plead with them there for My people and for My heritage Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations , and parted My land .
KJ21	Joel	3	4	Yea , and what have ye to do with Me , O Tyre and Sidon and all the coasts of Palestine ? Will ye render Me a recompense ? And if ye recompense Me , swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense upon your own head ,
KJ21	Joel	3	5	because ye have taken My silver and My gold , and have carried into your temples My goodly , pleasant things .
KJ21	Joel	3	6	The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians , that ye might remove them far from their border .
KJ21	Joel	3	7	Behold , I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them , and will return your recompense upon your own head .
KJ21	Joel	3	8	And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah , and they shall sell them to the Sabeans , to a people far off ; for the Lord hath spoken it. ”
KJ21	Joel	3	9	Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles : Prepare war ! Wake up the mighty men ! Let all the men of war draw near ; let them come up .
KJ21	Joel	3	10	Beat your plowshares into swords , and your pruning hooks into spears ; let the weak say , “ I am strong. ”
KJ21	Joel	3	11	Assemble yourselves and come , all ye heathen , and gather yourselves together round about ; thither cause Thy mighty ones to come down , O Lord .
KJ21	Joel	3	12	“ Let the heathen be wakened , and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat ; for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about .
KJ21	Joel	3	13	Put ye in the sickle , for the harvest is ripe . Come , get you down ; for the press is full , the vats overflow—for their wickedness is great ! ”
KJ21	Joel	3	14	Multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision ; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision .
KJ21	Joel	3	15	The sun and the moon shall be darkened , and the stars shall withdraw their shining .
KJ21	Joel	3	16	The Lord also shall roar out of Zion , and utter His voice from Jerusalem , and the heavens and the earth shall shake ; but the Lord will be the hope of His people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Joel	3	17	“ So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion , My holy mountain . Then shall Jerusalem be holy , and there shall no strangers pass through her any more .
KJ21	Joel	3	18	“ And it shall come to pass in that day , that the mountains shall drop down new wine , and the hills shall flow with milk ; and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters , and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the Lord and shall water the valley of Shittim .
KJ21	Joel	3	19	Egypt shall be a desolation , and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness , for the violence against the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
KJ21	Joel	3	20	“ But Judah shall dwell for ever , and Jerusalem from generation to generation .
KJ21	Joel	3	21	For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed , for the Lord dwelleth in Zion . ”
KJ21	Amos	1	1	The words of Amos , who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa , which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel , two years before the earthquake .
KJ21	Amos	1	2	And he said : “ The Lord will roar from Zion , and utter His voice from Jerusalem ; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn , and the top of Carmel shall wither. ”
KJ21	Amos	1	3	Thus saith the Lord : “ For three transgressions of Damascus , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof , because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron .
KJ21	Amos	1	4	But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael , which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad .
KJ21	Amos	1	5	I will break also the bar of Damascus , and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven , and him that holdeth the scepter from the house of Eden ; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	1	6	Thus saith the Lord : “ For three transgressions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof , because they carried away captive the whole captivity to deliver them up to Edom .
KJ21	Amos	1	7	But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , which shall devour the palaces thereof .
KJ21	Amos	1	8	And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod , and him that holdeth the scepter from Ashkelon ; and I will turn Mine hand against Ekron , and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish , ” saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Amos	1	9	Thus saith the Lord : “ For three transgressions of Tyre , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof , because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom , and remembered not the brotherly covenant .
KJ21	Amos	1	10	But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre , which shall devour the palaces thereof. ”
KJ21	Amos	1	11	Thus saith the Lord : “ For three transgressions of Edom , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof , because he pursued his brother with the sword , and cast off all pity ; and his anger tore perpetually , and he kept his wrath for ever .
KJ21	Amos	1	12	But I will send a fire upon Teman , which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah. ”
KJ21	Amos	1	13	Thus saith the Lord : “ For three transgressions of the children of Ammon , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof , because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead , that they might enlarge their border .
KJ21	Amos	1	14	But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it shall devour the palaces thereof , with shouting in the day of battle , with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind .
KJ21	Amos	1	15	And their king shall go into captivity , he and his princes together , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	2	2	But I will send a fire upon Moab , and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth ; and Moab shall die with tumult , with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet .
KJ21	Amos	2	3	And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof , and will slay all the princes thereof with him , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	2	4	Thus saith the Lord : “ For three transgressions of Judah , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof , because they have despised the law of the Lord , and have not kept His commandments ; and their lies caused them to err , after which their fathers have walked .
KJ21	Amos	2	5	But I will send a fire upon Judah , and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. ”
KJ21	Amos	2	6	Thus saith the Lord : “ For three transgressions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof , because they sold the righteous for silver and the poor for a pair of shoes .
KJ21	Amos	2	7	They pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the meek ; and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid to profane My holy name .
KJ21	Amos	2	8	And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid in pledge by every altar , and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god .
KJ21	Amos	2	9	“ Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them , whose height was like the height of the cedars , and he was strong as the oaks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath .
KJ21	Amos	2	10	Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you forty years through the wilderness to possess the land of the Amorite .
KJ21	Amos	2	11	And I raised up of your sons for prophets , and of your young men for Nazirites . Is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ? ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	2	12	“ But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink , and commanded the prophets , saying , ‘ Prophesy not. ’
KJ21	Amos	2	13	“ Behold , I am pressed under you , as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves .
KJ21	Amos	2	14	Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift , and the strong shall not strengthen his force , neither shall the mighty deliver himself .
KJ21	Amos	2	15	Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow , and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself ; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself .
KJ21	Amos	2	16	And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	3	3	Can two walk together , unless they be agreed ?
KJ21	Amos	3	2	“ You only have I known of all the families of the earth ; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. ”
KJ21	Amos	3	4	Will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey ? Will a young lion cry out of his den , if he have taken nothing ?
KJ21	Amos	3	5	Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no trap is for him ? Shall one take up a snare from the earth , and have taken nothing at all ?
KJ21	Amos	3	6	Shall a trumpet be blown in the city , and the people not be afraid ? Shall there be evil in a city , and the Lord hath not done it ?
KJ21	Amos	3	7	Surely the Lord God will do nothing , unless He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets .
KJ21	Amos	3	8	The lion hath roared ! Who will not fear ? The Lord God hath spoken ! Who can but prophesy ?
KJ21	Amos	3	9	Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod and in the palaces in theland of Egypt , and say , “ Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria , and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof and the oppressed in the midst thereof .
KJ21	Amos	3	10	For they know not to do right , ” saith the Lord , “ who store up violence and robbery in their palaces. ”
KJ21	Amos	3	11	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : “ An adversary there shall be even round about the land ; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee , and thy palaces shall be despoiled. ”
KJ21	Amos	3	12	Thus saith the Lord : “ As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear , so shall the children of Israel be taken out , that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed and in Damascus on a couch .
KJ21	Amos	3	13	“ Hear ye , and testify in the house of Jacob , ” saith the Lord God , the God of hosts ,
KJ21	Amos	3	14	“ that in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him , I will also visit the altars of Bethel ; and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground .
KJ21	Amos	3	15	And I will smite the winter house and the summer house ; and the houses of ivory shall perish , and the great houses shall have an end , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	4	4	“ Come to Bethel and transgress ; at Gilgal multiply transgression ; and bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes after three years .
KJ21	Amos	4	2	The Lord God hath sworn by His holiness that : “ Lo , the days shall come upon you , that He will take you away with hooks and your posterity with fishhooks .
KJ21	Amos	4	3	And ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her , and ye shall cast them into the palace , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	4	5	And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven , and proclaim and publish the free offerings ; for so ye love , O ye children of Israel , ” saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Amos	4	6	“ And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities , and want of bread in all your places ; yet have ye not returned unto Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	4	7	“ And also I have withheld the rain from you , when there were yet three months to the harvest ; and I caused it to rain upon one city , and caused it not to rain upon another city . One piece was rained upon , and the piece upon which it rained not withered .
KJ21	Amos	4	8	So two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water , but they were not satisfied ; yet have ye not returned unto Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	4	9	“ I have smitten you with blight and mildew ; when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased , the palmer worm devoured them ; yet have ye not returned unto Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	4	10	“ I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt ; your young men have I slain with the sword , and have taken away your horses ; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils ; yet have ye not returned unto Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	4	11	“ I have overthrown some of you , as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah , and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning ; yet have ye not returned unto Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	4	12	“ Therefore thus will I do unto thee , O Israel ; and because I will do this unto thee , prepare to meet thy God , O Israel ! ”
KJ21	Amos	4	13	For lo , He that formeth the mountains and createth the wind , and declareth unto man what is His thought , that maketh the morning darkness , and treadeth upon the high places of the earth—the Lord , the God of Hosts , is His name .
KJ21	Amos	5	5	but seek not Bethel , nor enter into Gilgal , and pass not to Beersheba ; for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity , and Bethel shall come to nought .
KJ21	Amos	5	2	The virgin of Israel is fallen ; she shall no more rise . She is forsaken upon her land ; there is none to raise her up .
KJ21	Amos	5	3	For thus saith the Lord God : “ The city that went out by a thousand shall be left a hundred , and that which went forth by a hundred shall be left ten to the house of Israel. ”
KJ21	Amos	5	4	For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel : “ Seek ye Me , and ye shall live ;
KJ21	Amos	5	6	Seek the Lord , and ye shall live ; lest He break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and devour it , and there be none to quench it in Bethel—
KJ21	Amos	5	7	ye who turn judgment to wormwood , and leave off righteousness in the earth ! ”
KJ21	Amos	5	8	Seek Him that maketh the seven stars and Orion , and turneth the shadow of death into the morning , and maketh the day dark with night , who calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth : The Lord is His name ,
KJ21	Amos	5	9	who strengtheneth the despoiled against the strong , so that the despoiled shall come against the fortress .
KJ21	Amos	5	10	They hate him that rebuketh in the gate , and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly .
KJ21	Amos	5	11	Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor , and ye take from him burdens of wheat , ye have built houses of hewn stone , but ye shall not dwell in them ; ye have planted pleasant vineyards , but ye shall not drink wine from them .
KJ21	Amos	5	12	For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins : they afflict the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside the poor at the gate from their right .
KJ21	Amos	5	13	Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time ; for it is an evil time .
KJ21	Amos	5	14	Seek good and not evil , that ye may live ; and so the Lord , the God of hosts , shall be with you , as ye have spoken .
KJ21	Amos	5	15	Hate the evil , and love the good , and establish judgment in the gate . It may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph .
KJ21	Amos	5	16	Therefore the Lord , the God of hosts , the Lord saith thus : “ Wailing shall be in all streets , and they shall say in all the highways , ‘ Alas ! Alas ! ’ And they shall call the husbandman to mourning , and such as are skillful in lamentation to wailing .
KJ21	Amos	5	17	And in all vineyards shall be wailing , for I will pass through thee , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	5	18	Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord ! To what end is it for you ? The day of the Lord is darkness , and not light :
KJ21	Amos	5	19	as if a man fled from a lion , and a bear met him ; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall , and a serpent bit him .
KJ21	Amos	5	20	Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness , and not light ? Even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
KJ21	Amos	5	21	“ I hate , I despise your feast days , and I will not smell the scent in your solemn assemblies .
KJ21	Amos	5	22	Though ye offer Me burnt offerings and your meat offerings , I will not accept them ; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts .
KJ21	Amos	5	23	Take thou away from Me the noise of thy songs , for I will not hear the melody of thy viols .
KJ21	Amos	5	24	But let judgment run down like waters , and righteousness as a mighty stream .
KJ21	Amos	5	25	“ Have ye offered unto Me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years , O house of Israel ?
KJ21	Amos	5	26	But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images , the star of your god which ye made for yourselves .
KJ21	Amos	5	27	Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus , ” saith the Lord , whose name is The God of Hosts .
KJ21	Amos	6	6	that drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the chief ointments— but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph .
KJ21	Amos	6	2	Pass ye unto Calneh , and see ; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great ; then go down to Gath of the Philistines . Are they better than these kingdoms ? Or their border greater than your border ?
KJ21	Amos	6	3	Ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ,
KJ21	Amos	6	4	that lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves upon their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
KJ21	Amos	6	5	that chant to the sound of the viol , and invent for themselves instruments of music , like David ;
KJ21	Amos	6	7	Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive , and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed .
KJ21	Amos	6	8	The Lord God hath sworn by Himself ; saith the Lord the God of hosts : “ I abhor the pretensions of Jacob , and hate his palaces ; therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein. ”
KJ21	Amos	6	9	And it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
KJ21	Amos	6	10	And a man ’ s kinsman shall take him up , and he that burneth him , to bring the bones out of the house , and shall say unto him that is by the side of the house , “ Is there yet any with thee ? ” And he shall say , “ No. ” Then shall he say , “ Hold thy tongue , for we may not make mention of the name of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Amos	6	11	For behold , the Lord commandeth , and He will smite the great house with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
KJ21	Amos	6	12	Shall horses run upon the rock ? Will one plow there with oxen ? For ye have turned judgment into gall , and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock ,
KJ21	Amos	6	13	ye that rejoice in a thing of nought , who say , “ Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength ? ”
KJ21	Amos	6	14	“ But , behold , I will raise up against you a nation , O house of Israel , ” saith the Lord the God of hosts ; “ and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness . ”
KJ21	Amos	7	7	Thus He showed me : And behold , the Lord stood upon a wall made with a plumb line , with a plumb line in His hand .
KJ21	Amos	7	2	And it came to pass , when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land , then I said , “ O Lord God , forgive , I beseech Thee ! By whom shall Jacob arise ? For he is small. ”
KJ21	Amos	7	3	The Lord repented concerning this . “ It shall not be , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	7	4	Thus hath the Lord God shown unto me : And behold , the Lord God called to contend by fire ; and it devoured the great deep and ate up a part .
KJ21	Amos	7	5	Then said I , “ O Lord God , cease , I beseech thee ! By whom shall Jacob arise ? For he is small. ”
KJ21	Amos	7	6	The Lord repented concerning this . “ This also shall not be , ” saith the Lord God .
KJ21	Amos	7	8	And the Lord said unto me , “ Amos , what seest thou ? ” And I said , “ A plumb line. ” Then said the Lord , “ Behold , I will set a plumb line in the midst of My people Israel ; I will not again pass by them any more .
KJ21	Amos	7	9	And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate , and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste ; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. ”
KJ21	Amos	7	10	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying , “ Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel ; the land is not able to bear all his words .
KJ21	Amos	7	11	For thus Amos saith , ‘ Jeroboam shall die by the sword , and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land. ’ ”
KJ21	Amos	7	12	Also Amaziah said unto Amos , “ O thou seer , go , flee thee away into the land of Judah , and there eat bread and prophesy there .
KJ21	Amos	7	13	But prophesy not again any more at Bethel ; for it is the king ’ s sanctuary , and it is the king ’ s court. ”
KJ21	Amos	7	14	Then answered Amos , and said to Amaziah , “ I was no prophet , neither was I a prophet ’ s son ; but I was a herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit .
KJ21	Amos	7	15	And the Lord took me as I followed the flock , and the Lord said unto me , ‘ Go , prophesy unto My people Israel. ’
KJ21	Amos	7	16	Now therefore , hear thou the word of the Lord . Thou sayest , ‘ Prophesy not against Israel , and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac. ’
KJ21	Amos	7	17	Therefore thus saith the Lord : ‘ Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city , and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword ; and thy land shall be divided by line , and thou shalt die in a polluted land . And Israel shall surely go into captivity forth from his land . ’ ”
KJ21	Amos	8	8	Shall not the land tremble for this , and every one mourn that dwelleth therein ? And it shall rise up wholly as a flood ; and it shall be cast out and drowned , as by the flood of Egypt .
KJ21	Amos	8	2	And He said , “ Amos , what seest thou ? ” And I said , “ A basket of summer fruit. ” Then said the Lord unto me : “ The end is come upon My people of Israel ; I will not again pass by them any more .
KJ21	Amos	8	3	And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day , ” saith the Lord God . “ There shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with silence. ”
KJ21	Amos	8	4	Hear this , O ye that swallow up the needy , even to make the poor of the land to fail ,
KJ21	Amos	8	5	saying , “ When will the new moon be gone , that we may sell corn ? And the Sabbath , that we may set forth wheat , making the ephah small and the shekel great , and falsifying the balances by deceit ,
KJ21	Amos	8	6	that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes , yea , and sell the refuse of the wheat ? ”
KJ21	Amos	8	7	The Lord hath sworn for the pretensions of Jacob : “ Surely I will never forget any of their works .
KJ21	Amos	8	9	And it shall come to pass in that day , ” saith the Lord God , “ that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will darken the earth in the clear day .
KJ21	Amos	8	10	And I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation ; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins and baldness upon every head ; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son , and the end thereof as a bitter day .
KJ21	Amos	8	11	“ Behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord God , “ that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	8	12	And they shall wander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east ; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord , and shall not find it .
KJ21	Amos	8	13	“ In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst .
KJ21	Amos	8	14	They that swear by the sin of Samaria and say , ‘ Thy god , O Dan , liveth , ’ and , ‘ The manner of Beersheba liveth ’ — even they shall fall and never rise up again . ”
KJ21	Amos	9	9	“ For lo , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations , as corn is sifted in a sieve ; yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
KJ21	Amos	9	2	Though they dig into hell , thence shall Mine hand take them ; though they climb up to heaven , thence will I bring them down .
KJ21	Amos	9	3	And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel , I will search and take them out thence ; and though they be hid from My sight in the bottom of the sea , thence will I command the serpent , and he shall bite them .
KJ21	Amos	9	4	And though they go into captivity before their enemies , thence will I command the sword , and it shall slay them . And I will set Mine eyes upon them for evil , and not for good. ”
KJ21	Amos	9	5	And the Lord God of hosts is He that toucheth the land , and it shall melt , and all that dwell therein shall mourn ; and it shall rise up wholly like a flood , and shall be drowned as by the flood of Egypt .
KJ21	Amos	9	6	It is He that buildeth His spheres in the heaven , and hath founded His troop on the earth . He that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth—the Lord is His name .
KJ21	Amos	9	7	“ Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto Me , O children of Israel ? ” saith the Lord . “ Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt ? And the Philistines from Caphtor , and the Syrians from Kir ?
KJ21	Amos	9	8	Behold , the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom , and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth , except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Amos	9	10	All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword , who say , ‘ The evil shall not overtake nor come before us. ’
KJ21	Amos	9	11	In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen , and close up the breaches thereof ; and I will raise up his ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old ,
KJ21	Amos	9	12	that they may possess the remnant of Edom , and of all the heathen that are called by My name , ” saith the Lord that doeth this .
KJ21	Amos	9	13	“ Behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ that the plowman shall overtake the reaper , and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed ; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine , and all the hills shall melt .
KJ21	Amos	9	14	And I will bring back the captives of My people of Israel , and they shall build the wasted cities , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
KJ21	Amos	9	15	And I will plant them upon their land , and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them , ” saith the Lord thy God .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	1	The vision of Obadiah . Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom : We have heard a word from the Lord , and an ambassador is sent among the heathen : “ Arise ye , and let us rise up against her in battle ” :
KJ21	Obadiah	1	2	“ Behold , I have made thee small among the heathen ; thou art greatly despised .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	3	The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee , thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock , whose habitation is high , that saith in his heart , ‘ Who shall bring me down to the ground ? ’
KJ21	Obadiah	1	4	Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle , and though thou set thy nest among the stars , from thence will I bring thee down , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	5	“ If thieves came to thee , if robbers by night ( how thou art cut off ! ) , would they not have stolen till they had enough ? If the grape-gatherers came to thee , would they not leave some grapes ?
KJ21	Obadiah	1	6	How the things of Esau are searched out ! How his hidden things are sought out !
KJ21	Obadiah	1	7	All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border ; the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee and prevailed against thee . They that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee ; there is no understanding in him .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	8	Shall I not in that day , ” saith the Lord , “ even destroy the wise men out of Edom , and understanding out of the mount of Esau ?
KJ21	Obadiah	1	9	And thy mighty men , O Teman , shall be dismayed , to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	10	“ For thy violence against thy brother Jacob , shame shall cover thee , and thou shalt be cut off for ever .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	11	In the day that thou stoodest on the other side—in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces , and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon Jerusalem ” even thou wast as one of them .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	12	But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger ; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction ; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	13	Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of My people in the day of their calamity ; yea , thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity , nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	14	Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway to cut off those of his that did escape ; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that remained in the day of distress .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	15	“ For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen . As thou hast done , it shall be done unto thee : thy reward shall return upon thine own head .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	16	For as ye have drunk upon My holy mountain , so shall all the heathen drink continually ; yea , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	17	“ But upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance , and there shall be holiness ; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	18	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire , and the house of Joseph a flame , and the house of Esau for stubble ; and they shall kindle them and devour them . And there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau , for the Lord hath spoken it. ”
KJ21	Obadiah	1	19	And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau , and they of the plain the Philistines . And they shall possess the fields of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria , and Benjamin shall possess Gilead .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	20	And the captives of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites , even unto Zarephath ; and the captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the south .
KJ21	Obadiah	1	21	And saviors shall come up on Mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau ; and the kingdom shall be the Lord ’ S .
KJ21	Jonah	1	1	Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai , saying ,
KJ21	Jonah	1	2	“ Arise , go to Nineveh , that great city , and cry out against it ; for their wickedness has come up before Me. ”
KJ21	Jonah	1	3	But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord ; and he went down to Joppa , and found a ship going to Tarshish . So he paid the fare thereof , and went down into it to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord .
KJ21	Jonah	1	4	But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea , and there was a mighty tempest in the sea , so that the ship was likely to be broken .
KJ21	Jonah	1	5	Then the mariners were afraid , and cried every man unto his god , and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them . But Jonah had gone down into the inner parts of the ship , and he lay and was fast asleep .
KJ21	Jonah	1	6	So the shipmaster came to him and said unto him , “ What meanest thou , O sleeper ? Arise , call upon thy God , if it so be that God will think upon us , that we perish not. ”
KJ21	Jonah	1	7	And they said every one to his fellow , “ Come , and let us cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. ” So they cast lots , and the lot fell upon Jonah .
KJ21	Jonah	1	8	Then said they unto him , “ Tell us , we pray thee , for whose cause this evil is upon us : What is thine occupation ? And from whence comest thou ? What is thy country ? And of what people art thou ? ”
KJ21	Jonah	1	9	And he said unto them , “ I am a Hebrew ; and I fear the Lord , the God of heaven , who hath made the sea and the dry land. ”
KJ21	Jonah	1	10	Then were the men exceedingly afraid , and said unto him , “ Why hast thou done this ? ” For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord , because he had told them .
KJ21	Jonah	1	11	Then said they unto him , “ What shall we do unto thee , that the sea may be calm unto us ? ” For the sea grew more and more tempestuous .
KJ21	Jonah	1	12	And he said unto them , “ Take me up and cast me forth into the sea . So shall the sea be calm unto you , for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. ”
KJ21	Jonah	1	13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land ; but they could not , for the sea was wroughtup and was tempestuous against them .
KJ21	Jonah	1	14	Therefore they cried unto the Lord and said , “ We beseech Thee , O Lord , we beseech Thee , let us not perish for this man ’ s life , and lay not upon us innocent blood ! For Thou , O Lord , hast done as it pleased Thee. ”
KJ21	Jonah	1	15	So they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea , and the sea ceased from her raging .
KJ21	Jonah	1	16	Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly , and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows .
KJ21	Jonah	1	17	Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah . And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights .
KJ21	Jonah	2	2	and said : “ I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord , and He heard me . Out of the belly of hell cried I , and Thou heardest my voice .
KJ21	Jonah	2	3	For Thou hadst cast me into the deep , in the midst of the seas , and the floods compassed me about ; all Thy billows and Thy waves passed over me .
KJ21	Jonah	2	4	Then I said , ‘ I am cast out of Thy sight ; yet I will look again toward Thy holy temple. ’
KJ21	Jonah	2	5	The waters compassed me about , even to the soul ; the depth closed me round about , the weeds were wrapped about my head .
KJ21	Jonah	2	6	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains ; the earth with her bars was about me for ever ; yet hast Thou brought up my life from corruption , O Lord my God .
KJ21	Jonah	2	7	“ When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord ; and my prayer came in unto Thee , into Thine holy temple .
KJ21	Jonah	2	8	They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy ,
KJ21	Jonah	2	9	but I will sacrifice unto Thee with the voice of thanksgiving ; I will pay that which I have vowed . Salvation is of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Jonah	2	10	And the Lord spoke unto the fish , and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land .
KJ21	Jonah	3	3	So Jonah arose and went unto Nineveh , according to the word of the Lord . Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days ’ journey .
KJ21	Jonah	3	2	“ Arise , go unto Nineveh , that great city , and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. ”
KJ21	Jonah	3	4	And Jonah began to enter into the city a day ’ s journey , and he cried and said , “ Yet forty days , and Nineveh shall be overthrown. ”
KJ21	Jonah	3	5	So the people of Nineveh believed God , and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
KJ21	Jonah	3	6	For word came unto the king of Nineveh ; and he arose from his throne , and he laid his robe from him , and covered himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes .
KJ21	Jonah	3	7	And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles , saying , “ Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock , taste anything ; let them not feed , nor drink water .
KJ21	Jonah	3	8	But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God . Yea , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
KJ21	Jonah	3	9	Who can tell if God will turn and repent , and turn away from His fierce anger , that we perish not ? ”
KJ21	Jonah	3	10	And God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way . And God repented of the evil that He had said that He would do unto them , and He did it not .
KJ21	Jonah	4	4	Then said the Lord , “ Doest thou well to be angry ? ”
KJ21	Jonah	4	2	And he prayed unto the Lord and said , “ I pray Thee , O Lord , was not this what I said when I was yet in my country ? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish ; for I knew that Thou art a gracious God and merciful , slow to anger and of great kindness , and repentest of the evil .
KJ21	Jonah	4	3	Therefore now , O Lord , take , I beseech Thee , my life from me , for it is better for me to die than to live. ”
KJ21	Jonah	4	5	So Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the city .
KJ21	Jonah	4	6	And the Lord God prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief . So Jonah was exceeding glad for the gourd .
KJ21	Jonah	4	7	But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day , and it smote the gourd so that it withered .
KJ21	Jonah	4	8	And it came to pass , when the sun arose , that God prepared a vehement east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah , so that he grew faint and wished in himself to die , and said , “ It is better for me to die than to live. ”
KJ21	Jonah	4	9	And God said to Jonah , “ Doest thou well to be angry over the gourd ? ” And he said , “ I do well to be angry , even unto death. ”
KJ21	Jonah	4	10	Then said the Lord , “ Thou hast had pity on the gourd for which thou hast not labored , neither madest it grow , which came up in a night and perished in a night .
KJ21	Jonah	4	11	And should not I spare Nineveh , that great city , wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons who can not discern between their right hand and their left hand , and also many cattle ? ”
KJ21	Micah	1	1	The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
KJ21	Micah	1	2	Hear , all ye people ! Hearken , O earth , and all that is therein ! And let the Lord God be a witness against you , the Lord from His holy temple .
KJ21	Micah	1	3	For behold , the Lord cometh forth out of His place , and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth .
KJ21	Micah	1	4	And the mountains shall be molten under Him , and the valleys shall be cleft , as wax before the fire , and as waters that are poured down a steep place .
KJ21	Micah	1	5	For the transgression of Jacob is all this , and for the sins of the house of Israel . What is the transgression of Jacob ? Is it not Samaria ? And what are the high places of Judah ? Are they not Jerusalem ?
KJ21	Micah	1	6	“ Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field , and as plantings of a vineyard ; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley , and I will uncover the foundations thereof .
KJ21	Micah	1	7	And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces , and all the hires thereof shall be burned with fire , and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate ; for she gathered it from the hire of a harlot , and they shall return to the hire of a harlot. ”
KJ21	Micah	1	8	Therefore I will wail and howl ; I will go stripped and naked ; I will make a wailing like the dragons and mourning as the owls .
KJ21	Micah	1	9	For her wound is incurable ; for it has come unto Judah ; he has come unto the gate of My people , even to Jerusalem .
KJ21	Micah	1	10	Declare ye it not at Gath , weep ye not at all ; in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust .
KJ21	Micah	1	11	Pass ye away , thou inhabitant of Shaphir , having thy shame naked . The inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel ; he shall receive from you his standing .
KJ21	Micah	1	12	For the inhabitant of Maroth waited anxiously for good , but evil came down from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Micah	1	13	O thou inhabitant of Lachish , bind the chariot to the swift beast ( she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion ) , for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee .
KJ21	Micah	1	14	Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath ; the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel .
KJ21	Micah	1	15	Yet I will bring an heir unto thee , O inhabitant of Mareshah : he shall come unto Adullam , the glory of Israel .
KJ21	Micah	1	16	Make thyself bald , and shear thy beard because of thy pleasant children ; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle , for they are gone into captivity from thee .
KJ21	Micah	2	2	They covet fields and take them by violence , and houses , and take them away . So they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
KJ21	Micah	2	3	Therefore thus saith the Lord : “ Behold , against this family do I devise an evil , from which ye shall not remove your necks , neither shall ye go haughtily ; for this time is evil .
KJ21	Micah	2	4	In that day shall one take up a parable against you , and lament with a doleful lamentation and say , ‘ We are utterly despoiled ; He hath changed the portion of my people . How hath He removed it from me ! Turning away , He hath divided our fields. ’ ”
KJ21	Micah	2	5	Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the Lord .
KJ21	Micah	2	6	“ Prophesy ye not , ” say they to them that prophesy : “ They shall not prophesy to them , that they shall not suffer shame. ”
KJ21	Micah	2	7	Oh thou that art named the house of Jacob : Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened ? Are these His doings ? Do not My words do good to him that walketh uprightly ?
KJ21	Micah	2	8	“ Even of late My people have risen up as an enemy ; ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by trustingly as men returning from war .
KJ21	Micah	2	9	The women of My people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their children have ye taken away My glory for ever .
KJ21	Micah	2	10	Arise ye and depart , for this is not your rest ; because it is polluted it shall destroy you , even with a sore destruction .
KJ21	Micah	2	11	If a man walking in the spirit of falsehood lieth , saying , ‘ I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink , ’ he shall even be the prophet of this people !
KJ21	Micah	2	12	“ I will surely assemble , O Jacob , all of thee ; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel . I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah , as the flock in the midst of their fold ; and they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men .
KJ21	Micah	2	13	The Breaker has come up before them ; they have broken forth and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it ; and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord at the head of them . ”
KJ21	Micah	3	3	who also eat the flesh of My people and flay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones and chop them in pieces , as for the pot and as flesh within the caldron ? ”
KJ21	Micah	3	2	you who hate the good and love the evil , who pluck off their skin from off them and their flesh from off their bones ,
KJ21	Micah	3	4	Then shall they cry unto the Lord , but He will not hear them ; He will even hide His face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings .
KJ21	Micah	3	5	Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err , that bite with their teeth and cry “ Peace ” ; and he that putteth not into their mouths , they even prepare war against him :
KJ21	Micah	3	6	“ Therefore night shall be unto you , that ye shall not have a vision ; and it shall be dark unto you , that ye shall not divine . And the sun shall go down over the prophets , and the day shall be dark over them .
KJ21	Micah	3	7	Then shall the seers be ashamed , and the diviners confounded ; yea , they shall all cover their lips ; for there is no answer from God. ”
KJ21	Micah	3	8	But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord , and of judgment and of might , to declare unto Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin .
KJ21	Micah	3	9	Hear this , I pray you , ye heads of the house of Jacob and princes of the house of Israel , that abhor judgment and pervert all equity :
KJ21	Micah	3	11	The heads thereof judge for reward , and the priests thereof teach for hire , and the prophets thereof divine for money . Yet will they lean upon the Lord and say , “ Is not the Lord among us ? No evil can come upon us. ”
KJ21	Micah	3	12	Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest .
KJ21	Micah	4	4	But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree , and none shall make them afraid ; for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it .
KJ21	Micah	4	2	And many nations shall come and say , “ Come , and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , and to the house of the God of Jacob . And He will teach us of His ways , and we will walk in His paths. ” For the law shall go forth from Zion , and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem .
KJ21	Micah	4	3	And He shall judge among many people , and rebuke strong nations afar off . And they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks ; nation shall not lift up a sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
KJ21	Micah	4	5	For all people will walk every one in the name of his god , and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever .
KJ21	Micah	4	6	“ In that day , ” saith the Lord , “ will I assemble her that is halt , and I will gather her that is driven out and her that I have afflicted .
KJ21	Micah	4	7	And I will make her that is halt a remnant , and her that was cast far off a strong nation ; and the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion from hence forth , even for ever .
KJ21	Micah	4	8	And thou , O tower of the flock , the stronghold of the daughter of Zion , unto thee shall it come , even the first dominion ; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. ”
KJ21	Micah	4	9	Now why dost thou cry out aloud ? Is there no king in thee ? Is thy counselor perished ? For pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail .
KJ21	Micah	4	10	Be in pain and labor to bring forth , O daughter of Zion , like a woman in travail ; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city , and thou shalt dwell in the field . And thou shalt go even to Babylon ; there shalt thou be delivered ; there the Lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies .
KJ21	Micah	4	11	Now also many nations are gathered against thee , that say , “ Let her be defiled , and let our eye look upon Zion ! ”
KJ21	Micah	4	12	But they know not the thoughts of the Lord , neither understand they His counsel ; for He shall gather them as the sheaves onto the threshing floor .
KJ21	Micah	4	13	Arise and thresh , O daughter of Zion ; for I will make thine horn iron , and I will make thy hoofs brass . And thou shalt beat in pieces many people , and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord , and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth .
KJ21	Micah	5	5	And this Man shall be the peace when the Assyrian shall come into our land ; and when he shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shepherds and eight princes of men .
KJ21	Micah	5	2	“ But thou , Bethlehem Ephrathah , though thou be little among the thousands of Judah , yet out of thee shall come forth unto Me He that is to be ruler in Israel , whose goings forth have been from of old , from everlasting. ”
KJ21	Micah	5	3	Therefore will He give them up , until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth ; then the remnant of His brethren shall return unto the children of Israel .
KJ21	Micah	5	4	And He shall stand and feed them in the strength of the Lord , in the majesty of the name of the Lord His God . And they shall abide ; for now shall He be great unto the ends of the earth .
KJ21	Micah	5	6	And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod at the entrances thereof ; thus shall He deliver us from the Assyrian when he cometh into our land , and when he treadeth within our borders .
KJ21	Micah	5	7	And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people , as a dew from the Lord , as the showers upon the grass that tarrieth not for man , nor waiteth for the sons of men .
KJ21	Micah	5	8	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles , in the midst of many people , as a lion among the beasts of the forest , as a young lion among the flocks of sheep , who , if he go through , both treadeth down and teareth in pieces , and none can deliver .
KJ21	Micah	5	9	Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries , and all thine enemies shall be cut off .
KJ21	Micah	5	10	“ And it shall come to pass in that day , ” saith the Lord , “ that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee , and I will destroy thy chariots .
KJ21	Micah	5	11	And I will cut off the cities of thy land , and throw down all thy strongholds .
KJ21	Micah	5	12	And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand , and thou shalt have no more soothsayers .
KJ21	Micah	5	13	Thy graven images also will I cut off , and thy standing images out of the midst of thee ; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands .
KJ21	Micah	5	14	And I will pluck up thine Asherah poles out of the midst of thee : so will I destroy thy cities .
KJ21	Micah	5	15	And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen , such as they have not heard . ”
KJ21	Micah	6	6	With what shall I come before the Lord , and bow myself before the high God ? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings , with calves of a year old ?
KJ21	Micah	6	2	Hear ye , O mountains , the Lord ’ S controversy , and ye strong foundations of the earth ; for the Lord hath a controversy with His people , and He will plead with Israel .
KJ21	Micah	6	3	O My people , what have I done unto thee ? And wherein have I wearied thee ? Testify against Me !
KJ21	Micah	6	4	For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed thee out of the house of servitude ; and I sent before thee Moses , Aaron , and Miriam .
KJ21	Micah	6	5	O My people , remember now what Balak king of Moab counseled , and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him , from Shittim unto Gilgal , that ye may know the righteousness of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Micah	6	7	Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams , or with ten thousands of rivers of oil ? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression , the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
KJ21	Micah	6	8	He hath shown thee , O man , what is good : and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with thy God ?
KJ21	Micah	6	9	The Lord ’ S voice crieth unto the city ( and the man of wisdom shall see Thy name ) : “ Hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it !
KJ21	Micah	6	10	Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and the scant measure that is abominable ?
KJ21	Micah	6	11	Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances , and with the bag of deceitful weights ?
KJ21	Micah	6	12	For the rich men thereof are full of violence , and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies , and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth .
KJ21	Micah	6	13	Therefore also will I make thee sick by smiting thee , in making thee desolate because of thy sins .
KJ21	Micah	6	14	Thou shalt eat , but not be satisfied , and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee . And thou shalt take hold , but shalt not deliver ; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword .
KJ21	Micah	6	15	Thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olives , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .
KJ21	Micah	6	16	For the statutes of Omri are kept , and all the works of the house of Ahab ; and ye walk in their counsels , that I should make thee a desolation and the inhabitants thereof a hissing : Therefore ye shall bear the reproach of My people . ”
KJ21	Micah	7	7	Therefore I will look unto the Lord ; I will wait for the God of my salvation ; my God will hear me .
KJ21	Micah	7	2	The good man is perished out of the earth , and there is none upright among men . They all lie in wait for blood ; they hunt every man his brother with a net .
KJ21	Micah	7	3	That they may do evil with both hands earnestly , the prince asketh , and the judge asketh for a reward ; and the great man uttereth his wicked desire ; so they wrap it up .
KJ21	Micah	7	4	The best of them is as a brier ; the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge . The day of thy watchman and thy visitation cometh ; now shall be their perplexity .
KJ21	Micah	7	5	Trust ye not in a friend , put ye not confidence in a guide ; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom .
KJ21	Micah	7	6	For the son dishonoreth the father , the daughter riseth up against her mother , the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law : a man ’ s enemies are the men of his own house .
KJ21	Micah	7	8	Rejoice not over me , O mine enemy ; when I fall , I shall arise ; when I sit in darkness , the Lord shall be a light unto me .
KJ21	Micah	7	9	I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against Him , until He plead my cause and execute judgment for me . He will bring me forth to the light , and I shall behold His righteousness .
KJ21	Micah	7	10	Then she that is mine enemy shall see it , and shame shall cover her that said unto me , “ Where is the Lord thy God ? ” Mine eyes shall behold her ; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets .
KJ21	Micah	7	11	In that day thy walls are to be built ; in that day shall the decree be far removed .
KJ21	Micah	7	12	In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria , and from the fortified cities , and from the fortress even to the river , and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain .
KJ21	Micah	7	13	Notwithstanding , the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein , because of the fruit of their doings .
KJ21	Micah	7	14	Rule Thy people with Thy rod , the flock of Thine heritage , who dwell solitarily in the wood , in the midst of Carmel ; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead , as in the days of old .
KJ21	Micah	7	15	“ As in the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt , will I show unto them marvelous things. ”
KJ21	Micah	7	16	The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might ; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth ; their ears shall be deaf .
KJ21	Micah	7	17	They shall lick the dust like a serpent ; they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth . They shall be afraid of the Lord our God , and shall fear because of Thee .
KJ21	Micah	7	18	Who is a God like unto Thee , who pardoneth iniquity , and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage ? He retaineth not His anger for ever , because He delighteth in mercy .
KJ21	Micah	7	19	He will turn again ; He will have compassion upon us ; He will subdue our iniquities . And Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
KJ21	Micah	7	20	Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham , which Thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old .
KJ21	Nahum	1	1	The burden of Nineveh . The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite .
KJ21	Nahum	1	2	God is jealous , and the Lord avengeth ; the Lord avengeth and is furious . The Lord will take vengeance on His adversaries , and He reserveth wrath for His enemies .
KJ21	Nahum	1	3	The Lord is slow to anger and great in power , and will not at all acquit the wicked . The Lord hath His way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of His feet .
KJ21	Nahum	1	4	He rebuketh the sea and maketh it dry , and drieth up all the rivers ; Bashan languisheth and Carmel , and the flower of Lebanon languisheth .
KJ21	Nahum	1	5	The mountains quake at Him , and the hills melt , and the earth is burned at His presence , yea , the world and all that dwell therein .
KJ21	Nahum	1	6	Who can stand before His indignation ? And who can abide in the fierceness of His anger ? His fury is poured out like fire , and the rocks are thrown down by Him .
KJ21	Nahum	1	7	The Lord is good , a stronghold in the day of trouble ; and He knoweth them that trust in Him .
KJ21	Nahum	1	8	But with an overrunning flood He will make an utter end of the place thereof , and darkness shall pursue His enemies .
KJ21	Nahum	1	9	What do ye contrive against the Lord ? He will make an utter end ; affliction shall not rise up the second time .
KJ21	Nahum	1	10	For while they are folded together as thorns and while they are drunken as drunkards , they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry .
KJ21	Nahum	1	11	There is one that comes out of thee , that imagineth evil against the Lord , a wicked counselor .
KJ21	Nahum	1	12	Thus saith the Lord : “ Though they be quiet and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down when he shall pass through . Though I have afflicted thee , I will afflict thee no more ;
KJ21	Nahum	1	13	for now will I break his yoke from off thee , and will burst thy bonds asunder. ”
KJ21	Nahum	1	14	And the Lord hath given a commandment concerning thee , that no more of thy name be sown : “ Out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image . I will make thy grave , for thou art vile. ”
KJ21	Nahum	1	15	Behold upon the mountains the feet of Him that bringeth good tidings , that publisheth peace ! O Judah , keep thy solemn feasts , perform thy vows ; for the wicked shall no more pass through thee ; he is utterly cut off .
KJ21	Nahum	2	2	For the Lord hath turned away the excellency of Jacob , as the excellency of Israel ; for the emptiers have emptied them out and marred their vine branches .
KJ21	Nahum	2	3	The shield of his mighty men is made red , the valiant men are in scarlet ; the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation , and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken .
KJ21	Nahum	2	4	The chariots shall rage in the streets , they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways ; they shall seem like torches , they shall run like the lightning .
KJ21	Nahum	2	5	He shall muster his worthies ; they shall stumble in their walk ; they shall make haste to the wall thereof , and the defense shall be prepared .
KJ21	Nahum	2	6	The gates of the rivers shall be opened , and the palace shall be dissolved .
KJ21	Nahum	2	7	And Huzzab shall be led away captive , she shall be brought up ; and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves , beating upon their breasts .
KJ21	Nahum	2	8	But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water ; yet they shall flee away . “ Stand , stand ! ” shall they cry , but none shall look back .
KJ21	Nahum	2	9	Take ye the spoil of silver , take the spoil of gold ; for there is no end of the store and glory of all the pleasant furnishings .
KJ21	Nahum	2	10	She is empty and void and waste ; and the heart melteth , and the knees smite together ; and much pain is in all loins , and the faces of them all gather blackness .
KJ21	Nahum	2	11	Where is the dwelling of the lions and the feeding place of the young lions , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion ’ s whelp , and none made them afraid ?
KJ21	Nahum	2	12	The lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his holes with prey and his dens with rapine .
KJ21	Nahum	2	13	“ Behold , I am against thee , ” saith the Lord of hosts , “ and I will burn her chariots in the smoke , and the sword shall devour thy young lions ; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth , and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard . ”
KJ21	Nahum	3	3	The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear , and there is a multitude of slain and a great number of carcasses . And there is no end of their corpses—they stumble upon their corpses ”
KJ21	Nahum	3	2	The noise of a whip and the noise of the rattling of the wheels , and of the prancing horses and of the jumping chariots !
KJ21	Nahum	3	4	because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavored harlot , the mistress of witchcraft , that selleth nations through her whoredom , and families through her witchcraft .
KJ21	Nahum	3	5	“ Behold , I am against thee , ” saith the Lord of hosts , “ and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face ; and I will show the nations thy nakedness and the kingdoms thy shame .
KJ21	Nahum	3	6	And I will cast abominable filth upon thee and make thee vile , and will set thee as a gazingstock .
KJ21	Nahum	3	7	And it shall come to pass that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee and say , ‘ Nineveh is laid waste ! Who will bemoan her ? ’ From whence shall I seek comforters for thee ? ”
KJ21	Nahum	3	8	Art thou better than populous No , that was situated among the rivers , that had the waters round about it , whose rampart was the sea and her wall was from the sea ?
KJ21	Nahum	3	9	Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength , and it was infinite ; Put and Lubim were thy helpers .
KJ21	Nahum	3	10	Yet was she carried away ; she went into captivity . Her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets ; and they cast lots for her honorable men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
KJ21	Nahum	3	11	Thou also shalt be drunken ; thou shalt be hid ; thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy .
KJ21	Nahum	3	12	All thy strongholds shall be like fig trees with the first ripe figs : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater .
KJ21	Nahum	3	13	Behold , thy people in the midst of thee are women ; the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies ; the fire shall devour thy bars .
KJ21	Nahum	3	14	Draw thee waters for the siege ! Fortify thy strongholds ! Go into clay and tread the mortar ; make strong the brickkiln !
KJ21	Nahum	3	15	There shall the fire devour thee ; the sword shall cut thee off ; it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm . Make thyself many as the cankerworm , make thyself many as the locusts .
KJ21	Nahum	3	16	Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven . The cankerworm despoileth , and fleeth away .
KJ21	Nahum	3	17	Thy crowned ones are as the locusts , and thy captains as the great grasshoppers , which camp in the hedges in the cold day ; but when the sun ariseth they flee away , and their place is not knownwhere they are .
KJ21	Nahum	3	18	Thy shepherds slumber , O king of Assyria ; thy nobles shall dwell in the dust ; thy people are scattered upon the mountains , and no man gathereth them .
KJ21	Nahum	3	19	There is no healing of thy bruise ; thy wound is grievous . All that hear the report of thee shall clap the hands over thee . For upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually ?
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	1	The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	2	O Lord , how long shall I cry , and Thou wilt not hear ? Even cry out unto Thee of violence , and Thou wilt not save ?
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	3	Why dost Thou show me iniquity , and cause me to behold grievance ? For despoiling and violence are before me , and there are those that raise up strife and contention .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	4	Therefore the law is slacked , and judgment doth never go forth . For the wicked doth compass about the righteous ; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	5	“ Behold ye among the heathen and regard , and wonder marvelously ; for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe , though it be told you .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	6	For lo , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	7	They are terrible and dreadful ; their judgment and their dignity shall proceed from themselves .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	8	Their horses also are swifter than the leopards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves . And their horsemen shall spread themselves , and their horsemen shall come from afar ; they shall fly as the vulture that hasteneth to eat .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	9	They shall come all for violence ; their faces shall consume as the east wind , and they shall gather the captives as the sand .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	10	And they shall scoff at the kings , and the princes shall be a scorn unto them . They shall deride every stronghold , for they shall heap up dirt and take it .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	11	Then shall his mind change ; and he shall pass over , and offend , imputing this his power unto his god. ”
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	12	Art Thou not from everlasting , O Lord my God , mine Holy One ? We shall not die . O Lord , Thou hast ordained them for judgment ; and , O mighty God , Thou hast established them for correction .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	13	Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil , and canst not look on iniquity . Why lookest Thou upon them that deal treacherously , and holdest Thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he ?
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	14	And makest men as the fishes of the sea , as the creeping things that have no ruler over them ?
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	15	They take up all of them with the hook ; they catch them in their net , and gather them in their drag ; therefore they rejoice and are glad .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	16	Therefore they sacrifice unto their net , and burn incense unto their drag , because by them their portion is fat and their meat plenteous .
KJ21	Habakkuk	1	17	Shall they therefore empty their net , and not spare continually to slay the nations ?
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	2	And the Lord answered me and said : “ Write the vision and make it plain upon tablets , that he may run that readeth it .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	3	For the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak and not lie . Though it tarry , wait for it , because it will surely come ; it will not tarry .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	4	Behold , his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him ; but the just shall live by his faith .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	5	“ Yea also , because he transgresseth by wine , he is a proud man , neither keepeth at home , who enlargeth his desire as hell , and is as death and can not be satisfied , but gathereth unto him all nations , and heapeth unto him all people .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	6	Shall not all these take up a parable against him , and a taunting proverb against him , and say , ‘ Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his ( how long ? ) and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay ’ ?
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	7	Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee , and awake , that shall vex thee ? And shalt thou be for booty unto them ?
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	8	Because thou hast despoiled many nations , all the remnant of the people shall despoil thee , because of men ’ s blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	9	“ Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness for his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the power of evil !
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	10	Thou hast devised shame to thy house by cutting off many people , and hast sinned against thy soul .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	11	For the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	12	“ Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood , and establisheth a city by iniquity !
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	13	Behold , is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labor in the very fire , and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity ?
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	14	For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	15	“ Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink , that puttest thy bottle to him , and makest him drunken also , that thou mayest look on his nakedness !
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	16	Thou art filled with the shame for glory ; drink thou also , and let thy foreskin be uncovered . The cup of the Lord ’ S right hand shall be turned unto thee , and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	17	For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee , and the spoil of beasts which made them afraid , because of men ’ s blood and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	18	“ What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it , the molten image and a teacher of lies , that the maker of his work trusteth therein to make dumb idols ?
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	19	Woe unto him that saith to the wood , ‘ Awake ! ’ To the dumb stone , ‘ Arise , it shall teach ! ’ Behold , it is laid over with gold and silver , and there is no breath at all in the midst of it .
KJ21	Habakkuk	2	20	“ But the Lord is in His holy temple ; let all the earth keep silence before Him . ”
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	3	God came from Teman , and the Holy One from Mount Paran . Selah . His glory covered the heavens , and the earth was full of His praise .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	2	O Lord , I have heard Thy speech and was afraid ; O Lord , revive Thy work in the midst of the years . In the midst of the years make it known ; in wrath remember mercy .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	4	And His brightness was as the light ; He had horns coming out of His hand , and there was the hiding of His power .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	5	Before Him went the pestilence , and burning coals went forth at His feet .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	6	He stood and measured the earth ; He beheld and drove asunder the nations ; and the everlasting mountains were scattered , the perpetual hills did bow . His ways are everlasting .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	7	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction ; and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	8	Was the Lord displeased against the rivers ? Was Thine anger against the rivers ? Was Thy wrath against the sea , that Thou didst ride upon Thine horses and Thy chariots of salvation ?
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	9	Thy bow was made quite naked according to the oaths of the tribes , even Thy word . Selah . Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	10	The mountains saw Thee and they trembled ; the overflowing of the water passed by ; the deep uttered his voice and lifted up his hands on high .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	11	The sun and moon stood still in their habitation ; at the light of thine arrows they went , and at the shining of Thy glittering spear .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	12	Thou didst march through the land in indignation ; Thou didst thresh the heathen in anger .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	13	Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people , even for salvation with Thine anointed . Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked , by uncovering the foundation unto the neck . Selah .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	14	Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages ; they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me ; their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	15	Thou didst walk through the sea with Thine horses , through the heap of great waters .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	16	When I heard , my belly trembled ; my lips quivered at the voice . Rottenness entered into my bones , and I trembled in myself , that I might rest in the day of trouble . When he cometh up unto the people , he will invade them with his troops .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	17	Although the fig tree shall not blossom , neither shall fruit be in the vines , the labor of the olive shall fail , and the fields shall yield no meat , the flock shall be cut off from the fold , and there shall be no herd in the stalls—
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	18	yet I will rejoice in the Lord , I will joy in the God of my salvation .
KJ21	Habakkuk	3	19	The Lord God is my strength ; and He will make my feet like hinds ’ feet , and He will make me to walk upon mine high places . To the chief singer on my stringed instruments .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	1	The word of the Lord which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hezekiah , in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	2	“ I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the land , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	3	“ I will consume man and beast ; I will consume the fowls of the heaven and the fishes of the sea , and the stumbling blocks with the wicked ; and I will cut off man from off the land , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	4	“ I will also stretch out Mine hand upon Judah , and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place , and the name of the Chemarim with the priests ,
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	5	and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops , and them that worship and that swear by the Lord , and that swear by Milcom ,
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	6	and them that are turned back from the Lord , and those that have not sought the Lord nor inquired for Him. ”
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	7	Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God , for the day of the Lord is at hand . For the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice ; He hath bidden His guests .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	8	“ And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord ’ S sacrifice , that I will punish the princes and the king ’ s children , and all such as are clothed with strange apparel .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	9	In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold , who fill their masters ’ houses with violence and deceit .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	10	“ And it shall come to pass in that day , ” saith the Lord , “ that there shall be the noise of a cry from the Fish Gate , and a howling from the Second , and a great crashing from the hills .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	11	Howl , ye inhabitants of Maktesh , for all the merchant people are cut down ; all they that bear silver are cut off .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	12	And it shall come to pass at that time that I will search Jerusalem with candles , and punish the men that are settled on their dregs , that say in their heart , ‘ The Lord will not do good , neither will He do evil. ’
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	13	Therefore their goods shall become a booty , and their houses a desolation . They shall also build houses , but not inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , but not drink the wine thereof. ”
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	14	The great day of the Lord is near ; it is near and hasteneth greatly , even the voice of the day of the Lord ; the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	15	That day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of waste and desolation , a day of darkness and gloominess , a day of clouds and thick darkness ,
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	16	a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fortified cities and against the high towers .
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	17	“ And I will bring distress upon men , that they shall walk like blind men , because they have sinned against the Lord ; and their blood shall be poured out as dust , and their flesh as the dung. ”
KJ21	Zephaniah	1	18	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord ’ S wrath ; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy , for He indeed shall make a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land .
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	2	before the decree bring forth , before the day pass as the chaff , before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you , before the day of the Lord ’ S anger come upon you !
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	3	Seek ye the Lord , all ye meek of the earth , who have wrought His judgment ; seek righteousness , seek meekness ; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord ’ S anger .
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	4	For Gaza shall be forsaken , and Ashkelon a desolation ; they shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday , and Ekron shall be rooted up .
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	5	Woe unto the inhabitants of the seacoast , the nation of the Cherethites ! The word of the Lord is against you , O Canaan , the land of the Philistines : “ I will even destroy thee , that there shall be no inhabitant. ”
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	6	And the seacoast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds , and folds for flocks .
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	7	And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah ; they shall feed thereupon . In the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening ; for the Lord their God shall visit them , and return them from captivity .
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	8	“ I have heard the reproach of Moab , and the revilings of the children of Ammon , whereby they have reproached My people , and magnified themselves against their border .
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	9	Therefore as I live , ” saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , “ surely Moab shall be as Sodom , and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah ” even the breeding of nettles and salt pits , and a perpetual desolation . The residue of My people shall despoil them , and the remnant of My people shall possess them. ”
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	10	This shall they have for their pride , because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	11	The Lord will be fearsome unto them ; for He will famish all the gods of the earth ; and men shall worship Him , every one from his place , even all the isles of the heathen .
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	12	“ Ye Ethiopians also , ye shall be slain by My sword. ”
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	13	And He will stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria , and will make Nineveh a desolation and dry like a wilderness .
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	14	And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her , all the beasts of the nations : both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it : their voice shall sing in the windows ; desolation shall be in the thresholds ; for He shall uncover the cedar work .
KJ21	Zephaniah	2	15	This is the rejoicing city that dwelt without care , that said in her heart , “ I am , and there is none besides me. ” How she has become a desolation , a place for beasts to lie down in ! Every one that passeth by her shall hiss and wag his hand .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	3	Her princes within her are roaring lions ; her judges are evening wolves , they gnaw not the bones till the morrow .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	2	She obeyed not the voice ; she received not correction ; she trusted not in the Lord ; she drew not near to her God .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	4	Her prophets are light and treacherous persons ; her priests have polluted the sanctuary , they have done violence to the law .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	5	The just Lord is in the midst thereof ; He will not do iniquity : Every morning doth He bring His judgment to light , He faileth not . But the unjust knoweth no shame .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	6	“ I have cut off the nations ; their towers are desolate ; I made their streets waste , that none passeth by ; their cities are destroyed , so that there is no man , that there is no inhabitant .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	7	I said , ‘ Surely thou wilt fear Me , thou wilt receive instruction ’ —so their dwelling should not be cut off , howsoever I punished them ; but they rose early and corrupted all their doings .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	8	“ Therefore wait ye upon Me , ” saith the Lord , “ until the day that I rise up to the prey ; for My determination is to gather the nations , that I may assemble the kingdoms , to pour upon them Mine indignation , even all My fierce anger ; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	9	For then will I return to the people a pure language , that they may all call upon the name of the Lord , to serve Him with one accord .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	10	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My suppliants—even the daughter of My dispersed—shall bring Mine offering .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	11	“ In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against Me ; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride , and thou shalt no more be haughty because of My holy mountain .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	12	I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people , and they shall trust in the name of the Lord .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	13	The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies , neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth ; for they shall feed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid. ”
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	14	Sing , O daughter of Zion ! Shout , O Israel ! Be glad and rejoice with all the heart , O daughter of Jerusalem !
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	15	The Lord hath taken away thy judgments ; He hath cast out thine enemy . The King of Israel , even the Lord , is in the midst of thee ; thou shalt not see evil any more .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	16	In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem , “ Fear thou not ” ; and to Zion , “ Let not thine hands be slack .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	17	The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty ; He will save , He will rejoice over thee with joy ; He will rest in His love , He will joy over thee with singing. ”
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	18	“ I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly , who are of thee , to whom the reproach of it was a burden .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	19	Behold , at that time I will undo all that afflict thee ; and I will save her that is halt , and gather her that was driven out ; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame .
KJ21	Zephaniah	3	20	At that time will I bring you back , even in the time that I gather you ; for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth , when I bring back your captives before your eyes , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Haggai	1	1	In the second year of Darius the king , in the sixth month , on the first day of the month , came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , saying ,
KJ21	Haggai	1	2	“ Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , saying : This people say , ‘ The time has not come , the time that the Lord ’ S house should be built. ’ ”
KJ21	Haggai	1	3	Then came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet , saying ,
KJ21	Haggai	1	4	“ Is it time for you , O ye , to dwell in your ceilinged houses , and this house lie waste ? ”
KJ21	Haggai	1	5	Now therefore , thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ Consider your ways !
KJ21	Haggai	1	6	Ye have sown much , and bring in little ; ye eat , but ye have not enough ; ye drink , but ye are not filled with drink ; ye clothe yourselves , but there is none warm ; and he that earneth wages , earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. ”
KJ21	Haggai	1	7	Thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ Consider your ways !
KJ21	Haggai	1	8	Go up to the mountain , and bring wood and build the house ; and I will take pleasure in it , and I will be glorified , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Haggai	1	9	“ Ye looked for much , and lo , it came to little ; and when ye brought it home , I blew upon it . Why ? ” saith the Lord of hosts . “ Because of Mine house that is laid waste , and ye run every man unto his own house .
KJ21	Haggai	1	10	Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew , and the earth is stayed from her fruit .
KJ21	Haggai	1	11	And I called for a drought upon the land , and upon the mountains , and upon the corn , and upon the new wine , and upon the oil , and upon that which the ground bringeth forth , and upon men , and upon cattle , and upon all the labor of the hands. ”
KJ21	Haggai	1	12	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , with all the remnant of the people , obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the words of Haggai the prophet , as the Lord their God had sent him ; and the people feared before the Lord .
KJ21	Haggai	1	13	Then spoke Haggai , the Lord ’ S messenger , in the Lord ’ S message unto the people , saying , “ I am with you , saith the Lord. ”
KJ21	Haggai	1	14	And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and the spirit of all the remnant of the people ; and they came and began work on the house of the Lord of hosts their God ,
KJ21	Haggai	1	15	on the four and twentieth day of the sixth month , in the second year of Darius the king .
KJ21	Haggai	2	2	“ Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and to the residue of the people , saying :
KJ21	Haggai	2	3	‘ Who is left among you who saw this house in her first glory ? And how do ye see it now ? Is this not in your eyes by comparison with it as nothing ?
KJ21	Haggai	2	4	Yet now be strong , O Zerubbabel , ’ saith the Lord ; ‘ and be strong , O Joshua , son of Jehozadak the high priest ; and be strong , all ye people of the land , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ and work , for I am with you , ’ saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Haggai	2	5	‘ According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt , so My Spirit remaineth among you . Fear ye not. ’
KJ21	Haggai	2	6	For thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ Yet once , it is a little while , and I will shake the heavens and the earth , and the sea and the dry land .
KJ21	Haggai	2	7	And I will shake all nations , and the desire of all nations shall come ; and I will fill this house with glory , ’ saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Haggai	2	8	‘ The silver is Mine , and the gold is Mine , ’ saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Haggai	2	9	‘ The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former , ’ saith the Lord of hosts . ‘ And in this place will I give peace , ’ saith the Lord of hosts. ”
KJ21	Haggai	2	10	In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet , saying ,
KJ21	Haggai	2	11	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : Ask now the priests concerning the law , saying ,
KJ21	Haggai	2	12	‘ If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment , and with his skirt toucheth bread , or pottage , or wine , or oil , or any meat , shall it be holy ? ’ ” And the priests answered and said , “ No. ”
KJ21	Haggai	2	13	Then said Haggai , “ If one who is unclean from a dead body touch any of these , shall it be unclean ? ” And the priests answered and said , “ It shall be unclean. ”
KJ21	Haggai	2	14	Then answered Haggai and said , “ ‘ So is this people , and so is this nation before Me , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ and so is every work of their hands ; and that which they offer there is unclean .
KJ21	Haggai	2	15	And now , I pray you , consider from this day and upward , from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord :
KJ21	Haggai	2	16	Since those days were , when one came to a heap of twenty measures , there were but ten . When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty vessels out of the press , there were but twenty .
KJ21	Haggai	2	17	I smote you with blight and with mildew and with hail in all the labors of your hands ; yet ye turned not to Me , ’ saith the Lord .
KJ21	Haggai	2	18	‘ Consider now from this day and upward , from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , even from the day that the foundation of the Lord ’ S temple was laid , consider it :
KJ21	Haggai	2	19	Is the seed yet in the barn ? Yea , as yet the vine , and the fig tree , and the pomegranate , and the olive tree hath not brought forth . From this day will I bless you. ’ ”
KJ21	Haggai	2	20	And again the word of the Lord came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month , saying ,
KJ21	Haggai	2	21	“ Speak to Zerubbabel , governor of Judah , saying : ‘ I will shake the heavens and the earth .
KJ21	Haggai	2	22	And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms , and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen ; and I will overthrow the chariots and those who ride in them , and the horses and their riders shall come down , every one by the sword of his brother .
KJ21	Haggai	2	23	In that day , ’ saith the Lord of hosts , ‘ will I take thee , O Zerubbabel , My servant , the son of Shealtiel , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ and will make thee as a signet ; for I have chosen thee , ’ saith the Lord of hosts . ”
KJ21	Zechariah	1	1	In the eighth month in the second year of Darius , came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo the prophet , saying ,
KJ21	Zechariah	1	2	“ The Lord hath been sorely displeased with your fathers .
KJ21	Zechariah	1	3	Therefore say thou unto them : Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ Turn ye unto Me , ’ saith the Lord of hosts , ‘ and I will turn unto you , ’ saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Zechariah	1	4	Be ye not as your fathers , unto whom the former prophets have cried , saying : Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ Turn ye now from your evil ways and from your evil doings. ’ But they did not hear , nor hearken unto Me , saith the Lord .
KJ21	Zechariah	1	5	Your fathers , where are they ? And the prophets , do they live for ever ?
KJ21	Zechariah	1	6	But My words and My statutes , which I commanded My servants the prophets , did they not overtake your fathers ? And they returned and said , ‘ As the Lord of hosts thought to do unto us , according to our ways and according to our doings , so hath He dealt with us. ’ ”
KJ21	Zechariah	1	7	Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month , which is the month of Shebat , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo the prophet , saying :
KJ21	Zechariah	1	8	I saw by night , and behold , a man riding upon a red horse , and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom ; and behind him were there red horses , speckled , and white .
KJ21	Zechariah	1	9	Then said I , “ O my lord , what are these ? ” And the angel that talked with me said unto me , “ I will show thee what these be. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	1	10	And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said , “ These are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro throughout the earth. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	1	11	And they answered the angel of the Lord who stood among the myrtle trees , and said , “ We have walked to and fro throughout the earth , and behold , all the earth sitteth still and is at rest. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	1	12	Then the angel of the Lord answered and said , “ O Lord of hosts , how long wilt Thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah , against which Thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years ? ”
KJ21	Zechariah	1	13	And the Lord answered the angel who talked with me , with good words and comforting words .
KJ21	Zechariah	1	14	So the angel who communed with me said unto me , “ Cry thou , saying , Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy .
KJ21	Zechariah	1	15	And I am very sorely displeased with the heathen who are at ease ; for I was but a little displeased , and they helped forward the affliction. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	1	16	Therefore thus saith the Lord : ‘ I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies . My house shall be built in it , ’ saith the Lord of hosts , ‘ and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	1	17	Cry yet , saying , Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad ; and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion , and shall yet choose Jerusalem. ’ ”
KJ21	Zechariah	1	18	Then I lifted up mine eyes and saw , and behold , four horns .
KJ21	Zechariah	1	19	And I said unto the angel who talked with me , “ What are these ? ” And he answered me , “ These are the horns which have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	1	20	And the Lord showed me four carpenters .
KJ21	Zechariah	1	21	Then said I , “ What come these to do ? ” And he spoke , saying , “ These are the horns which have scattered Judah , so that no man lifted up his head ; but these have come to frighten them , to cast out the horns of the Gentiles who lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it . ”
KJ21	Zechariah	2	2	Then said I , “ Whither goest thou ? ” And he said unto me , “ To measure Jerusalem to see what is the breadth thereof and what is the length thereof. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	2	3	And behold , the angel who talked with me went forth ; and another angel went out to meet him
KJ21	Zechariah	2	4	and said unto him , “ Run , speak to this young man , saying , ‘ Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls , because of the multitude of men and cattle therein .
KJ21	Zechariah	2	5	For I , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ will be unto her a wall of fire round about , and will be the glory in the midst of her. ’ ”
KJ21	Zechariah	2	6	“ Ho ! Ho ! Come forth , and flee from the land of the north , ” saith the Lord ; “ for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Zechariah	2	7	“ Deliver thyself , O Zion , ye that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	2	8	For thus saith the Lord of hosts : “ After the glory hath He sent me unto the nations which despoiled you , for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye .
KJ21	Zechariah	2	9	For behold , I will shake Mine hand upon them , and they shall be a spoil to their servants . And ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me .
KJ21	Zechariah	2	10	“ Sing and rejoice , O daughter of Zion ; for lo , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of thee , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Zechariah	2	11	“ And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day , and shall be My people ; and I will dwell in the midst of thee . And thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
KJ21	Zechariah	2	12	And the Lord shall inherit Judah as His portion in the holy land , and shall choose Jerusalem again. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	2	13	Be silent , O all flesh , before the Lord , for He is raised up out of His holy habitation .
KJ21	Zechariah	3	3	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments , and stood before the angel .
KJ21	Zechariah	3	2	And the Lord said unto Satan , “ The Lord rebuke thee , O Satan ; even the Lord who hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee ! Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire ? ”
KJ21	Zechariah	3	4	And He answered and spoke unto those who stood before Him , saying , “ Take away the filthy garments from him. ” And unto him He said , “ Behold , I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee , and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	3	5	And I said , “ Let them set a clean miter upon his head. ” So they set a clean miter upon his head , and clothed him with garments . And the angel of the Lord stood by .
KJ21	Zechariah	3	6	And the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua , saying ,
KJ21	Zechariah	3	7	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ If thou wilt walk in My ways , and if thou wilt keep My ordinance , then thou shalt also judge My house , and shalt also keep My courts , and I will give thee places to walk among these who stand by .
KJ21	Zechariah	3	8	Hear now , O Joshua the high priest , thou and thy fellows who sit before thee ; for they are men wondered at . For behold , I will bring forth My Servant the Branch .
KJ21	Zechariah	3	9	For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua : upon one stone shall be seven eyes . Behold , I will engrave the engraving thereof , ’ saith the Lord of hosts , ‘ and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day .
KJ21	Zechariah	3	10	In that day , ’ saith the Lord of hosts , ‘ shall ye call every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree . ’ ”
KJ21	Zechariah	4	4	So I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me , saying , “ What are these , my lord ? ”
KJ21	Zechariah	4	2	and said unto me , “ What seest thou ? ” And I said , “ I have looked and behold , a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it , and his seven lamps thereon , and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof ;
KJ21	Zechariah	4	3	and two olive trees by it , one upon the right side of the bowl , and the other upon the left side thereof. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	4	5	Then the angel who talked with me answered and said unto me , “ Knowest thou not what these be ? ” And I said , “ No , my lord. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	4	6	Then he answered and spoke unto me , saying , “ This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel , saying , ‘ Not by might nor by power , but by My Spirit , ’ saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Zechariah	4	7	Who art thou , O great mountain ? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain ; and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings , crying , ‘ Grace , grace unto it ! ’ ”
KJ21	Zechariah	4	8	Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Zechariah	4	9	“ The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it . And thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you .
KJ21	Zechariah	4	10	For who hath despised the day of small things ? For they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven . They are the eyes of the Lord , which run to and fro through the whole earth. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	4	11	Then answered I and said unto him , “ What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof ? ”
KJ21	Zechariah	4	12	And I answered again and said unto him , “ What be these two olive branches , which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves ? ”
KJ21	Zechariah	4	13	And he answered me and said , “ Knowest thou not what these be ? ” And I said , “ No , my lord. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	4	14	Then said he , “ These are the two anointed ones , who stand by the Lord of the whole earth . ”
KJ21	Zechariah	5	5	Then the angel who talked with me went forth and said unto me , “ Lift up now thine eyes and see what is this that goeth forth. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	5	2	And he said unto me , “ What seest thou ? ” And I answered , “ I see a flying scroll . The length thereof is twenty cubits and the breadth thereof ten cubits. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	5	3	Then said he unto me , “ This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth ; for every one who stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it , and every one who sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it .
KJ21	Zechariah	5	4	‘ I will bring it forth , ’ saith the Lord of hosts , ‘ and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by My name . And it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it , with the timber thereof and the stones thereof. ’ ”
KJ21	Zechariah	5	6	And I said , “ What is it ? ” And he said , “ This is an ephah that goeth forth. ” He said moreover , “ This is their resemblance through all the earth. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	5	7	And behold , there was lifted up a weighty piece of lead , and this is a woman who sitteth in the midst of the ephah .
KJ21	Zechariah	5	8	And he said , “ This is wickedness. ” And he cast it into the midst of the ephah , and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof .
KJ21	Zechariah	5	9	Then I lifted up mine eyes and looked , and behold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their wings ( for they had wings like the wings of a stork ) , and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven .
KJ21	Zechariah	5	10	Then said I to the angel who talked with me , “ Whither do these bear the ephah ? ”
KJ21	Zechariah	5	11	And he said unto me , “ To build it a house in the land of Shinar ; and it shall be established , and set there upon her own base . ”
KJ21	Zechariah	6	6	The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country , and the white go forth after them , and the grizzled go forth toward the south country .
KJ21	Zechariah	6	2	In the first chariot were red horses , and in the second chariot black horses ,
KJ21	Zechariah	6	3	and in the third chariot white horses , and in the fourth chariot grizzled and bay horses .
KJ21	Zechariah	6	4	Then I answered and said unto the angel who talked with me , “ What are these , my lord ? ”
KJ21	Zechariah	6	5	And the angel answered and said unto me , “ These are the four spirits of the heavens , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
KJ21	Zechariah	6	7	And the bay went forth and sought to go , that they might walk to and fro through the earth. ” And he said , “ Get you hence , walk to and fro through the earth. ” So they walked to and fro through the earth .
KJ21	Zechariah	6	8	Then cried he unto me , and spoke unto me , saying , “ Behold , these who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	6	9	And the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Zechariah	6	10	“ Take from them of the captivity — even from Heldai , from Tobijah , and from Jedaiah , who have come from Babylon — and come thou the same day and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah .
KJ21	Zechariah	6	11	Then take silver and gold and make crowns , and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest ,
KJ21	Zechariah	6	12	and speak unto him , saying , ‘ Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , saying , “ Behold the Man whose name is The Branch ! And He shall grow up out of His place , and He shall build the temple of the Lord .
KJ21	Zechariah	6	13	Even He shall build the temple of the Lord ; and He shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon His throne . And He shall be a priest upon His throne ; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. ” ’
KJ21	Zechariah	6	14	“ And the crowns shall be for Helem and for Tobijah and for Jedaiah , and for Hen the son of Zephaniah , for a memorial in the temple of the Lord .
KJ21	Zechariah	6	15	And those who are far off shall come and build the temple of the Lord , and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent Me unto you . And this shall come to pass if ye will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God . ”
KJ21	Zechariah	7	7	Should ye not hear the words which the Lord hath cried by the former prophets , when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity , and the cities thereof round about her , when men inhabited the south and the plain ? ’ ”
KJ21	Zechariah	7	2	when they had sent Sherezer and Regemmelech and their men unto the house of God to pray before the Lord ,
KJ21	Zechariah	7	3	and to speak unto the priests who were in the house of the Lord of hosts , and to the prophets , saying , “ Should I weep in the fifth month , separating myself as I have done these so many years ? ”
KJ21	Zechariah	7	4	Then came the word of the Lord of hosts unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Zechariah	7	5	“ Speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , ‘ When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month even those seventy years , did ye fast at all unto Me , even to Me ?
KJ21	Zechariah	7	6	And when ye ate and when ye drank , did not ye eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves ?
KJ21	Zechariah	7	8	And the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah , saying ,
KJ21	Zechariah	7	9	“ Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , saying , ‘ Execute true judgment , and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother .
KJ21	Zechariah	7	10	And oppress not the widow nor the fatherless , the stranger , nor the poor ; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	7	11	But they refused to hearken , and pulled away the shoulder , and stopped their ears , that they should not hear .
KJ21	Zechariah	7	12	Yea , they made their hearts as an adamant stone , lest they should hear the law and the words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in His Spirit by the former prophets . Therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Zechariah	7	13	“ Therefore it has come to pass that as He cried and they would not hear , so they cried and I would not hear , ” saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Zechariah	7	14	“ But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not . Thus the land was desolate after them , that no man passed through nor returned ; for they laid the pleasant land desolate . ”
KJ21	Zechariah	8	8	and I will bring them , and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem . And they shall be My people and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	8	2	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy , and I was jealous for her with great fury. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	8	3	“ Thus saith the Lord : ‘ I am returned unto Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem ; and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth , and the mountain of the Lord of hosts , the Holy Mountain. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	8	4	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem , and every man with his staff in his hand because of great age .
KJ21	Zechariah	8	5	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	8	6	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ If it be marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days , should it also be marvelous in Mine eyes ? ’ saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Zechariah	8	7	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ Behold , I will save My people from the east country and from the west country ;
KJ21	Zechariah	8	9	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ Let your hands be strong , ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets , who were in the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid , that the temple might be built .
KJ21	Zechariah	8	10	For before these days there was no hire for man nor any hire for beast , neither was there any peace for him that went out or came in because of the affliction ; for I set all men , every one , against his neighbor .
KJ21	Zechariah	8	11	But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days , ’ saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Zechariah	8	12	‘ For the seed shall be prosperous ; the vine shall give her fruit , and the ground shall give her increase , and the heavens shall give their dew ; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things .
KJ21	Zechariah	8	13	And it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the heathen , O house of Judah and house of Israel , so will I save you , and ye shall be a blessing . Fear not , but let your hands be strong. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	8	14	“ For thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ As I thought to punish you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath , ’ saith the Lord of hosts , ‘ and I repented not ,
KJ21	Zechariah	8	15	so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah . Fear ye not .
KJ21	Zechariah	8	16	These are the things that ye shall do : Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor ; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates ;
KJ21	Zechariah	8	17	and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor ; and love no false oath . For all these are things that I hate , ’ saith the Lord. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	8	18	And the word of the Lord of hosts came unto me , saying ,
KJ21	Zechariah	8	19	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ The fast of the fourth month , and the fast of the fifth , and the fast of the seventh , and the fast of the tenth , shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness and cheerful feasts . Therefore love the truth and peace. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	8	20	Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ It shall yet come to pass that there shall come people and the inhabitants of many cities .
KJ21	Zechariah	8	21	And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another , saying , “ Let us go speedily to pray before the Lord , and to seek the Lord of hosts . I will go also. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	8	22	Yea , many people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem , and to pray before the Lord. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	8	23	“ Thus saith the Lord of hosts : ‘ In those days it shall come to pass that ten men out of all the languages of the nations shall take hold , even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew , saying , “ We will go with you , for we have heard that God is with you . ” ’ ”
KJ21	Zechariah	9	9	Rejoice greatly , O daughter of Zion ! Shout , O daughter of Jerusalem ! Behold , thy King cometh unto thee ! He is just and having salvation , lowly , and riding upon an ass and upon a colt , the foal of an ass .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	2	And Hamath also shall border thereby ; Tyre and Sidon , though it be very wise .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	3	And Tyre did build herself a stronghold , and heaped up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the streets .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	4	Behold , the Lord will cast her out , and He will smite her power in the sea ; and she shall be devoured with fire .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	5	Ashkelon shall see it and fear ; Gaza also shall see it and be very sorrowful , and Ekron for her expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	6	And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	7	And I will take away his blood out of his mouth , and his abominations from between his teeth ; but he that remaineth , even he shall be for our God , and he shall be as a governor in Judah , and Ekron as a Jebusite .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	8	And I will encamp about Mine house because of the army , because of him that passeth by , and because of him that returneth ; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more , for now have I seen with Mine eyes .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	10	And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim , and the horse from Jerusalem , and the battle bow shall be cut off ; and He shall speak peace unto the heathen , and His dominion shall be from sea even to sea , and from the river even to the ends of the earth .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	11	As for thee also , by the blood of thy covenant , I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	12	Turn you to the stronghold , ye prisoners of hope ; even today do I declare that I will render double unto thee ,
KJ21	Zechariah	9	13	when I have bent Judah for Me , filled the bow with Ephraim , and raised up thy sons , O Zion , against thy sons , O Greece , and made thee as the sword of a mighty man .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	14	And the Lord shall be seen over them , and His arrow shall go forth as the lightning ; and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet , and shall go with whirlwinds of the south .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	15	The Lord of hosts shall defend them , and they shall devour and subdue with slingstones ; and they shall drink and make a noise as through wine , and they shall be filled like bowls , and as the corners of the altar .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	16	And the Lord their God shall save them in that day , as the flock of His people ; for they shall be as the stones of a crown , lifted up as an ensign upon His land .
KJ21	Zechariah	9	17	For how great is their goodness , and how great is their beauty ! Corn shall make the young men cheerful , and new wine the maids .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	10	I will bring them back also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon , and a place shall not be found for them .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	2	For the idols have spoken vanity , and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams . They comfort in vain ; therefore they went their way as a flock ; they were troubled , because there was no shepherd .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	3	“ Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds , and I punished the goats ; for the Lord of hosts hath visited His flock , the house of Judah , and hath made them as His goodly horse in the battle .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	4	Out of him came forth the corner , out of him the nail , out of him the battle bow , out of him every oppressor together .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	5	And they shall be as mighty men , who tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle ; and they shall fight because the Lord is with them , and the riders on horses shall be confounded .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	6	“ And I will strengthen the house of Judah , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them back to place them , for I have mercy upon them . And they shall be as though I had not cast them off , for I am the Lord their God and will hear them .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	7	And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine ; yea , their children shall see it and be glad ; their heart shall rejoice in the Lord .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	8	“ I will whistle for them and gather them , for I have redeemed them ; and they shall increase as they have increased .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	9	And I will sow them among the people , and they shall remember Me in far countries ; and they shall live with their children and turn again .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	11	And He shall pass through the sea with affliction , and shall smite the waves in the sea , and all the deeps of the river shall dry up ; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down , and the scepter of Egypt shall depart away .
KJ21	Zechariah	10	12	And I will strengthen them in the Lord ; and they shall walk up and down in His name , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	11	And it was broken on that day , and so the poor of the flock who waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	2	Howl , fir tree , for the cedar is fallen , because the mighty are despoiled ; howl , O ye oaks of Bashan , for the forest of the vintage is come down .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	3	There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds , for their glory is despoiled ; a voice of the roaring of young lions , for the pride of Jordan is despoiled .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	4	Thus saith the Lord my God : “ Feed the flock for the slaughter ,
KJ21	Zechariah	11	5	whose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty ; and those who sell them say , ‘ Blessed be the Lord , for I am rich ’ ; and their own shepherds pity them not .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	6	For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land , ” saith the Lord . “ But lo , I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor ’ s hand , and into the hand of his king ; and they shall smite the land , and out of their hand I will not deliver them. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	11	7	And I will feed the flock for slaughter , even you , O poor of the flock . And I took unto me two staves : the one I called Beauty , and the other I called Bands ; and I fed the flock .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	8	Three shepherds also I cut off in one month ; and my soul loathed them and their soul also abhorred me .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	9	Then said I , “ I will not feed you : that which dieth , let it die , and that which is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. ”
KJ21	Zechariah	11	10	And I took my staff , even Beauty , and cut it asunder , that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	12	And I said unto them , “ If ye think it be good , give me my price ; and if not , forbear. ” So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	13	And the Lord said unto me , “ Cast it unto the potter ” — a goodly price that I was prized at by them . And I took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	14	Then I cut asunder mine other staff , even Bands , that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	15	And the Lord said unto me , “ Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	16	For lo , I will raise up a shepherd in the land who shall not visit those that are cut off , neither shall seek the young one , nor heal that which is broken , nor feed that which standeth still ; but he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their claws in pieces .
KJ21	Zechariah	11	17	“ Woe to the sham shepherd that leaveth the flock ! The sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye ; his arm shall be clean dried up , and his right eye shall be utterly darkened . ”
KJ21	Zechariah	12	12	And the land shall mourn , every family apart : the family of the house of David apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the house of Nathan apart , and their wives apart ;
KJ21	Zechariah	12	2	“ Behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem .
KJ21	Zechariah	12	3	And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people . All who burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces , though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it .
KJ21	Zechariah	12	4	In that day , ” saith the Lord , “ I will smite every horse with astonishment and his rider with madness . And I will open Mine eyes upon the house of Judah , and will smite every horse of the people with blindness ;
KJ21	Zechariah	12	5	and the governors of Judah shall say in their heart , ‘ The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the Lord of hosts , their God. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	12	6	“ In that day will I make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood , and like a torch of fire in a sheaf , and they shall devour all the people round about on the right hand and on the left ; and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place , even in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Zechariah	12	7	The Lord also shall save the tents of Judah first , that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah .
KJ21	Zechariah	12	8	“ In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David , and the house of David shall be as God , as the angel of the Lord before them .
KJ21	Zechariah	12	9	And it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
KJ21	Zechariah	12	10	And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication ; and they shall look upon Me whom they have pierced , and they shall mourn for Him as one mourneth for his only son , and shall be in bitterness for Him as one who is in bitterness for his firstborn .
KJ21	Zechariah	12	11	“ In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem , as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the Valley of Megiddo .
KJ21	Zechariah	12	13	the family of the house of Levi apart , and their wives apart ; the family of Shimei apart , and their wives apart ;
KJ21	Zechariah	12	14	all the families that remain , every family apart , and their wives apart .
KJ21	Zechariah	13	13	“ In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , for sin and for uncleanness .
KJ21	Zechariah	13	2	And it shall come to pass in that day , ” saith the Lord of hosts , “ that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land , and they shall no more be remembered ; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land .
KJ21	Zechariah	13	3	And it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy , then his father and his mother who begot him shall say unto him , ‘ Thou shalt not live , for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lord ’ ; and his father and his mother who begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth .
KJ21	Zechariah	13	4	And it shall come to pass in that day , that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he hath prophesied ; neither shall they wear a garment of hair to deceive .
KJ21	Zechariah	13	5	But he shall say , ‘ I am no prophet ; I am a husbandman , for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	13	6	And one shall say unto him , ‘ What are these wounds in thine hands ? ’ Then he shall answer , ‘ Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. ’
KJ21	Zechariah	13	7	“ Awake , O sword , against My Shepherd , and against the Man that is My fellow , ” saith the Lord of hosts . “ Smite the Shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered ; and I will turn Mine hand upon the little ones .
KJ21	Zechariah	13	8	And it shall come to pass that in all the land , ” saith the Lord , “ two parts therein shall be cut off and die , but the third shall be left therein .
KJ21	Zechariah	13	9	And I will bring the third part through the fire , and will refine them as silver is refined , and will try them as gold is tried . They shall call on My name , and I will hear them . I will say , ‘ It is My people ’ ; and they shall say , ‘ The Lord is my God . ’ ”
KJ21	Zechariah	14	14	And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem , and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together : gold and silver and apparel in great abundance .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	2	For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses rifled , and the women ravished . And half of the city shall go forth into captivity , and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	3	Then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those nations , as when He fought in the day of battle .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	4	And His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives , which is before Jerusalem on the east ; and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west , and there shall be a very great valley , and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the south .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	5	And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains , for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal . Yea , ye shall flee as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah ; and the Lord my God shall come , and all the saints with Thee .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	6	And it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	7	But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord — neither day nor night ; but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	8	And it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem , half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the hinder sea ; in summer and in winter shall it be .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	9	And the Lord shall be king over all the earth ; in that day shall there be one Lord , and His name one .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	10	All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem ; and it shall be lifted up and inhabited in her place , from Benjamin ’ s Gate unto the place of the First Gate unto the Corner Gate , and from the Tower of Hananeel unto the king ’ s wine presses .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	11	And men shall dwell in it , and there shall be no more utter destruction ; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	12	And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people who have fought against Jerusalem : their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet , and their eyes shall consume away in their holes , and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	13	And it shall come to pass in that day that a great tumult from the Lord shall be among them ; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor , and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	15	And so shall be the plague on the horse , on the mule , on the camel and on the ass , and on all the beasts that shall be in these tents , as this plague .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	16	And it shall come to pass that every one who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem , shall even go up from year to year to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	17	And it shall be , that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , even upon them shall be no rain .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	18	And if the family of Egypt go not up and come not , upon whom there is no rain , there shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite the heathen who come not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	19	This shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .
KJ21	Zechariah	14	20	In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses : “ Holiness Unto The Lord. ” And the pots in the Lord ’ S house shall be like the bowls before the altar ;
KJ21	Zechariah	14	21	yea , every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts , and all those who sacrifice shall come and take of them and boil therein . And in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	1	1	The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by the hand of Malachi .
KJ21	Malachi	1	2	“ I have loved you , ” saith the Lord . “ Yet ye say , ‘ Wherein hast Thou loved us ? ’ Was not Esau Jacob ’ s brother ? ” saith the Lord . “ Yet I loved Jacob ,
KJ21	Malachi	1	3	and I hated Esau , and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. ”
KJ21	Malachi	1	4	Whereas Edom saith , “ We are impoverished , but we will return and rebuild the desolate places , ” thus saith the Lord of Hosts : “ They shall build , but I will throw down ; and they shall call them the Border of Wickedness and the people against whom the Lord hath indignation forever .
KJ21	Malachi	1	5	And your eyes shall see , and ye shall say , ‘ The Lord will be magnified from the border of Israel. ’
KJ21	Malachi	1	6	“ A son honoreth his father , and a servant his master . If then I be a father , where is Mine honor ? And if I be a master , where is the fear of Me ? saith the Lord of hosts unto you , O priests , who despise My name . And ye say , ‘ Wherein have we despised Thy name ? ’
KJ21	Malachi	1	7	Ye offer polluted bread upon Mine altar ; and ye say , ‘ Wherein have we polluted Thee ? ’ In that ye say : ‘ The table of the Lord is contemptible. ’
KJ21	Malachi	1	8	And if ye offer blind animals for sacrifice , is that not evil ? And if ye offer the lame and sick , is that not evil ? Offer it now unto thy governor ! Will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person ? ” saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	1	9	“ And now , I pray you , beseech God that He will be gracious unto us . This has been by your hand : Will He regard your persons ? ” saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	1	10	“ Who is there even among you who would shut the doors for nought ? Neither do ye kindle fire on Mine altar for nought . I have no pleasure in you , ” saith the Lord of hosts , “ neither will I accept an offering from your hand .
KJ21	Malachi	1	11	For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same , My name shall be great among the Gentiles . And in every place incense shall be offered unto My name , and a pure offering ; for My name shall be great among the heathen , ” saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	1	12	“ But ye have profaned it in that ye say , ‘ The table of the Lord is polluted ; and the fruit thereof , even His meat , is contemptible. ’
KJ21	Malachi	1	13	Ye said also , ‘ Behold , what a weariness is it ! ’ And ye have sniffed it , ” saith the Lord of hosts . “ And ye brought that which was torn and the lame and the sick ; thus ye brought an offering ! Should I accept this from your hand ? ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	Malachi	1	14	“ But cursed be the deceiver who hath in his flock a male , and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing . For I am a great King , ” saith the Lord of hosts , “ and My name is dreadful among the heathen .
KJ21	Malachi	2	2	If ye will not hear , and if ye will not lay it to heart to give glory unto My name , ” saith the Lord of hosts , “ I will even send a curse upon you , and I will curse your blessings . Yea , I have cursed them already , because ye do not lay it to heart .
KJ21	Malachi	2	3	Behold , I will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your faces , even the dung of your solemn feasts ; and one shall take you away with it .
KJ21	Malachi	2	4	And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you , that My covenant might be with Levi , ” saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	2	5	“ My covenant was with him of life and peace , and I gave them to him for the fear with which he feared Me and was afraid before My name .
KJ21	Malachi	2	6	The law of truth was in his mouth , and iniquity was not found on his lips . He walked with Me in peace and equity , and turned many away from iniquity .
KJ21	Malachi	2	7	For the priest ’ s lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth ; for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	2	8	But ye have departed from the way ; ye have caused many to stumble at the law ; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi , ” saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	2	9	“ Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people , according as ye have not kept My ways but have been partial in the law. ”
KJ21	Malachi	2	10	Have we not all one Father ? Hath not one God created us ? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the covenant of our fathers ?
KJ21	Malachi	2	11	Judah hath dealt treacherously , and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord which he loved , and hath married the daughter of a strange god .
KJ21	Malachi	2	12	The Lord will cut off the man who doeth this — the master and the scholar — out of the tabernacles of Jacob , and him that offereth an offering unto the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	2	13	And this have ye done again , covering the altar of the Lord with tears , with weeping , and with crying out insomuch that He regardeth not the offering anymore , nor receiveth it with good will from thy hand .
KJ21	Malachi	2	14	Yet ye say , “ Why ? ” Because the Lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth , against whom thou hast dealt treacherously ; yet she is thy companion and the wife of thy covenant .
KJ21	Malachi	2	15	And did not He make one ? Yet had He the residue of the spirit . And why one ? That He might seek a godly seed ! Therefore take heed to your spirit , and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth .
KJ21	Malachi	2	16	“ For the Lord , the God of Israel , saith that He hateth putting away ; for one covereth violence with his garment , ” saith the Lord of hosts . “ Therefore take heed to your spirit , that ye deal not treacherously. ”
KJ21	Malachi	2	17	Ye have wearied the Lord with your words . Yet ye say , “ Wherein have we wearied Him ? ” When ye say : “ Every one who doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord , and He delighteth in them , ” or , “ Where is the God of judgment ? ”
KJ21	Malachi	3	3	And He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver ; and He shall purify the sons of Levi , and purge them as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness .
KJ21	Malachi	3	2	“ But who may abide the day of His coming ? And who shall stand when He appeareth ? For He is like a refiner ’ s fire and like fullers ’ soap .
KJ21	Malachi	3	4	Then shall the offering of Judah and of Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord , as in the days of old and as in former years .
KJ21	Malachi	3	5	“ And I will come near to you in judgment ; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers , and against those who swear falsely , and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages , the widow and the fatherless , and those who turn aside the stranger from his right , and fear not Me , ” saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	3	6	“ For I am the Lord , I change not . Therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed .
KJ21	Malachi	3	7	“ Even from the days of your fathers , ye have gone away from Mine ordinances and have not kept them . Return unto Me , and I will return unto you , ” saith the Lord of hosts . “ But ye said , ‘ In what manner shall we return ? ’
KJ21	Malachi	3	8	Will a man rob God ? Yet ye have robbed Me ! But ye say , ‘ Wherein have we robbed Thee ? ’ In tithes and offerings .
KJ21	Malachi	3	9	Ye are cursed with a curse ; for ye have robbed Me , even this whole nation .
KJ21	Malachi	3	10	Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse , that there may be meat in Mine house , and put Me to the proof now herewith , ” saith the Lord of hosts , “ if I will not open to you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing , that there shall not be room enough to receive it .
KJ21	Malachi	3	11	And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes , and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground , neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field , ” saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	3	12	“ And all nations shall call you blessed , for ye shall be a delightsome land , ” saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	3	13	“ Your words have been defiant against Me , ” saith the Lord . “ Yet ye say , ‘ What have we spoken so much against Thee ? ’
KJ21	Malachi	3	14	Ye have said : ‘ It is vain to serve God ; and what profit is it that we have kept His ordinance , and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts ?
KJ21	Malachi	3	15	So now we call the proud happy ; yea , they that work wickedness are set up ; yea , they that tempt God are even delivered. ’ ”
KJ21	Malachi	3	16	Then those who feared the Lord spoke often one to another , and the Lord hearkened and heard it . And a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who feared the Lord and who thought upon His name .
KJ21	Malachi	3	17	“ And they shall be Mine , ” saith the Lord of hosts , “ in that day when I make up My jewels ; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son who serveth him .

KJ21	Malachi	4	4	“ Remember ye the Law of Moses , My servant , which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel , with the statutes and judgments .
KJ21	Malachi	4	2	But unto you that fear My name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in His wings ; and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves from the stall .
KJ21	Malachi	4	3	And ye shall tread down the wicked , for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this , ” saith the Lord of hosts .
KJ21	Malachi	4	5	“ Behold , I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord .
KJ21	Malachi	4	6	And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fathers , lest I come and smite the earth with a curse . ”
