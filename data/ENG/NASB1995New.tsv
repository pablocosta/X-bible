NASB1995	Matthew	8	27	The men were amazed , and said , “ What kind of a man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey Him ? ” Jesus Casts Out Demons
NASB1995	Matthew	8	28	( Z ) When He came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes , two men who were ( AA ) demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of the tombs . They were so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way .

NASB1995	Matthew	9	3	And some of the scribes said [ b ] to themselves , “ This fellow ( F ) blasphemes. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	9	4	And Jesus ( G ) knowing their thoughts said , “ Why are you thinking evil in your hearts ?

NASB1995	Matthew	9	6	But so that you may know that ( I ) the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —then He * said to the ( J ) paralytic , “ Get up , pick up your bed and go home. ”

NASB1995	Matthew	9	17	Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins ; otherwise the wineskins burst , and the wine pours out and the wineskins are ruined ; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved. ” Miracles of Healing

NASB1995	Matthew	9	25	But ( AC ) when the crowd had been sent out , He entered and ( AD ) took her by the hand , and the girl [ x ] got up .
NASB1995	Matthew	9	26	( AE ) This news spread throughout all that land .
NASB1995	Matthew	9	27	As Jesus went on from there , two blind men followed Him , crying out , “ Have mercy on us , ( AF ) Son of David ! ”
NASB1995	Matthew	9	28	When He entered the house , the blind men came up to Him , and Jesus * said to them , “ Do you believe that I am able to do this ? ” They * said to Him , “ Yes , Lord. ”

NASB1995	Matthew	9	33	After the demon was cast out , the mute man spoke ; and the crowds were amazed , and were saying , “ ( AL ) Nothing like this has [ aa ] ever been seen in Israel. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees were saying , “ He ( AM ) casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	9	35	Jesus was going through all the cities and villages , ( AN ) teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness .
NASB1995	Matthew	9	36	( AO ) Seeing the [ ab ] people , He felt compassion for them , ( AP ) because they were [ ac ] distressed and [ ad ] dispirited like sheep [ ae ] without a shepherd .

NASB1995	Matthew	10	2	( C ) Now the names of the twelve apostles are these : The first , ( D ) Simon , who is called Peter , and ( E ) Andrew his brother ; and [ a ] ( F ) James the son of Zebedee , and [ b ] John his brother ;
NASB1995	Matthew	10	3	( G ) Philip and [ c ] Bartholomew ; ( H ) Thomas and ( I ) Matthew the tax collector ; [ d ] ( J ) James the son of Alphaeus , and ( K ) Thaddaeus ;
NASB1995	Matthew	10	4	Simon the [ e ] Zealot , and ( L ) Judas Iscariot , the one who betrayed Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	5	( M ) These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them : “ Do not [ f ] go [ g ] in the way of the Gentiles , and do not enter any city of the ( N ) Samaritans ;
NASB1995	Matthew	10	6	but rather go to ( O ) the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	7	And as you go , [ h ] preach , saying , ‘ ( P ) The kingdom of heaven [ i ] is at hand. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	10	8	Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse the lepers , cast out demons . Freely you received , freely give .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	9	( Q ) Do not acquire gold , or silver , or copper for your money belts ,
NASB1995	Matthew	10	11	And whatever city or village you enter , inquire who is worthy in it , and stay [ m ] at his house until you leave that city .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	12	As you enter the [ n ] house , ( S ) give it your [ o ] greeting .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	13	If the house is worthy , [ p ] give it your blessing of peace . But if it is not worthy , [ q ] take back your blessing of peace .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	14	Whoever does not receive you , nor heed your words , as you go out of that house or that city , ( T ) shake the dust off your feet .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	15	Truly I say to you , ( U ) it will be more tolerable for the land of ( V ) Sodom and Gomorrah in ( W ) the day of judgment than for that city . A Hard Road before Them
NASB1995	Matthew	10	16	“ ( X ) Behold , I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves ; so [ r ] be ( Y ) shrewd as serpents and ( Z ) innocent as doves .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	17	But beware of men , for they will hand you over to the ( AA ) courts and scourge you ( AB ) in their synagogues ;
NASB1995	Matthew	10	18	and you will even be brought before governors and kings for My sake , as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	19	( AC ) But when they hand you over , ( AD ) do not worry about how or what you are to say ; for it will be given you in that hour what you are to say .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	20	For ( AE ) it is not you who speak , but it is the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	21	“ ( AF ) Brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child ; and ( AG ) children will rise up against parents and [ s ] cause them to be put to death .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	22	( AH ) You will be hated by all because of My name , but ( AI ) it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	23	“ But whenever they ( AJ ) persecute you in [ t ] one city , flee to [ u ] the next ; for truly I say to you , you will not finish going through the cities of Israel ( AK ) until the Son of Man comes . The Meaning of Discipleship
NASB1995	Matthew	10	24	“ ( AL ) A [ v ] disciple is not above his teacher , nor a slave above his master .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher , and the slave like his master . ( AM ) If they have called the head of the house [ w ] ( AN ) Beelzebul , how much more will they malign the members of his household !
NASB1995	Matthew	10	26	“ Therefore do not ( AO ) fear them , ( AP ) for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed , or hidden that will not be known .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	27	( AQ ) What I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear whispered in your ear , proclaim ( AR ) upon the housetops .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	28	Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul ; but rather ( AS ) fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in [ x ] ( AT ) hell .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	29	( AU ) Are not two sparrows sold for a [ y ] cent ? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	30	But ( AV ) the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	31	So do not fear ; ( AW ) you are more valuable than many sparrows .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	32	“ Therefore ( AX ) everyone who [ z ] confesses Me before men , I will also confess [ aa ] him before My Father who is in heaven .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	33	But ( AY ) whoever [ ab ] denies Me before men , I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	34	“ ( AZ ) Do not think that I came to [ ac ] bring peace on the earth ; I did not come to bring peace , but a sword .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	35	For I came to ( BA ) set a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ;
NASB1995	Matthew	10	36	and ( BB ) a man ’ s enemies will be the members of his household .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	37	“ ( BC ) He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me ; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	38	And ( BD ) he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	39	( BE ) He who has found his [ ad ] life will lose it , and he who has lost his [ ae ] life for My sake will find it . The Reward of Service
NASB1995	Matthew	10	40	“ ( BF ) He who receives you receives Me , and ( BG ) he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	41	( BH ) He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet ’ s reward ; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man ’ s reward .
NASB1995	Matthew	10	42	And ( BI ) whoever in the name of a disciple gives to one of these [ af ] little ones even a cup of cold water to drink , truly I say to you , he shall not lose his reward. ” Footnotes - Matthew 10:2 Or Jacob ; James is the Eng form of Jacob - Matthew 10:2 Gr Joannes , Heb Johanan - Matthew 10:3 I.e . son of Talmai ( Aram ) - Matthew 10:3 Or Jacob - Matthew 10:4 Or Cananaean - Matthew 10:5 Or go off - Matthew 10:5 Or on the road of ( Gr hodos : way or road ) - Matthew 10:7 Or proclaim - Matthew 10:7 Lit has come near - Matthew 10:10 Or knapsack , or beggar ’ s bag - Matthew 10:10 Or inner garments - Matthew 10:10 Lit nourishment - Matthew 10:11 Lit there until - Matthew 10:12 Or household - Matthew 10:12 I.e . the familiar Heb blessing , “ Peace be to this house ! ” - Matthew 10:13 Lit your peace is to come upon it - Matthew 10:13 Lit your peace is to return to you - Matthew 10:16 Or show yourselves to be - Matthew 10:21 Lit put them to death - Matthew 10:23 Lit this - Matthew 10:23 Lit the other - Matthew 10:24 Or student - Matthew 10:25 Or Beezebul : ruler of demons - Matthew 10:28 Gr Gehenna - Matthew 10:29 Gr assarion , the smallest copper coin - Matthew 10:32 Lit will confess in Me - Matthew 10:32 Lit in him - Matthew 10:33 Lit will deny - Matthew 10:34 Lit cast - Matthew 10:39 Or soul - Matthew 10:39 Or soul - Matthew 10:42 I.e . humble New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB1995	Matthew	11	11	Truly I say to you , among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist ! Yet the one who is [ m ] least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .

NASB1995	Matthew	11	2	( C ) Now when ( D ) John , [ c ] while imprisoned , heard of the works of Christ , he sent word by his disciples
NASB1995	Matthew	11	3	and said to Him , “ Are You ( E ) the [ d ] Expected One , or shall we look for someone else ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	11	4	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Go and report to John what you hear and see :
NASB1995	Matthew	11	5	( F ) the blind receive sight and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the ( G ) poor have the [ e ] gospel preached to them .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	6	And blessed is he [ f ] who ( H ) does not [ g ] take offense at Me. ” Jesus ’ Tribute to John
NASB1995	Matthew	11	7	As these men were going away , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John , “ What did you go out into ( I ) the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
NASB1995	Matthew	11	8	[ h ] But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothing ? Those who wear soft clothing are in kings ’ [ i ] palaces !
NASB1995	Matthew	11	9	[ j ] But what did you go out to see ? ( J ) A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and one who is more than a prophet .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	10	This is the one about whom it [ k ] is written ,
NASB1995	Matthew	11	12	( L ) From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven [ n ] suffers violence , and violent men [ o ] take it by force .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	13	For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	14	And if you are willing to accept it , John himself is ( M ) Elijah who [ p ] was to come .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	15	( N ) He who has ears to hear , [ q ] let him hear .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	16	“ But to what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children sitting in the market places , who call out to the other children ,
NASB1995	Matthew	11	17	and say , ‘ We played the flute for you , and you did not dance ; we sang a dirge , and you did not [ r ] mourn. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither ( O ) eating nor ( P ) drinking , and they say , ‘ ( Q ) He has a demon ! ’
NASB1995	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Behold , a gluttonous man and a [ s ] drunkard , ( R ) a friend of tax collectors and [ t ] sinners ! ’ Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds. ” The Unrepenting Cities
NASB1995	Matthew	11	20	Then He began to denounce the cities in which most of His [ u ] ( S ) miracles were done , because they did not repent .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	21	“ ( T ) Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , ( U ) Bethsaida ! For if the [ v ] miracles had occurred in ( V ) Tyre and ( W ) Sidon which occurred in you , they would have repented long ago in [ w ] ( X ) sackcloth and ashes .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	22	Nevertheless I say to you , ( Y ) it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in ( Z ) the day of judgment than for you .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	23	And you , ( AA ) Capernaum , will not be exalted to heaven , will you ? You will ( AB ) descend to ( AC ) Hades ; for if the [ x ] miracles had occurred in ( AD ) Sodom which occurred in you , it would have remained to this day .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	24	Nevertheless I say to you that ( AE ) it will be more tolerable for the land of ( AF ) Sodom in the day of judgment , than for you. ” Come to Me
NASB1995	Matthew	11	25	( AG ) At that [ y ] time Jesus said , “ I praise You , ( AH ) Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that ( AI ) You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	26	Yes , ( AJ ) Father , for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	27	( AK ) All things have been handed over to Me by My Father ; and no one knows the Son except the Father ; nor does anyone know the Father ( AL ) except the Son , and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	28	“ ( AM ) Come to Me , all [ z ] who are weary and heavy-laden , and I will give you rest .
NASB1995	Matthew	11	29	Take My yoke upon you and ( AN ) learn from Me , for I am gentle and humble in heart , and ( AO ) you will find rest for your souls .

NASB1995	Matthew	12	12	( K ) How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep ! So then , it is lawful to do [ i ] good on the Sabbath. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	12	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	2	But when the Pharisees saw this , they said to Him , “ Look , Your disciples do what ( C ) is not lawful to do on a Sabbath. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	12	3	But He said to them , “ Have you not read what David did when he became hungry , he and his companions ,
NASB1995	Matthew	12	4	how he entered the house of God , and ( D ) they ate the [ b ] consecrated bread , which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him , but for the priests alone ?
NASB1995	Matthew	12	5	Or have you not read in the Law , that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple [ c ] break the Sabbath and are innocent ?
NASB1995	Matthew	12	6	But I say to you that something ( E ) greater than the temple is here .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	7	But if you had known what this [ d ] means , ‘ ( F ) I desire [ e ] compassion , and not a sacrifice , ’ you would not have condemned the innocent . Lord of the Sabbath
NASB1995	Matthew	12	8	For ( G ) the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	12	9	( H ) Departing from there , He went into their synagogue .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	10	And a man was there whose hand was withered . And they questioned [ f ] Jesus , asking , “ ( I ) Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? ” —so that they might accuse Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	11	And He said to them , “ ( J ) What man [ g ] is there among you who [ h ] has a sheep , and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will he not take hold of it and lift it out ?
NASB1995	Matthew	12	13	Then He * said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand ! ” ( L ) He stretched it out , and it was restored to [ j ] normal , like the other .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and [ k ] ( M ) conspired against Him , as to how they might destroy Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	15	But Jesus , [ l ] aware of this , withdrew from there . Many followed Him , and ( N ) He healed them all ,
NASB1995	Matthew	12	16	and ( O ) warned them not to [ m ] tell who He was .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	17	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet :
NASB1995	Matthew	12	18	“ ( P ) Behold , My [ n ] Servant whom I [ o ] have chosen ; ( Q ) My Beloved in whom My soul [ p ] is well-pleased ; ( R ) I will put My Spirit upon Him , ( S ) And He shall proclaim [ q ] justice to the [ r ] Gentiles .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	19	“ ( T ) He will not quarrel , nor cry out ; Nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	20	“ ( U ) A battered reed He will not break off , And a smoldering wick He will not put out , Until He [ s ] leads [ t ] justice to victory .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	21	“ ( V ) And in His name the [ u ] Gentiles will hope. ” The Pharisees Rebuked
NASB1995	Matthew	12	22	( W ) Then a ( X ) demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to [ v ] Jesus , and He healed him , so that the mute man spoke and saw .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	23	All the crowds were amazed , and were saying , “ This man can not be the ( Y ) Son of David , can he ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	12	24	, note
NASB1995	Matthew	12	25	( AA ) And ( AB ) knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them , “ [ x ] Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste ; and [ y ] any city or house divided against itself will not stand .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	26	If ( AC ) Satan casts out Satan , he [ z ] is divided against himself ; how then will his kingdom stand ?
NASB1995	Matthew	12	27	If I ( AD ) by [ aa ] Beelzebul cast out demons , ( AE ) by whom do your sons cast them out ? For this reason they will be your judges .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	28	But ( AF ) if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	29	Or how can anyone enter the strong man ’ s house and carry off his property , unless he first binds the strong man ? And then he will plunder his house . The Unpardonable Sin
NASB1995	Matthew	12	30	( AG ) He who is not with Me is against Me ; and he who does not gather with Me scatters .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	31	“ ( AH ) Therefore I say to you , any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people , but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	32	( AI ) Whoever [ ab ] speaks a word against the Son of Man , it shall be forgiven him ; but whoever [ ac ] speaks against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , either in ( AJ ) this age or in the age to come . Words Reveal Character
NASB1995	Matthew	12	33	“ Either make the tree good and its fruit good , or make the tree bad and its fruit bad ; for ( AK ) the tree is known by its fruit .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	34	( AL ) You brood of vipers , how can you , being evil , speak [ ad ] what is good ? ( AM ) For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	35	( AN ) The good man brings out of his good treasure [ ae ] what is good ; and the evil man brings out of his evil treasure [ af ] what is evil .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	36	But I tell you that every [ ag ] careless word that people [ ah ] speak , they shall give an accounting for it in ( AO ) the day of judgment .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	37	For [ ai ] by your words you will be justified , and [ aj ] by your words you will be condemned. ” The Desire for Signs
NASB1995	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him , “ Teacher , ( AP ) we want to see a [ ak ] sign from You. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	12	39	But He answered and said to them , “ ( AQ ) An evil and adulterous generation craves for a [ al ] sign ; and yet no [ am ] sign will be given to it but the [ an ] sign of Jonah the prophet ;
NASB1995	Matthew	12	40	for just as ( AR ) Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster , so will ( AS ) the Son of Man be ( AT ) three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	41	( AU ) The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment , and will condemn it because ( AV ) they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , ( AW ) something greater than Jonah is here .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	42	( AX ) The Queen of the South will rise up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , ( AY ) something greater than Solomon is here .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	43	“ ( AZ ) Now when the unclean spirit goes out of a man , it passes through waterless places seeking rest , and does not find it .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	44	Then it says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came ’ ; and when it comes , it finds it unoccupied , swept , and put in order .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	45	Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they go in and live there ; and ( BA ) the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . That is the way it will also be with this evil generation. ” Changed Relationships
NASB1995	Matthew	12	46	( BB ) While He was still speaking to the crowds , behold , His ( BC ) mother and ( BD ) brothers were standing outside , seeking to speak to Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	12	47	Someone said to Him , “ Behold , Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You. ” [ ao ]
NASB1995	Matthew	12	48	But [ ap ] Jesus answered the one who was telling Him and said , “ Who is My mother and who are My brothers ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	12	49	And stretching out His hand toward His disciples , He said , “ Behold My mother and My brothers !
NASB1995	Matthew	12	50	For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven , he is My brother and sister and mother. ” Footnotes - Matthew 12:1 Or occasion - Matthew 12:4 Or showbread ; lit loaves of presentation - Matthew 12:5 Or profane - Matthew 12:7 Lit is - Matthew 12:7 Or mercy - Matthew 12:10 Lit Him - Matthew 12:11 Lit will be from you - Matthew 12:11 Lit will have - Matthew 12:12 Lit well - Matthew 12:13 Lit health - Matthew 12:14 Lit took counsel - Matthew 12:15 Lit knowing - Matthew 12:16 Lit make Him known - Matthew 12:18 Lit Child - Matthew 12:18 Lit chose - Matthew 12:18 Or took pleasure - Matthew 12:18 Or judgment - Matthew 12:18 Or nations - Matthew 12:20 Or puts forth - Matthew 12:20 Or judgment - Matthew 12:21 Or nations - Matthew 12:22 Lit Him - Matthew 12:24 Or Beezebul ; i.e . ruler of demons - Matthew 12:25 Lit Every - Matthew 12:25 Lit Every - Matthew 12:26 Lit was - Matthew 12:27 V

NASB1995	Matthew	13	3	And He spoke many things to them in ( D ) parables , saying , “ Behold , the sower went out to sow ;
NASB1995	Matthew	13	4	and as he sowed , some seeds fell beside the road , and the birds came and ate them up .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	5	Others fell on the rocky places , where they did not have much soil ; and immediately they sprang up , because they had no depth of soil .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	6	But when the sun had risen , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .

NASB1995	Matthew	13	10	And the disciples came and said to Him , “ Why do You speak to them in parables ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	13	11	[ d ] Jesus answered them , “ ( G ) To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been granted .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	12	( H ) For whoever has , to him more shall be given , and he will have an abundance ; but whoever does not have , even what he has shall be taken away from him .

NASB1995	Matthew	13	15	( K ) For the heart of this people has become dull , With their ears they scarcely hear , And they have closed their eyes , Otherwise they would see with their eyes , Hear with their ears , And understand with their heart and return , And I would heal them. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	13	16	( L ) But blessed are your eyes , because they see ; and your ears , because they hear .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	17	For truly I say to you that ( M ) many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it . The Sower Explained
NASB1995	Matthew	13	18	“ ( N ) Hear then the parable of the sower .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	19	When anyone hears ( O ) the [ i ] word of the kingdom and does not understand it , ( P ) the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart . This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	20	The one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places , this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy ;
NASB1995	Matthew	13	21	yet he has no firm root in himself , but is only temporary , and when affliction or persecution arises because of the [ j ] word , immediately he [ k ] ( Q ) falls away .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	22	And the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns , this is the man who hears the word , and the worry of ( R ) the [ l ] world and the ( S ) deceitfulness of wealth choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	23	And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil , this is the man who hears the word and understands it ; who indeed bears fruit and brings forth , some ( T ) a hundredfold , some sixty , and some thirty. ” Tares among Wheat
NASB1995	Matthew	13	24	Jesus presented another parable to them , saying , “ ( U ) The kingdom of heaven [ m ] may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	25	But while his men were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed [ n ] tares among the wheat , and went away .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	26	But when the [ o ] wheat sprouted and bore grain , then the tares became evident also .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	27	The slaves of the landowner came and said to him , ‘ Sir , did you not sow good seed in your field ? [ p ] How then does it have tares ? ’
NASB1995	Matthew	13	28	And he said to them , ‘ An [ q ] enemy has done this ! ’ The slaves * said to him , ‘ Do you want us , then , to go and gather them up ? ’
NASB1995	Matthew	13	29	But he * said , ‘ No ; for while you are gathering up the tares , you may uproot the wheat with them .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	30	Allow both to grow together until the harvest ; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers , “ First gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up ; but ( V ) gather the wheat into my barn. ” ’ ” The Mustard Seed
NASB1995	Matthew	13	31	He presented another parable to them , saying , “ ( W ) The kingdom of heaven is like ( X ) a mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field ;
NASB1995	Matthew	13	32	and this is smaller than all other seeds , but when it is full grown , it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree , so that ( Y ) the birds of the [ r ] air come and nest in its branches. ” The Leaven
NASB1995	Matthew	13	33	He spoke another parable to them , “ ( Z ) The kingdom of heaven is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in ( AA ) three [ s ] pecks of flour until it was all leavened. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	13	34	All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables , and He did not speak to them ( AB ) without a parable .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	35	This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet : “ ( AC ) I will open My mouth in parables ; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world. ” The Tares Explained
NASB1995	Matthew	13	36	Then He left the crowds and went into ( AD ) the house . And His disciples came to Him and said , “ ( AE ) Explain to us the parable of the [ t ] tares of the field. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	13	37	And He said , “ The one who sows the good seed is ( AF ) the Son of Man ,
NASB1995	Matthew	13	38	and the field is the world ; and as for the good seed , these are ( AG ) the sons of the kingdom ; and the tares are ( AH ) the sons of ( AI ) the evil one ;
NASB1995	Matthew	13	39	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil , and the harvest is ( AJ ) the [ u ] end of the age ; and the reapers are angels .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	40	So just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire , so shall it be at ( AK ) the [ v ] end of the age .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	41	( AL ) The Son of Man ( AM ) will send forth His angels , and they will gather out of His kingdom [ w ] all ( AN ) stumbling blocks , and those who commit lawlessness ,
NASB1995	Matthew	13	42	and ( AO ) will throw them into the furnace of fire ; in that place ( AP ) there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	43	( AQ ) Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . ( AR ) He who has ears , [ x ] let him hear . Hidden Treasure
NASB1995	Matthew	13	44	“ ( AS ) The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field , which a man found and hid again ; and from joy over it he goes and ( AT ) sells all that he has and buys that field . A Costly Pearl
NASB1995	Matthew	13	45	“ Again , ( AU ) the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls ,
NASB1995	Matthew	13	46	and upon finding one pearl of great value , he went and sold all that he had and bought it . A Dragnet
NASB1995	Matthew	13	47	“ Again , ( AV ) the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea , and gathering fish of every kind ;
NASB1995	Matthew	13	48	and when it was filled , they drew it up on the beach ; and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers , but the bad they threw away .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	49	So it will be at ( AW ) the [ y ] end of the age ; the angels will come forth and [ z ] take out the wicked from among the righteous ,
NASB1995	Matthew	13	50	and ( AX ) will throw them into the furnace of fire ; in that place ( AY ) there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	51	“ Have you understood all these things ? ” They * said to Him , “ Yes. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	13	52	And [ aa ] Jesus said to them , “ Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household , who brings out of his treasure things new and old. ” Jesus Revisits Nazareth
NASB1995	Matthew	13	53	( AZ ) When Jesus had finished these parables , He departed from there .
NASB1995	Matthew	13	54	( BA ) He came to [ ab ] His hometown and ( BB ) began teaching them in their synagogue , so that ( BC ) they were astonished , and said , “ Where did this man get this wisdom and these [ ac ] miraculous powers ?
NASB1995	Matthew	13	55	Is not this the carpenter ’ s son ? Is not ( BD ) His mother called Mary , and His ( BE ) brothers , James and Joseph and Simon and Judas ?
NASB1995	Matthew	13	56	And ( BF ) His sisters , are they not all with us ? Where then did this man get all these things ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	13	57	And they took ( BG ) offense at Him . But Jesus said to them , “ ( BH ) A prophet is not without honor except in his [ ad ] hometown and in his own household. ”

NASB1995	Matthew	14	2	and said to his servants , “ ( C ) This is John the Baptist ; [ b ] he has risen from the dead , and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	3	For when ( D ) Herod had John arrested , he bound him and put him ( E ) in prison because of ( F ) Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	4	For John had been saying to him , “ ( G ) It is not lawful for you to have her. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	5	Although Herod wanted to put him to death , he feared the crowd , because they regarded [ c ] John as ( H ) a prophet .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod ’ s birthday came , the daughter of ( I ) Herodias danced [ d ] before them and pleased ( J ) Herod ,
NASB1995	Matthew	14	7	so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	8	Having been prompted by her mother , she * said , “ Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	9	Although he was grieved , the king commanded it to be given because of his oaths , and because of [ e ] his dinner guests .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	10	He sent and had John beheaded in the prison .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl , and she brought it to her mother .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	12	His disciples came and took away the body and buried [ f ] it ; and they went and reported to Jesus . Five Thousand Fed
NASB1995	Matthew	14	13	( K ) Now when Jesus heard about John , He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself ; and when the [ g ] people heard of this , they followed Him on foot from the cities .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	15	When it was evening , the disciples came to Him and said , “ This place is desolate and the hour is already [ i ] late ; so send the crowds away , that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said to them , “ They do not need to go away ; you give them something to eat ! ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	17	They * said to Him , “ We have here only ( N ) five loaves and two fish. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	18	And He said , “ Bring them here to Me. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	19	Ordering the [ j ] people to [ k ] sit down on the grass , He took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up toward heaven , He ( O ) blessed the food , and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds ,
NASB1995	Matthew	14	20	and they all ate and were satisfied . They picked up what was left over of the broken pieces , twelve full ( P ) baskets .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	21	There were about five thousand men who ate , besides women and children . Jesus Walks on the Water
NASB1995	Matthew	14	22	( Q ) Immediately He [ l ] made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side , while He sent the crowds away .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	23	After He had sent the crowds away , ( R ) He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray ; and when it was evening , He was there alone .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	24	But the boat was already [ m ] a long distance from the land , [ n ] battered by the waves ; for the wind was [ o ] ( S ) contrary .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	25	And in ( T ) the [ p ] fourth watch of the night He came to them , walking on the sea .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	26	When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea , they were terrified , and said , “ It is ( U ) a ghost ! ” And they cried out [ q ] in fear .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	27	But immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying , “ ( V ) Take courage , it is I ; ( W ) do not be afraid. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	28	Peter said to Him , “ Lord , if it is You , command me to come to You on the water. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	29	And He said , “ Come ! ” And Peter got out of the boat , and walked on the water and came toward Jesus .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	30	But seeing the wind , he became frightened , and beginning to sink , he cried out , “ Lord , save me ! ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	31	Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him , and * said to him , “ ( X ) You of little faith , why did you doubt ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	14	32	When they got into the boat , the wind stopped .
NASB1995	Matthew	14	33	And those who were in the boat worshiped Him , saying , “ You are certainly ( Y ) God ’ s Son ! ”

NASB1995	Matthew	15	2	“ Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders ? For they ( C ) do not wash their hands when they eat bread. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	3	And He answered and said to them , “ Why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition ?
NASB1995	Matthew	15	4	For God said , ‘ ( D ) Honor your father and mother , ’ and , ‘ ( E ) He who speaks evil of father or mother is to [ a ] be put to death. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	15	5	But you say , ‘ Whoever says to his father or mother , “ Whatever I have that would help you has been [ b ] given to God , ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	6	he is not to honor his father or his mother [ c ] . ’ And by this you invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition .
NASB1995	Matthew	15	7	You hypocrites , rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you :
NASB1995	Matthew	15	8	‘ ( F ) This people honors Me with their lips , But their heart is far away from Me .
NASB1995	Matthew	15	9	‘ But in vain do they worship Me , Teaching as ( G ) doctrines the precepts of men. ’ ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	10	After Jesus called the crowd to Him , He said to them , “ Hear and understand .
NASB1995	Matthew	15	11	( H ) It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles the man , but what proceeds out of the mouth , this defiles the man. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	12	Then the disciples * came and * said to Him , “ Do You know that the Pharisees were [ d ] offended when they heard this statement ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	13	But He answered and said , “ ( I ) Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant shall be uprooted .
NASB1995	Matthew	15	14	Let them alone ; ( J ) they are blind guides [ e ] of the blind . And ( K ) if a blind man guides a blind man , both will fall into a pit. ” The Heart of Man
NASB1995	Matthew	15	16	[ g ] Jesus said , “ Are you still lacking in understanding also ?
NASB1995	Matthew	15	17	Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach , and is [ h ] eliminated ?
NASB1995	Matthew	15	18	But ( M ) the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart , and those defile the man .
NASB1995	Matthew	15	19	( N ) For out of the heart come evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , [ i ] fornications , thefts , false witness , slanders .
NASB1995	Matthew	15	20	These are the things which defile the man ; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man. ” The Syrophoenician Woman
NASB1995	Matthew	15	21	( O ) Jesus went away from there , and withdrew into the district of ( P ) Tyre and ( Q ) Sidon .
NASB1995	Matthew	15	22	And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out , saying , “ Have mercy on me , Lord , ( R ) Son of David ; my daughter is cruelly ( S ) demon-possessed. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	23	But He did not answer her a word . And His disciples came and implored Him , saying , “ Send her away , because she keeps shouting [ j ] at us. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	24	But He answered and said , “ I was sent only to ( T ) the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	25	But she came and ( U ) began [ k ] to bow down before Him , saying , “ Lord , help me ! ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	26	And He answered and said , “ It is not [ l ] good to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the dogs. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	27	But she said , “ Yes , Lord ; [ m ] but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters ’ table. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus said to her , “ O woman , ( V ) your faith is great ; it shall be done for you as you wish. ” And her daughter was healed [ n ] at once . Healing Crowds
NASB1995	Matthew	15	29	( W ) Departing from there , Jesus went along by ( X ) the Sea of Galilee , and having gone up on the mountain , He was sitting there .
NASB1995	Matthew	15	30	And [ o ] large crowds came to Him , bringing with them those who were lame , crippled , blind , mute , and many others , and they laid them down at His feet ; and ( Y ) He healed them .
NASB1995	Matthew	15	31	So the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking , the crippled [ p ] restored , and the lame walking , and the blind seeing ; and they ( Z ) glorified the God of Israel . Four Thousand Fed
NASB1995	Matthew	15	32	( AA ) And Jesus called His disciples to Him , and said , “ ( AB ) I feel compassion for the [ q ] people , because they [ r ] have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat ; and I do not want to send them away hungry , for they might faint on the way. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	33	The disciples * said to Him , “ Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus * said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” And they said , “ Seven , and a few small fish. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	15	35	And He directed the [ s ] people to [ t ] sit down on the ground ;
NASB1995	Matthew	15	36	and He took the seven loaves and the fish ; and ( AC ) giving thanks , He broke them and started giving them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people .
NASB1995	Matthew	15	37	And they all ate and were satisfied , and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces , seven large ( AD ) baskets full .

NASB1995	Matthew	16	7	They began to discuss this among themselves , saying , “ He said that because we did not bring any bread. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	16	8	But Jesus , aware of this , said , “ ( I ) You men of little faith , why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread ?

NASB1995	Matthew	16	13	( O ) Now when Jesus came into the district of ( P ) Caesarea Philippi , He was asking His disciples , “ Who do people say that ( Q ) the Son of Man is ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	16	14	And they said , “ Some say ( R ) John the Baptist ; and others , [ h ] ( S ) Elijah ; but still others , [ i ] Jeremiah , or one of the prophets. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	16	15	He * said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	16	17	And Jesus said to him , “ Blessed are you , ( W ) Simon [ k ] Barjona , because ( X ) flesh and blood did not reveal this to you , but My Father who is in heaven .

NASB1995	Matthew	18	7	“ Woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks ! For ( F ) it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come ; but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes !

NASB1995	Matthew	18	25	But since he [ x ] ( Y ) did not have the means to repay , his lord commanded him ( Z ) to be sold , along with his wife and children and all that he had , and repayment to be made .
NASB1995	Matthew	18	26	So the slave fell to the ground and ( AA ) prostrated himself before him , saying , ‘ Have patience with me and I will repay you everything. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	18	27	And the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and ( AB ) forgave him the [ y ] debt .

NASB1995	Matthew	18	31	So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened , they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their lord all that had happened .

NASB1995	Matthew	19	10	The disciples * said to Him , “ If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this , it is better not to marry. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	19	11	But He said to them , “ ( J ) Not all men can accept this statement , but ( K ) only those to whom it has been given .

NASB1995	Matthew	19	18	Then he * said to Him , “ Which ones ? ” And Jesus said , “ ( R ) You shall not commit murder ; You shall not commit adultery ; You shall not steal ; You shall not bear false witness ;

NASB1995	Matthew	19	23	And Jesus said to His disciples , “ Truly I say to you , ( W ) it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven .
NASB1995	Matthew	19	24	Again I say to you , ( X ) it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	19	25	When the disciples heard this , they were very astonished and said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	19	26	And looking at them Jesus said to them , “ ( Y ) With people this is impossible , but with God all things are possible. ” The Disciples ’ Reward

NASB1995	Matthew	21	9	The crowds going ahead of Him , and those who followed , were shouting , “ Hosanna to the ( F ) Son of David ; ( G ) Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna ( H ) in the highest ! ”

NASB1995	Matthew	21	12	( K ) And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple , and overturned the tables of the ( L ) money changers and the seats of those who were selling ( M ) doves .
NASB1995	Matthew	21	13	And He * said to them , “ It is written , ‘ ( N ) My house shall be called a house of prayer ’ ; but you are making it a ( O ) robbers ’ [ c ] den. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	21	14	And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple , and ( P ) He healed them .
NASB1995	Matthew	21	15	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done , and the children who were shouting in the temple , “ Hosanna to the ( Q ) Son of David , ” they became indignant
NASB1995	Matthew	21	16	and said to Him , “ Do You hear what these children are saying ? ” And Jesus * said to them , “ Yes ; have you never read , ‘ ( R ) Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies You have prepared praise for Yourself ’ ? ”

NASB1995	Matthew	21	20	Seeing this , the disciples were amazed and asked , “ How did the fig tree wither all at once ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	21	22	And ( W ) all things you ask in prayer , believing , you will receive. ” Authority Challenged
NASB1995	Matthew	21	23	( X ) When He entered the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him ( Y ) while He was teaching , and said , “ By what authority are You doing these things , and who gave You this authority ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	21	24	Jesus said to them , “ I will also ask you one [ d ] thing , which if you tell Me , I will also tell you by what authority I do these things .
NASB1995	Matthew	21	25	The baptism of John was from what source , from heaven or from men ? ” And they began reasoning among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say to us , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
NASB1995	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we fear the [ e ] people ; for they all regard John as ( Z ) a prophet. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	21	27	And answering Jesus , they said , “ We do not know. ” He also said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . Parable of Two Sons
NASB1995	Matthew	21	28	“ But what do you think ? A man had two [ f ] sons , and he came to the first and said , ‘ [ g ] Son , go work today in the ( AA ) vineyard. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	21	29	And he answered , ‘ I will not ’ ; but afterward he regretted it and went .
NASB1995	Matthew	21	30	The man came to the second and said the same thing ; and he answered , ‘ I will , sir ’ ; but he did not go .
NASB1995	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two did the will of his father ? ” They * said , “ The first. ” Jesus * said to them , “ Truly I say to you that ( AB ) the tax collectors and prostitutes [ h ] will get into the kingdom of God before you .
NASB1995	Matthew	21	32	For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him ; but ( AC ) the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him ; and you , seeing this , did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe him . Parable of the Landowner
NASB1995	Matthew	21	33	“ Listen to another parable . ( AD ) There was a [ i ] landowner who ( AE ) planted a ( AF ) vineyard and put a wall around it and dug a wine press in it , and built a tower , and rented it out to [ j ] vine-growers and ( AG ) went on a journey .

NASB1995	Matthew	22	2	“ ( A ) The kingdom of heaven [ a ] may be compared to [ b ] a king who [ c ] gave a ( B ) wedding feast for his son .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	3	And he ( C ) sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast , and they were unwilling to come .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	4	Again he ( D ) sent out other slaves saying , ‘ Tell those who have been invited , “ Behold , I have prepared my dinner ; my oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready ; come to the wedding feast. ” ’
NASB1995	Matthew	22	5	But they paid no attention and went their way , one to his own [ d ] farm , another to his business ,
NASB1995	Matthew	22	6	and the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	7	But the king was enraged , and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	8	Then he * said to his slaves , ‘ The wedding is ready , but those who were invited were not worthy .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	9	Go therefore to ( E ) the main highways , and as many as you find there , invite to the wedding feast. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	22	10	Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found , both evil and good ; and the wedding hall was filled with [ e ] dinner guests .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	11	“ But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests , he saw ( F ) a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes ,
NASB1995	Matthew	22	12	and he * said to him , ‘ ( G ) Friend , how did you come in here without wedding clothes ? ’ And the man was speechless .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the servants , ‘ Bind him hand and foot , and throw him into ( H ) the outer darkness ; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	22	14	For many are [ f ] ( I ) called , but few are ( J ) chosen. ” Tribute to Caesar
NASB1995	Matthew	22	15	( K ) Then the Pharisees went and [ g ] plotted together how they might trap Him [ h ] in what He said .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	16	And they * sent their disciples to Him , along with the ( L ) Herodians , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth , and [ i ] defer to no one ; for You are not partial to any .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	17	Tell us then , what do You think ? Is it [ j ] lawful to give a ( M ) poll-tax to ( N ) Caesar , or not ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus perceived their [ k ] malice , and said , “ Why are you testing Me , you hypocrites ?
NASB1995	Matthew	22	19	Show Me the ( O ) coin used for the poll-tax. ” And they brought Him a [ l ] denarius .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	20	And He * said to them , “ Whose likeness and inscription is this ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	22	21	They * said to Him , “ Caesar ’ s. ” Then He * said to them , “ ( P ) Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s ; and to God the things that are God ’ s. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	22	23	( R ) On that day some ( S ) Sadducees ( who say ( T ) there is no resurrection ) came to Jesus and questioned Him ,
NASB1995	Matthew	22	24	asking , “ Teacher , Moses said , ‘ ( U ) If a man dies having no children , his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife , and raise up children for his brother. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	22	25	Now there were seven brothers with us ; and the first married and died , and having no children left his wife to his brother ;
NASB1995	Matthew	22	26	so also the second , and the third , down to the seventh .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	27	Last of all , the woman died .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	28	In the resurrection , therefore , whose wife of the seven will she be ? For they all had married her. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	22	29	But Jesus answered and said to them , “ You are mistaken , ( V ) not [ m ] understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither ( W ) marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	31	But regarding the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was spoken to you by God :
NASB1995	Matthew	22	32	‘ ( X ) I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	22	33	When the crowds heard this , ( Y ) they were astonished at His teaching .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	34	( Z ) But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced ( AA ) the Sadducees , they gathered themselves together .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	35	One of them , [ n ] ( AB ) a lawyer , asked Him a question , testing Him ,
NASB1995	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , which is the great commandment in the Law ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	22	37	And He said to him , “ ‘ ( AC ) You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	22	38	This is the great and [ o ] foremost commandment .
NASB1995	Matthew	22	39	The second is like it , ‘ ( AD ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	22	40	( AE ) On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	22	41	( AF ) Now while the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them a question :
NASB1995	Matthew	22	42	“ What do you think about [ p ] the Christ , whose son is He ? ” They * said to Him , “ ( AG ) The son of David. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	22	43	He * said to them , “ Then how does David [ q ] ( AH ) in the Spirit call Him ‘ Lord , ’ saying ,
NASB1995	Matthew	22	44	‘ ( AI ) The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand , Until I put Your enemies beneath Your feet ” ’ ?
NASB1995	Matthew	22	45	If David then calls Him ‘ Lord , ’ how is He his son ? ”

NASB1995	Matthew	24	32	“ Now learn the parable from the fig tree : when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves , you know that summer is near ;
NASB1995	Matthew	24	33	so , you too , when you see all these things , [ u ] recognize that [ v ] He is near , right ( AR ) at the [ w ] door .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	34	Truly I say to you , ( AS ) this [ x ] generation will not pass away until all these things take place .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	35	( AT ) Heaven and earth will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	36	“ But ( AU ) of that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven , nor the Son , but the Father alone .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	37	For [ y ] the ( AV ) coming of the Son of Man will be ( AW ) just like the days of Noah .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	38	For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking , ( AX ) marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that ( AY ) Noah entered the ark ,
NASB1995	Matthew	24	39	and they did not [ z ] understand until the flood came and took them all away ; so will the ( AZ ) coming of the Son of Man be .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	40	Then there will be two men in the field ; one [ aa ] will be taken and one [ ab ] will be left .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	41	( BA ) Two women will be grinding at the [ ac ] ( BB ) mill ; one [ ad ] will be taken and one [ ae ] will be left . Be Ready for His Coming
NASB1995	Matthew	24	42	“ Therefore ( BC ) be on the alert , for you do not know which day your Lord is coming .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	43	But [ af ] be sure of this , that ( BD ) if the head of the house had known ( BE ) at what time of the night the thief was coming , he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be [ ag ] broken into .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	44	For this reason ( BF ) you also must be ready ; for ( BG ) the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	45	“ ( BH ) Who then is the ( BI ) faithful and ( BJ ) sensible slave whom his [ ah ] master ( BK ) put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time ?
NASB1995	Matthew	24	46	Blessed is that slave whom his [ ai ] master finds so doing when he comes .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	47	Truly I say to you that ( BL ) he will put him in charge of all his possessions .
NASB1995	Matthew	24	48	But if that evil slave says in his heart , ‘ My [ aj ] master [ ak ] is not coming for a long time , ’
NASB1995	Matthew	24	49	and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards ;
NASB1995	Matthew	24	50	the [ al ] master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know ,
NASB1995	Matthew	24	51	and will [ am ] cut him in pieces and [ an ] assign him a place with the hypocrites ; in that place there will be ( BM ) weeping and gnashing of teeth .

NASB1995	Matthew	25	2	Five of them were foolish , and five were ( C ) prudent .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	3	For when the foolish took their lamps , they took no oil with them ,
NASB1995	Matthew	25	4	but the ( D ) prudent took oil in flasks along with their lamps .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	5	Now while the bridegroom was delaying , they all got drowsy and began to sleep .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	6	But at midnight there was a shout , ‘ Behold , the bridegroom ! Come out to meet him. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	25	7	Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	8	The foolish said to the prudent , ‘ Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	25	9	But the ( E ) prudent answered , ‘ No , there will not be enough for us and you too ; go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	25	10	And while they were going away to make the purchase , the bridegroom came , and those who were ( F ) ready went in with him to ( G ) the wedding feast ; and ( H ) the door was shut .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	11	Later the other virgins also came , saying , ‘ ( I ) Lord , lord , open up for us. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	25	12	But he answered , ‘ Truly I say to you , I do not know you. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	25	13	( J ) Be on the alert then , for you do not know the day nor the hour . Parable of the Talents
NASB1995	Matthew	25	14	“ ( K ) For it is just like a man ( L ) about to go on a journey , who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	15	To one he gave five [ a ] ( M ) talents , to another , two , and to another , one , each according to his own ability ; and he ( N ) went on his journey .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	16	Immediately the one who had received the five ( O ) talents went and traded with them , and gained five more talents .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	17	In the same manner the one who had received the two talents gained two more .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	18	But he who received the one talent went away , and dug a hole in the ground and hid his [ b ] master ’ s money .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	19	“ Now after a long time the master of those slaves * came and * ( P ) settled accounts with them .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	20	The one who had received the five ( Q ) talents came up and brought five more talents , saying , ‘ Master , you entrusted five talents to me . See , I have gained five more talents. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	25	21	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and ( R ) faithful slave . You were faithful with a few things , I will ( S ) put you in charge of many things ; enter into the joy of your [ c ] master. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	25	22	“ Also the one who had received the two ( T ) talents came up and said , ‘ Master , you entrusted two talents to me . See , I have gained two more talents. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	25	23	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and ( U ) faithful slave . You were faithful with a few things , I will put you in charge of many things ; enter into the joy of your master. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	25	24	“ And the one also who had received the one ( V ) talent came up and said , ‘ Master , I knew you to be a hard man , reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	26	“ But his master answered and said to him , ‘ You wicked , lazy slave , you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	27	Then you ought to have put my money [ d ] in the bank , and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest .
NASB1995	Matthew	25	28	Therefore take away the talent from him , and give it to the one who has the ten talents. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	25	29	“ ( W ) For to everyone who has , more shall be given , and he will have an abundance ; but from the one who does not have , even what he does have shall be taken away .

NASB1995	Matthew	25	37	Then the righteous will answer Him , ‘ Lord , when did we see You hungry , and feed You , or thirsty , and give You something to drink ?

NASB1995	Matthew	26	6	( J ) Now when Jesus was in ( K ) Bethany , at the home of Simon the leper ,
NASB1995	Matthew	26	7	( L ) a woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume , and she poured it on His head as He reclined at the table .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	8	But the disciples were indignant when they saw this , and said , “ Why this waste ?
NASB1995	Matthew	26	9	For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	10	But Jesus , aware of this , said to them , “ Why do you bother the woman ? For she has done a good deed to Me .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	11	For you always have ( M ) the poor with you ; but you do not always have Me .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	12	For when she poured this perfume on My body , she did it ( N ) to prepare Me for burial .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	13	Truly I say to you , ( O ) wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her. ” Judas ’ s Bargain

NASB1995	Matthew	26	15	and said , “ What are you willing to give me [ a ] to [ b ] ( R ) betray Him to you ? ” And ( S ) they weighed out thirty [ c ] pieces of silver to him .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	16	From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to [ d ] betray [ e ] Jesus .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	17	( T ) Now on the first day of ( U ) Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked , “ Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	18	And He said , “ Go into the city to ( V ) a certain man , and say to him , ‘ The Teacher says , “ ( W ) My time is near ; I am to keep the Passover at your house with My disciples. ” ’ ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	19	The disciples did as Jesus had directed them ; and they prepared the Passover . The Last Passover
NASB1995	Matthew	26	20	( X ) Now when evening came , Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	21	As they were eating , He said , “ ( Y ) Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	22	Being deeply grieved , they [ f ] each one began to say to Him , “ Surely not I , Lord ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	23	And He answered , “ ( Z ) He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	24	The Son of Man is to go , ( AA ) just as it is written of Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! ( AB ) It would have been good [ g ] for that man if he had not been born. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	25	And ( AC ) Judas , who was betraying Him , said , “ Surely it is not I , ( AD ) Rabbi ? ” Jesus * said to him , “ ( AE ) You have said it yourself. ” The Lord ’ s Supper Instituted
NASB1995	Matthew	26	27	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks , He gave it to them , saying , “ Drink from it , all of you ;
NASB1995	Matthew	26	28	for ( AH ) this is My blood of the covenant , which is poured out for ( AI ) many for forgiveness of sins .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	29	But I say to you , I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father ’ s kingdom. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	30	( AJ ) After singing a hymn , they went out to ( AK ) the Mount of Olives .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	31	Then Jesus * said to them , “ You will all [ i ] ( AL ) fall away because of Me this night , for it is written , ‘ ( AM ) I will strike down the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be ( AN ) scattered. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	26	32	But after I have been raised , ( AO ) I will go ahead of you to Galilee. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	33	But Peter said to Him , “ Even though all may [ j ] fall away because of You , I will never fall away. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said to him , “ ( AP ) Truly I say to you that ( AQ ) this very night , before a rooster crows , you will deny Me three times. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	35	Peter * said to Him , “ ( AR ) Even if I have to die with You , I will not deny You. ” All the disciples said the same thing too . The Garden of Gethsemane
NASB1995	Matthew	26	36	( AS ) Then Jesus * came with them to a place called ( AT ) Gethsemane , and * said to His disciples , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	37	And He took with Him ( AU ) Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be grieved and distressed .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	38	Then He * said to them , “ ( AV ) My soul is deeply grieved , to the point of death ; remain here and ( AW ) keep watch with Me. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	39	And He went a little beyond them , and fell on His face and prayed , saying , “ My Father , if it is possible , let ( AX ) this cup pass from Me ; ( AY ) yet not as I will , but as You will. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	40	And He * came to the disciples and * found them sleeping , and * said to Peter , “ So , you men could not ( AZ ) keep watch with Me for one hour ?
NASB1995	Matthew	26	41	( BA ) Keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation ; ( BB ) the spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	42	He went away again a second time and prayed , saying , “ My Father , if this ( BC ) can not pass away unless I drink it , ( BD ) Your will be done. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	43	Again He came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	44	And He left them again , and went away and prayed a third time , saying the same thing once more .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	45	Then He * came to the disciples and * said to them , “ [ k ] Are you still sleeping and resting ? Behold , ( BE ) the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	46	Get up , let us be going ; behold , the one who betrays Me is at hand ! ” Jesus ’ Betrayal and Arrest
NASB1995	Matthew	26	47	( BF ) While He was still speaking , behold , ( BG ) Judas , one of the twelve , came up [ l ] accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs , who came from the chief priests and elders of the people .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	48	Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign , saying , “ Whomever I kiss , He is the one ; seize Him. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	49	Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said , “ Hail , ( BH ) Rabbi ! ” and kissed Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	50	And Jesus said to him , “ ( BI ) Friend , do what you have come for. ” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	51	And behold , ( BJ ) one of those who were with Jesus [ m ] reached and drew out his ( BK ) sword , and struck the ( BL ) slave of the high priest and [ n ] cut off his ear .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	52	Then Jesus * said to him , “ Put your sword back into its place ; for ( BM ) all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	53	Or do you think that I can not appeal to My Father , and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve [ o ] ( BN ) legions of ( BO ) angels ?
NASB1995	Matthew	26	54	How then will ( BP ) the Scriptures be fulfilled , which say that it must happen this way ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	55	At that time Jesus said to the crowds , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would against a robber ? ( BQ ) Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	56	But all this has taken place to fulfill ( BR ) the Scriptures of the prophets. ” Then all the disciples left Him and fled . Jesus before Caiaphas
NASB1995	Matthew	26	57	( BS ) Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to ( BT ) Caiaphas , the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	58	But ( BU ) Peter was following Him at a distance as far as the ( BV ) courtyard of the high priest , and entered in , and sat down with the [ p ] ( BW ) officers to see the outcome .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	59	Now the chief priests and the whole [ q ] ( BX ) Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus , so that they might put Him to death .
NASB1995	Matthew	26	60	They did not find any , even though many false witnesses came forward . But later on ( BY ) two came forward ,
NASB1995	Matthew	26	61	and said , “ This man stated , ‘ ( BZ ) I am able to destroy the [ r ] temple of God and to rebuild it [ s ] in three days. ’ ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	62	The high priest stood up and said to Him , “ Do You not answer ? What is it that these men are testifying against You ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	63	But ( CA ) Jesus kept silent . ( CB ) And the high priest said to Him , “ I [ t ] ( CC ) adjure You by ( CD ) the living God , that You tell us whether You are [ u ] the Christ , ( CE ) the Son of God. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	64	Jesus * said to him , “ ( CF ) You have said it yourself ; nevertheless I tell you , [ v ] hereafter you will see ( CG ) the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power , and ( CH ) coming on the clouds of heaven. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest ( CI ) tore his [ w ] robes and said , “ He has blasphemed ! What further need do we have of witnesses ? Behold , you have now heard the blasphemy ;
NASB1995	Matthew	26	66	what do you think ? ” They answered , “ ( CJ ) He deserves death ! ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	67	( CK ) Then they ( CL ) spat in His face and beat Him with their fists ; and others [ x ] slapped Him ,
NASB1995	Matthew	26	68	and said , “ ( CM ) Prophesy to us , You [ y ] Christ ; who is the one who hit You ? ” Peter ’ s Denials
NASB1995	Matthew	26	69	( CN ) Now Peter was sitting outside in the ( CO ) courtyard , and a servant-girl came to him and said , “ You too were with Jesus the Galilean. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it before them all , saying , “ I do not know what you are talking about. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	71	When he had gone out to the gateway , another servant-girl saw him and * said to those who were there , “ This man was with Jesus of Nazareth. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied it with an oath , “ I do not know the man. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	73	A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter , “ Surely you too are one of them ; ( CP ) for even the way you talk [ z ] gives you away. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	26	74	Then he began to curse and swear , “ I do not know the man ! ” And immediately a rooster crowed .

NASB1995	Matthew	27	5	And he threw the pieces of silver into ( G ) the temple sanctuary and departed ; and ( H ) he went away and hanged himself .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	6	The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said , “ It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury , since it is the price of blood. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	7	And they conferred together and [ b ] with the money bought the Potter ’ s Field as a burial place for strangers .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	8	( I ) For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	9	Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled : “ ( J ) And [ c ] they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of the one whose price had been set by the sons of Israel ;
NASB1995	Matthew	27	10	( K ) and [ d ] they gave them for the Potter ’ s Field , as the Lord directed me. ” Jesus before Pilate
NASB1995	Matthew	27	11	( L ) Now Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor questioned Him , saying , “ Are You the ( M ) King of the Jews ? ” And Jesus said to him , “ ( N ) It is as you say. ”

NASB1995	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate * said to Him , “ Do You not hear how many things they testify against You ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	14	And ( P ) He did not answer him with regard to even a single [ e ] charge , so the governor was quite amazed .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	15	( Q ) Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the [ f ] people any one prisoner whom they wanted .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	16	At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner , called Barabbas .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	17	So when the people gathered together , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you want me to release for you ? Barabbas , or Jesus ( R ) who is called Christ ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that because of envy they had handed Him over .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	19	( S ) While he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent him a message , saying , “ Have nothing to do with that ( T ) righteous Man ; for [ g ] last night I suffered greatly ( U ) in a dream because of Him. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ( V ) ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	21	But the governor [ h ] said to them , “ Which of the two do you want me to release for you ? ” And they said , “ Barabbas. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	22	Pilate * said to them , “ Then what shall I do with Jesus ( W ) who is called Christ ? ” They all * said , “ [ i ] Crucify Him ! ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	23	And he said , “ Why , what evil has He done ? ” But they kept shouting all the more , saying , “ [ j ] Crucify Him ! ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing , but rather that ( X ) a riot was starting , he took water and ( Y ) washed his hands in front of the crowd , saying , “ I am innocent of ( Z ) this Man ’ s blood ; ( AA ) see to that yourselves. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	25	And all the people said , “ ( AB ) His blood shall be on us and on our children ! ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	26	Then he released Barabbas [ k ] for them ; but after having Jesus ( AC ) scourged , he handed Him over to be crucified . Jesus Is Mocked
NASB1995	Matthew	27	28	They stripped Him and ( AG ) put a scarlet robe on Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	29	( AH ) And after twisting together a crown of thorns , they put it on His head , and a [ n ] reed in His right hand ; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him , saying , “ ( AI ) Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	30	( AJ ) They spat on Him , and took the reed and began to beat Him on the head .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	31	( AK ) After they had mocked Him , they took the scarlet robe off Him and put His own garments back on Him , and led Him away to crucify Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	32	( AL ) As they were coming out , they found a man of ( AM ) Cyrene named Simon , [ o ] whom they pressed into service to bear His cross . The Crucifixion
NASB1995	Matthew	27	33	( AN ) And when they came to a place called ( AO ) Golgotha , which means Place of a Skull ,
NASB1995	Matthew	27	34	( AP ) they gave Him ( AQ ) wine to drink mixed with gall ; and after tasting it , He was unwilling to drink .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	35	And when they had crucified Him , ( AR ) they divided up His garments among themselves by casting [ p ] lots .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	36	And sitting down , they began to ( AS ) keep watch over Him there .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	37	And above His head they put up the charge against Him [ q ] which read , “ ( AT ) THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	38	At that time two robbers * were crucified with Him , one on the right and one on the left .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	39	And those passing by were [ r ] hurling abuse at Him , ( AU ) wagging their heads
NASB1995	Matthew	27	40	and saying , “ ( AV ) You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , save Yourself ! ( AW ) If You are the Son of God , come down from the cross. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	41	In the same way the chief priests also , along with the scribes and elders , were mocking Him and saying ,
NASB1995	Matthew	27	42	“ ( AX ) He saved others ; [ s ] He can not save Himself . ( AY ) He is the King of Israel ; let Him now come down from the cross , and we will believe in Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	43	( AZ ) He trusts in God ; let God rescue Him now , if He [ t ] delights in Him ; for He said , ‘ I am the Son of God. ’ ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	44	( BA ) The robbers who had been crucified with Him were also insulting Him with the same words .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	45	( BB ) Now from the [ u ] sixth hour darkness [ v ] fell upon all the land until the [ w ] ninth hour .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	46	About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ ( BC ) Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? ” that is , “ My God , My God , why have You forsaken Me ? ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	47	And some of those who were standing there , when they heard it , began saying , “ This man is calling for Elijah. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	48	( BD ) Immediately one of them ran , and taking a sponge , he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed , and gave Him a drink .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	49	But the rest of them said , “ [ x ] Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him [ y ] . ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	50	And Jesus ( BE ) cried out again with a loud voice , and yielded up His spirit .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	51	( BF ) And behold , ( BG ) the [ z ] veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom ; and ( BH ) the earth shook and the rocks were split .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	52	The tombs were opened , and many bodies of the [ aa ] saints who had ( BI ) fallen asleep were raised ;
NASB1995	Matthew	27	53	and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered ( BJ ) the holy city and appeared to many .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	54	( BK ) Now the centurion , and those who were with him ( BL ) keeping guard over Jesus , when they saw ( BM ) the earthquake and the things that were happening , became very frightened and said , “ Truly this was [ ab ] ( BN ) the Son of God ! ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	55	( BO ) Many women were there looking on from a distance , who had followed Jesus from Galilee while [ ac ] ( BP ) ministering to Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	56	Among them was ( BQ ) Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and ( BR ) the mother of the sons of Zebedee . Jesus Is Buried
NASB1995	Matthew	27	57	( BS ) When it was evening , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	58	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	59	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
NASB1995	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock ; and he rolled ( BT ) a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	61	And ( BU ) Mary Magdalene was there , and the other Mary , sitting opposite the grave .
NASB1995	Matthew	27	62	Now on the next day , [ ad ] the day after ( BV ) the preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate ,
NASB1995	Matthew	27	63	and said , “ Sir , we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said , ‘ ( BW ) After three days I am to rise again. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	27	64	Therefore , give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day , otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people , ‘ He has risen from the dead , ’ and the last deception will be worse than the first. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said to them , “ You have a ( BX ) guard ; go , make it as secure as you know how. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	27	66	And they went and made the grave secure , and along with ( BY ) the guard they set a ( BZ ) seal on ( CA ) the stone .

NASB1995	Matthew	28	2	And behold , a severe earthquake had occurred , for ( C ) an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away ( D ) the stone and sat upon it .
NASB1995	Matthew	28	3	And ( E ) his appearance was like lightning , and his clothing as white as snow .
NASB1995	Matthew	28	4	The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men .
NASB1995	Matthew	28	5	The angel said to the women , “ [ a ] ( F ) Do not be afraid ; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified .
NASB1995	Matthew	28	6	He is not here , for He has risen , ( G ) just as He said . Come , see the place where He was lying .
NASB1995	Matthew	28	7	Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead ; and behold , He is going ahead of you ( H ) into Galilee , there you will see Him ; behold , I have told you. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	28	8	And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples .
NASB1995	Matthew	28	9	And behold , Jesus met them [ b ] and greeted them . And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him .
NASB1995	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus * said to them , “ [ c ] ( I ) Do not be afraid ; go and take word to ( J ) My brethren to leave ( K ) for Galilee , and there they will see Me. ”
NASB1995	Matthew	28	11	Now while they were on their way , some of ( L ) the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened .
NASB1995	Matthew	28	12	And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together , they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers ,
NASB1995	Matthew	28	13	and said , “ You are to say , ‘ His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep. ’
NASB1995	Matthew	28	14	And if this should come to ( M ) the governor ’ s ears , we will win him over and [ d ] keep you out of trouble. ”

NASB1995	Mark	1	4	John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness [ b ] ( E ) preaching a baptism of repentance for the ( F ) forgiveness of sins .
NASB1995	Mark	1	5	And all the country of Judea was going out to him , and all the people of Jerusalem ; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River , confessing their sins .
NASB1995	Mark	1	6	John was clothed with camel ’ s hair and wore ( G ) a leather belt around his waist , and [ c ] his diet was locusts and wild honey .
NASB1995	Mark	1	7	And he was [ d ] preaching , and saying , “ After me One is coming who is mightier than I , and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals .
NASB1995	Mark	1	8	I baptized you [ e ] with water ; but He will baptize you [ f ] with the Holy Spirit. ” The Baptism of Jesus
NASB1995	Mark	1	9	( H ) In those days Jesus ( I ) came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
NASB1995	Mark	1	10	Immediately coming up out of the water , He saw the heavens [ g ] opening , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him ;
NASB1995	Mark	1	11	and a voice came out of the heavens : “ ( J ) You are My beloved Son , in You I am well-pleased. ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	12	( K ) Immediately the Spirit * impelled Him to go out into the wilderness .
NASB1995	Mark	1	13	And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by ( L ) Satan ; and He was with the wild beasts , and the angels were ministering to Him . Jesus Preaches in Galilee

NASB1995	Mark	1	15	and saying , “ ( O ) The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God [ j ] is at hand ; ( P ) repent and [ k ] believe in the gospel. ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	16	( Q ) As He was going along by the Sea of Galilee , He saw Simon and Andrew , the brother of Simon , casting a net in the sea ; for they were fishermen .
NASB1995	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said to them , “ Follow Me , and I will make you become fishers of men. ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	18	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him .
NASB1995	Mark	1	19	Going on a little farther , He saw [ l ] James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who were also in the boat mending the nets .

NASB1995	Mark	1	22	( T ) They were amazed at His teaching ; for He was teaching them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .
NASB1995	Mark	1	23	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
NASB1995	Mark	1	24	saying , “ ( U ) What [ n ] business do we have with each other , Jesus [ o ] of ( V ) Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are— ( W ) the Holy One of God ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be quiet , and come out of him ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	26	Throwing him into convulsions , the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him .
NASB1995	Mark	1	27	They were all ( X ) amazed , so that they debated among themselves , saying , “ What is this ? A new teaching with authority ! He commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey Him. ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	28	Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding district of Galilee . Crowds Healed
NASB1995	Mark	1	29	( Y ) And immediately after they came ( Z ) out of the synagogue , they came into the house of Simon and Andrew , with [ p ] James and John .
NASB1995	Mark	1	30	Now Simon ’ s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever ; and immediately they * spoke to [ q ] Jesus about her .
NASB1995	Mark	1	31	And He came to her and raised her up , taking her by the hand , and the fever left her , and she [ r ] waited on them .

NASB1995	Mark	1	35	( AF ) In the early morning , while it was still dark , Jesus got up , left the house , and went away to a secluded place , and ( AG ) was praying there .
NASB1995	Mark	1	36	Simon and his companions searched for Him ;
NASB1995	Mark	1	37	they found Him , and * said to Him , “ Everyone is looking for You. ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	38	He * said to them , “ Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby , so that I may [ s ] preach there also ; for that is what I came for. ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	39	( AH ) And He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee , [ t ] preaching and casting out the demons .
NASB1995	Mark	1	40	( AI ) And a leper * came to Jesus , beseeching Him and ( AJ ) falling on his knees before Him , and saying , “ If You are willing , You can make me clean. ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	41	Moved with compassion , Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him , and * said to him , “ I am willing ; be cleansed. ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	42	Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed .
NASB1995	Mark	1	43	And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away ,
NASB1995	Mark	1	44	and He * said to him , “ ( AK ) See that you say nothing to anyone ; but ( AL ) go , show yourself to the priest and ( AM ) offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded , as a testimony to them. ”
NASB1995	Mark	1	45	But he went out and began to ( AN ) proclaim it freely and to ( AO ) spread the news around , to such an extent that [ u ] Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city , but [ v ] stayed out in unpopulated areas ; and ( AP ) they were coming to Him from everywhere .

NASB1995	Mark	2	6	But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts ,
NASB1995	Mark	2	7	“ Why does this man speak that way ? He is blaspheming ; ( G ) who can forgive sins [ d ] but God alone ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	2	8	Immediately Jesus , aware [ e ] in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves , * said to them , “ Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts ?
NASB1995	Mark	2	9	Which is easier , to say to the ( H ) paralytic , ‘ Your sins are forgiven ’ ; or to say , ‘ Get up , and pick up your pallet and walk ’ ?

NASB1995	Mark	2	11	“ I say to you , get up , pick up your pallet and go home. ”

NASB1995	Mark	2	16	When ( O ) the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with the sinners and tax collectors , they said to His disciples , “ ( P ) Why is He eating and drinking with tax collectors and [ k ] sinners ? ”

NASB1995	Mark	3	24	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .

NASB1995	Mark	4	4	as he was sowing , some seed fell beside the road , and the birds came and ate it up .
NASB1995	Mark	4	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Mark	4	2	And He was teaching them many things in ( D ) parables , and was saying to them in His teaching ,
NASB1995	Mark	4	3	“ Listen to this ! Behold , the sower went out to sow ;
NASB1995	Mark	4	5	Other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil ; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil .
NASB1995	Mark	4	6	And after the sun had risen , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
NASB1995	Mark	4	7	Other seed fell among the thorns , and the thorns came up and choked it , and it yielded no crop .
NASB1995	Mark	4	8	Other seeds fell into the good soil , and as they grew up and increased , they yielded a crop and produced thirty , sixty , and a hundredfold. ”
NASB1995	Mark	4	9	And He was saying , “ ( E ) He who has ears to hear , [ a ] let him hear. ”
NASB1995	Mark	4	10	As soon as He was alone , [ b ] His followers , along with the twelve , began asking Him about the parables .
NASB1995	Mark	4	11	And He was saying to them , “ To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God , but ( F ) those who are outside get everything ( G ) in parables ,
NASB1995	Mark	4	12	so that ( H ) while seeing , they may see and not perceive , and while hearing , they may hear and not understand , otherwise they might return and be forgiven. ” Explanation
NASB1995	Mark	4	13	( I ) And He * said to them , “ Do you not understand this parable ? How will you understand all the parables ?
NASB1995	Mark	4	14	The sower sows the word .
NASB1995	Mark	4	15	These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown ; and when they hear , immediately ( J ) Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
NASB1995	Mark	4	16	In a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky places , who , when they hear the word , immediately receive it with joy ;
NASB1995	Mark	4	17	and they have no firm root in themselves , but are only temporary ; then , when affliction or persecution arises because of the word , immediately they [ c ] fall away .
NASB1995	Mark	4	18	And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns ; these are the ones who have heard the word ,
NASB1995	Mark	4	19	but the worries of ( K ) the [ d ] world , and the ( L ) deceitfulness of riches , and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
NASB1995	Mark	4	20	And those are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil ; and they hear the word and accept it and ( M ) bear fruit , thirty , sixty , and a hundredfold. ”
NASB1995	Mark	4	21	And He was saying to them , “ ( N ) A lamp is not brought to be put under a [ e ] basket , is it , or under a bed ? Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand ?
NASB1995	Mark	4	22	( O ) For nothing is hidden , except to be revealed ; nor has anything been secret , but that it would come to light .
NASB1995	Mark	4	23	( P ) If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear. ”
NASB1995	Mark	4	24	And He was saying to them , “ Take care what you listen to . [ f ] ( Q ) By your standard of measure it will be measured to you ; and more will be given you besides .
NASB1995	Mark	4	25	( R ) For whoever has , to him more shall be given ; and whoever does not have , even what he has shall be taken away from him. ” Parable of the Seed
NASB1995	Mark	4	26	And He was saying , “ The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil ;
NASB1995	Mark	4	27	and he goes to bed at night and gets up by day , and the seed sprouts and grows—how , he himself does not know .
NASB1995	Mark	4	28	The soil produces crops by itself ; first the blade , then the head , then the mature grain in the head .
NASB1995	Mark	4	29	But when the crop permits , he immediately [ g ] ( S ) puts in the sickle , because the harvest has come. ” Parable of the Mustard Seed
NASB1995	Mark	4	30	( T ) And He said , “ How shall we [ h ] ( U ) picture the kingdom of God , or by what parable shall we present it ?
NASB1995	Mark	4	31	It is like a mustard seed , which , when sown upon the soil , though it is smaller than all the seeds that are upon the soil ,
NASB1995	Mark	4	32	yet when it is sown , it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and forms large branches ; so that ( V ) the birds of the [ i ] air can nest under its shade. ”
NASB1995	Mark	4	33	With many such parables He was speaking the word to them , so far as they were able to hear it ;
NASB1995	Mark	4	34	and He did not speak to them ( W ) without a parable ; but He was ( X ) explaining everything privately to His own disciples . Jesus Stills the Sea
NASB1995	Mark	4	35	( Y ) On that day , when evening came , He * said to them , “ Let us go over to the other side. ”
NASB1995	Mark	4	36	[ j ] Leaving the crowd , they * took Him along with them ( Z ) in the boat , just as He was ; and other boats were with Him .
NASB1995	Mark	4	37	And there * arose a fierce gale of wind , and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up .
NASB1995	Mark	4	38	Jesus Himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion ; and they * woke Him and * said to Him , “ Teacher , do You not care that we are perishing ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	4	39	And He got up and ( AA ) rebuked the wind and said to the sea , “ Hush , be still. ” And the wind died down and [ k ] it became perfectly calm .
NASB1995	Mark	4	40	And He said to them , “ Why are you [ l ] afraid ? ( AB ) Do you still have no faith ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	4	41	They became very much afraid and said to one another , “ Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey Him ? ” Footnotes - Mark 4:9 Or hear ! ; or listen ! - Mark 4:10 Lit those about Him - Mark 4:17 Lit are caused to stumble - Mark 4:19 Or age - Mark 4:21 Or peck-measure - Mark 4:24 Lit By what measure you measure - Mark 4:29 Lit sends forth - Mark 4:30 Lit compare - Mark 4:32 Or sky - Mark 4:36 Or Sending away - Mark 4:39 Lit a great calm occurred - Mark 4:40 Or cowardly New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB1995	Mark	5	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Mark	5	2	When He got out of ( B ) the boat , immediately a man from the tombs ( C ) with an unclean spirit met Him ,
NASB1995	Mark	5	3	and he had his dwelling among the tombs . And no one was able to bind him anymore , even with a chain ;
NASB1995	Mark	5	4	because he had often been bound with shackles and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces , and no one was strong enough to subdue him .
NASB1995	Mark	5	6	Seeing Jesus from a distance , he ran up and bowed down before Him ;
NASB1995	Mark	5	7	and shouting with a loud voice , he * said , “ [ a ] ( D ) What business do we have with each other , Jesus , ( E ) Son of ( F ) the Most High God ? I implore You by God , do not torment me ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	8	For He had been saying to him , “ Come out of the man , you unclean spirit ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	9	And He was asking him , “ What is your name ? ” And he * said to Him , “ My name is ( G ) Legion ; for we are many. ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	10	And he began to implore Him earnestly not to send them out of the country .
NASB1995	Mark	5	11	Now there was a large herd of swine feeding [ b ] nearby on the mountain .
NASB1995	Mark	5	12	The demons implored Him , saying , “ Send us into the swine so that we may enter them. ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	13	Jesus gave them permission . And coming out , the unclean spirits entered the swine ; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea , about two thousand of them ; and they were drowned in the sea .
NASB1995	Mark	5	14	Their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and in the country . And the people came to see what it was that had happened .
NASB1995	Mark	5	15	They * came to Jesus and * observed the man who had been ( H ) demon-possessed sitting down , ( I ) clothed and ( J ) in his right mind , the very man who had had the “ ( K ) legion ” ; and they became frightened .
NASB1995	Mark	5	16	Those who had seen it described to them how it had happened to the ( L ) demon-possessed man , and all about the swine .
NASB1995	Mark	5	17	And they began to ( M ) implore Him to leave their region .
NASB1995	Mark	5	18	( N ) As He was getting into the boat , the man who had been ( O ) demon-possessed was imploring Him that he might [ c ] accompany Him .
NASB1995	Mark	5	19	And He did not let him , but He * said to him , “ ( P ) Go home to your people and report to them [ d ] what great things the Lord has done for you , and how He had mercy on you. ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	20	And he went away and began to ( Q ) proclaim in ( R ) Decapolis [ e ] what great things Jesus had done for him ; and everyone was amazed . Miracles and Healing
NASB1995	Mark	5	21	( S ) When Jesus had crossed over again in ( T ) the boat to the other side , a large crowd gathered around Him ; and so He [ f ] stayed ( U ) by the seashore .
NASB1995	Mark	5	22	( V ) One of ( W ) the synagogue [ g ] officials named Jairus * came up , and on seeing Him , * fell at His feet
NASB1995	Mark	5	23	and * implored Him earnestly , saying , “ My little daughter is at the point of death ; please come and ( X ) lay Your hands on her , so that she will [ h ] get well and live. ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	24	And He went off with him ; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him .
NASB1995	Mark	5	25	A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years ,
NASB1995	Mark	5	26	and had endured much at the hands of many physicians , and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all , but rather had grown worse—
NASB1995	Mark	5	27	after hearing about Jesus , she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His [ i ] cloak .
NASB1995	Mark	5	28	For she [ j ] thought , “ If I just touch His garments , I will [ k ] get well. ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	29	Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her ( Y ) affliction .
NASB1995	Mark	5	30	Immediately Jesus , perceiving in Himself that ( Z ) the power proceeding from Him had gone forth , turned around in the crowd and said , “ Who touched My garments ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	31	And His disciples said to Him , “ You see the crowd pressing in on You , and You say , ‘ Who touched Me ? ’ ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	32	And He looked around to see the woman who had done this .
NASB1995	Mark	5	33	But the woman fearing and trembling , aware of what had happened to her , came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth .
NASB1995	Mark	5	34	And He said to her , “ Daughter , ( AA ) your faith has [ l ] made you well ; ( AB ) go in peace and be healed of your ( AC ) affliction. ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	35	While He was still speaking , they * came from the house of the ( AD ) synagogue official , saying , “ Your daughter has died ; why trouble the Teacher anymore ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	36	But Jesus , overhearing what was being spoken , * said to the ( AE ) synagogue official , “ ( AF ) Do not be afraid any longer , only [ m ] believe. ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	37	And He allowed no one to accompany Him , except ( AG ) Peter and [ n ] James and John the brother of [ o ] James .
NASB1995	Mark	5	38	They * came to the house of the ( AH ) synagogue official ; and He * saw a commotion , and people loudly weeping and wailing .
NASB1995	Mark	5	39	And entering in , He * said to them , “ Why make a commotion and weep ? The child has not died , but is asleep. ”
NASB1995	Mark	5	40	They began laughing at Him . But putting them all out , He * took along the child ’ s father and mother and His own companions , and * entered the room where the child was .
NASB1995	Mark	5	41	Taking the child by the hand , He * said to her , “ Talitha kum ! ” ( which translated means , “ Little girl , ( AI ) I say to you , get up ! ” ) .
NASB1995	Mark	5	42	Immediately the girl got up and began to walk , for she was twelve years old . And immediately they were completely astounded .

NASB1995	Mark	6	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Mark	6	2	When the Sabbath came , He began ( C ) to teach in the synagogue ; and the ( D ) many listeners were astonished , saying , “ Where did this man get these things , and what is this wisdom given to Him , and such [ b ] miracles as these performed by His hands ?
NASB1995	Mark	6	3	Is not this ( E ) the carpenter , ( F ) the son of Mary , and brother of [ c ] James and Joses and Judas and Simon ? Are not ( G ) His sisters here with us ? ” And they took ( H ) offense at Him .
NASB1995	Mark	6	4	Jesus said to them , “ ( I ) A prophet is not without honor except in [ d ] ( J ) his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household. ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	5	And He could do no [ e ] miracle there except that He ( K ) laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them .
NASB1995	Mark	6	7	( M ) And ( N ) He * summoned the twelve and began to send them out ( O ) in pairs , and gave them authority over the unclean spirits ;
NASB1995	Mark	6	8	( P ) and He instructed them that they should take nothing for their journey , except a mere staff—no bread , no [ f ] bag , no money in their belt—
NASB1995	Mark	6	9	but [ g ] to wear sandals ; and He added , “ Do not put on two [ h ] tunics. ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	10	And He said to them , “ Wherever you enter a house , stay there until you [ i ] leave town .
NASB1995	Mark	6	11	Any place that does not receive you or listen to you , as you go out from there , ( Q ) shake the dust [ j ] off the soles of your feet for a testimony against them. ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	12	( R ) They went out and [ k ] preached that men should repent .
NASB1995	Mark	6	13	And they were casting out many demons and ( S ) were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them . John ’ s Fate Recalled
NASB1995	Mark	6	14	( T ) And King Herod heard of it , for His name had become well known ; and people were saying , “ ( U ) John the Baptist has risen from the dead , and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him. ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	15	But others were saying , “ He is ( V ) Elijah. ” And others were saying , “ He is ( W ) a prophet , like one of the prophets of old. ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard of it , he kept saying , “ John , whom I beheaded , has risen ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of ( X ) Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip , because he had married her .
NASB1995	Mark	6	18	For John had been saying to Herod , “ ( Y ) It is not lawful for you to have your brother ’ s wife. ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	19	( Z ) Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death and could not do so ;
NASB1995	Mark	6	20	for ( AA ) Herod was afraid of John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and he kept him safe . And when he heard him , he was very perplexed ; [ l ] but he [ m ] used to enjoy listening to him .
NASB1995	Mark	6	21	A strategic day came when Herod on his birthday ( AB ) gave a banquet for his lords and [ n ] military commanders and the leading men ( AC ) of Galilee ;
NASB1995	Mark	6	22	and when the daughter of ( AD ) Herodias herself came in and danced , she pleased Herod and [ o ] his dinner guests ; and the king said to the girl , “ Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you. ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	23	And he swore to her , “ Whatever you ask of me , I will give it to you ; up to ( AE ) half of my kingdom. ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	24	And she went out and said to her mother , “ What shall I ask for ? ” And she said , “ The head of John the Baptist. ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	25	Immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked , saying , “ I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter. ”
NASB1995	Mark	6	26	And although the king was very sorry , yet because of his oaths and because of [ p ] his dinner guests , he was unwilling to refuse her .
NASB1995	Mark	6	27	Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded him to bring back his head . And he went and had him beheaded in the prison ,
NASB1995	Mark	6	28	and brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the girl ; and the girl gave it to her mother .
NASB1995	Mark	6	29	When his disciples heard about this , they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb .
NASB1995	Mark	6	30	( AF ) The ( AG ) apostles * gathered together with Jesus ; and they reported to Him all that they had done and taught .
NASB1995	Mark	6	31	And He * said to them , “ Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a while. ” ( For there were many people coming and going , and ( AH ) they did not even have time to eat . )

NASB1995	Mark	7	4	and when they come from the market place , they do not eat unless they [ b ] cleanse themselves ; and there are many other things which they have received in order to observe , such as the [ c ] washing of ( E ) cups and pitchers and copper pots . )
NASB1995	Mark	7	5	The Pharisees and the scribes * asked Him , “ Why do Your disciples not walk according to the ( F ) tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with ( G ) impure hands ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	7	6	And He said to them , “ Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites , as it is written : ‘ ( H ) This people honors Me with their lips , But their heart is far away from Me .
NASB1995	Mark	7	8	Neglecting the commandment of God , you hold to the ( J ) tradition of men. ”
NASB1995	Mark	7	9	He was also saying to them , “ You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your ( K ) tradition .
NASB1995	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , ‘ ( L ) Honor your father and your mother ’ ; and , ‘ ( M ) He who speaks evil of father or mother , is to [ d ] be put to death ’ ;

NASB1995	Mark	7	17	When he had left the crowd and entered ( P ) the house , ( Q ) His disciples questioned Him about the parable .
NASB1995	Mark	7	18	And He * said to them , “ Are you so lacking in understanding also ? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside can not defile him ,
NASB1995	Mark	7	19	because it does not go into his heart , but into his stomach , and [ g ] is eliminated ? ” ( Thus He declared ( R ) all foods ( S ) clean . )
NASB1995	Mark	7	20	And He was saying , “ ( T ) That which proceeds out of the man , that is what defiles the man .
NASB1995	Mark	7	21	For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed the evil thoughts , [ h ] fornications , thefts , murders , adulteries ,

NASB1995	Mark	7	26	Now the woman was a [ m ] Gentile , of the Syrophoenician race . And she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter .
NASB1995	Mark	7	27	And He was saying to her , “ Let the children be satisfied first , for it is not [ n ] good to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the dogs. ”
NASB1995	Mark	7	28	But she answered and * said to Him , “ Yes , Lord , but even the dogs under the table feed on the children ’ s crumbs. ”
NASB1995	Mark	7	29	And He said to her , “ Because of this [ o ] answer go ; the demon has gone out of your daughter. ”
NASB1995	Mark	7	30	And going back to her home , she found the child [ p ] lying on the bed , the demon having left .
NASB1995	Mark	7	31	( X ) Again He went out from the region of ( Y ) Tyre , and came through Sidon to ( Z ) the Sea of Galilee , within the region of ( AA ) Decapolis .

NASB1995	Mark	8	9	About four thousand were there ; and He sent them away .
NASB1995	Mark	8	10	And immediately He entered the boat with His disciples and came to the district of ( E ) Dalmanutha .
NASB1995	Mark	8	11	( F ) The Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him , ( G ) seeking from Him a [ h ] sign from heaven , [ i ] to test Him .

NASB1995	Mark	8	13	Leaving them , He again embarked and went away to the other side .

NASB1995	Mark	9	5	Peter * said to Jesus , “ ( E ) Rabbi , it is good for us to be here ; ( F ) let us make three [ b ] tabernacles , one for You , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
NASB1995	Mark	9	6	For he did not know what to answer ; for they became terrified .
NASB1995	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud [ c ] formed , overshadowing them , and ( G ) a voice [ d ] came out of the cloud , “ ( H ) This is My beloved Son , [ e ] listen to Him ! ”

NASB1995	Mark	9	10	They [ g ] seized upon [ h ] that statement , discussing with one another [ i ] what rising from the dead meant .

NASB1995	Mark	9	16	And He asked them , “ What are you discussing with them ? ”

NASB1995	Mark	9	30	( S ) From there they went out and began to go through Galilee , and He did not want anyone to know about it .
NASB1995	Mark	9	31	For He was teaching His disciples and telling them , “ ( T ) The Son of Man is to be [ r ] delivered into the hands of men , and they will kill Him ; and when He has been killed , He will rise three days later. ”

NASB1995	Mark	10	10	In the house the disciples began questioning Him about this again .
NASB1995	Mark	10	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Mark	10	2	Some Pharisees came up to Jesus , testing Him , and began to question Him whether it was lawful for a man to [ a ] divorce a wife .
NASB1995	Mark	10	3	And He answered and said to them , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	4	They said , “ ( C ) Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and [ b ] send her away. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	5	But Jesus said to them , “ [ c ] ( D ) Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment .
NASB1995	Mark	10	6	But ( E ) from the beginning of creation , God ( F ) made them male and female .
NASB1995	Mark	10	7	( G ) For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother [ d ] ,
NASB1995	Mark	10	8	( H ) and the two shall become one flesh ; so they are no longer two , but one flesh .
NASB1995	Mark	10	9	What therefore God has joined together , let no man separate. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	11	And He * said to them , “ ( I ) Whoever [ e ] divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her ;
NASB1995	Mark	10	12	and ( J ) if she herself [ f ] divorces her husband and marries another man , she is committing adultery. ” Jesus Blesses Little Children
NASB1995	Mark	10	13	( K ) And they were bringing children to Him so that He might touch them ; but the disciples rebuked them .
NASB1995	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw this , He was indignant and said to them , “ Permit the children to come to Me ; do not hinder them ; ( L ) for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
NASB1995	Mark	10	15	Truly I say to you , ( M ) whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	16	And He ( N ) took them in His arms and began blessing them , laying His hands on them . The Rich Young Ruler
NASB1995	Mark	10	17	( O ) As He was setting out on a journey , a man ran up to Him and ( P ) knelt before Him , and asked Him , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do to ( Q ) inherit eternal life ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	18	And Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is good except God alone .
NASB1995	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments , ‘ ( R ) Do not murder , Do not commit adultery , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Do not defraud , Honor your father and mother. ’ ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	20	And he said to Him , “ Teacher , I have kept ( S ) all these things from my youth up. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	21	Looking at him , Jesus felt a love for him and said to him , “ One thing you lack : go and sell all you possess and give to the poor , and you will have ( T ) treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	22	But at these words [ g ] he was saddened , and he went away grieving , for he was one who owned much property .
NASB1995	Mark	10	23	And Jesus , looking around , * said to His disciples , “ ( U ) How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	24	The disciples ( V ) were amazed at His words . But Jesus * answered again and * said to them , “ Children , how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God !
NASB1995	Mark	10	25	( W ) It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	26	They were even more astonished and said to Him , “ [ h ] Then who can be saved ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	27	Looking at them , Jesus * said , “ ( X ) With people it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	28	( Y ) Peter began to say to Him , “ Behold , we have left everything and followed You. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , “ Truly I say to you , ( Z ) there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms , for My sake and for the gospel ’ s sake ,
NASB1995	Mark	10	30	[ i ] but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in [ j ] the present age , houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms , along with persecutions ; and in ( AA ) the age to come , eternal life .
NASB1995	Mark	10	31	But ( AB ) many who are first will be last , and the last , first. ” Jesus ’ Sufferings Foretold
NASB1995	Mark	10	32	( AC ) They were on the road going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was walking on ahead of them ; and they ( AD ) were amazed , and those who followed were fearful . And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him ,
NASB1995	Mark	10	33	saying , “ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and ( AE ) the Son of Man will be [ k ] delivered to the chief priests and the scribes ; and they will condemn Him to death and will [ l ] hand Him over to the Gentiles .
NASB1995	Mark	10	34	They will mock Him and ( AF ) spit on Him , and scourge Him and kill Him , and three days later He will rise again. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	35	[ m ] ( AG ) James and John , the two sons of Zebedee , * came up to Jesus , saying , “ Teacher , we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	36	And He said to them , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	37	They said to Him , “ [ n ] Grant that we ( AH ) may sit , one on Your right and one on Your left , in Your glory. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said to them , “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able ( AI ) to drink the cup that I drink , or ( AJ ) to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	39	They said to Him , “ We are able. ” And Jesus said to them , “ The cup that I drink ( AK ) you shall drink ; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized .
NASB1995	Mark	10	40	But to sit on My right or on My left , this is not Mine to give ; ( AL ) but it is for those for whom it has been prepared. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	41	( AM ) Hearing this , the ten began to feel indignant with [ o ] James and John .
NASB1995	Mark	10	42	Calling them to Himself , Jesus * said to them , “ You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them ; and their great men exercise authority over them .
NASB1995	Mark	10	43	But it is not this way among you , ( AN ) but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant ;
NASB1995	Mark	10	44	and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all .
NASB1995	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of Man ( AO ) did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His [ p ] life a ransom for many. ” Bartimaeus Receives His Sight
NASB1995	Mark	10	46	( AP ) Then they * came to Jericho . And ( AQ ) as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd , a blind beggar named Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , was sitting by the road .
NASB1995	Mark	10	47	When he heard that it was Jesus the ( AR ) Nazarene , he began to cry out and say , “ Jesus , ( AS ) Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	48	Many were sternly telling him to be quiet , but he kept crying out all the more , “ ( AT ) Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	49	And Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him here. ” So they * called the blind man , saying to him , “ ( AU ) Take courage , stand up ! He is calling for you. ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	50	Throwing aside his cloak , he jumped up and came to Jesus .
NASB1995	Mark	10	51	And answering him , Jesus said , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” And the blind man said to Him , “ [ q ] ( AV ) Rabboni , I want to regain my sight ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said to him , “ Go ; ( AW ) your faith has [ r ] made you well. ” Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him on the road .

NASB1995	Mark	11	2	and * said to them , “ Go into the village opposite you , and immediately as you enter it , you will find a colt tied there , on which no one yet has ever sat ; untie it and bring it here .
NASB1995	Mark	11	3	If anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ you say , ‘ The Lord has need of it ’ ; and immediately he [ a ] will send it back here. ”
NASB1995	Mark	11	4	They went away and found a colt tied at the door , outside in the street ; and they * untied it .
NASB1995	Mark	11	5	Some of the bystanders were saying to them , “ What are you doing , untying the colt ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	11	6	They spoke to them just as Jesus had told them , and they gave them permission .
NASB1995	Mark	11	7	( D ) They * brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it ; and He sat on it .
NASB1995	Mark	11	8	And many spread their coats in the road , and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields .
NASB1995	Mark	11	9	Those who went in front and those who followed were shouting : “ Hosanna ! ( E ) Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord ;
NASB1995	Mark	11	10	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David ; Hosanna ( F ) in the highest ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	11	12	( I ) On the next day , when they had left Bethany , He became hungry .
NASB1995	Mark	11	13	Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf , He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it ; and when He came to it , He found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
NASB1995	Mark	11	14	He said to it , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again ! ” And His disciples were listening . Jesus Drives Money Changers from the Temple
NASB1995	Mark	11	15	( J ) Then they * came to Jerusalem . And He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling in the temple , and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling [ b ] doves ;
NASB1995	Mark	11	16	and He would not permit anyone to carry [ c ] merchandise through the temple .
NASB1995	Mark	11	17	And He began to teach and say to them , “ Is it not written , ‘ ( K ) My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ’ ? ( L ) But you have made it a robbers ’ [ d ] den. ”
NASB1995	Mark	11	18	The chief priests and the scribes heard this , and ( M ) began seeking how to destroy Him ; for they were afraid of Him , for ( N ) the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching .
NASB1995	Mark	11	19	( O ) When evening came , [ e ] they would go out of the city .
NASB1995	Mark	11	20	( P ) As they were passing by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up .
NASB1995	Mark	11	21	Being reminded , Peter * said to Him , “ ( Q ) Rabbi , look , the fig tree which You cursed has withered. ”
NASB1995	Mark	11	22	And Jesus * answered saying to them , “ ( R ) Have faith in God .
NASB1995	Mark	11	23	( S ) Truly I say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and cast into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says is going to happen , it will be granted him .

NASB1995	Mark	11	27	They * came again to Jerusalem . ( X ) And as He was walking in the temple , the chief priests and the scribes and the elders * came to Him ,
NASB1995	Mark	11	28	and began saying to Him , “ By what authority are You doing these things , or who gave You this authority to do these things ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	11	29	And Jesus said to them , “ I will ask you one question , and you answer Me , and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
NASB1995	Mark	11	30	Was the baptism of John from heaven , or from men ? Answer Me. ”
NASB1995	Mark	11	31	They began reasoning among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
NASB1995	Mark	11	32	But [ g ] shall we say , ‘ From men ’ ? ” —they were afraid of the people , for everyone considered John to have been a real prophet .

NASB1995	Mark	12	18	( L ) Some Sadducees ( who say that there is no resurrection ) * came to Jesus , and began questioning Him , saying ,
NASB1995	Mark	12	19	“ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that ( M ) if a man ’ s brother dies and leaves behind a wife and leaves no child , his brother should [ i ] marry the wife and raise up children to his brother .
NASB1995	Mark	12	20	There were seven brothers ; and the first took a wife , and died leaving no children .
NASB1995	Mark	12	21	The second one [ j ] married her , and died leaving behind no children ; and the third likewise ;
NASB1995	Mark	12	22	and so [ k ] all seven left no children . Last of all the woman died also .
NASB1995	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection , [ l ] when they rise again , which one ’ s wife will she be ? For [ m ] all seven had married her. ”
NASB1995	Mark	12	24	Jesus said to them , “ Is this not the reason you are mistaken , that you do not [ n ] understand the Scriptures or the power of God ?
NASB1995	Mark	12	25	For when they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
NASB1995	Mark	12	26	But [ o ] regarding the fact that the dead rise again , have you not read in the book of Moses , ( N ) in the passage about the burning bush , how God spoke to him , saying , ‘ ( O ) I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ?
NASB1995	Mark	12	27	( P ) He is not the God [ p ] of the dead , but of the living ; you are greatly mistaken. ”
NASB1995	Mark	12	28	( Q ) One of the scribes came and heard them arguing , and ( R ) recognizing that He had answered them well , asked Him , “ What commandment is the [ q ] foremost of all ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered , “ The foremost is , ‘ ( S ) Hear , O Israel ! The Lord our God is one Lord ;
NASB1995	Mark	12	30	( T ) and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength. ’
NASB1995	Mark	12	31	The second is this , ‘ ( U ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’ There is no other commandment greater than these. ”
NASB1995	Mark	12	32	The scribe said to Him , “ Right , Teacher ; You have truly stated that ( V ) He is One , and there is no one else besides Him ;
NASB1995	Mark	12	33	( W ) and to love Him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength , and to love one ’ s neighbor as himself , ( X ) is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. ”
NASB1995	Mark	12	34	When Jesus saw that he had answered intelligently , He said to him , “ You are not far from the kingdom of God. ” ( Y ) After that , no one would venture to ask Him any more questions .
NASB1995	Mark	12	35	( Z ) And Jesus began to say , as He ( AA ) taught in the temple , “ How is it that the scribes say that [ r ] the Christ is the ( AB ) son of David ?
NASB1995	Mark	12	36	David himself said [ s ] in the Holy Spirit , ‘ ( AC ) The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand , Until I put Your enemies beneath Your feet. ” ’

NASB1995	Mark	13	16	and the one who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat .
NASB1995	Mark	13	17	But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days !
NASB1995	Mark	13	18	But pray that it may not happen in the winter .
NASB1995	Mark	13	19	For those days will be a time of tribulation such as has not occurred ( N ) since the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will .

NASB1995	Mark	14	3	( D ) While He was in ( E ) Bethany at the home of Simon the leper , and reclining at the table , there came a woman with an alabaster vial of very ( F ) costly perfume of pure [ a ] nard ; and she broke the vial and poured it over His head .
NASB1995	Mark	14	4	But some were indignantly remarking to one another , “ Why has this perfume been wasted ?
NASB1995	Mark	14	5	For this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred [ b ] denarii , and the money given to the poor. ” And they were scolding her .
NASB1995	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said , “ Let her alone ; why do you bother her ? She has done a good deed to Me .
NASB1995	Mark	14	7	For you always have ( G ) the poor with you , and whenever you wish you can do good to them ; but you do not always have Me .

NASB1995	Mark	14	10	( J ) Then Judas Iscariot , ( K ) who was one of the twelve , went off to the chief priests in order to [ c ] betray Him to them .

NASB1995	Mark	14	12	( L ) On the first day of ( M ) Unleavened Bread , when [ d ] the Passover lamb was being ( N ) sacrificed , His disciples * said to Him , “ Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover ? ”

NASB1995	Mark	14	15	And he himself will show you a large upper room furnished and ready ; prepare for us there. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	16	The disciples went out and came to the city , and found it just as He had told them ; and they prepared the Passover .
NASB1995	Mark	14	17	( P ) When it was evening He * came with the twelve .
NASB1995	Mark	14	18	As they were reclining at the table and eating , Jesus said , “ Truly I say to you that one of you will [ e ] betray Me— [ f ] one who is eating with Me. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	19	They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one , “ Surely not I ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	20	And He said to them , “ It is one of the twelve , [ g ] one who dips with Me in the bowl .
NASB1995	Mark	14	21	For the Son of Man is to go just as it is written of Him ; but woe to that man [ h ] by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been good [ i ] for that man if he had not been born. ” The Lord ’ s Supper

NASB1995	Mark	14	23	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks , He gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
NASB1995	Mark	14	24	And He said to them , “ This is My ( S ) blood of the ( T ) covenant , which is poured out for many .
NASB1995	Mark	14	25	Truly I say to you , I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	26	( U ) After singing a hymn , they went out to ( V ) the Mount of Olives .
NASB1995	Mark	14	27	( W ) And Jesus * said to them , “ You will all [ k ] fall away , because it is written , ‘ ( X ) I will strike down the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered. ’
NASB1995	Mark	14	28	But after I have been raised , ( Y ) I will go ahead of you to Galilee. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	29	But Peter said to Him , “ Even though all may [ l ] fall away , yet I will not. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	30	And Jesus * said to him , “ Truly I say to you , that [ m ] ( Z ) this very night , before ( AA ) a rooster crows twice , you yourself will deny Me three times. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	31	But Peter kept saying insistently , “ Even if I have to die with You , I will not deny You ! ” And they all were saying the same thing also . Jesus in Gethsemane
NASB1995	Mark	14	32	( AB ) They * came to a place named Gethsemane ; and He * said to His disciples , “ Sit here until I have prayed. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	33	And He * took with Him Peter and [ n ] James and John , and began to be very ( AC ) distressed and troubled .
NASB1995	Mark	14	34	And He * said to them , “ ( AD ) My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death ; remain here and keep watch. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	35	And He went a little beyond them , and fell to the ground and began to pray that if it were possible , ( AE ) the hour might [ o ] pass Him by .
NASB1995	Mark	14	36	And He was saying , “ ( AF ) Abba ! Father ! All things are possible for You ; remove this cup from Me ; ( AG ) yet not what I will , but what You will. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	37	And He * came and * found them sleeping , and * said to Peter , “ Simon , are you asleep ? Could you not keep watch for one hour ?
NASB1995	Mark	14	38	( AH ) Keep watching and praying that you may not come into temptation ; the spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	39	Again He went away and prayed , saying the same [ p ] words .
NASB1995	Mark	14	40	And again He came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy ; and they did not know what to answer Him .
NASB1995	Mark	14	41	And He * came the third time , and * said to them , “ [ q ] Are you still sleeping and resting ? It is enough ; ( AI ) the hour has come ; behold , the Son of Man is being [ r ] betrayed into the hands of sinners .
NASB1995	Mark	14	42	Get up , let us be going ; behold , the one who betrays Me is at hand ! ” Betrayal and Arrest
NASB1995	Mark	14	43	( AJ ) Immediately while He was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve , * came up [ s ] accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs , who were from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
NASB1995	Mark	14	44	Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal , saying , “ Whomever I kiss , He is the one ; seize Him and lead Him away [ t ] under guard. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	45	After coming , Judas immediately went to Him , saying , “ ( AK ) Rabbi ! ” and kissed Him .
NASB1995	Mark	14	46	They laid hands on Him and seized Him .
NASB1995	Mark	14	47	But one of those who stood by drew his sword , and struck the slave of the high priest and [ u ] cut off his ear .
NASB1995	Mark	14	48	And Jesus said to them , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me , as you would against a robber ?
NASB1995	Mark	14	49	Every day I was with you ( AL ) in the temple teaching , and you did not seize Me ; but this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	50	And they all left Him and fled .
NASB1995	Mark	14	51	A young man was following Him , wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body ; and they * seized him .
NASB1995	Mark	14	52	But he [ v ] pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked . Jesus before His Accusers
NASB1995	Mark	14	53	( AM ) They led Jesus away to the high priest ; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes * gathered together .

NASB1995	Mark	14	55	Now the chief priests and the whole [ y ] ( AQ ) Council kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death , and they were not finding any .
NASB1995	Mark	14	56	For many were giving false testimony against Him , but their testimony was not consistent .
NASB1995	Mark	14	57	Some stood up and began to give false testimony against Him , saying ,
NASB1995	Mark	14	58	“ We heard Him say , ‘ ( AR ) I will destroy this [ z ] temple made with hands , and in three days I will build another made without hands. ’ ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	59	Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent .
NASB1995	Mark	14	60	The high priest stood up and came forward and questioned Jesus , saying , “ Do You not answer ? [ aa ] What is it that these men are testifying against You ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	61	( AS ) But He kept silent and did not answer . ( AT ) Again the high priest was questioning Him , and [ ab ] saying to Him , “ Are You [ ac ] the Christ , the Son of the Blessed One ? ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said , “ I am ; and you shall see ( AU ) the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power , and ( AV ) coming with the clouds of heaven. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	63	( AW ) Tearing his clothes , the high priest * said , “ What further need do we have of witnesses ?
NASB1995	Mark	14	64	You have heard the ( AX ) blasphemy ; how does it seem to you ? ” And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death .
NASB1995	Mark	14	65	Some began to ( AY ) spit at Him , and [ ad ] ( AZ ) to blindfold Him , and to beat Him with their fists , and to say to Him , “ ( BA ) Prophesy ! ” And the officers [ ae ] received Him with [ af ] slaps in the face . Peter ’ s Denials
NASB1995	Mark	14	66	( BB ) As Peter was below in ( BC ) the courtyard , one of the servant-girls of the high priest * came ,
NASB1995	Mark	14	67	and seeing Peter ( BD ) warming himself , she looked at him and * said , “ You also were with Jesus the ( BE ) Nazarene. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	68	But he denied it , saying , “ I neither know nor understand what you are talking about. ” And he ( BF ) went out onto the [ ag ] porch . [ ah ]
NASB1995	Mark	14	69	The servant-girl saw him , and began once more to say to the bystanders , “ This is one of them ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	70	But again ( BG ) he denied it . And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter , “ Surely you are one of them , ( BH ) for you are a Galilean too. ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	71	But he began to [ ai ] curse and swear , “ I do not know this man you are talking about ! ”
NASB1995	Mark	14	72	Immediately a rooster crowed a second time . And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him , “ Before ( BI ) a rooster crows twice , you will deny Me three times. ” [ aj ] And he began to weep .

NASB1995	Mark	16	11	When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her , ( M ) they refused to believe it .

NASB1995	Luke	1	4	so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been [ f ] ( J ) taught . Birth of John the Baptist Foretold
NASB1995	Luke	1	5	( K ) In the days of Herod , king of Judea , there was a priest named [ g ] Zacharias , of the ( L ) division of [ h ] Abijah ; and he had a wife [ i ] from the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
NASB1995	Luke	1	6	They were both ( M ) righteous in the sight of God , walking ( N ) blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord .
NASB1995	Luke	1	7	But they had no child , because Elizabeth was barren , and they were both advanced in [ j ] years .
NASB1995	Luke	1	8	Now it happened that while ( O ) he was performing his priestly service before God in the appointed order of his division ,
NASB1995	Luke	1	9	according to the custom of the priestly office , he was chosen by lot ( P ) to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
NASB1995	Luke	1	10	And the whole multitude of the people were in prayer ( Q ) outside at the hour of the incense offering .
NASB1995	Luke	1	11	And ( R ) an angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing to the right of the altar of incense .
NASB1995	Luke	1	12	Zacharias was troubled when he saw the angel , and ( S ) fear [ k ] gripped him .
NASB1995	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him , “ ( T ) Do not be afraid , Zacharias , for your petition has been heard , and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and ( U ) you will [ l ] give him the name John .
NASB1995	Luke	1	14	You will have joy and gladness , and many will rejoice at his birth .
NASB1995	Luke	1	15	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord ; and he will ( V ) drink no wine or liquor , and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit [ m ] while yet in his mother ’ s womb .
NASB1995	Luke	1	16	And he will ( W ) turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God .
NASB1995	Luke	1	17	It is he who will ( X ) go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit and power of ( Y ) Elijah , ( Z ) to turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children , and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous , so as to ( AA ) make ready a people prepared for the Lord. ”
NASB1995	Luke	1	18	Zacharias said to the angel , “ How will I know this for certain ? For ( AB ) I am an old man and my wife is advanced in [ n ] years. ”
NASB1995	Luke	1	19	The angel answered and said to him , “ I am ( AC ) Gabriel , who [ o ] ( AD ) stands in the presence of God , and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news .
NASB1995	Luke	1	20	And behold , you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place , because you did not believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their proper time. ”
NASB1995	Luke	1	21	The people were waiting for Zacharias , and were wondering at his delay in the temple .
NASB1995	Luke	1	22	But when he came out , he was unable to speak to them ; and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple ; and he ( AE ) kept [ p ] making signs to them , and remained mute .
NASB1995	Luke	1	23	When the days of his priestly service were ended , he went back home .
NASB1995	Luke	1	24	After these days Elizabeth his wife became pregnant , and she [ q ] kept herself in seclusion for five months , saying ,

NASB1995	Luke	1	26	Now in the sixth month the angel ( AG ) Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called ( AH ) Nazareth ,
NASB1995	Luke	1	27	to ( AI ) a virgin [ r ] engaged to a man whose name was Joseph , ( AJ ) of the [ s ] descendants of David ; and the virgin ’ s name was [ t ] Mary .
NASB1995	Luke	1	28	And coming in , he said to her , “ Greetings , [ u ] favored one ! The Lord [ v ] is with you. ”
NASB1995	Luke	1	29	But she ( AK ) was very perplexed at this statement , and kept pondering what kind of salutation this was .
NASB1995	Luke	1	30	The angel said to her , “ ( AL ) Do not be afraid , Mary ; for you have found favor with God .
NASB1995	Luke	1	31	And behold , you will conceive in your womb and bear a son , and you ( AM ) shall name Him Jesus .
NASB1995	Luke	1	32	He will be great and will be called the Son of ( AN ) the Most High ; and the Lord God will give Him ( AO ) the throne of His father David ;
NASB1995	Luke	1	33	( AP ) and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever , ( AQ ) and His kingdom will have no end. ”
NASB1995	Luke	1	34	Mary said to the angel , “ How [ w ] can this be , since I [ x ] am a virgin ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	1	35	The angel answered and said to her , “ ( AR ) The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of ( AS ) the Most High will overshadow you ; and for that reason ( AT ) the [ y ] holy Child shall be called ( AU ) the Son of God .
NASB1995	Luke	1	36	And behold , even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age ; and [ z ] she who was called barren is now in her sixth month .
NASB1995	Luke	1	37	For [ aa ] ( AV ) nothing will be impossible with God. ”
NASB1995	Luke	1	38	And Mary said , “ Behold , the [ ab ] bondslave of the Lord ; may it be done to me according to your word. ” And the angel departed from her . Mary Visits Elizabeth

NASB1995	Luke	1	41	When Elizabeth heard Mary ’ s greeting , the baby leaped in her womb ; and Elizabeth was ( AX ) filled with the Holy Spirit .
NASB1995	Luke	1	42	And she cried out with a loud voice and said , “ Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
NASB1995	Luke	1	43	And [ ad ] how has it happened to me , that the mother of ( AY ) my Lord would come to me ?
NASB1995	Luke	1	44	For behold , when the sound of your greeting reached my ears , the baby leaped in my womb for joy .

NASB1995	Luke	1	47	And ( BC ) my spirit has rejoiced in ( BD ) God my Savior .
NASB1995	Luke	1	48	“ For ( BE ) He has had regard for the humble state of His [ ah ] bondslave ; For behold , from this time on all generations will count me ( BF ) blessed .
NASB1995	Luke	1	49	“ For the Mighty One has done great things for me ; And holy is His name .
NASB1995	Luke	1	50	“ ( BG ) And His mercy is [ ai ] upon generation after generation Toward those who fear Him .
NASB1995	Luke	1	51	“ ( BH ) He has done [ aj ] mighty deeds with His arm ; He has scattered those who were proud in the [ ak ] thoughts of their heart .
NASB1995	Luke	1	52	“ He has brought down rulers from their thrones , And has ( BI ) exalted those who were humble .
NASB1995	Luke	1	53	“ ( BJ ) He has filled the hungry with good things ; And sent away the rich empty-handed .
NASB1995	Luke	1	54	“ He has given help to Israel His servant , [ al ] In remembrance of His mercy ,
NASB1995	Luke	1	55	( BK ) As He spoke to our fathers , ( BL ) To Abraham and his [ am ] descendants forever. ”
NASB1995	Luke	1	56	And Mary stayed with her about three months , and then returned to her home . John Is Born
NASB1995	Luke	1	57	Now the time [ an ] had come for Elizabeth to give birth , and she gave birth to a son .
NASB1995	Luke	1	58	Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had [ ao ] ( BM ) displayed His great mercy toward her ; and they were rejoicing with her .
NASB1995	Luke	1	59	And it happened that on ( BN ) the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they were going to call him Zacharias , [ ap ] after his father .
NASB1995	Luke	1	60	But his mother answered and said , “ No indeed ; but ( BO ) he shall be called John. ”
NASB1995	Luke	1	61	And they said to her , “ There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name. ”
NASB1995	Luke	1	62	And they ( BP ) made signs to his father , as to what he wanted him called .
NASB1995	Luke	1	63	And he asked for a tablet and wrote as follows , “ ( BQ ) His name is John. ” And they were all astonished .
NASB1995	Luke	1	64	( BR ) And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed , and he began to speak in praise of God .
NASB1995	Luke	1	65	Fear came on all those living around them ; and all these matters were being talked about in all ( BS ) the hill country of Judea .

NASB1995	Luke	1	67	And his father Zacharias ( BU ) was filled with the Holy Spirit , and ( BV ) prophesied , saying :
NASB1995	Luke	1	68	“ ( BW ) Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , For He has visited us and accomplished ( BX ) redemption for His people ,

NASB1995	Luke	2	45	When they did not find Him , they returned to Jerusalem looking for Him .
NASB1995	Luke	2	46	Then , after three days they found Him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers , both listening to them and asking them questions .

NASB1995	Luke	3	15	Now while the people were in a state of expectation and all were [ e ] wondering in their hearts about John , ( T ) as to whether he was [ f ] the Christ ,
NASB1995	Luke	3	16	( U ) John answered and said to them all , “ As for me , I baptize you with water ; but One is coming who is mightier than I , and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals ; He will baptize you [ g ] with the Holy Spirit and fire .

NASB1995	Luke	3	21	( AB ) Now when all the people were baptized , Jesus was also baptized , and while He was ( AC ) praying , heaven was opened ,

NASB1995	Luke	4	15	And He began ( O ) teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all .
NASB1995	Luke	4	16	And He came to ( P ) Nazareth , where He had been brought up ; and as was His custom , ( Q ) He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath , and ( R ) stood up to read .
NASB1995	Luke	4	17	And the [ e ] book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him . And He opened the [ f ] book and found the place where it was written ,
NASB1995	Luke	4	18	“ ( S ) The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me , Because He anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor . He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives , And recovery of sight to the blind , To set free those who are oppressed ,

NASB1995	Luke	4	20	And He ( U ) closed the [ g ] book , gave it back to the attendant and ( V ) sat down ; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him .
NASB1995	Luke	4	21	And He began to say to them , “ Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your [ h ] hearing. ”
NASB1995	Luke	4	22	And all were [ i ] speaking well of Him , and wondering at the [ j ] gracious words which [ k ] were falling from His lips ; and they were saying , “ ( W ) Is this not Joseph ’ s son ? ”

NASB1995	Luke	4	26	and yet Elijah was sent to none of them , but ( AB ) only to [ l ] Zarephath , in the land of ( AC ) Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
NASB1995	Luke	4	27	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , but ( AD ) only Naaman the Syrian. ”
NASB1995	Luke	4	28	And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things ;
NASB1995	Luke	4	29	and they got up and ( AE ) drove Him out of the city , and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city had been built , in order to throw Him down the cliff .
NASB1995	Luke	4	30	But ( AF ) passing through their midst , He went His way .
NASB1995	Luke	4	31	And ( AG ) He came down to ( AH ) Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and He was teaching them on the Sabbath ;

NASB1995	Luke	4	34	“ Let us alone ! [ o ] ( AK ) What business do we have with each other , Jesus [ p ] of ( AL ) Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are— ( AM ) the Holy One of God ! ”

NASB1995	Luke	4	39	And standing over her , He ( AS ) rebuked the fever , and it left her ; and she immediately got up and [ s ] waited on them .
NASB1995	Luke	4	40	( AT ) While ( AU ) the sun was setting , all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him ; and ( AV ) laying His hands on each one of them , He was ( AW ) healing them .
NASB1995	Luke	4	41	Demons also were coming out of many , shouting , “ You are ( AX ) the Son of God ! ” But ( AY ) rebuking them , He would ( AZ ) not allow them to speak , because they knew Him to be [ t ] the Christ .

NASB1995	Luke	5	2	and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake ; but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets .
NASB1995	Luke	5	3	And ( C ) He got into one of the boats , which was Simon ’ s , and asked him to put out a little way from the land . And He sat down and began teaching the [ a ] people from the boat .
NASB1995	Luke	5	4	When He had finished speaking , He said to Simon , “ Put out into the deep water and ( D ) let down your nets for a catch. ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	6	When they had done this , ( G ) they enclosed a great quantity of fish , and their nets began to break ;
NASB1995	Luke	5	7	so they signaled to their partners in the other boat for them to come and help them . And they came and filled both of the boats , so that they began to sink .
NASB1995	Luke	5	8	But when Simon Peter saw that , he fell down at Jesus ’ [ c ] feet , saying , “ Go away from me Lord , for I am a sinful man ! ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	9	For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken ;
NASB1995	Luke	5	10	and so also were [ d ] James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , “ ( H ) Do not fear , from now on you will be ( I ) catching men. ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	11	When they had brought their boats to land , ( J ) they left everything and followed Him . The Leper and the Paralytic
NASB1995	Luke	5	12	( K ) While He was in one of the cities , behold , there was a man [ e ] covered with leprosy ; and when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face and implored Him , saying , “ Lord , if You are willing , You can make me clean. ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	13	And He stretched out His hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing ; be cleansed. ” And immediately the leprosy left him .
NASB1995	Luke	5	14	And He ordered him to tell no one , “ But go and ( L ) show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing , just as Moses commanded , as a testimony to them. ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	15	But ( M ) the news about Him was spreading even farther , and large crowds were gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses .
NASB1995	Luke	5	16	But Jesus Himself would often slip away [ f ] to the [ g ] wilderness and ( N ) pray .
NASB1995	Luke	5	17	[ h ] One day He was teaching ; and ( O ) there were some Pharisees and ( P ) teachers of the law sitting there , who had ( Q ) come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem ; and ( R ) the power of the Lord was present for Him to perform healing .
NASB1995	Luke	5	18	( S ) And some men were carrying on a [ i ] bed a man who was paralyzed ; and they were trying to bring him in and to set him down in front of Him .
NASB1995	Luke	5	19	But not finding any way to bring him in because of the crowd , they went up on ( T ) the roof and let him down ( U ) through the tiles with his stretcher , into the middle of the crowd , in front of Jesus .
NASB1995	Luke	5	20	Seeing their faith , He said , “ [ j ] Friend , ( V ) your sins are forgiven you. ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	21	The scribes and the Pharisees ( W ) began to reason , saying , “ ( X ) Who is this man who speaks blasphemies ? ( Y ) Who can forgive sins , but God alone ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	22	But Jesus , [ k ] aware of their reasonings , answered and said to them , “ Why are you reasoning in your hearts ?
NASB1995	Luke	5	23	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins have been forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
NASB1995	Luke	5	24	But , so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins , ” —He said to the ( Z ) paralytic— “ I say to you , get up , and pick up your stretcher and go home. ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	25	Immediately he got up before them , and picked up what he had been lying on , and went home ( AA ) glorifying God .
NASB1995	Luke	5	26	[ l ] They were all struck with astonishment and began ( AB ) glorifying God ; and they were filled ( AC ) with fear , saying , “ We have seen remarkable things today. ” Call of Levi ( Matthew )
NASB1995	Luke	5	27	( AD ) After that He went out and noticed a tax collector named [ m ] ( AE ) Levi sitting in the tax booth , and He said to him , “ Follow Me. ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	28	And he ( AF ) left everything behind , and got up and began to follow Him .
NASB1995	Luke	5	29	And ( AG ) Levi gave a big reception for Him in his house ; and there was a great crowd of ( AH ) tax collectors and other people who were reclining at the table with them .
NASB1995	Luke	5	30	( AI ) The Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling at His disciples , saying , “ Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and [ n ] sinners ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answered and said to them , “ ( AJ ) It is not those who are well who need a physician , but those who are sick .
NASB1995	Luke	5	32	I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	33	And they said to Him , “ ( AK ) The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers , the disciples of the Pharisees also do [ o ] the same , but Yours eat and drink. ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	34	And Jesus said to them , “ You can not make the [ p ] attendants of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them , can you ?
NASB1995	Luke	5	35	( AL ) But the days will come ; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them , then they will fast in those days. ”
NASB1995	Luke	5	36	And He was also telling them a parable : “ No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment ; otherwise he will both tear the new , and the piece from the new will not match the old .
NASB1995	Luke	5	37	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins ; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled out , and the skins will be ruined .
NASB1995	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins .

NASB1995	Luke	6	40	( AR ) A [ x ] pupil is not above his teacher ; but everyone , after he has been fully trained , will [ y ] be like his teacher .
NASB1995	Luke	6	41	Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother ’ s eye , but do not notice the log that is in your own eye ?
NASB1995	Luke	6	42	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me take out the speck that is in your eye , ’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye ? You hypocrite , first take the log out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother ’ s eye .
NASB1995	Luke	6	43	( AS ) For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit , nor , [ z ] on the other hand , a bad tree which produces good fruit .
NASB1995	Luke	6	44	( AT ) For each tree is known by its own fruit . For men do not gather figs from thorns , nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush .
NASB1995	Luke	6	45	( AU ) The good man out of the good [ aa ] treasure of his heart brings forth what is good ; and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil ; ( AV ) for his mouth speaks from [ ab ] that which fills his heart . Builders and Foundations

NASB1995	Luke	6	49	But the one who has heard and has not acted accordingly , is like a man who built a house on the ground without any foundation ; and the [ af ] torrent burst against it and immediately it collapsed , and the ruin of that house was great. ” Footnotes - Luke 6:4 Or showbread ; lit loaves of presentation - Luke 6:6 Lit and his - Luke 6:8 Lit their thoughts - Luke 6:8 Lit stand into the middle - Luke 6:8 Lit stood - Luke 6:11 Lit folly - Luke 6:12 Lit in these days - Luke 6:14 Or Jacob , also vv

NASB1995	Luke	7	2	And a centurion ’ s slave , [ a ] who was highly regarded by him , was sick and about to die .
NASB1995	Luke	7	3	When he heard about Jesus , ( C ) he sent some [ b ] Jewish elders asking Him to come and [ c ] save the life of his slave .
NASB1995	Luke	7	4	When they came to Jesus , they earnestly implored Him , saying , “ He is worthy for You to grant this to him ;
NASB1995	Luke	7	5	for he loves our nation and it was he who built us our synagogue. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	6	Now Jesus started on His way with them ; and when He was not far from the house , the centurion sent friends , saying to Him , “ [ d ] Lord , do not trouble Yourself further , for I am not worthy for You to come under my roof ;
NASB1995	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man placed under authority , with soldiers under me ; and I say to this one , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes , and to my slave , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he does it. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	9	Now when Jesus heard this , He marveled at him , and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him , “ I say to you , ( D ) not even in Israel have I found such great faith. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	10	When those who had been sent returned to the house , they found the slave in good health .
NASB1995	Luke	7	11	Soon afterwards He went to a city called Nain ; and His disciples were going along with Him , [ g ] accompanied by a large crowd .
NASB1995	Luke	7	12	Now as He approached the gate of the city , [ h ] a dead man was being carried out , the [ i ] only son of his mother , and she was a widow ; and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her .
NASB1995	Luke	7	13	When ( E ) the Lord saw her , He felt compassion for her , and said to her , “ [ j ] Do not weep. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	14	And He came up and touched the coffin ; and the bearers came to a halt . And He said , “ Young man , I say to you , arise ! ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	15	The [ k ] dead man sat up and began to speak . And Jesus gave him back to his mother .
NASB1995	Luke	7	16	( F ) Fear gripped them all , and they began ( G ) glorifying God , saying , “ A great ( H ) prophet has arisen among us ! ” and , “ God has [ l ] visited His people ! ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	17	( I ) This report concerning Him went out all over Judea and in all the surrounding district . A Deputation from John
NASB1995	Luke	7	18	( J ) The disciples of John reported to him about all these things .
NASB1995	Luke	7	19	Summoning [ m ] two of his disciples , John sent them to ( K ) the Lord , saying , “ Are You the [ n ] Expected One , or do we look for someone else ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	20	When the men came to Him , they said , “ John the Baptist has sent us to You , to ask , ‘ Are You the [ o ] Expected One , or do we look for someone else ? ’ ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	21	At that [ p ] very time He ( L ) cured many people of diseases and ( M ) afflictions and evil spirits ; and He gave sight to many who were blind .
NASB1995	Luke	7	22	And He answered and said to them , “ Go and report to John what you have seen and heard : the ( N ) blind receive sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , the ( O ) poor have the gospel preached to them .
NASB1995	Luke	7	23	Blessed is he [ q ] who does not take offense at Me. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	24	When the messengers of John had left , He began to speak to the crowds about John , “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
NASB1995	Luke	7	25	[ r ] But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft [ s ] clothing ? Those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are found in royal palaces !
NASB1995	Luke	7	26	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I say to you , and one who is more than a prophet .
NASB1995	Luke	7	27	This is the one about whom it is written ,
NASB1995	Luke	7	28	I say to you , among those born of women there is no one greater than John ; yet he who is [ u ] least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	29	When all the people and the tax collectors heard this , they [ v ] acknowledged ( Q ) God ’ s justice , ( R ) having been baptized with ( S ) the baptism of John .
NASB1995	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the [ w ] ( T ) lawyers rejected God ’ s purpose for themselves , not having been baptized by [ x ] John .
NASB1995	Luke	7	31	“ To what then shall I compare the men of this generation , and what are they like ?
NASB1995	Luke	7	32	They are like children who sit in the market place and call to one another , and they say , ‘ We played the flute for you , and you did not dance ; we sang a dirge , and you did not weep. ’
NASB1995	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist has come ( U ) eating no bread and drinking no wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon ! ’
NASB1995	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Behold , a gluttonous man and a [ y ] drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and [ z ] sinners ! ’
NASB1995	Luke	7	35	Yet wisdom ( V ) is vindicated by all her children. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	36	Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to [ aa ] dine with him , and He entered the Pharisee ’ s house and reclined at the table .
NASB1995	Luke	7	37	( W ) And there was a woman in the city who was a [ ab ] sinner ; and when she learned that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee ’ s house , she brought an alabaster vial of perfume ,
NASB1995	Luke	7	38	and standing behind Him at His feet , weeping , she began to wet His feet with her tears , and kept wiping them with the hair of her head , and kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume .
NASB1995	Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this , he said to himself , “ If this man were ( X ) a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him , that she is a [ ac ] sinner. ” Parable of Two Debtors
NASB1995	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answered him , “ Simon , I have something to say to you. ” And he [ ad ] replied , “ Say it , Teacher. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	41	“ A moneylender had two debtors : one owed five hundred [ ae ] ( Y ) denarii , and the other fifty .
NASB1995	Luke	7	42	When they ( Z ) were unable to repay , he graciously forgave them both . So which of them will love him more ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	43	Simon answered and said , “ I suppose the one whom he forgave more. ” And He said to him , “ You have judged correctly. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	44	Turning toward the woman , He said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I entered your house ; you ( AA ) gave Me no water for My feet , but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
NASB1995	Luke	7	45	You ( AB ) gave Me no kiss ; but she , since the time I came in , has not ceased to kiss My feet .
NASB1995	Luke	7	46	( AC ) You did not anoint My head with oil , but she anointed My feet with perfume .
NASB1995	Luke	7	47	For this reason I say to you , her sins , which are many , have been forgiven , for she loved much ; but he who is forgiven little , loves little. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	48	Then He said to her , “ ( AD ) Your sins have been forgiven. ”
NASB1995	Luke	7	49	Those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say [ af ] to themselves , “ ( AE ) Who is this man who even forgives sins ? ”

NASB1995	Luke	8	4	( F ) When a large crowd was coming together , and those from the various cities were journeying to Him , He spoke by way of a parable :
NASB1995	Luke	8	5	“ The sower went out to sow his seed ; and as he sowed , some fell beside the road , and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the [ a ] air ate it up .
NASB1995	Luke	8	6	Other seed fell on rocky soil , and as soon as it grew up , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
NASB1995	Luke	8	7	Other seed fell among the thorns ; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out .
NASB1995	Luke	8	9	( H ) His disciples began questioning Him as to what this parable meant .
NASB1995	Luke	8	10	And He said , “ ( I ) To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God , but to the rest it is in parables , so that ( J ) seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand .
NASB1995	Luke	8	11	“ Now the parable is this : ( K ) the seed is the word of God .
NASB1995	Luke	8	12	Those beside the road are those who have heard ; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart , so that they will not believe and be saved .
NASB1995	Luke	8	13	Those on the rocky soil are those who , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no firm root ; [ c ] they believe for a while , and in time of temptation fall away .
NASB1995	Luke	8	14	The seed which fell among the thorns , these are the ones who have heard , and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to maturity .
NASB1995	Luke	8	15	But the seed in the good soil , these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart , and hold it fast , and bear fruit with [ d ] perseverance . Parable of the Lamp
NASB1995	Luke	8	16	“ Now ( L ) no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a container , or puts it under a bed ; but he puts it on a lampstand , so that those who come in may see the light .
NASB1995	Luke	8	17	( M ) For nothing is hidden that will not become evident , nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light .
NASB1995	Luke	8	18	So take care how you listen ; ( N ) for whoever has , to him more shall be given ; and whoever does not have , even what he [ e ] thinks he has shall be taken away from him. ”
NASB1995	Luke	8	19	( O ) And His mother and brothers came to Him , and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd .
NASB1995	Luke	8	20	And it was reported to Him , “ Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , wishing to see You. ”
NASB1995	Luke	8	21	But He answered and said to them , “ My mother and My brothers are these ( P ) who hear the word of God and do it. ” Jesus Stills the Sea
NASB1995	Luke	8	22	( Q ) Now on one of those days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat , and He said to them , “ Let us go over to the other side of ( R ) the lake. ” So they launched out .
NASB1995	Luke	8	23	But as they were sailing along He fell asleep ; and a fierce gale of wind descended on ( S ) the lake , and they began to be swamped and to be in danger .
NASB1995	Luke	8	24	They came to Jesus and woke Him up , saying , “ ( T ) Master , Master , we are perishing ! ” And He got up and ( U ) rebuked the wind and the surging waves , and they stopped , and [ f ] it became calm .
NASB1995	Luke	8	25	And He said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” They were fearful and amazed , saying to one another , “ Who then is this , that He commands even the winds and the water , and they obey Him ? ” The Demoniac Cured
NASB1995	Luke	8	26	( V ) Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
NASB1995	Luke	8	27	And when He came out onto the land , He was met by a man from the city who was possessed with demons ; and who had not put on any clothing for a long time , and was not living in a house , but in the tombs .
NASB1995	Luke	8	28	Seeing Jesus , he cried out and fell before Him , and said in a loud voice , “ [ g ] ( W ) What business do we have with each other , Jesus , Son of ( X ) the Most High God ? I beg You , do not torment me. ”
NASB1995	Luke	8	29	For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For it had seized him many times ; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard , and yet he would break his bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert .
NASB1995	Luke	8	30	And Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ ( Y ) Legion ” ; for many demons had entered him .
NASB1995	Luke	8	31	They were imploring Him not to command them to go away into ( Z ) the abyss .
NASB1995	Luke	8	32	Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain ; and the demons implored Him to permit them to enter [ h ] the swine . And He gave them permission .
NASB1995	Luke	8	33	And the demons came out of the man and entered the swine ; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into ( AA ) the lake and was drowned .
NASB1995	Luke	8	34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened , they ran away and reported it in the city and out in the country .
NASB1995	Luke	8	35	The people went out to see what had happened ; and they came to Jesus , and found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting down ( AB ) at the feet of Jesus , clothed and in his right mind ; and they became frightened .
NASB1995	Luke	8	36	Those who had seen it reported to them how the man who was ( AC ) demon-possessed had been [ i ] made well .
NASB1995	Luke	8	37	And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them , for they were gripped with great fear ; and He got into a boat and returned .
NASB1995	Luke	8	38	( AD ) But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might [ j ] accompany Him ; but He sent him away , saying ,
NASB1995	Luke	8	39	“ Return to your house and describe what great things God has done for you. ” So he went away , proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him . Miracles of Healing
NASB1995	Luke	8	40	( AE ) And as Jesus returned , the [ k ] people welcomed Him , for they had all been waiting for Him .
NASB1995	Luke	8	41	( AF ) And there came a man named Jairus , and he was an [ l ] ( AG ) official of the synagogue ; and he fell at Jesus ’ feet , and began to implore Him to come to his house ;
NASB1995	Luke	8	42	for he had an [ m ] only daughter , about twelve years old , and she was dying . But as He went , the crowds were pressing against Him .
NASB1995	Luke	8	43	And a woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years , and could not be healed by anyone ,
NASB1995	Luke	8	44	came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His [ n ] cloak , and immediately her hemorrhage stopped .
NASB1995	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , “ Who is the one who touched Me ? ” And while they were all denying it , Peter said , “ ( AH ) Master , the [ o ] people are crowding and pressing in on You. ”
NASB1995	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone did touch Me , for I was aware that ( AI ) power had gone out of Me. ”
NASB1995	Luke	8	47	When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice , she came trembling and fell down before Him , and declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him , and how she had been immediately healed .
NASB1995	Luke	8	48	And He said to her , “ Daughter , ( AJ ) your faith has [ p ] made you well ; ( AK ) go in peace. ”
NASB1995	Luke	8	49	While He was still speaking , someone * came from the house of ( AL ) the synagogue official , saying , “ Your daughter has died ; do not trouble the Teacher anymore. ”
NASB1995	Luke	8	50	But when Jesus heard this , He answered him , “ ( AM ) Do not be afraid any longer ; only believe , and she will be [ q ] made well. ”
NASB1995	Luke	8	51	When He came to the house , He did not allow anyone to enter with Him , except Peter and John and James , and the girl ’ s father and mother .
NASB1995	Luke	8	52	Now they were all weeping and ( AN ) lamenting for her ; but He said , “ Stop weeping , for she has not died , but ( AO ) is asleep. ”
NASB1995	Luke	8	53	And they began laughing at Him , knowing that she had died .
NASB1995	Luke	8	54	He , however , took her by the hand and called , saying , “ Child , arise ! ”
NASB1995	Luke	8	55	And her spirit returned , and she got up immediately ; and He gave orders for something to be given her to eat .
NASB1995	Luke	8	56	Her parents were amazed ; but He ( AP ) instructed them to tell no one what had happened . Footnotes - Luke 8:5 Lit heaven - Luke 8:8 Or hear !

NASB1995	Luke	9	6	Departing , they began going [ d ] throughout the villages , ( F ) preaching the gospel and healing everywhere .
NASB1995	Luke	9	7	( G ) Now ( H ) Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening ; and he was greatly perplexed , because it was said by some that ( I ) John had risen from the dead ,
NASB1995	Luke	9	8	and by some that ( J ) Elijah had appeared , and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen again .
NASB1995	Luke	9	10	( L ) When the apostles returned , they gave an account to Him of all that they had done . ( M ) Taking them with Him , He withdrew by Himself to a city called ( N ) Bethsaida .
NASB1995	Luke	9	11	But the crowds were aware of this and followed Him ; and welcoming them , He began speaking to them about the kingdom of God and curing those who had need of healing . Five Thousand Fed
NASB1995	Luke	9	12	Now the day [ e ] was ending , and the twelve came and said to Him , “ Send the crowd away , that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get [ f ] something to eat ; for here we are in a desolate place. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	13	But He said to them , “ You give them something to eat ! ” And they said , “ We have no more than five loaves and two fish , unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	14	( For there were about five thousand men . ) And He said to His disciples , “ Have them [ g ] sit down to eat ( O ) in groups of about fifty each. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	15	They did so , and had them all [ h ] sit down .
NASB1995	Luke	9	16	Then He took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , He blessed them , and broke them , and kept giving them to the disciples to set before the [ i ] people .
NASB1995	Luke	9	17	And they all ate and were satisfied ; and [ j ] the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up , twelve ( P ) baskets full .
NASB1995	Luke	9	18	( Q ) And it happened that while He was ( R ) praying alone , the disciples were with Him , and He questioned them , saying , “ Who do the [ k ] people say that I am ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	19	They answered and said , “ John the Baptist , and others say Elijah ; but others , that one of the prophets of old has risen again. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	20	And He said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” And Peter answered and said , “ ( S ) The [ l ] Christ of God. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	21	But He [ m ] ( T ) warned them and instructed them not to tell this to anyone ,
NASB1995	Luke	9	22	( U ) saying , “ ( V ) The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed and be raised up on the third day. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	23	And He was saying to them all , “ ( W ) If anyone wishes to come after Me , he must deny himself , and take up his cross daily and follow Me .

NASB1995	Luke	9	28	( AB ) Some eight days after these sayings , He took along ( AC ) Peter and John and James , and ( AD ) went up on the mountain ( AE ) to pray .
NASB1995	Luke	9	29	And while He was ( AF ) praying , the appearance of His face ( AG ) became different , and His clothing became white and [ p ] gleaming .

NASB1995	Luke	9	31	who , appearing in [ q ] glory , were speaking of His ( AH ) departure which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem .
NASB1995	Luke	9	32	Now Peter and his companions ( AI ) had been overcome with sleep ; but when they were fully awake , they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him .
NASB1995	Luke	9	33	And as [ r ] these were leaving Him , Peter said to Jesus , “ ( AJ ) Master , it is good for us to be here ; ( AK ) let us make three [ s ] tabernacles : one for You , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah ” — ( AL ) not realizing what he was saying .
NASB1995	Luke	9	34	While he was saying this , a cloud [ t ] formed and began to overshadow them ; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud .
NASB1995	Luke	9	35	Then ( AM ) a voice came out of the cloud , saying , “ ( AN ) This is My Son , My Chosen One ; listen to Him ! ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	36	And when the voice [ u ] had spoken , Jesus was found alone . And ( AO ) they kept silent , and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen .
NASB1995	Luke	9	37	( AP ) On the next day , when they came down from the mountain , a large crowd met Him .
NASB1995	Luke	9	38	And a man from the crowd shouted , saying , “ Teacher , I beg You to look at my son , for he is my [ v ] only boy ,
NASB1995	Luke	9	39	and a spirit seizes him , and he suddenly screams , and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming at the mouth ; and only with difficulty does it leave him , mauling him as it leaves .
NASB1995	Luke	9	40	I begged Your disciples to cast it out , and they could not. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	41	And Jesus answered and said , “ You unbelieving and perverted generation , how long shall I be with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	42	While he was still approaching , the demon [ w ] slammed him to the ground and threw him into a convulsion . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy and gave him back to his father .
NASB1995	Luke	9	43	And they were all amazed at the [ x ] ( AQ ) greatness of God . ( AR ) But while everyone was marveling at all that He was doing , He said to His disciples ,
NASB1995	Luke	9	44	“ Let these words sink into your ears ; ( AS ) for the Son of Man is going to be [ y ] delivered into the hands of men. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	45	But ( AT ) they [ z ] did not understand this statement , and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it ; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement . The Test of Greatness
NASB1995	Luke	9	46	( AU ) An argument [ aa ] started among them as to which of them might be the greatest .
NASB1995	Luke	9	47	But Jesus , ( AV ) knowing [ ab ] what they were thinking in their heart , took a child and stood him by His side ,
NASB1995	Luke	9	48	and said to them , “ ( AW ) Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me , and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me ; ( AX ) for the one who is least among all of you , this is the one who is great. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	49	( AY ) John answered and said , “ ( AZ ) Master , we saw someone casting out demons in Your name ; and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow along with us. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	50	But Jesus said to him , “ Do not hinder him ; ( BA ) for he who is not against you is [ ac ] for you. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	51	When the days were approaching for ( BB ) His [ ad ] ascension , He [ ae ] was determined ( BC ) to go to Jerusalem ;
NASB1995	Luke	9	52	and He sent messengers on ahead of Him , and they went and entered a village of the ( BD ) Samaritans to [ af ] make arrangements for Him .
NASB1995	Luke	9	53	But they did not receive Him , ( BE ) because [ ag ] He was traveling toward Jerusalem .
NASB1995	Luke	9	54	When His disciples ( BF ) James and John saw this , they said , “ Lord , do You want us to ( BG ) command fire to come down from heaven and consume them ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	55	But He turned and rebuked them , [ [ ah ] and said , “ You do not know what kind of spirit you are of ;
NASB1995	Luke	9	56	for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men ’ s lives , but to save them. ” ] And they went on to another village . Exacting Discipleship
NASB1995	Luke	9	57	( BH ) As they were going along the road , ( BI ) someone said to Him , “ I will follow You wherever You go. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	58	And Jesus said to him , “ The foxes have holes and the birds of the [ ai ] air have [ aj ] nests , but ( BJ ) the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	59	And He said to another , “ ( BK ) Follow Me. ” But he said , “ Lord , permit me first to go and bury my father. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	60	But He said to him , “ Allow the dead to bury their own dead ; but as for you , go and ( BL ) proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	61	Another also said , “ I will follow You , Lord ; but ( BM ) first permit me to say good-bye to those at home. ”
NASB1995	Luke	9	62	But Jesus said to him , “ ( BN ) No one , after putting his hand to the plow and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God. ” Footnotes - Luke 9:3 Or knapsack or beggar ’ s bag - Luke 9:3 Or inner garments - Luke 9:4 Lit and leave from there - Luke 9:6 Or from village to village - Luke 9:12 Lit began to decline - Luke 9:12 Lit provisions - Luke 9:14 Lit recline - Luke 9:15 Lit recline - Luke 9:16 Lit crowd - Luke 9:17 Lit that which was left over to them of the broken pieces was - Luke 9:18 Lit crowds - Luke 9:20 I.e .

NASB1995	Luke	10	16	“ ( U ) The one who listens to you listens to Me , and ( V ) the one who rejects you rejects Me ; and he who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me. ” The Happy Results
NASB1995	Luke	10	17	The [ i ] seventy returned with joy , saying , “ Lord , even ( W ) the demons are subject to us in Your name. ”
NASB1995	Luke	10	18	And He said to them , “ I was watching ( X ) Satan fall from heaven like lightning .
NASB1995	Luke	10	19	Behold , I have given you authority to ( Y ) tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy , and nothing will injure you .
NASB1995	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless do not rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that ( Z ) your names are recorded in heaven. ”
NASB1995	Luke	10	21	( AA ) At that very [ j ] time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit , and said , “ I [ k ] praise You , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants . Yes , Father , for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight .
NASB1995	Luke	10	22	( AB ) All things have been handed over to Me by My Father , and ( AC ) no one knows who the Son is except the Father , and who the Father is except the Son , and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him. ”
NASB1995	Luke	10	23	( AD ) Turning to the disciples , He said privately , “ Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see ,
NASB1995	Luke	10	24	for I say to you , that many prophets and kings wished to see the things which you see , and did not see them , and to hear the things which you hear , and did not hear them. ”
NASB1995	Luke	10	25	( AE ) And a [ l ] ( AF ) lawyer stood up and put Him to the test , saying , “ Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	10	26	And He said to him , “ What is written in the Law ? [ m ] How does it read to you ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	10	27	And he answered , “ ( AG ) You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your strength , and with all your mind ; and your neighbor as yourself. ”
NASB1995	Luke	10	28	And He said to him , “ You have answered correctly ; ( AH ) do this and you will live. ”
NASB1995	Luke	10	29	But wishing ( AI ) to justify himself , he said to Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ” The Good Samaritan
NASB1995	Luke	10	30	Jesus replied and said , “ A man was ( AJ ) going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among robbers , and they stripped him and [ n ] beat him , and went away leaving him half dead .
NASB1995	Luke	10	31	And by chance a priest was going down on that road , and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
NASB1995	Luke	10	32	Likewise a Levite also , when he came to the place and saw him , passed by on the other side .
NASB1995	Luke	10	33	But a ( AK ) Samaritan , who was on a journey , came upon him ; and when he saw him , he felt compassion ,
NASB1995	Luke	10	34	and came to him and bandaged up his wounds , pouring oil and wine on them ; and he put him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn and took care of him .
NASB1995	Luke	10	35	On the next day he took out two [ o ] denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said , ‘ Take care of him ; and whatever more you spend , when I return I will repay you. ’
NASB1995	Luke	10	36	Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers ’ hands ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	10	37	And he said , “ The one who showed mercy toward him. ” Then Jesus said to him , “ Go and do [ p ] the same. ” Martha and Mary

NASB1995	Luke	10	41	But the Lord answered and said to her , “ ( AP ) Martha , Martha , you are ( AQ ) worried and bothered about so many things ;

NASB1995	Luke	11	4	‘ And forgive us our sins , For we ourselves also forgive everyone who ( C ) is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation. ’ ”
NASB1995	Luke	11	5	Then He said to them , “ [ d ] Suppose one of you has a friend , and goes to him at midnight and says to him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves ;
NASB1995	Luke	11	6	for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey , and I have nothing to set before him ’ ;
NASB1995	Luke	11	7	and from inside he answers and says , ‘ Do not bother me ; the door has already been shut and my children [ e ] and I are in bed ; I can not get up and give you anything. ’
NASB1995	Luke	11	8	I tell you , even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend , yet ( D ) because of his [ f ] persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs .
NASB1995	Luke	11	9	“ So I say to you , [ g ] ( E ) ask , and it will be given to you ; [ h ] seek , and you will find ; [ i ] knock , and it will be opened to you .
NASB1995	Luke	11	10	For everyone who asks , receives ; and he who seeks , finds ; and to him who knocks , it will be opened .
NASB1995	Luke	11	12	Or if he is asked for an egg , he will not give him a scorpion , will he ?
NASB1995	Luke	11	13	( F ) If you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your [ l ] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him ? ” Pharisees ’ Blasphemy
NASB1995	Luke	11	14	( G ) And He was casting out a demon , and it was mute ; when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke ; and the crowds were amazed .
NASB1995	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , “ He casts out demons ( H ) by ( I ) Beelzebul , the ruler of the demons. ”
NASB1995	Luke	11	16	Others , [ m ] to test Him , ( J ) were demanding of Him a [ n ] sign from heaven .
NASB1995	Luke	11	17	( K ) But He knew their thoughts and said to them , “ [ o ] Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste ; and a house divided against [ p ] itself falls .
NASB1995	Luke	11	18	If ( L ) Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? For you say that I cast out demons by ( M ) Beelzebul .
NASB1995	Luke	11	19	And if I by ( N ) Beelzebul cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? So they will be your judges .
NASB1995	Luke	11	20	But if I cast out demons by the ( O ) finger of God , then ( P ) the kingdom of God has come upon you .
NASB1995	Luke	11	21	When [ q ] a strong man , fully armed , guards his own house , his possessions are [ r ] undisturbed .
NASB1995	Luke	11	22	But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him , he takes away from him all his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder .
NASB1995	Luke	11	23	( Q ) He who is not with Me is against Me ; and he who does not gather with Me , scatters .
NASB1995	Luke	11	24	“ ( R ) When the unclean spirit goes out of [ s ] a man , it passes through waterless places seeking rest , and not finding any , it says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came. ’
NASB1995	Luke	11	25	And when it comes , it finds it swept and put in order .
NASB1995	Luke	11	26	Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they go in and live there ; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. ”
NASB1995	Luke	11	27	While [ t ] Jesus was saying these things , one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him , “ ( S ) Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed. ”
NASB1995	Luke	11	28	But He said , “ On the contrary , blessed are ( T ) those who hear the word of God and observe it. ” The Sign of Jonah
NASB1995	Luke	11	29	As the crowds were increasing , He began to say , “ ( U ) This generation is a wicked generation ; it ( V ) seeks for a [ u ] sign , and yet no [ v ] sign will be given to it but the [ w ] sign of Jonah .
NASB1995	Luke	11	30	For just as ( W ) Jonah became a [ x ] sign to the Ninevites , so will the Son of Man be to this generation .
NASB1995	Luke	11	31	The ( X ) Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation at the judgment and condemn them , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , something greater than Solomon is here .
NASB1995	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it , because ( Y ) they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , something greater than Jonah is here .
NASB1995	Luke	11	33	“ ( Z ) No one , after lighting a lamp , puts it away in a cellar nor under a basket , but on the lampstand , so that those who enter may see the light .
NASB1995	Luke	11	34	( AA ) The eye is the lamp of your body ; when your eye is [ y ] clear , your whole body also is full of light ; but when it is [ z ] bad , your body also is full of darkness .
NASB1995	Luke	11	35	Then watch out that the light in you is not darkness .
NASB1995	Luke	11	36	If therefore your whole body is full of light , with no dark part in it , it will be wholly illumined , as when the lamp illumines you with its rays. ” Woes upon the Pharisees
NASB1995	Luke	11	37	Now when He had spoken , a Pharisee * asked Him to have lunch with him ; and He went in , and reclined at the table .
NASB1995	Luke	11	38	When the Pharisee saw it , he was surprised that He had not first [ aa ] ( AB ) ceremonially washed before the [ ab ] meal .
NASB1995	Luke	11	39	But ( AC ) the Lord said to him , “ Now ( AD ) you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter ; but [ ac ] inside of you , you are full of robbery and wickedness .
NASB1995	Luke	11	40	( AE ) You foolish ones , did not He who made the outside make the inside also ?
NASB1995	Luke	11	41	But ( AF ) give that which is within as charity , and [ ad ] then all things are ( AG ) clean for you .
NASB1995	Luke	11	42	“ ( AH ) But woe to you Pharisees ! For you ( AI ) pay tithe of mint and rue and every kind of garden herb , and yet disregard justice and the love of God ; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others .
NASB1995	Luke	11	43	Woe to you Pharisees ! For you ( AJ ) love the chief seats in the synagogues and the respectful greetings in the market places .
NASB1995	Luke	11	44	( AK ) Woe to you ! For you are like [ ae ] concealed tombs , and the people who walk over them are unaware of it. ”
NASB1995	Luke	11	45	One of the [ af ] ( AL ) lawyers * said to Him in reply , “ Teacher , when You say this , You insult us too. ”
NASB1995	Luke	11	46	But He said , “ Woe to you ( AM ) lawyers as well ! For ( AN ) you weigh men down with burdens hard to bear , [ ag ] while you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
NASB1995	Luke	11	47	( AO ) Woe to you ! For you build the [ ah ] tombs of the prophets , and it was your fathers who killed them .
NASB1995	Luke	11	48	So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers ; because it was they who killed them , and you build their tombs .
NASB1995	Luke	11	49	For this reason also ( AP ) the wisdom of God said , ‘ ( AQ ) I will send to them prophets and apostles , and some of them they will kill and some they will [ ai ] persecute ,
NASB1995	Luke	11	50	so that the blood of all the prophets , shed ( AR ) since the foundation of the world , may be [ aj ] charged against this generation ,
NASB1995	Luke	11	51	from ( AS ) the blood of Abel to ( AT ) the blood of Zechariah , who was killed between the altar and the house of God ; yes , I tell you , it shall be [ ak ] charged against this generation. ’
NASB1995	Luke	11	52	Woe to you [ al ] ( AU ) lawyers ! For you have taken away the key of knowledge ; ( AV ) you yourselves did not enter , and you hindered those who were entering. ”
NASB1995	Luke	11	53	When He left there , the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to question Him closely on many subjects ,

NASB1995	Luke	12	6	Are not ( G ) five sparrows sold for two [ f ] cents ? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God .
NASB1995	Luke	12	7	( H ) Indeed , the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Do not fear ; you are more valuable than many sparrows .
NASB1995	Luke	12	8	“ And I say to you , everyone who ( I ) confesses Me before men , the Son of Man will confess him also before the angels of God ;

NASB1995	Luke	12	11	When they bring you before ( M ) the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities , do not ( N ) worry about how or what you are to speak in your defense , or what you are to say ;
NASB1995	Luke	12	13	Someone [ h ] in the crowd said to Him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me. ”
NASB1995	Luke	12	14	But He said to him , “ ( P ) Man , who appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over you ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	12	15	Then He said to them , “ ( Q ) Beware , and be on your guard against every form of greed ; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions. ”
NASB1995	Luke	12	16	And He told them a parable , saying , “ The land of a rich man was very productive .

NASB1995	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , ‘ ( S ) You fool ! This very night [ i ] ( T ) your soul is required of you ; and ( U ) now who will own what you have prepared ? ’
NASB1995	Luke	12	21	So is the man who ( V ) stores up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God. ”
NASB1995	Luke	12	22	And He said to His disciples , “ ( W ) For this reason I say to you , [ j ] do not worry about your [ k ] life , as to what you will eat ; nor for your body , as to what you will put on .
NASB1995	Luke	12	23	For life is more than food , and the body more than clothing .
NASB1995	Luke	12	24	Consider the ( X ) ravens , for they neither sow nor reap ; they have no storeroom nor ( Y ) barn , and yet God feeds them ; how much more valuable you are than the birds !
NASB1995	Luke	12	25	And which of you by worrying can add a single [ l ] ( Z ) hour to his [ m ] life ’ s span ?
NASB1995	Luke	12	26	If then you can not do even a very little thing , why do you worry about other matters ?
NASB1995	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies , how they grow : they neither toil nor spin ; but I tell you , not even ( AA ) Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these .
NASB1995	Luke	12	28	But if God so clothes the grass in the field , which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , how much more will He clothe you ? ( AB ) You men of little faith !
NASB1995	Luke	12	29	And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink , and do not ( AC ) keep worrying .
NASB1995	Luke	12	30	For [ n ] all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek ; but your Father knows that you need these things .
NASB1995	Luke	12	31	But seek His kingdom , and ( AD ) these things will be added to you .
NASB1995	Luke	12	32	( AE ) Do not be afraid , ( AF ) little flock , for ( AG ) your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom .
NASB1995	Luke	12	33	“ ( AH ) Sell your possessions and give to charity ; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out , ( AI ) an unfailing treasure in heaven , where no thief comes near nor moth destroys .
NASB1995	Luke	12	34	For ( AJ ) where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . Be in Readiness
NASB1995	Luke	12	35	“ [ o ] ( AK ) Be dressed in ( AL ) readiness , and keep your lamps lit .
NASB1995	Luke	12	36	Be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast , so that they may immediately open the door to him when he comes and knocks .
NASB1995	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find ( AM ) on the alert when he comes ; truly I say to you , that ( AN ) he will gird himself to serve , and have them recline at the table , and will come up and wait on them .
NASB1995	Luke	12	38	( AO ) Whether he comes in the [ p ] second watch , or even in the [ q ] third , and finds them so , blessed are those slaves .
NASB1995	Luke	12	39	“ ( AP ) But [ r ] be sure of this , that if the head of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming , he would not have allowed his house to be [ s ] ( AQ ) broken into .
NASB1995	Luke	12	40	( AR ) You too , be ready ; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not [ t ] expect. ”
NASB1995	Luke	12	41	Peter said , “ Lord , are You addressing this parable to us , or ( AS ) to everyone else as well ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	12	42	And ( AT ) the Lord said , “ ( AU ) Who then is the faithful and sensible ( AV ) steward , whom his master will put in charge of his [ u ] servants , to give them their rations at the proper time ?
NASB1995	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that ( AW ) slave whom his [ v ] master finds so doing when he comes .
NASB1995	Luke	12	44	Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions .
NASB1995	Luke	12	45	But if that slave says in his heart , ‘ My master [ w ] will be a long time in coming , ’ and begins to beat the slaves , both men and women , and to eat and drink and get drunk ;
NASB1995	Luke	12	46	the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know , and will cut him in pieces , and assign him a place with the unbelievers .
NASB1995	Luke	12	47	And that slave who knew his master ’ s will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will , will ( AX ) receive many lashes ,
NASB1995	Luke	12	48	but the one who did not ( AY ) know it , and committed deeds worthy of [ x ] a flogging , will receive but few . ( AZ ) From everyone who has been given much , much will be required ; and to whom they entrusted much , of him they will ask all the more . Christ Divides Men
NASB1995	Luke	12	49	“ I [ y ] have come to cast fire upon the earth ; and [ z ] how I wish it were already kindled !
NASB1995	Luke	12	50	But I have a ( BA ) baptism to [ aa ] undergo , and how distressed I am until it is accomplished !
NASB1995	Luke	12	51	( BB ) Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth ? I tell you , no , but rather division ;
NASB1995	Luke	12	52	for from now on five members in one household will be divided , three against two and two against three .
NASB1995	Luke	12	53	They will be divided , ( BC ) father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ”
NASB1995	Luke	12	54	And He was also saying to the crowds , “ ( BD ) When you see a cloud rising in the west , immediately you say , ‘ A shower is coming , ’ and so it turns out .
NASB1995	Luke	12	55	And when you see a south wind blowing , you say , ‘ It will be a ( BE ) hot day , ’ and it turns out that way .
NASB1995	Luke	12	56	You hypocrites ! ( BF ) You know how to analyze the appearance of the earth and the sky , but [ ab ] why do you not analyze this present time ?
NASB1995	Luke	12	57	“ And ( BG ) why do you not even on your own initiative judge what is right ?
NASB1995	Luke	12	58	For ( BH ) while you are going with your opponent to appear before the magistrate , on your way there make an effort to [ ac ] settle with him , so that he may not drag you before the judge , and the judge turn you over to the officer , and the officer throw you into prison .

NASB1995	Luke	13	6	And He began telling this parable : “ A man had ( E ) a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard ; and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any .
NASB1995	Luke	13	7	And he said to the vineyard-keeper , ‘ Behold , for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree [ d ] without finding any . ( F ) Cut it down ! Why does it even use up the ground ? ’
NASB1995	Luke	13	8	And he answered and said to him , ‘ Let it alone , sir , for this year too , until I dig around it and put in fertilizer ;
NASB1995	Luke	13	9	and if it bears fruit next year , fine ; but if not , cut it down. ’ ” Healing on the Sabbath
NASB1995	Luke	13	10	And He was ( G ) teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
NASB1995	Luke	13	11	And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had ( H ) a sickness caused by a spirit ; and she was bent double , and could not straighten up at all .
NASB1995	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her , He called her over and said to her , “ Woman , you are freed from your sickness. ”
NASB1995	Luke	13	14	But ( K ) the synagogue official , indignant because Jesus ( L ) had healed on the Sabbath , began saying to the crowd in response , “ ( M ) There are six days in which work should be done ; so come during them and get healed , and not on the Sabbath day. ”
NASB1995	Luke	13	15	But ( N ) the Lord answered him and said , “ You hypocrites , ( O ) does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead him away to water him ?
NASB1995	Luke	13	16	And this woman , ( P ) a daughter of Abraham as she is , whom ( Q ) Satan has bound for eighteen long years , should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	13	17	As He said this , all His opponents were being humiliated ; and ( R ) the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him . Parables of Mustard Seed and Leaven
NASB1995	Luke	13	18	So ( S ) He was saying , “ ( T ) What is the kingdom of God like , and to what shall I compare it ?
NASB1995	Luke	13	19	It is like a mustard seed , which a man took and threw into his own garden ; and it grew and became a tree , and ( U ) the birds of the [ e ] air nested in its branches. ”
NASB1995	Luke	13	20	And again He said , “ ( V ) To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
NASB1995	Luke	13	21	( W ) It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in ( X ) three [ f ] pecks of flour until it was all leavened. ” Teaching in the Villages
NASB1995	Luke	13	22	And He was passing through from one city and village to another , teaching , and ( Y ) proceeding on His way to Jerusalem .
NASB1995	Luke	13	23	And someone said to Him , “ Lord , are there just a few who are being saved ? ” And He said to them ,
NASB1995	Luke	13	24	“ ( Z ) Strive to enter through the narrow door ; for many , I tell you , will seek to enter and will not be able .
NASB1995	Luke	13	25	Once the head of the house gets up and ( AA ) shuts the door , and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door , saying , ‘ ( AB ) Lord , open up to us ! ’ then He will answer and say to you , ‘ ( AC ) I do not know where you are from. ’
NASB1995	Luke	13	26	Then you will ( AD ) begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in Your presence , and You taught in our streets ’ ;
NASB1995	Luke	13	27	and He will say , ‘ I tell you , ( AE ) I do not know where you are from ; ( AF ) depart from Me , all you evildoers. ’
NASB1995	Luke	13	28	( AG ) In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but yourselves being thrown out .
NASB1995	Luke	13	29	And they ( AH ) will come from east and west and from north and south , and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God .
NASB1995	Luke	13	30	And behold , ( AI ) some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last. ”
NASB1995	Luke	13	31	Just at that time some Pharisees approached , saying to Him , “ Go away , leave here , for ( AJ ) Herod wants to kill You. ”
NASB1995	Luke	13	32	And He said to them , “ Go and tell that fox , ‘ Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third day I [ g ] ( AK ) reach My goal. ’
NASB1995	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless ( AL ) I must journey on today and tomorrow and the next day ; for it can not be that a ( AM ) prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem .

NASB1995	Luke	14	6	( E ) And they could make no reply to this . Parable of the Guests
NASB1995	Luke	14	7	And He began speaking a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how ( F ) they had been picking out the places of honor at the table , saying to them ,
NASB1995	Luke	14	8	“ When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast , ( G ) do not [ e ] take the place of honor , for someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him ,
NASB1995	Luke	14	9	and he who invited you both will come and say to you , ‘ Give your place to this man , ’ and then ( H ) in disgrace you [ f ] proceed to occupy the last place .
NASB1995	Luke	14	10	But when you are invited , go and recline at the last place , so that when the one who has invited you comes , he may say to you , ‘ Friend , ( I ) move up higher ’ ; then you will have honor in the sight of all who [ g ] are at the table with you .
NASB1995	Luke	14	11	( J ) For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and he who humbles himself will be exalted. ”
NASB1995	Luke	14	12	And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him , “ When you give a luncheon or a dinner , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors , otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment .
NASB1995	Luke	14	13	But when you give a [ h ] reception , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , the blind ,
NASB1995	Luke	14	15	When one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this , he said to Him , “ ( L ) Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God ! ” Parable of the Dinner
NASB1995	Luke	14	16	But He said to him , “ ( M ) A man was giving a big dinner , and he invited many ;
NASB1995	Luke	14	17	and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited , ‘ Come ; for everything is ready now. ’
NASB1995	Luke	14	18	But they all alike began to make excuses . The first one said to him , ‘ I have bought a [ j ] piece of land and I need to go out and look at it ; [ k ] please consider me excused. ’
NASB1995	Luke	14	19	Another one said , ‘ I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I am going to try them out ; [ l ] please consider me excused. ’
NASB1995	Luke	14	20	Another one said , ‘ ( N ) I have married a wife , and for that reason I can not come. ’
NASB1995	Luke	14	21	And the slave came back and reported this to his master . Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave , ‘ Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame. ’
NASB1995	Luke	14	22	And the slave said , ‘ Master , what you commanded has been done , and still there is room. ’
NASB1995	Luke	14	23	And the master said to the slave , ‘ Go out into the highways and along the hedges , and compel them to come in , so that my house may be filled .
NASB1995	Luke	14	24	For I tell you , none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner. ’ ” Discipleship Tested
NASB1995	Luke	14	25	Now [ m ] large crowds were going along with Him ; and He turned and said to them ,
NASB1995	Luke	14	26	“ ( O ) If anyone comes to Me , and does not [ n ] hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters , yes , and even his own life , he can not be My disciple .
NASB1995	Luke	14	27	Whoever does not ( P ) carry his own cross and come after Me can not be My disciple .
NASB1995	Luke	14	28	For which one of you , when he wants to build a tower , does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it ?
NASB1995	Luke	14	29	Otherwise , when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish , all who observe it begin to ridicule him ,
NASB1995	Luke	14	30	saying , ‘ This man began to build and was not able to finish. ’
NASB1995	Luke	14	31	Or what king , when he sets out to meet another king in battle , will not first sit down and ( Q ) consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one coming against him with twenty thousand ?
NASB1995	Luke	14	32	Or else , while the other is still far away , he sends [ o ] a delegation and asks for terms of peace .
NASB1995	Luke	14	33	So then , none of you can be My disciple who ( R ) does not give up all his own possessions .
NASB1995	Luke	14	34	“ Therefore , salt is good ; but ( S ) if even salt has become tasteless , with what will it be seasoned ?
NASB1995	Luke	14	35	It is useless either for the soil or for the manure pile ; it is thrown out .

NASB1995	Luke	15	2	Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble , saying , “ This man receives sinners and ( B ) eats with them. ”
NASB1995	Luke	15	3	So He told them this parable , saying ,
NASB1995	Luke	15	4	“ ( C ) What man among you , if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine in the [ b ] open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it ?
NASB1995	Luke	15	5	When he has found it , he lays it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
NASB1995	Luke	15	6	And when he comes home , he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying to them , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost ! ’
NASB1995	Luke	15	7	I tell you that in the same way , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance . The Lost Coin
NASB1995	Luke	15	8	“ Or what woman , if she has ten [ c ] silver coins and loses one coin , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it ?
NASB1995	Luke	15	9	When she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found the coin which I had lost ! ’
NASB1995	Luke	15	10	In the same way , I tell you , there is joy ( D ) in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents. ” The Prodigal Son
NASB1995	Luke	15	11	And He said , “ A man had two sons .
NASB1995	Luke	15	12	The younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me ( E ) the share of the estate that falls to me. ’ So he divided his [ d ] ( F ) wealth between them .
NASB1995	Luke	15	13	And not many days later , the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country , and there he squandered his estate with loose living .
NASB1995	Luke	15	14	Now when he had spent everything , a severe famine occurred in that country , and he began to be impoverished .
NASB1995	Luke	15	16	And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the [ f ] pods that the swine were eating , and no one was giving anything to him .
NASB1995	Luke	15	17	But when he came to [ g ] his senses , he said , ‘ How many of my father ’ s hired men have more than enough bread , but I am dying here with hunger !
NASB1995	Luke	15	18	I will get up and go to my father , and will say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven , and [ h ] in your sight ;
NASB1995	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ; make me as one of your hired men. ” ’
NASB1995	Luke	15	20	So he got up and came to [ i ] his father . But while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and felt compassion for him , and ran and [ j ] ( G ) embraced him and kissed him .
NASB1995	Luke	15	21	And the son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight ; I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ’
NASB1995	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his slaves , ‘ Quickly bring out ( H ) the best robe and put it on him , and ( I ) put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet ;
NASB1995	Luke	15	23	and bring the fattened calf , kill it , and let us eat and celebrate ;
NASB1995	Luke	15	24	for this son of mine was ( J ) dead and has come to life again ; he was lost and has been found. ’ And they began to celebrate .
NASB1995	Luke	15	25	“ Now his older son was in the field , and when he came and approached the house , he heard music and dancing .
NASB1995	Luke	15	26	And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things could be .
NASB1995	Luke	15	27	And he said to him , ‘ Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound. ’

NASB1995	Luke	16	20	And a poor man named Lazarus ( S ) was laid at his gate , covered with sores ,
NASB1995	Luke	16	21	and longing to be fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man ’ s table ; besides , even the dogs were coming and licking his sores .

NASB1995	Luke	17	11	While He was ( K ) on the way to Jerusalem , ( L ) He was passing [ k ] between Samaria and Galilee .
NASB1995	Luke	17	12	As He entered a village , ten leprous men who ( M ) stood at a distance met Him ;
NASB1995	Luke	17	13	and they raised their voices , saying , “ Jesus , ( N ) Master , have mercy on us ! ”
NASB1995	Luke	17	14	When He saw them , He said to them , “ ( O ) Go and show yourselves to the priests. ” And as they were going , they were cleansed .
NASB1995	Luke	17	15	Now one of them , when he saw that he had been healed , turned back , ( P ) glorifying God with a loud voice ,
NASB1995	Luke	17	16	and he fell on his face at His feet , giving thanks to Him . And he was a ( Q ) Samaritan .
NASB1995	Luke	17	18	[ l ] Was no one found who returned to ( R ) give glory to God , except this foreigner ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	17	19	And He said to him , “ Stand up and go ; ( S ) your faith [ m ] has made you well. ”
NASB1995	Luke	17	20	Now having been questioned by the Pharisees ( T ) as to when the kingdom of God was coming , He answered them and said , “ The kingdom of God is not coming with [ n ] ( U ) signs to be observed ;
NASB1995	Luke	17	21	nor will ( V ) they say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or , ‘ There it is ! ’ For behold , the kingdom of God is [ o ] in your midst. ” Second Coming Foretold

NASB1995	Luke	17	23	( X ) They will say to you , ‘ Look there ! Look here ! ’ Do not go away , and do not run after them .
NASB1995	Luke	17	24	( Y ) For just like the lightning , when it flashes out of one part [ p ] of the sky , shines to the other part [ q ] of the sky , so will the Son of Man be in His day .
NASB1995	Luke	17	25	( Z ) But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
NASB1995	Luke	17	26	( AA ) And just as it happened ( AB ) in the days of Noah , so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man :
NASB1995	Luke	17	27	they were eating , they were drinking , they were marrying , they were being given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
NASB1995	Luke	17	28	[ r ] It was the same as happened in ( AC ) the days of Lot : they were eating , they were drinking , they were buying , they were selling , they were planting , they were building ;
NASB1995	Luke	17	29	but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and [ s ] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all .
NASB1995	Luke	17	30	It will be [ t ] just the same on the day that the Son of Man ( AD ) is revealed .
NASB1995	Luke	17	31	On that day , the one who is ( AE ) on the housetop and whose goods are in the house must not go down to take them out ; and likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back .

NASB1995	Luke	18	9	And He also told this parable to some people who ( L ) trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and ( M ) viewed others with contempt :
NASB1995	Luke	18	10	“ Two men ( N ) went up into the temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
NASB1995	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee ( O ) stood and was praying this to himself : ‘ God , I thank You that I am not like other people : swindlers , unjust , adulterers , or even like this tax collector .
NASB1995	Luke	18	12	I ( P ) fast twice a week ; I ( Q ) pay tithes of all that I get. ’
NASB1995	Luke	18	13	But the tax collector , ( R ) standing some distance away , ( S ) was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven , but ( T ) was beating his breast , saying , ‘ God , be [ f ] merciful to me , the sinner ! ’
NASB1995	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went to his house justified rather than the other ; ( U ) for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be exalted. ”
NASB1995	Luke	18	15	( V ) And they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them , but when the disciples saw it , they began rebuking them .
NASB1995	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called for them , saying , “ Permit the children to come to Me , and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
NASB1995	Luke	18	17	Truly I say to you , ( W ) whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all. ” The Rich Young Ruler
NASB1995	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is good except God alone .
NASB1995	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments , ‘ ( Y ) Do not commit adultery , Do not murder , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honor your father and mother. ’ ”
NASB1995	Luke	18	21	And he said , “ All these things I have kept from my youth. ”
NASB1995	Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard this , He said to him , “ One thing you still lack ; ( Z ) sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor , and you shall have ( AA ) treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me. ”
NASB1995	Luke	18	23	But when he had heard these things , he became very sad , for he was extremely rich .
NASB1995	Luke	18	24	And Jesus looked at him and said , “ ( AB ) How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God !
NASB1995	Luke	18	25	For ( AC ) it is easier for a camel to [ g ] go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NASB1995	Luke	18	26	They who heard it said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	18	27	But He said , “ ( AD ) The things that are impossible with people are possible with God. ”
NASB1995	Luke	18	28	Peter said , “ Behold , ( AE ) we have left [ h ] our own homes and followed You. ”
NASB1995	Luke	18	29	And He said to them , “ Truly I say to you , ( AF ) there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
NASB1995	Luke	18	30	who will not receive many times as much at this time and in ( AG ) the age to come , eternal life. ”
NASB1995	Luke	18	31	( AH ) Then He took the twelve aside and said to them , “ Behold , ( AI ) we are going up to Jerusalem , and ( AJ ) all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished .

NASB1995	Luke	18	34	But ( AL ) the disciples understood none of these things , and the meaning of this statement was hidden from them , and they did not comprehend the things that were said . Bartimaeus Receives Sight
NASB1995	Luke	18	35	( AM ) As [ j ] ( AN ) Jesus was approaching Jericho , a blind man was sitting by the road begging .

NASB1995	Luke	19	3	Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was , and was unable because of the crowd , for he was small in stature .
NASB1995	Luke	19	4	So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a [ a ] ( B ) sycamore tree in order to see Him , for He was about to pass through that way .

NASB1995	Luke	19	11	While they were listening to these things , Jesus went on to tell a parable , because ( H ) He was near Jerusalem , and they supposed that ( I ) the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately .
NASB1995	Luke	19	12	So He said , “ ( J ) A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself , and then return .

NASB1995	Luke	19	14	But his citizens hated him and sent [ h ] a delegation after him , saying , ‘ We do not want this man to reign over us. ’
NASB1995	Luke	19	15	When he returned , after receiving the kingdom , he ordered that these slaves , to whom he had given the money , be called to him so that he might know what business they had done .
NASB1995	Luke	19	16	The first appeared , saying , ‘ [ i ] Master , your [ j ] mina has made ten minas more. ’
NASB1995	Luke	19	17	And he said to him , ‘ Well done , good slave , because you have been ( K ) faithful in a very little thing , you are to be in authority over ten cities. ’
NASB1995	Luke	19	18	The second came , saying , ‘ Your [ k ] mina , [ l ] master , has made five minas. ’
NASB1995	Luke	19	20	Another came , saying , ‘ Master , here is your mina , which I kept put away in a handkerchief ;
NASB1995	Luke	19	21	for I was afraid of you , because you are an exacting man ; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow. ’

NASB1995	Luke	19	23	Then why did you not put my money in the bank , and having come , I would have collected it with interest ? ’
NASB1995	Luke	19	24	Then he said to the bystanders , ‘ Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas. ’
NASB1995	Luke	19	25	And they said to him , ‘ Master , he has ten minas already. ’
NASB1995	Luke	19	26	( L ) I tell you that to everyone who has , more shall be given , but from the one who does not have , even what he does have shall be taken away .

NASB1995	Luke	19	33	As they were untying the colt , its [ o ] owners said to them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	19	34	They said , “ The Lord has need of it. ”
NASB1995	Luke	19	35	They brought it to Jesus , ( T ) and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it .
NASB1995	Luke	19	36	As He was going , they were spreading their coats on the road .
NASB1995	Luke	19	37	As soon as He was approaching , near the descent of ( U ) the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of the disciples began to ( V ) praise God [ p ] joyfully with a loud voice for all the [ q ] miracles which they had seen ,
NASB1995	Luke	19	38	shouting : “ ( W ) Blessed is the ( X ) King who comes in the name of the Lord ; Peace in heaven and ( Y ) glory in the highest ! ”
NASB1995	Luke	19	39	( Z ) Some of the Pharisees [ r ] in the crowd said to Him , “ Teacher , rebuke Your disciples. ”

NASB1995	Luke	19	41	When He approached Jerusalem , He saw the city and ( AB ) wept over it ,
NASB1995	Luke	19	42	saying , “ If you had known in this day , even you , the things which make for peace ! But now they have been hidden from your eyes .
NASB1995	Luke	19	43	For the days will come upon you [ s ] when your enemies will ( AC ) throw up a [ t ] barricade against you , and ( AD ) surround you and hem you in on every side ,

NASB1995	Luke	19	45	( AG ) Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling ,

NASB1995	Luke	20	4	Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	20	5	They reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘ Why did you not believe him ? ’

NASB1995	Luke	20	9	( F ) And He began to tell the people this parable : “ A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to [ c ] vine-growers , and went on a journey for a long time .
NASB1995	Luke	20	10	,
NASB1995	Luke	20	11	And he proceeded to send another slave ; and they beat him also and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty-handed .
NASB1995	Luke	20	12	And he proceeded to send a third ; and this one also they wounded and cast out .
NASB1995	Luke	20	13	The [ d ] owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son ; perhaps they will ( G ) respect him. ’
NASB1995	Luke	20	14	,

NASB1995	Luke	20	18	( L ) Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces ; but on whomever it falls , it will scatter him like dust. ” Tribute to Caesar
NASB1995	Luke	20	19	The scribes and the chief priests ( M ) tried to lay hands on Him that very hour , and they feared the people ; for they understood that He spoke this parable against them .
NASB1995	Luke	20	21	They questioned Him , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You speak and teach correctly , and You [ i ] are not partial to any , but teach the way of God in truth .
NASB1995	Luke	20	22	Is it [ j ] lawful for us ( Q ) to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	20	23	But He detected their trickery and said to them ,
NASB1995	Luke	20	24	“ Show Me a [ k ] denarius . Whose [ l ] likeness and inscription does it have ? ” They said , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NASB1995	Luke	20	25	And He said to them , “ Then ( R ) render to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and to God the things that are God ’ s. ”
NASB1995	Luke	20	26	And they were unable to [ m ] ( S ) catch Him in a saying in the presence of the people ; and being amazed at His answer , they became silent . Is There a Resurrection ?
NASB1995	Luke	20	27	( T ) Now there came to Him some of the ( U ) Sadducees ( who say that there is no resurrection ) ,
NASB1995	Luke	20	28	and they questioned Him , saying , “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that ( V ) if a man ’ s brother dies , having a wife , and he is childless , his brother should [ n ] marry the wife and raise up children to his brother .
NASB1995	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brothers ; and the first took a wife and died childless ;
NASB1995	Luke	20	30	and the second
NASB1995	Luke	20	31	and the third [ o ] married her ; and in the same way [ p ] all seven [ q ] died , leaving no children .
NASB1995	Luke	20	32	Finally the woman died also .
NASB1995	Luke	20	33	In the resurrection therefore , which one ’ s wife will she be ? For [ r ] all seven [ s ] had married her. ”
NASB1995	Luke	20	34	Jesus said to them , “ The sons of ( W ) this age marry and are given in marriage ,
NASB1995	Luke	20	35	but those who are considered worthy to attain to ( X ) that age and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry nor are given in marriage ;
NASB1995	Luke	20	36	for they can not even die anymore , because they are like angels , and are ( Y ) sons of God , being sons of the resurrection .
NASB1995	Luke	20	37	But that the dead are raised , even Moses showed , in ( Z ) the passage about the burning bush , where he calls the Lord ( AA ) the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
NASB1995	Luke	20	38	( AB ) Now He is not the God of the dead but of the living ; for ( AC ) all live to Him. ”
NASB1995	Luke	20	39	Some of the scribes answered and said , “ Teacher , You have spoken well. ”
NASB1995	Luke	20	40	For ( AD ) they did not have courage to question Him any longer about anything .
NASB1995	Luke	20	41	( AE ) Then He said to them , “ How is it that they say [ t ] the Christ is ( AF ) David ’ s son ?
NASB1995	Luke	20	42	For David himself says in the book of Psalms , ‘ ( AG ) The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand ,
NASB1995	Luke	20	43	( AH ) Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet. ” ’
NASB1995	Luke	20	44	Therefore David calls Him ‘ Lord , ’ and how is He his son ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	20	45	( AI ) And while all the people were listening , He said to the disciples ,
NASB1995	Luke	20	46	“ Beware of the scribes , ( AJ ) who like to walk around in long robes , and love respectful greetings in the market places , and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets ,

NASB1995	Luke	21	2	And He saw a poor widow putting [ a ] in ( B ) two [ b ] small copper coins .
NASB1995	Luke	21	3	And He said , “ Truly I say to you , this poor widow put in more than all of them ;
NASB1995	Luke	21	4	for they all out of their [ c ] surplus put into the [ d ] offering ; but she out of her poverty put in all [ e ] that she had ( C ) to live on. ”
NASB1995	Luke	21	5	( D ) And while some were talking about the temple , that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive gifts , He said ,
NASB1995	Luke	21	6	“ As for these things which you are looking at , the days will come in which ( E ) there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down. ”
NASB1995	Luke	21	7	They questioned Him , saying , “ Teacher , when therefore will these things happen ? And what will be the [ f ] sign when these things are about to take place ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	21	8	And He said , “ See to it that you are not misled ; for many will come in My name , saying , ‘ ( F ) I am He , ’ and , ‘ The time is near. ’ ( G ) Do not go after them .
NASB1995	Luke	21	9	When you hear of wars and disturbances , do not be terrified ; for these things must take place first , but the end does not follow immediately. ” Things to Come
NASB1995	Luke	21	10	Then He continued by saying to them , “ Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom ,
NASB1995	Luke	21	11	and there will be great earthquakes , and in various places plagues and famines ; and there will be terrors and great [ g ] signs from heaven .
NASB1995	Luke	21	12	“ But before all these things , ( H ) they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you , delivering you to the synagogues and prisons , [ h ] bringing you before kings and governors for My name ’ s sake .

NASB1995	Luke	21	14	( J ) So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves ;
NASB1995	Luke	21	15	for ( K ) I will give you [ j ] utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute .
NASB1995	Luke	21	16	But you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends , and they will put some of you to death ,
NASB1995	Luke	21	17	and you will be hated by all because of My name .
NASB1995	Luke	21	18	Yet ( L ) not a hair of your head will perish .
NASB1995	Luke	21	19	( M ) By your endurance you will gain your [ k ] lives .
NASB1995	Luke	21	20	“ But when you see Jerusalem ( N ) surrounded by armies , then [ l ] recognize that her desolation is near .
NASB1995	Luke	21	22	because these are ( P ) days of vengeance , so that all things which are written will be fulfilled .
NASB1995	Luke	21	23	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days ; for ( Q ) there will be great distress upon the [ o ] land and wrath to this people ;
NASB1995	Luke	21	24	and they will fall by ( R ) the edge of the sword , and will be led captive into all the nations ; and ( S ) Jerusalem will be ( T ) trampled under foot by the Gentiles until ( U ) the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled . The Return of Christ
NASB1995	Luke	21	25	“ There will be [ p ] signs in sun and moon and stars , and on the earth dismay among nations , in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves ,
NASB1995	Luke	21	26	men fainting from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the [ q ] world ; for the powers of [ r ] the heavens will be shaken .
NASB1995	Luke	21	27	( V ) Then they will see ( W ) the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
NASB1995	Luke	21	28	But when these things begin to take place , straighten up and lift up your heads , because ( X ) your redemption is drawing near. ”
NASB1995	Luke	21	29	Then He told them a parable : “ Behold the fig tree and all the trees ;
NASB1995	Luke	21	30	as soon as they put forth leaves , you see it and ( Y ) know for yourselves that summer is now near .
NASB1995	Luke	21	31	So you also , when you see these things happening , [ s ] recognize that ( Z ) the kingdom of God is near .

NASB1995	Luke	22	4	And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and ( F ) officers how he might betray Him to them .
NASB1995	Luke	22	5	They were glad and agreed to give him money .
NASB1995	Luke	22	6	So he consented , and began seeking a good opportunity to betray Him to them [ b ] apart from the crowd .
NASB1995	Luke	22	7	( G ) Then came the first day of Unleavened Bread on which ( H ) the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed .
NASB1995	Luke	22	8	And Jesus sent ( I ) Peter and John , saying , “ Go and prepare the Passover for us , so that we may eat it. ”
NASB1995	Luke	22	9	They said to Him , “ Where do You want us to prepare it ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	22	10	And He said to them , “ When you have entered the city , a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house that he enters .

NASB1995	Luke	22	13	And they left and found everything just as He had told them ; and they prepared the Passover . The Lord ’ s Supper
NASB1995	Luke	22	14	( J ) When the hour had come , He reclined at the table , and ( K ) the apostles with Him .
NASB1995	Luke	22	15	And He said to them , “ I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer ;
NASB1995	Luke	22	16	for I say to you , I shall never again eat it ( L ) until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. ”
NASB1995	Luke	22	17	( M ) And when He had taken a cup and ( N ) given thanks , He said , “ Take this and share it among yourselves ;
NASB1995	Luke	22	18	for ( O ) I say to you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes. ”
NASB1995	Luke	22	19	And when He had taken some bread and ( P ) given thanks , He broke it and gave it to them , saying , “ This is My body which is given for you ; do this in remembrance of Me. ”
NASB1995	Luke	22	20	And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten , saying , “ This cup which is ( Q ) poured out for you is the ( R ) new covenant in My blood .
NASB1995	Luke	22	21	( S ) But behold , the hand of the one betraying Me is with [ c ] Mine on the table .

NASB1995	Luke	22	24	And there arose also ( U ) a dispute among them as to which one of them was regarded to be greatest .
NASB1995	Luke	22	25	( V ) And He said to them , “ The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them ; and those who have authority over them are called ‘ Benefactors. ’
NASB1995	Luke	22	26	But it is not this way with you , ( W ) but the one who is the greatest among you must become like ( X ) the youngest , and the leader like the servant .
NASB1995	Luke	22	27	For ( Y ) who is greater , the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves ? Is it not the one who reclines at the table ? But ( Z ) I am among you as the one who serves .
NASB1995	Luke	22	28	“ You are those who have stood by Me in My ( AA ) trials ;
NASB1995	Luke	22	29	and just as My Father has granted Me a ( AB ) kingdom , I grant you
NASB1995	Luke	22	30	that you may ( AC ) eat and drink at My table in My ( AD ) kingdom , and ( AE ) you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
NASB1995	Luke	22	31	“ Simon , Simon , behold , ( AF ) Satan has [ d ] demanded permission to ( AG ) sift you like wheat ;

NASB1995	Luke	22	34	And He said , “ I say to you , Peter , the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me. ”

NASB1995	Luke	22	36	And He said to them , “ But now , [ e ] whoever has a money belt is to take it along , likewise also a bag , and [ f ] whoever has no sword is to sell his [ g ] coat and buy one .

NASB1995	Luke	22	47	( AZ ) While He was still speaking , behold , a crowd came , and the one called Judas , one of the twelve , was preceding them ; and he approached Jesus to kiss Him .

NASB1995	Luke	24	8	And ( H ) they remembered His words ,

NASB1995	Luke	24	11	But these words appeared [ b ] to them as nonsense , and they ( K ) would not believe them .

NASB1995	Luke	24	13	And behold , ( N ) two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus , which was [ d ] about seven miles from Jerusalem .

NASB1995	Luke	24	21	But we were hoping that it was He who was going to ( S ) redeem Israel . Indeed , besides all this , it is the third day since these things happened .
NASB1995	Luke	24	22	But also some women among us amazed us . ( T ) When they were at the tomb early in the morning ,
NASB1995	Luke	24	23	and did not find His body , they came , saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive .
NASB1995	Luke	24	25	And He said to them , “ O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that ( U ) the prophets have spoken !
NASB1995	Luke	24	26	( V ) Was it not necessary for the [ f ] Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	24	27	Then beginning [ g ] with ( W ) Moses and [ h ] with all the ( X ) prophets , He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures .
NASB1995	Luke	24	28	And they approached the village where they were going , and ( Y ) He acted as though He were going farther .
NASB1995	Luke	24	29	But they urged Him , saying , “ Stay with us , for it is getting toward evening , and the day [ i ] is now nearly over. ” So He went in to stay with them .
NASB1995	Luke	24	30	When He had reclined at the table with them , He took the bread and ( Z ) blessed it , and breaking it , He began giving it to them .
NASB1995	Luke	24	31	Then their ( AA ) eyes were opened and they recognized Him ; and He vanished from [ j ] their sight .
NASB1995	Luke	24	32	They said to one another , “ [ k ] Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road , while He ( AB ) was [ l ] explaining the Scriptures to us ? ”

NASB1995	Luke	24	36	While they were telling these things , ( AH ) He Himself stood in their midst and * said to them , “ Peace be to you. ”
NASB1995	Luke	24	37	But they were startled and frightened and thought that they were seeing ( AI ) a spirit .
NASB1995	Luke	24	38	And He said to them , “ Why are you troubled , and why do doubts arise in your [ n ] hearts ?
NASB1995	Luke	24	39	( AJ ) See My hands and My feet , that it is I Myself ; ( AK ) touch Me and see , for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have. ”

NASB1995	Luke	24	41	While they still [ o ] ( AL ) could not believe it because of their joy and amazement , He said to them , “ ( AM ) Have you anything here to eat ? ”
NASB1995	Luke	24	42	They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish ;
NASB1995	Luke	24	43	and He took it and ( AN ) ate it before them .
NASB1995	Luke	24	44	Now He said to them , “ ( AO ) These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you , that all things which are written about Me in the ( AP ) Law of Moses and the Prophets and ( AQ ) the Psalms must be fulfilled. ”
NASB1995	Luke	24	45	Then He ( AR ) opened their [ p ] minds to understand the Scriptures ,
NASB1995	Luke	24	46	and He said to them , “ ( AS ) Thus it is written , that the [ q ] Christ would suffer and ( AT ) rise again from the dead the third day ,
NASB1995	Luke	24	47	and that ( AU ) repentance [ r ] for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed [ s ] in His name to ( AV ) all the nations , beginning from Jerusalem .

NASB1995	John	1	38	And Jesus turned and saw them following , and * said to them , “ What do you seek ? ” They said to Him , “ ( BE ) Rabbi ( which translated means Teacher ) , where are You staying ? ”
NASB1995	John	1	39	He * said to them , “ Come , and you will see. ” So they came and saw where He was staying ; and they stayed with Him that day , for it was about the [ aa ] tenth hour .
NASB1995	John	1	40	( BF ) One of the two who heard John speak and followed Him , was Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother .
NASB1995	John	1	41	He * found first his own brother Simon and * said to him , “ We have found the ( BG ) Messiah ” ( which translated means [ ab ] Christ ) .
NASB1995	John	1	42	He brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon the son of [ ac ] ( BH ) John ; you shall be called ( BI ) Cephas ” ( which is translated [ ad ] ( BJ ) Peter ) .
NASB1995	John	1	43	( BK ) The next day He purposed to go into ( BL ) Galilee , and He * found ( BM ) Philip . And Jesus * said to him , “ ( BN ) Follow Me. ”
NASB1995	John	1	44	Now ( BO ) Philip was from ( BP ) Bethsaida , of the city of Andrew and Peter .
NASB1995	John	1	45	( BQ ) Philip * found ( BR ) Nathanael and * said to him , “ We have found Him of whom ( BS ) Moses in the Law and also ( BT ) the Prophets wrote—Jesus of ( BU ) Nazareth , ( BV ) the son of Joseph. ”
NASB1995	John	1	46	Nathanael said to him , “ ( BW ) Can any good thing come out of Nazareth ? ” ( BX ) Philip * said to him , “ Come and see. ”

NASB1995	John	2	5	His ( H ) mother * said to the servants , “ Whatever He says to you , do it. ”
NASB1995	John	2	6	Now there were six stone waterpots set there ( I ) for the Jewish custom of purification , containing [ b ] twenty or thirty gallons each .
NASB1995	John	2	7	Jesus * said to them , “ Fill the waterpots with water. ” So they filled them up to the brim .

NASB1995	John	2	10	and * said to him , “ Every man serves the good wine first , and when the people ( K ) have [ d ] drunk freely , then he serves the poorer wine ; but you have kept the good wine until now. ”
NASB1995	John	2	11	This beginning of His [ e ] ( L ) signs Jesus did in Cana of ( M ) Galilee , and manifested His ( N ) glory , and His disciples believed in Him .

NASB1995	John	2	13	( S ) The Passover of the Jews was near , and Jesus ( T ) went up to Jerusalem .
NASB1995	John	2	14	( U ) And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves , and the money changers seated at their tables .
NASB1995	John	2	15	And He made a scourge of cords , and drove them all out of the temple , with the sheep and the oxen ; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables ;
NASB1995	John	2	16	and to those who were selling ( V ) the doves He said , “ Take these things away ; stop making ( W ) My Father ’ s house a [ f ] place of business. ”
NASB1995	John	2	17	His ( X ) disciples remembered that it was written , “ ( Y ) Zeal for Your house will consume me. ”
NASB1995	John	2	18	( Z ) The Jews then said to Him , “ ( AA ) What sign do You show us [ g ] as your authority for doing these things ? ”
NASB1995	John	2	19	Jesus answered them , “ ( AB ) Destroy this [ h ] temple , and in three days I will raise it up. ”
NASB1995	John	2	20	( AC ) The Jews then said , “ It took ( AD ) forty-six years to build this [ i ] temple , and will You raise it up in three days ? ”
NASB1995	John	2	21	But He was speaking of ( AE ) the [ j ] temple of His body .
NASB1995	John	2	22	So when He was raised from the dead , His ( AF ) disciples ( AG ) remembered that He said this ; and they believed ( AH ) the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken .
NASB1995	John	2	23	Now when He was in Jerusalem at ( AI ) the Passover , during the feast , many believed in His name , ( AJ ) observing His signs which He was doing .
NASB1995	John	2	24	But Jesus , on His part , was not entrusting Himself to them , for ( AK ) He knew all men ,

NASB1995	John	3	4	Nicodemus * said to Him , “ How can a man be born when he is old ? He can not enter a second time into his mother ’ s womb and be born , can he ? ”
NASB1995	John	3	5	Jesus answered , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is born of ( H ) water and the Spirit he can not enter into ( I ) the kingdom of God .

NASB1995	John	3	12	If I told you earthly things and you do not believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
NASB1995	John	3	13	( P ) No one has ascended into heaven , but ( Q ) He who descended from heaven : ( R ) the Son of Man .
NASB1995	John	3	14	As ( S ) Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must ( T ) the Son of Man ( U ) be lifted up ;
NASB1995	John	3	15	so that whoever [ d ] believes will ( V ) in Him have eternal life .
NASB1995	John	3	16	“ For God so ( W ) loved the world , that He ( X ) gave His [ e ] ( Y ) only begotten Son , that whoever ( Z ) believes in Him shall not perish , but have eternal life .
NASB1995	John	3	17	For God ( AA ) did not send the Son into the world ( AB ) to judge the world , but that the world might be saved through Him .
NASB1995	John	3	18	( AC ) He who believes in Him is not judged ; he who does not believe has been judged already , because he has not believed in the name of ( AD ) the [ f ] only begotten Son of God .
NASB1995	John	3	19	This is the judgment , that ( AE ) the Light has come into the world , and men loved the darkness rather than the Light , for ( AF ) their deeds were evil .
NASB1995	John	3	20	( AG ) For everyone who does evil hates the Light , and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed .
NASB1995	John	3	21	But he who ( AH ) practices the truth comes to the Light , so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God. ” John ’ s Last Testimony
NASB1995	John	3	22	After these things Jesus and His ( AI ) disciples came into the land of Judea , and there He was spending time with them and ( AJ ) baptizing .
NASB1995	John	3	23	John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim , because there was much water there ; and people were coming and were being baptized—
NASB1995	John	3	24	for ( AK ) John had not yet been thrown into prison .
NASB1995	John	3	25	Therefore there arose a discussion on the part of John ’ s disciples with a Jew about ( AL ) purification .
NASB1995	John	3	26	And they came to John and said to him , “ ( AM ) Rabbi , He who was with you ( AN ) beyond the Jordan , to whom you ( AO ) have testified , behold , He is baptizing and all are coming to Him. ”
NASB1995	John	3	27	John answered and said , “ ( AP ) A man can receive nothing unless it ( AQ ) has been given him from heaven .
NASB1995	John	3	28	You yourselves [ g ] are my witnesses that I said , ‘ ( AR ) I am not the [ h ] Christ , ’ but , ‘ I have been sent ahead of Him. ’
NASB1995	John	3	29	He who has the bride is ( AS ) the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom ’ s voice . So this ( AT ) joy of mine has been made full .

NASB1995	John	4	9	Therefore the ( M ) Samaritan woman * said to Him , “ How is it that You , being a Jew , ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman ? ” ( For ( N ) Jews have no dealings with Samaritans . )
NASB1995	John	4	10	Jesus answered and said to her , “ If you knew the gift of God , and who it is who says to you , ‘ Give Me a drink , ’ you would have asked Him , and He would have given you ( O ) living water. ”
NASB1995	John	4	11	She * said to Him , “ [ b ] Sir , You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep ; where then do You get that ( P ) living water ?
NASB1995	John	4	12	You are not greater than our father Jacob , are You , who ( Q ) gave us the well , and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle ? ”
NASB1995	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said to her , “ Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again ;
NASB1995	John	4	14	but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him ( R ) shall never thirst ; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to ( S ) eternal life. ”
NASB1995	John	4	15	The woman * said to Him , “ [ c ] Sir , ( T ) give me this water , so I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw. ”
NASB1995	John	4	16	He * said to her , “ Go , call your husband and come here. ”
NASB1995	John	4	17	The woman answered and said , “ I have no husband. ” Jesus * said to her , “ You have correctly said , ‘ I have no husband ’ ;
NASB1995	John	4	18	for you have had five husbands , and the one whom you now have is not your husband ; this you have said truly. ”
NASB1995	John	4	19	The woman * said to Him , “ [ d ] Sir , I perceive that You are ( U ) a prophet .
NASB1995	John	4	20	( V ) Our fathers worshiped in ( W ) this mountain , and you people say that ( X ) in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. ”
NASB1995	John	4	21	Jesus * said to her , “ Woman , believe Me , ( Y ) an hour is coming when ( Z ) neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father .
NASB1995	John	4	22	( AA ) You worship what you do not know ; we worship what we know , for ( AB ) salvation is from the Jews .
NASB1995	John	4	23	But ( AC ) an hour is coming , and now is , when the true worshipers will worship the Father ( AD ) in spirit and truth ; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers .
NASB1995	John	4	24	God is [ e ] spirit , and those who worship Him must worship ( AE ) in spirit and truth. ”
NASB1995	John	4	25	The woman * said to Him , “ I know that ( AF ) Messiah is coming ( ( AG ) He who is called Christ ) ; when that One comes , He will declare all things to us. ”
NASB1995	John	4	26	Jesus * said to her , “ ( AH ) I who speak to you am He. ”
NASB1995	John	4	27	At this point His ( AI ) disciples came , and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman , yet no one said , “ What do You seek ? ” or , “ Why do You speak with her ? ”
NASB1995	John	4	28	So the woman left her waterpot , and went into the city and * said to the men ,
NASB1995	John	4	29	“ Come , see a man ( AJ ) who told me all the things that I have done ; ( AK ) this is not [ f ] the Christ , is it ? ”
NASB1995	John	4	30	They went out of the city , and were coming to Him .
NASB1995	John	4	31	Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him , saying , “ ( AL ) Rabbi , eat. ”
NASB1995	John	4	32	But He said to them , “ I have food to eat that you do not know about. ”
NASB1995	John	4	33	So the ( AM ) disciples were saying to one another , “ No one brought Him anything to eat , did he ? ”
NASB1995	John	4	34	Jesus * said to them , “ My food is to ( AN ) do the will of Him who sent Me and to ( AO ) accomplish His work .
NASB1995	John	4	35	Do you not say , ‘ There are yet four months , and then comes the harvest ’ ? Behold , I say to you , lift up your eyes and look on the fields , that they are white ( AP ) for harvest .
NASB1995	John	4	36	Already he who reaps is receiving ( AQ ) wages and is gathering ( AR ) fruit for ( AS ) life eternal ; so that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together .
NASB1995	John	4	37	For in this case the saying is true , ‘ ( AT ) One sows and another reaps. ’
NASB1995	John	4	38	I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored ; others have labored and you have entered into their labor. ” The Samaritans
NASB1995	John	4	39	From ( AU ) that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified , “ ( AV ) He told me all the things that I have done. ”
NASB1995	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to Jesus , they were asking Him to stay with them ; and He stayed there two days .
NASB1995	John	4	41	Many more believed because of His word ;
NASB1995	John	4	42	and they were saying to the woman , “ It is no longer because of what you said that we believe , for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed ( AW ) the Savior of the world. ”
NASB1995	John	4	43	After ( AX ) the two days He went forth from there into Galilee .
NASB1995	John	4	44	For Jesus Himself testified that ( AY ) a prophet has no honor in his own country .
NASB1995	John	4	45	So when He came to Galilee , the Galileans received Him , ( AZ ) having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast ; for they themselves also went to the feast . Healing a Nobleman ’ s Son
NASB1995	John	4	46	Therefore He came again to ( BA ) Cana of Galilee ( BB ) where He had made the water wine . And there was a royal official whose son was sick at ( BC ) Capernaum .
NASB1995	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus had come ( BD ) out of Judea into Galilee , he went to Him and was imploring Him to come down and heal his son ; for he was at the point of death .
NASB1995	John	4	48	So Jesus said to him , “ Unless you people see [ g ] ( BE ) signs and ( BF ) wonders , you simply will not believe. ”
NASB1995	John	4	49	The royal official * said to Him , “ [ h ] Sir , come down before my child dies. ”
NASB1995	John	4	50	Jesus * said to him , “ ( BG ) Go ; your son lives. ” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started off .
NASB1995	John	4	51	As he was now going down , his slaves met him , saying that his [ i ] son was living .
NASB1995	John	4	52	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better . Then they said to him , “ Yesterday at the [ j ] seventh hour the fever left him. ”
NASB1995	John	4	53	So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him , “ Your son lives ” ; and he himself believed and ( BH ) his whole household .

NASB1995	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying there , and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition , He * said to him , “ Do you wish to get well ? ”
NASB1995	John	5	7	The sick man answered Him , “ Sir , I have no man to put me into the pool when ( D ) the water is stirred up , but while I am coming , another steps down before me. ”
NASB1995	John	5	8	Jesus * said to him , “ ( E ) Get up , pick up your pallet and walk. ”
NASB1995	John	5	9	Immediately the man became well , and picked up his pallet and began to walk . ( F ) Now it was the Sabbath on that day .
NASB1995	John	5	10	So ( G ) the Jews were saying to the man who was cured , “ It is the Sabbath , and ( H ) it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet. ”
NASB1995	John	5	11	But he answered them , “ He who made me well was the one who said to me , ‘ Pick up your pallet and walk. ’ ”
NASB1995	John	5	12	They asked him , “ Who is the man who said to you , ‘ Pick up your pallet and walk ’ ? ”
NASB1995	John	5	13	But the man who was healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place .
NASB1995	John	5	14	Afterward Jesus * found him in the temple and said to him , “ Behold , you have become well ; do not ( I ) sin anymore , ( J ) so that nothing worse happens to you. ”
NASB1995	John	5	15	The man went away , and told ( K ) the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
NASB1995	John	5	16	For this reason ( L ) the Jews were persecuting Jesus , because He was doing these things on the Sabbath .
NASB1995	John	5	17	But He answered them , “ My Father is working until now , and I Myself am working. ” Jesus ’ Equality with God
NASB1995	John	5	18	For this reason therefore ( M ) the Jews ( N ) were seeking all the more to kill Him , because He not only was breaking the Sabbath , but also was calling God His own Father , ( O ) making Himself equal with God .
NASB1995	John	5	19	Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , ( P ) the Son can do nothing of Himself , unless it is something He sees the Father doing ; for whatever [ e ] the Father does , these things the Son also does in like manner .
NASB1995	John	5	20	( Q ) For the Father loves the Son , and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing ; and the Father will show Him ( R ) greater works than these , so that you will marvel .
NASB1995	John	5	21	For just as the Father raises the dead and ( S ) gives them life , even so ( T ) the Son also gives life to whom He wishes .
NASB1995	John	5	22	For not even the Father judges anyone , but ( U ) He has given all judgment to the Son ,
NASB1995	John	5	23	so that all will honor the Son even as they honor the Father . ( V ) He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him .
NASB1995	John	5	24	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , he who hears My word , and ( W ) believes Him who sent Me , has eternal life , and ( X ) does not come into judgment , but has ( Y ) passed out of death into life . Two Resurrections
NASB1995	John	5	25	Truly , truly , I say to you , ( Z ) an hour is coming and now is , when ( AA ) the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who ( AB ) hear will live .
NASB1995	John	5	26	For just as the Father has life in Himself , even so He ( AC ) gave to the Son also to have life in Himself ;
NASB1995	John	5	27	and He gave Him authority to ( AD ) execute judgment , because He is [ f ] the Son of Man .
NASB1995	John	5	28	Do not marvel at this ; for ( AE ) an hour is coming , in which ( AF ) all who are in the tombs will hear His voice ,
NASB1995	John	5	29	and will come forth ; ( AG ) those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life , those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment .
NASB1995	John	5	30	“ ( AH ) I can do nothing on My own initiative . As I hear , I judge ; and ( AI ) My judgment is just , because I do not seek My own will , but ( AJ ) the will of Him who sent Me .
NASB1995	John	5	31	“ ( AK ) If I alone testify about Myself , My testimony is not [ g ] true .
NASB1995	John	5	32	There is ( AL ) another who testifies of Me , and I know that the testimony which He gives about Me is true . Witness of John
NASB1995	John	5	33	You have sent to John , and he ( AM ) has testified to the truth .
NASB1995	John	5	34	But ( AN ) the testimony which I receive is not from man , but I say these things so that you may be saved .
NASB1995	John	5	35	He was ( AO ) the lamp that was burning and was shining and you ( AP ) were willing to rejoice for [ h ] a while in his light . Witness of Works
NASB1995	John	5	36	But the testimony which I have is greater than the testimony of John ; for ( AQ ) the works which the Father has given Me ( AR ) to accomplish—the very works that I do—testify about Me , that the Father ( AS ) has sent Me . Witness of the Father
NASB1995	John	5	37	And the Father who sent Me , ( AT ) He has testified of Me . You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form .
NASB1995	John	5	38	You do not have ( AU ) His word abiding in you , for you do not believe Him whom He ( AV ) sent . Witness of the Scripture
NASB1995	John	5	39	[ i ] ( AW ) You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life ; it is ( AX ) these that testify about Me ;
NASB1995	John	5	40	and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life .
NASB1995	John	5	41	( AY ) I do not receive glory from men ;
NASB1995	John	5	42	but I know you , that you do not have the love of God in yourselves .
NASB1995	John	5	43	I have come in My Father ’ s name , and you do not receive Me ; ( AZ ) if another comes in his own name , you will receive him .
NASB1995	John	5	44	How can you believe , when you ( BA ) receive [ j ] glory from one another and you do not seek ( BB ) the [ k ] glory that is from ( BC ) the one and only God ?
NASB1995	John	5	45	Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father ; the one who accuses you is ( BD ) Moses , in whom you have set your hope .
NASB1995	John	5	46	For if you believed Moses , you would believe Me , for ( BE ) he wrote about Me .
NASB1995	John	5	47	But ( BF ) if you do not believe his writings , how will you believe My words ? ” Footnotes - John 5:2 I.e . Jewish Aramaic - John 5:2 Some early mss read Bethsaida or Bethzatha - John 5:3 Early mss do not contain the remainder of v

NASB1995	John	6	2	A large crowd followed Him , because they saw the [ a ] ( D ) signs which He was performing on those who were sick .
NASB1995	John	6	3	Then ( E ) Jesus went up on the mountain , and there He sat down with His disciples .
NASB1995	John	6	4	Now ( F ) the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was near .
NASB1995	John	6	5	Therefore Jesus , lifting up His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him , * said to ( G ) Philip , “ Where are we to buy bread , so that these may eat ? ”
NASB1995	John	6	7	( I ) Philip answered Him , “ ( J ) Two hundred [ b ] denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them , for everyone to receive a little. ”
NASB1995	John	6	8	One of His ( K ) disciples , ( L ) Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , * said to Him ,
NASB1995	John	6	9	“ There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two ( M ) fish , but what are these for so many people ? ”
NASB1995	John	6	10	Jesus said , “ Have the people [ c ] sit down. ” Now there was ( N ) much grass in the place . So the men [ d ] sat down , in number about ( O ) five thousand .
NASB1995	John	6	11	Jesus then took the loaves , and ( P ) having given thanks , He distributed to those who were seated ; likewise also of the ( Q ) fish as much as they wanted .
NASB1995	John	6	12	When they were filled , He * said to His ( R ) disciples , “ Gather up the leftover fragments so that nothing will be lost. ”
NASB1995	John	6	13	So they gathered them up , and filled twelve ( S ) baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten .
NASB1995	John	6	14	Therefore when the people saw the [ e ] sign which He had performed , they said , “ This is truly the ( T ) Prophet who is to come into the world. ” Jesus Walks on the Water
NASB1995	John	6	15	So Jesus , perceiving that they were [ f ] intending to come and take Him by force ( U ) to make Him king , ( V ) withdrew again to ( W ) the mountain by Himself alone .
NASB1995	John	6	16	Now when evening came , His ( X ) disciples went down to the sea ,
NASB1995	John	6	17	and after getting into a boat , they started to cross the sea ( Y ) to Capernaum . It had already become dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them .
NASB1995	John	6	18	The sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing .
NASB1995	John	6	19	Then , when they had rowed about [ g ] three or four miles , they * saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat ; and they were frightened .
NASB1995	John	6	20	But He * said to them , “ It is I ; [ h ] ( Z ) do not be afraid. ”
NASB1995	John	6	21	So they were willing to receive Him into the boat , and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going .
NASB1995	John	6	22	The next day ( AA ) the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there , except one , and that Jesus ( AB ) had not entered with His disciples into the boat , but that His disciples had gone away alone .
NASB1995	John	6	23	There came other small boats from ( AC ) Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the ( AD ) Lord ( AE ) had given thanks .
NASB1995	John	6	24	So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there , nor His disciples , they themselves got into the small boats , and ( AF ) came to Capernaum seeking Jesus .
NASB1995	John	6	25	or
NASB1995	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , you ( AH ) seek Me , not because you saw ( AI ) signs , but because you ate of the loaves and were filled .
NASB1995	John	6	27	Do not ( AJ ) work for the food which perishes , but for the food which endures to ( AK ) eternal life , which ( AL ) the Son of Man will give to you , for on Him the Father , God , ( AM ) has set His seal. ”
NASB1995	John	6	28	Therefore they said to Him , “ What shall we do , so that we may work the works of God ? ”
NASB1995	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said to them , “ This is ( AN ) the work of God , that you believe in Him whom He ( AO ) has sent. ”

NASB1995	John	6	31	( AR ) Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written , ‘ ( AS ) He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. ’ ”
NASB1995	John	6	32	Jesus then said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven , but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven .
NASB1995	John	6	33	For the bread of God is [ i ] that which ( AT ) comes down out of heaven , and gives life to the world. ”
NASB1995	John	6	34	Then they said to Him , “ Lord , always ( AU ) give us this bread. ”
NASB1995	John	6	35	Jesus said to them , “ ( AV ) I am the bread of life ; he who comes to Me will not hunger , and he who believes in Me ( AW ) will never thirst .
NASB1995	John	6	36	But ( AX ) I said to you that you have seen Me , and yet do not believe .
NASB1995	John	6	37	( AY ) All that the Father gives Me will come to Me , and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out .

NASB1995	John	6	39	This is the will of Him who sent Me , that of ( BD ) all that He has given Me I ( BE ) lose nothing , but ( BF ) raise it up on the last day .
NASB1995	John	6	40	For this is the will of My Father , that everyone who ( BG ) beholds the Son and ( BH ) believes in Him will have eternal life , and I Myself will ( BI ) raise him up on the last day. ” Words to the Jews
NASB1995	John	6	41	( BJ ) Therefore the Jews were grumbling about Him , because He said , “ I am the bread that ( BK ) came down out of heaven. ”
NASB1995	John	6	42	They were saying , “ ( BL ) Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother ( BM ) we know ? How does He now say , ‘ ( BN ) I have come down out of heaven ’ ? ”
NASB1995	John	6	43	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Do not grumble among yourselves .
NASB1995	John	6	44	No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me ( BO ) draws him ; and I will ( BP ) raise him up on the last day .
NASB1995	John	6	45	It is written ( BQ ) in the prophets , ‘ ( BR ) And they shall all be ( BS ) taught of God. ’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father , comes to Me .
NASB1995	John	6	46	( BT ) Not that anyone has seen the Father , except the One who is from God ; He has seen the Father .
NASB1995	John	6	47	Truly , truly , I say to you , he who believes ( BU ) has eternal life .
NASB1995	John	6	48	( BV ) I am the bread of life .
NASB1995	John	6	49	( BW ) Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
NASB1995	John	6	50	This is the bread which ( BX ) comes down out of heaven , so that one may eat of it and ( BY ) not die .
NASB1995	John	6	51	( BZ ) I am the living bread that ( CA ) came down out of heaven ; if anyone eats of this bread , ( CB ) he will live forever ; and the bread also which I will give ( CC ) for the life of the world is ( CD ) My flesh. ”
NASB1995	John	6	52	( CE ) Then the Jews ( CF ) began to argue with one another , saying , “ How can this man give us His flesh to eat ? ”
NASB1995	John	6	53	So Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of ( CG ) the Son of Man and drink His blood , you have no life in yourselves .
NASB1995	John	6	54	He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life , and I will ( CH ) raise him up on the last day .
NASB1995	John	6	55	For My flesh is true food , and My blood is true drink .
NASB1995	John	6	56	He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood ( CI ) abides in Me , and I in him .
NASB1995	John	6	57	As the ( CJ ) living Father ( CK ) sent Me , and I live because of the Father , so he who eats Me , he also will live because of Me .
NASB1995	John	6	58	This is the bread which ( CL ) came down out of heaven ; not as ( CM ) the fathers ate and died ; he who eats this bread ( CN ) will live forever. ” Words to the Disciples
NASB1995	John	6	59	These things He said ( CO ) in the synagogue as He taught ( CP ) in Capernaum .
NASB1995	John	6	60	Therefore many of His ( CQ ) disciples , when they heard this said , “ ( CR ) This is a difficult statement ; who can listen to it ? ”
NASB1995	John	6	61	But Jesus , ( CS ) conscious that His disciples grumbled at this , said to them , “ Does this ( CT ) cause you to stumble ?
NASB1995	John	6	62	What then if you see ( CU ) the Son of Man ( CV ) ascending to where He was before ?
NASB1995	John	6	63	( CW ) It is the Spirit who gives life ; the flesh profits nothing ; ( CX ) the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life .
NASB1995	John	6	64	But there are ( CY ) some of you who do not believe. ” For Jesus ( CZ ) knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe , and ( DA ) who it was that would [ j ] betray Him .
NASB1995	John	6	65	And He was saying , “ For this reason I have ( DB ) said to you , that no one can come to Me unless ( DC ) it has been granted him from the Father. ” Peter ’ s Confession of Faith
NASB1995	John	6	66	As a result of this many of His ( DD ) disciples ( DE ) withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore .
NASB1995	John	6	67	So Jesus said to ( DF ) the twelve , “ You do not want to go away also , do you ? ”
NASB1995	John	6	68	( DG ) Simon Peter answered Him , “ Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have ( DH ) words of eternal life .
NASB1995	John	6	69	We have believed and have come to know that You are ( DI ) the Holy One of God. ”
NASB1995	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , “ ( DJ ) Did I Myself not choose you , ( DK ) the twelve , and yet one of you is ( DL ) a devil ? ”
NASB1995	John	6	71	Now He meant Judas ( DM ) the son of Simon Iscariot , for he , ( DN ) one of ( DO ) the twelve , [ k ] was going to betray Him .

NASB1995	John	7	2	Now the feast of the Jews , ( D ) the Feast of Booths , was near .
NASB1995	John	7	3	Therefore His ( E ) brothers said to Him , “ Leave here and go into Judea , so that Your ( F ) disciples also may see Your works which You are doing .
NASB1995	John	7	4	For no one does anything in secret [ a ] when he himself seeks to be known publicly . If You do these things , show Yourself to the world. ”
NASB1995	John	7	5	For not even His ( G ) brothers were believing in Him .
NASB1995	John	7	6	So Jesus * said to them , “ ( H ) My time is not yet here , but your time is always opportune .
NASB1995	John	7	8	Go up to the feast yourselves ; I do not go up to this feast because ( K ) My time has not yet fully come. ”
NASB1995	John	7	9	Having said these things to them , He stayed in Galilee .
NASB1995	John	7	10	But when His ( L ) brothers had gone up to the feast , then He Himself also went up , not publicly , but as if , in secret .
NASB1995	John	7	11	( M ) So the Jews ( N ) were seeking Him at the feast and were saying , “ Where is He ? ”
NASB1995	John	7	12	There was much grumbling among the crowds concerning Him ; ( O ) some were saying , “ He is a good man ” ; others were saying , “ No , on the contrary , He leads the people astray. ”
NASB1995	John	7	13	Yet no one was speaking openly of Him for ( P ) fear of the Jews .
NASB1995	John	7	14	But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and began to ( Q ) teach .
NASB1995	John	7	15	( R ) The Jews then were astonished , saying , “ How has this man ( S ) become learned , having never been educated ? ”
NASB1995	John	7	16	So Jesus answered them and said , “ ( T ) My teaching is not Mine , but His who sent Me .
NASB1995	John	7	17	( U ) If anyone is willing to do His will , he will know of the teaching , whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself .
NASB1995	John	7	18	He who speaks from himself ( V ) seeks his own glory ; but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him , He is true , and there is no unrighteousness in Him .
NASB1995	John	7	19	“ ( W ) Did not Moses give you the Law , and yet none of you carries out the Law ? Why do you ( X ) seek to kill Me ? ”
NASB1995	John	7	20	The crowd answered , “ ( Y ) You have a demon ! Who seeks to kill You ? ”
NASB1995	John	7	21	Jesus answered them , “ I did ( Z ) one [ b ] deed , and you all marvel .
NASB1995	John	7	22	For this reason ( AA ) Moses has given you circumcision ( not because it is from Moses , but from ( AB ) the fathers ) , and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man .
NASB1995	John	7	23	( AC ) If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken , are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath ?
NASB1995	John	7	24	Do not ( AD ) judge according to appearance , but [ c ] judge with righteous judgment. ”
NASB1995	John	7	25	So some of the people of Jerusalem were saying , “ Is this not the man whom they are seeking to kill ?
NASB1995	John	7	26	Look , He is speaking publicly , and they are saying nothing to Him . ( AE ) The rulers do not really know that this is [ d ] the Christ , do they ?
NASB1995	John	7	27	However , ( AF ) we know where this man is from ; but whenever the Christ may come , no one knows where He is from. ”
NASB1995	John	7	28	Then Jesus cried out in the temple , ( AG ) teaching and saying , “ ( AH ) You both know Me and know where I am from ; and ( AI ) I have not come of Myself , but He who sent Me is true , whom you do not know .
NASB1995	John	7	29	( AJ ) I know Him , because ( AK ) I am from Him , and ( AL ) He sent Me. ”
NASB1995	John	7	30	So they ( AM ) were seeking to seize Him ; and no man laid his hand on Him , because His ( AN ) hour had not yet come .
NASB1995	John	7	31	But ( AO ) many of the crowd believed in Him ; and they were saying , “ ( AP ) When [ e ] the Christ comes , He will not perform more [ f ] ( AQ ) signs than those which this man has , will He ? ”
NASB1995	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him , and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent ( AR ) officers to ( AS ) seize Him .
NASB1995	John	7	33	Therefore Jesus said , “ ( AT ) For a little while longer I am with you , then ( AU ) I go to Him who sent Me .
NASB1995	John	7	34	( AV ) You will seek Me , and will not find Me ; and where I am , you can not come. ”
NASB1995	John	7	35	( AW ) The Jews then said to one another , “ ( AX ) Where does this man intend to go that we will not find Him ? He is not intending to go to ( AY ) the Dispersion among ( AZ ) the Greeks , and teach the Greeks , is He ?
NASB1995	John	7	36	What is this statement that He said , ‘ ( BA ) You will seek Me , and will not find Me ; and where I am , you can not come ’ ? ”
NASB1995	John	7	37	Now on ( BB ) the last day , the great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , saying , “ [ g ] ( BC ) If anyone is thirsty , [ h ] let him come to Me and drink .
NASB1995	John	7	38	He who believes in Me , ( BD ) as the Scripture said , ‘ From [ i ] his innermost being will flow rivers of ( BE ) living water. ’ ”
NASB1995	John	7	39	But this He spoke ( BF ) of the Spirit , whom those who believed in Him were to receive ; for ( BG ) the Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus was not yet ( BH ) glorified . Division of People over Jesus
NASB1995	John	7	40	Some of the people therefore , when they heard these words , were saying , “ This certainly is ( BI ) the Prophet. ”
NASB1995	John	7	41	Others were saying , “ This is [ j ] the Christ. ” Still others were saying , “ ( BJ ) Surely [ k ] the Christ is not going to come from Galilee , is He ?
NASB1995	John	7	42	Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from ( BK ) the descendants of David , and from Bethlehem , the village where David was ? ”
NASB1995	John	7	43	So ( BL ) a division occurred in the crowd because of Him .
NASB1995	John	7	44	( BM ) Some of them wanted to seize Him , but no one laid hands on Him .
NASB1995	John	7	45	The ( BN ) officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , “ Why did you not bring Him ? ”
NASB1995	John	7	46	The ( BO ) officers answered , “ ( BP ) Never has a man spoken the way this man speaks. ”
NASB1995	John	7	47	The Pharisees then answered them , “ ( BQ ) You have not also been led astray , have you ?
NASB1995	John	7	48	( BR ) No one of ( BS ) the rulers or Pharisees has believed in Him , has he ?
NASB1995	John	7	49	But this crowd which does not know the Law is accursed. ”
NASB1995	John	7	50	( BT ) Nicodemus ( he who came to Him before , being one of them ) * said to them ,
NASB1995	John	7	51	“ ( BU ) Our Law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing , does it ? ”
NASB1995	John	7	52	They answered him , “ ( BV ) You are not also from Galilee , are you ? Search , and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee. ”

NASB1995	John	8	2	Early in the morning He came again into the temple , and all the people were coming to Him ; and ( B ) He sat down and began to teach them .
NASB1995	John	8	3	The scribes and the Pharisees * brought a woman caught in adultery , and having set her in the center of the court ,
NASB1995	John	8	4	they * said to Him , “ Teacher , this woman has been caught in adultery , in the very act .
NASB1995	John	8	5	Now in the Law ( C ) Moses commanded us to stone such women ; what then do You say ? ”
NASB1995	John	8	6	They were saying this , ( D ) testing Him , ( E ) so that they might have grounds for accusing Him . But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground .
NASB1995	John	8	7	But when they persisted in asking Him , ( F ) He straightened up , and said to them , “ ( G ) He who is without sin among you , let him be the ( H ) first to throw a stone at her. ”
NASB1995	John	8	9	When they heard it , they began to go out one by one , beginning with the older ones , and He was left alone , and the woman , where she was , in the center of the court .
NASB1995	John	8	10	( I ) Straightening up , Jesus said to her , “ Woman , where are they ? Did no one condemn you ? ”
NASB1995	John	8	11	She said , “ No one , [ a ] Lord. ” And Jesus said , “ ( J ) I do not condemn you , either . Go . From now on ( K ) sin no more. ” ] Jesus Is the Light of the World
NASB1995	John	8	12	Then Jesus again spoke to them , saying , “ ( L ) I am the Light of the world ; ( M ) he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness , but will have the Light of life. ”
NASB1995	John	8	13	So the Pharisees said to Him , “ ( N ) You are testifying about Yourself ; Your testimony is not [ b ] true. ”
NASB1995	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said to them , “ ( O ) Even if I testify about Myself , My testimony is [ c ] true , for I know ( P ) where I came from and where I am going ; but ( Q ) you do not know where I come from or where I am going .
NASB1995	John	8	15	( R ) You judge [ d ] according to the flesh ; ( S ) I am not judging anyone .

NASB1995	John	8	17	Even in ( U ) your law it has been written that the testimony of ( V ) two men is [ e ] true .
NASB1995	John	8	18	I am He who testifies about Myself , and ( W ) the Father who sent Me testifies about Me. ”
NASB1995	John	8	19	So they were saying to Him , “ Where is Your Father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You know neither Me nor My Father ; ( X ) if you knew Me , you would know My Father also. ”
NASB1995	John	8	20	These words He spoke in ( Y ) the treasury , as ( Z ) He taught in the temple ; and no one seized Him , because ( AA ) His hour had not yet come .
NASB1995	John	8	21	Then He said again to them , “ I go away , and ( AB ) you will seek Me , and ( AC ) will die in your sin ; where I am going , you can not come. ”
NASB1995	John	8	22	So ( AD ) the Jews were saying , “ Surely He will not kill Himself , will He , since He says , ‘ ( AE ) Where I am going , you can not come ’ ? ”
NASB1995	John	8	23	And He was saying to them , “ ( AF ) You are from below , I am from above ; ( AG ) you are of this world , ( AH ) I am not of this world .

NASB1995	John	8	25	So they were saying to Him , “ Who are You ? ” Jesus said to them , “ [ g ] What have I been saying to you from the beginning ?
NASB1995	John	8	26	I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you , but ( AL ) He who sent Me is true ; and ( AM ) the things which I heard from Him , these I speak to the world. ”
NASB1995	John	8	27	They did not realize that He had been speaking to them about the Father .
NASB1995	John	8	28	So Jesus said , “ When you ( AN ) lift up the Son of Man , then you will know that [ h ] ( AO ) I am He , and ( AP ) I do nothing on My own initiative , but I speak these things as the Father taught Me .
NASB1995	John	8	29	And He who sent Me is with Me ; ( AQ ) He [ i ] has not left Me alone , for ( AR ) I always do the things that are pleasing to Him. ”
NASB1995	John	8	30	As He spoke these things , ( AS ) many came to believe in Him . The Truth Will Make You Free
NASB1995	John	8	31	So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him , “ ( AT ) If you continue in My word , then you are truly ( AU ) disciples of Mine ;
NASB1995	John	8	32	and ( AV ) you will know the truth , and ( AW ) the truth will make you free. ”
NASB1995	John	8	33	They answered Him , “ ( AX ) We are Abraham ’ s descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone ; how is it that You say , ‘ You will become free ’ ? ”
NASB1995	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AY ) everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin .
NASB1995	John	8	35	( AZ ) The slave does not remain in the house forever ; ( BA ) the son does remain forever .
NASB1995	John	8	36	So if the Son ( BB ) makes you free , you will be free indeed .
NASB1995	John	8	37	I know that you are ( BC ) Abraham ’ s descendants ; yet ( BD ) you seek to kill Me , because My word [ j ] has no place in you .
NASB1995	John	8	38	I speak the things which I have seen [ k ] with My Father ; therefore you also do the things which you heard from ( BE ) your father. ”
NASB1995	John	8	39	They answered and said to Him , “ Abraham is ( BF ) our father. ” Jesus * said to them , “ ( BG ) If you are Abraham ’ s children , do the deeds of Abraham .
NASB1995	John	8	40	But as it is , ( BH ) you are seeking to kill Me , a man who has ( BI ) told you the truth , which I heard from God ; this Abraham did not do .
NASB1995	John	8	41	You are doing the deeds of ( BJ ) your father. ” They said to Him , “ We were not born of fornication ; ( BK ) we have one Father : God. ”
NASB1995	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , “ If God were your Father , ( BL ) you would love Me , ( BM ) for I proceeded forth and have come from God , for I have ( BN ) not even come on My own initiative , but [ l ] ( BO ) He sent Me .
NASB1995	John	8	43	Why do you not understand [ m ] ( BP ) what I am saying ? It is because you can not ( BQ ) hear My word .
NASB1995	John	8	44	( BR ) You are of ( BS ) your father the devil , and ( BT ) you want to do the desires of your father . ( BU ) He was a murderer from the beginning , and does not stand in the truth because ( BV ) there is no truth in him . Whenever he speaks [ n ] a lie , he ( BW ) speaks from his own nature , for he is a liar and the father of [ o ] lies .
NASB1995	John	8	45	But because ( BX ) I speak the truth , you do not believe Me .
NASB1995	John	8	46	Which one of you convicts Me of sin ? If ( BY ) I speak truth , why do you not believe Me ?
NASB1995	John	8	47	( BZ ) He who is of God hears the words of God ; for this reason you do not hear them , because you are not of God. ”
NASB1995	John	8	48	( CA ) The Jews answered and said to Him , “ Do we not say rightly that You are a ( CB ) Samaritan and ( CC ) have a demon ? ”
NASB1995	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I do not ( CD ) have a demon ; but I honor My Father , and you dishonor Me .
NASB1995	John	8	50	But ( CE ) I do not seek My glory ; there is One who seeks and judges .
NASB1995	John	8	51	Truly , truly , I say to you , if anyone ( CF ) keeps My word he will never ( CG ) see death. ”
NASB1995	John	8	52	( CH ) The Jews said to Him , “ Now we know that You ( CI ) have a demon . Abraham died , and the prophets also ; and You say , ‘ If anyone ( CJ ) keeps My word , he will never ( CK ) taste of death. ’
NASB1995	John	8	53	Surely You ( CL ) are not greater than our father Abraham , who died ? The prophets died too ; whom do You make Yourself out to be ? ”
NASB1995	John	8	54	Jesus answered , “ ( CM ) If I glorify Myself , My glory is nothing ; ( CN ) it is My Father who glorifies Me , of whom you say , ‘ He is our God ’ ;
NASB1995	John	8	55	and ( CO ) you have not come to know Him , ( CP ) but I know Him ; and if I say that I do not know Him , I will be ( CQ ) a liar like you , ( CR ) but I do know Him and ( CS ) keep His word .
NASB1995	John	8	56	( CT ) Your father Abraham ( CU ) rejoiced [ p ] to see My day , and he saw it and was glad. ”
NASB1995	John	8	57	( CV ) So the Jews said to Him , “ You are not yet fifty years old , and have You seen Abraham ? ”
NASB1995	John	8	58	Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , before Abraham [ q ] was born , ( CW ) I am. ”
NASB1995	John	8	59	Therefore they ( CX ) picked up stones to throw at Him , but Jesus [ r ] ( CY ) hid Himself and went out of the temple .

NASB1995	John	9	2	And His disciples asked Him , “ ( A ) Rabbi , who sinned , ( B ) this man or his ( C ) parents , that he would be born blind ? ”
NASB1995	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ It was neither that this man sinned , nor his parents ; but it was so ( D ) that the works of God might be displayed in him .
NASB1995	John	9	4	We must work the works of Him who sent Me ( E ) as long as it is day ; night is coming when no one can work .
NASB1995	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am ( F ) the Light of the world. ”
NASB1995	John	9	6	When He had said this , He ( G ) spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and applied the clay to his eyes ,
NASB1995	John	9	7	and said to him , “ Go , wash in ( H ) the pool of Siloam ” ( which is translated , Sent ) . So he went away and ( I ) washed , and ( J ) came back seeing .
NASB1995	John	9	8	Therefore the neighbors , and those who previously saw him as a beggar , were saying , “ Is not this the one who used to ( K ) sit and beg ? ”
NASB1995	John	9	10	So they were saying to him , “ How then were your eyes opened ? ”
NASB1995	John	9	11	He answered , “ The man who is called Jesus made clay , and anointed my eyes , and said to me , ‘ Go to ( L ) Siloam and wash ’ ; so I went away and washed , and I received sight. ”
NASB1995	John	9	12	They said to him , “ Where is He ? ” He * said , “ I do not know. ” Controversy over the Man
NASB1995	John	9	13	They * brought to the Pharisees the man who was formerly blind .
NASB1995	John	9	14	( M ) Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes .
NASB1995	John	9	15	( N ) Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight . And he said to them , “ He applied clay to my eyes , and I washed , and I see. ”
NASB1995	John	9	16	Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying , “ This man is not from God , because He ( O ) does not keep the Sabbath. ” But others were saying , “ How can a man who is a sinner perform such [ b ] ( P ) signs ? ” And ( Q ) there was a division among them .
NASB1995	John	9	17	So they * said to the blind man ( R ) again , “ What do you say about Him , since He opened your eyes ? ” And he said , “ He is a ( S ) prophet. ”
NASB1995	John	9	18	( T ) The Jews then did not believe it of him , that he had been blind and had received sight , until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight ,
NASB1995	John	9	19	and questioned them , saying , “ Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? Then how does he now see ? ”
NASB1995	John	9	20	His parents answered them and said , “ We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
NASB1995	John	9	21	but how he now sees , we do not know ; or who opened his eyes , we do not know . Ask him ; he is of age , he will speak for himself. ”
NASB1995	John	9	22	His parents said this because they ( U ) were afraid of the Jews ; for the Jews ( V ) had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be [ c ] Christ , ( W ) he was to be put out of the synagogue .
NASB1995	John	9	23	For this reason his parents said , “ ( X ) He is of age ; ask him. ”
NASB1995	John	9	24	So a second time they called the man who had been blind , and said to him , “ ( Y ) Give glory to God ; we know that ( Z ) this man is a sinner. ”
NASB1995	John	9	25	He then answered , “ Whether He is a sinner , I do not know ; one thing I do know , that though I was blind , now I see. ”
NASB1995	John	9	26	So they said to him , “ What did He do to you ? How did He open your eyes ? ”
NASB1995	John	9	27	He answered them , “ ( AA ) I told you already and you did not ( AB ) listen ; why do you want to hear it again ? You do not want to become His disciples too , do you ? ”
NASB1995	John	9	28	They reviled him and said , “ You are His disciple , but ( AC ) we are disciples of Moses .
NASB1995	John	9	29	We know that God has spoken to Moses , but as for this man , ( AD ) we do not know where He is from. ”
NASB1995	John	9	30	The man answered and said to them , “ Well , here is an amazing thing , that you do not know where He is from , and yet He opened my eyes .
NASB1995	John	9	31	We know that ( AE ) God does not hear sinners ; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will , He hears him .
NASB1995	John	9	32	[ d ] Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind .
NASB1995	John	9	33	( AF ) If this man were not from God , He could do nothing. ”
NASB1995	John	9	34	They answered him , “ ( AG ) You were born entirely in sins , and are you teaching us ? ” So they ( AH ) put him out . Jesus Affirms His Deity
NASB1995	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had ( AI ) put him out , and finding him , He said , “ Do you believe in the ( AJ ) Son of Man ? ”
NASB1995	John	9	36	He answered , “ ( AK ) Who is He , [ e ] Lord , that I may believe in Him ? ”
NASB1995	John	9	37	Jesus said to him , “ You have both seen Him , and ( AL ) He is the one who is talking with you. ”
NASB1995	John	9	38	And he said , “ Lord , I believe. ” And he ( AM ) worshiped Him .
NASB1995	John	9	39	And Jesus said , “ ( AN ) For judgment I came into this world , so that ( AO ) those who do not see may see , and that ( AP ) those who see may become blind. ”
NASB1995	John	9	40	Those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him , “ ( AQ ) We are not blind too , are we ? ”

NASB1995	John	10	6	This ( G ) figure of speech Jesus spoke to them , but they did not understand what those things were which He had been saying to them .
NASB1995	John	10	7	So Jesus said to them again , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , I am ( H ) the door of the sheep .

NASB1995	John	10	12	He who is a hired hand , and not a ( N ) shepherd , who is not the owner of the sheep , sees the wolf coming , and leaves the sheep and flees , and the wolf snatches them and scatters them .
NASB1995	John	10	13	He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep .
NASB1995	John	10	14	( O ) I am the good shepherd , and ( P ) I know My own and My own know Me ,

NASB1995	John	10	19	( Z ) A division occurred again among the Jews because of these words .
NASB1995	John	10	20	Many of them were saying , “ He ( AA ) has a demon and ( AB ) is insane . Why do you listen to Him ? ”

NASB1995	John	10	22	At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place at Jerusalem ;
NASB1995	John	10	23	it was winter , and Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of ( AE ) Solomon .
NASB1995	John	10	24	( AF ) The Jews then gathered around Him , and were saying to Him , “ How long [ b ] will You keep us in suspense ? If You are [ c ] the Christ , tell us ( AG ) plainly. ”

NASB1995	John	10	33	The Jews answered Him , “ For a good work we do not stone You , but for ( AQ ) blasphemy ; and because You , being a man , ( AR ) make Yourself out to be God. ”

NASB1995	John	11	2	It was the Mary who ( C ) anointed ( D ) the Lord with ointment , and wiped His feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick .
NASB1995	John	11	3	So the sisters sent word to Him , saying , “ ( E ) Lord , behold , ( F ) he whom You love is sick. ”
NASB1995	John	11	4	But when Jesus heard this , He said , “ This sickness is not to end in death , but for ( G ) the glory of God , so that the Son of God may be glorified by it. ”
NASB1995	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved ( H ) Martha and her sister and Lazarus .

NASB1995	John	11	34	and said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They * said to Him , “ Lord , come and see. ”
NASB1995	John	11	35	Jesus ( AQ ) wept .
NASB1995	John	11	36	So ( AR ) the Jews were saying , “ See how He ( AS ) loved him ! ”
NASB1995	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ Could not this man , who ( AT ) opened the eyes of the blind man , [ i ] have kept this man also from dying ? ”
NASB1995	John	11	38	So Jesus , again being deeply moved within , * came to the tomb . Now it was a ( AU ) cave , and a stone was lying against it .
NASB1995	John	11	39	Jesus * said , “ Remove the stone. ” Martha , the sister of the deceased , * said to Him , “ Lord , by this time [ j ] there will be a stench , for he has been dead ( AV ) four days. ”
NASB1995	John	11	40	Jesus * said to her , “ ( AW ) Did I not say to you that if you believe , you will see the glory of God ? ”
NASB1995	John	11	41	So they removed the ( AX ) stone . Then Jesus ( AY ) raised His eyes , and said , “ ( AZ ) Father , I thank You that You have heard Me .
NASB1995	John	11	42	I knew that You always hear Me ; but ( BA ) because of the [ k ] people standing around I said it , so that they may believe that ( BB ) You sent Me. ”
NASB1995	John	11	43	When He had said these things , He cried out with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come forth. ”
NASB1995	John	11	44	The man who had died came forth , ( BC ) bound hand and foot with wrappings , and ( BD ) his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus * said to them , “ Unbind him , and let him go. ”
NASB1995	John	11	45	( BE ) Therefore many of the Jews ( BF ) who came to Mary , and ( BG ) saw what He had done , believed in Him .
NASB1995	John	11	46	But some of them went to the ( BH ) Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done . Conspiracy to Kill Jesus
NASB1995	John	11	47	Therefore ( BI ) the chief priests and the Pharisees ( BJ ) convened a ( BK ) council , and were saying , “ What are we doing ? For this man is performing many [ l ] ( BL ) signs .
NASB1995	John	11	48	If we let Him go on like this , all men will believe in Him , and the Romans will come and take away both our ( BM ) place and our nation. ”
NASB1995	John	11	49	But one of them , ( BN ) Caiaphas , ( BO ) who was high priest that year , said to them , “ You know nothing at all ,
NASB1995	John	11	50	nor do you take into account that ( BP ) it is expedient for you that one man die for the people , and that the whole nation not perish. ”
NASB1995	John	11	51	Now he did not say this [ m ] on his own initiative , but ( BQ ) being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation ,
NASB1995	John	11	52	and not for the nation only , but in order that He might also ( BR ) gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad .
NASB1995	John	11	53	So from that day on they ( BS ) planned together to kill Him .
NASB1995	John	11	54	Therefore Jesus ( BT ) no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews , but went away from there to the country near the wilderness , into a city called ( BU ) Ephraim ; and there He stayed with the disciples .
NASB1995	John	11	55	Now ( BV ) the Passover of the Jews was near , and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover ( BW ) to purify themselves .
NASB1995	John	11	56	So they ( BX ) were seeking for Jesus , and were saying to one another as they stood in the temple , “ What do you think ; that He will not come to the feast at all ? ”
NASB1995	John	11	57	Now ( BY ) the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was , he was to report it , so that they might seize Him . Footnotes - John 11:12 Lit be saved - John 11:13 Lit the slumber of sleep - John 11:16 I.e . the Twin - John 11:18 Lit

NASB1995	John	12	4	But ( G ) Judas Iscariot , one of His disciples , who was intending to [ b ] betray Him , * said ,
NASB1995	John	12	5	“ Why was this perfume not sold for [ c ] three hundred denarii and given to poor people ? ”

NASB1995	John	12	20	Now there were some ( Z ) Greeks among those who were going up to worship at ( AA ) the feast ;
NASB1995	John	12	21	these then came to ( AB ) Philip , who was from ( AC ) Bethsaida of Galilee , and began to ask him , saying , “ Sir , we wish to see Jesus. ”
NASB1995	John	12	22	Philip * came and * told ( AD ) Andrew ; Andrew and Philip * came and * told Jesus .

NASB1995	John	12	24	Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AG ) unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it bears much fruit .

NASB1995	John	12	27	“ ( AL ) Now My soul has become troubled ; and what shall I say , ‘ ( AM ) Father , save Me from ( AN ) this hour ’ ? But for this purpose I came to this hour .
NASB1995	John	12	28	( AO ) Father , glorify Your name. ” Then a ( AP ) voice came out of heaven : “ I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again. ”
NASB1995	John	12	29	So the crowd of people who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered ; others were saying , “ ( AQ ) An angel has spoken to Him. ”
NASB1995	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said , “ ( AR ) This voice has not come for My sake , but for your sakes .
NASB1995	John	12	31	( AS ) Now judgment is upon this world ; now ( AT ) the ruler of this world will be cast out .
NASB1995	John	12	32	And I , if I ( AU ) am lifted up from the earth , will ( AV ) draw all men to Myself. ”
NASB1995	John	12	33	But He was saying this ( AW ) to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die .
NASB1995	John	12	34	The crowd then answered Him , “ We have heard out of ( AX ) the Law that [ l ] ( AY ) the Christ is to remain forever ; and how can You say , ‘ The ( AZ ) Son of Man must be ( BA ) lifted up ’ ? Who is this ( BB ) Son of Man ? ”
NASB1995	John	12	35	So Jesus said to them , “ ( BC ) For a little while longer ( BD ) the Light is among you . ( BE ) Walk while you have the Light , so that darkness will not overtake you ; he who ( BF ) walks in the darkness does not know where he goes .
NASB1995	John	12	36	While you have the Light , ( BG ) believe in the Light , so that you may become ( BH ) sons of Light. ” These things Jesus spoke , and He went away and [ m ] ( BI ) hid Himself from them .
NASB1995	John	12	37	But though He had performed so many [ n ] signs before them , yet they were not believing in Him .
NASB1995	John	12	38	This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke : “ ( BJ ) Lord , who has believed our report ? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ”
NASB1995	John	12	39	For this reason they could not believe , for Isaiah said again ,
NASB1995	John	12	40	“ ( BK ) He has blinded their eyes and He ( BL ) hardened their heart , so that they would not see with their eyes and perceive with their heart , and [ o ] be converted and I heal them. ”
NASB1995	John	12	41	These things Isaiah said because ( BM ) he saw His glory , and ( BN ) he spoke of Him .
NASB1995	John	12	42	Nevertheless ( BO ) many even of ( BP ) the rulers believed in Him , but ( BQ ) because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him , for fear that they would be [ p ] ( BR ) put out of the synagogue ;
NASB1995	John	12	43	( BS ) for they loved the [ q ] approval of men rather than the [ r ] approval of God .
NASB1995	John	12	44	And Jesus cried out and said , “ ( BT ) He who believes in Me , does not believe in Me but in Him who sent Me .
NASB1995	John	12	45	( BU ) He who sees Me sees the One who sent Me .

NASB1995	John	13	2	During supper , ( D ) the devil having already put into the heart of ( E ) Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , to betray Him ,
NASB1995	John	13	3	Jesus , ( F ) knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands , and that ( G ) He had come forth from God and was going back to God ,
NASB1995	John	13	4	* got up from supper , and * laid aside His garments ; and taking a towel , He ( H ) girded Himself . Jesus Washes the Disciples ’ Feet
NASB1995	John	13	5	Then He * poured water into the basin , and began to ( I ) wash the disciples ’ feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded .
NASB1995	John	13	6	So He * came to Simon Peter . He * said to Him , “ Lord , do You wash my feet ? ”
NASB1995	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said to him , “ What I do you do not realize now , but you will understand ( J ) hereafter. ”
NASB1995	John	13	8	Peter * said to Him , “ Never shall You wash my feet ! ” Jesus answered him , “ ( K ) If I do not wash you , ( L ) you have no part with Me. ”
NASB1995	John	13	9	Simon Peter * said to Him , “ Lord , then wash not only my feet , but also my hands and my head. ”
NASB1995	John	13	10	Jesus * said to him , “ He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet , but is completely clean ; and ( M ) you are clean , but not all of you. ”
NASB1995	John	13	11	For ( N ) He knew the one who was betraying Him ; for this reason He said , “ Not all of you are clean. ”
NASB1995	John	13	12	So when He had washed their feet , and ( O ) taken His garments and reclined at the table again , He said to them , “ Do you know what I have done to you ?
NASB1995	John	13	14	If I then , ( R ) the Lord and the Teacher , washed your feet , you also ought to wash one another ’ s feet .

NASB1995	John	13	21	When Jesus had said this , He ( AD ) became troubled in spirit , and testified and said , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , that ( AE ) one of you will [ c ] betray Me. ”
NASB1995	John	13	22	The disciples began looking at one another , ( AF ) at a loss to know of which one He was speaking .
NASB1995	John	13	23	There was reclining on ( AG ) Jesus ’ bosom one of His disciples , ( AH ) whom Jesus loved .
NASB1995	John	13	24	So Simon Peter * gestured to him , and * said to him , “ Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking. ”
NASB1995	John	13	25	He , ( AI ) leaning back thus on Jesus ’ bosom , * said to Him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
NASB1995	John	13	26	Jesus then * answered , “ That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him. ” So when He had dipped the morsel , He * took and * gave it to Judas , ( AJ ) the son of Simon Iscariot .
NASB1995	John	13	27	After the morsel , ( AK ) Satan then ( AL ) entered into him . Therefore Jesus * said to him , “ What you do , do quickly. ”
NASB1995	John	13	28	Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him .
NASB1995	John	13	29	For some were supposing , because Judas ( AM ) had the money box , that Jesus was saying to him , “ Buy the things we have need of ( AN ) for the feast ” ; or else , that he should ( AO ) give something to the poor .
NASB1995	John	13	30	So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately ; and ( AP ) it was night .
NASB1995	John	13	31	Therefore when he had gone out , Jesus * said , “ Now [ d ] is ( AQ ) the Son of Man ( AR ) glorified , and ( AS ) God [ e ] is glorified in Him ;

NASB1995	John	15	6	If anyone does not abide in Me , he is ( F ) thrown away as a branch and dries up ; and they gather them , and cast them into the fire and they are burned .
NASB1995	John	15	7	If you abide in Me , and My words abide in you , ( G ) ask whatever you wish , and it will be done for you .

NASB1995	John	15	19	If you were of the world , the world would love its own ; but because you are not of the world , but ( Z ) I chose you out of the world , ( AA ) because of this the world hates you .
NASB1995	John	15	20	Remember the word that I said to you , ‘ ( AB ) A slave is not greater than his master. ’ If they persecuted Me , ( AC ) they will also persecute you ; if they ( AD ) kept My word , they will keep yours also .

NASB1995	John	18	32	to fulfill ( AX ) the word of Jesus which He spoke , signifying by what kind of death He was about to die .

NASB1995	John	19	18	There they crucified Him , and with Him ( AB ) two other men , one on either side , and Jesus in between .
NASB1995	John	19	20	Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written ( AE ) in [ k ] Hebrew , Latin and in Greek .
NASB1995	John	19	21	So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate , “ Do not write , ‘ ( AF ) The King of the Jews ’ ; but that He said , ‘ I am ( AG ) King of the Jews. ’ ”
NASB1995	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ ( AH ) What I have written I have written. ”
NASB1995	John	19	23	Then ( AI ) the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took His outer garments and made ( AJ ) four parts , a part to every soldier and also the [ l ] tunic ; now the tunic was seamless , woven [ m ] in one piece .
NASB1995	John	19	24	So they said to one another , “ ( AK ) Let us not tear it , but cast lots for it , to decide whose it shall be ” ; ( AL ) this was to fulfill the Scripture : “ They ( AM ) divided My outer garments among them , and for My clothing they cast [ n ] lots. ”
NASB1995	John	19	25	Therefore the soldiers did these things . ( AN ) But standing by the cross of Jesus were ( AO ) His mother , and His mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and ( AP ) Mary Magdalene .
NASB1995	John	19	26	When Jesus then saw His mother , and ( AQ ) the disciple whom He loved standing nearby , He * said to His mother , “ ( AR ) Woman , behold , your son ! ”
NASB1995	John	19	27	Then He * said to the disciple , “ Behold , your mother ! ” From that hour the disciple took her into ( AS ) his own household .
NASB1995	John	19	28	After this , Jesus , ( AT ) knowing that all things had already been accomplished , ( AU ) to fulfill the Scripture , * said , “ ( AV ) I am thirsty. ”
NASB1995	John	19	29	A jar full of sour wine was standing there ; so ( AW ) they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth .
NASB1995	John	19	30	Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine , He said , “ ( AX ) It is finished ! ” And He bowed His head and ( AY ) gave up His spirit . Care of the Body of Jesus
NASB1995	John	19	31	Then the Jews , because it was ( AZ ) the day of preparation , so that ( BA ) the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath ( [ o ] for that Sabbath was a ( BB ) high day ) , asked Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
NASB1995	John	19	32	So the soldiers came , and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was ( BC ) crucified with Him ;
NASB1995	John	19	33	but coming to Jesus , when they saw that He was already dead , they did not break His legs .
NASB1995	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear , and immediately ( BD ) blood and water came out .
NASB1995	John	19	35	And he who has seen has ( BE ) testified , and his testimony is true ; and he knows that he is telling the truth , so that you also may believe .
NASB1995	John	19	36	For these things came to pass ( BF ) to fulfill the Scripture , “ ( BG ) Not a bone of Him shall be [ p ] broken. ”
NASB1995	John	19	37	And again another Scripture says , “ ( BH ) They shall look on Him whom they pierced. ”
NASB1995	John	19	38	( BI ) After these things Joseph of Arimathea , being a disciple of Jesus , but a ( BJ ) secret one for ( BK ) fear of the Jews , asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus ; and Pilate granted permission . So he came and took away His body .
NASB1995	John	19	39	( BL ) Nicodemus , who had first come to Him by night , also came , ( BM ) bringing a [ q ] mixture of ( BN ) myrrh and aloes , about a ( BO ) hundred [ r ] pounds weight .
NASB1995	John	19	40	So they took the body of Jesus and ( BP ) bound it in ( BQ ) linen wrappings with the spices , as is the burial custom of the Jews .
NASB1995	John	19	41	Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden , and in the garden a ( BR ) new tomb ( BS ) in which no one had yet been laid .
NASB1995	John	19	42	Therefore because of the Jewish day of ( BT ) preparation , since the tomb was ( BU ) nearby , they laid Jesus there .

NASB1995	John	20	3	( F ) So Peter and the other disciple went forth , and they were going to the tomb .
NASB1995	John	20	4	The two were running together ; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first ;
NASB1995	John	20	5	and ( G ) stooping and looking in , he * saw the ( H ) linen wrappings lying there ; but he did not go in .
NASB1995	John	20	6	And so Simon Peter also * came , following him , and entered the tomb ; and he * saw the linen wrappings lying there ,

NASB1995	John	20	8	So the other disciple who ( K ) had first come to the tomb then also entered , and he saw and believed .
NASB1995	John	20	9	For as yet ( L ) they did not understand the Scripture , ( M ) that He must rise again from the dead .
NASB1995	John	20	10	So the disciples went away again ( N ) to their own homes .
NASB1995	John	20	11	( O ) But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping ; and so , as she wept , she ( P ) stooped and looked into the tomb ;

NASB1995	John	20	13	And they * said to her , “ ( R ) Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She * said to them , “ Because ( S ) they have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have laid Him. ”
NASB1995	John	20	14	When she had said this , she turned around and * ( T ) saw Jesus standing there , and ( U ) did not know that it was Jesus .

NASB1995	John	20	16	Jesus * said to her , “ Mary ! ” She turned and * said to Him ( W ) in [ a ] Hebrew , “ ( X ) Rabboni ! ” ( which means , Teacher ) .
NASB1995	John	20	17	Jesus * said to her , “ Stop clinging to Me , for I have not yet ascended to the Father ; but go to ( Y ) My brethren and say to them , ‘ I ( Z ) ascend to My Father and your Father , and My God and your God. ’ ”

NASB1995	John	20	25	So the other disciples were saying to him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But he said to them , “ Unless I see in ( AM ) His hands the imprint of the nails , and put my finger into the place of the nails , and put my hand into His side , ( AN ) I will not believe. ”
NASB1995	John	20	26	[ e ] After eight days His disciples were again inside , and Thomas with them . Jesus * came , the doors having been [ f ] shut , and stood in their midst and said , “ ( AO ) Peace be with you. ”

NASB1995	John	21	2	Simon Peter , and ( D ) Thomas called [ b ] Didymus , and ( E ) Nathanael of ( F ) Cana in Galilee , and ( G ) the sons of Zebedee , and two others of His disciples were together .
NASB1995	John	21	3	Simon Peter * said to them , “ I am going fishing. ” They * said to him , “ We will also come with you. ” They went out and got into the boat ; and ( H ) that night they caught nothing .
NASB1995	John	21	4	But when the day was now breaking , Jesus stood on the beach ; yet the disciples did not ( I ) know that it was Jesus .
NASB1995	John	21	5	So Jesus * said to them , “ Children , ( J ) you do not have [ c ] any fish , do you ? ” They answered Him , “ No. ”
NASB1995	John	21	6	And He said to them , “ ( K ) Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat and you will find a catch. ” So they cast , and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish .
NASB1995	John	21	7	( L ) Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved * said to Peter , “ It is the Lord. ” So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he put his outer garment on ( for he was stripped for work ) , and threw himself into the sea .
NASB1995	John	21	8	But the other disciples came in the little boat , for they were not far from the land , but about [ d ] one hundred yards away , dragging the net full of fish .
NASB1995	John	21	9	So when they got out on the land , they * saw a charcoal ( M ) fire already laid and ( N ) fish placed on it , and bread .
NASB1995	John	21	10	Jesus * said to them , “ Bring some of the ( O ) fish which you have now caught. ”
NASB1995	John	21	11	Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land , full of large fish , a hundred and fifty-three ; and although there were so many , the net was not torn . Jesus Provides
NASB1995	John	21	12	Jesus * said to them , “ Come and have ( P ) breakfast. ” None of the disciples ventured to question Him , “ Who are You ? ” knowing that it was the Lord .
NASB1995	John	21	13	Jesus * came and * took ( Q ) the bread and * gave it to them , and the ( R ) fish likewise .
NASB1995	John	21	14	This is now the ( S ) third time that Jesus [ e ] was manifested to the disciples , after He was raised from the dead . The Love Motivation
NASB1995	John	21	15	So when they had ( T ) finished breakfast , Jesus * said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of John , do you [ f ] ( U ) love Me more than these ? ” He * said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; You know that I [ g ] love You. ” He * said to him , “ Tend ( V ) My lambs. ”
NASB1995	John	21	16	He * said to him again a second time , “ Simon , son of John , do you [ h ] love Me ? ” He * said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; You know that I [ i ] love You. ” He * said to him , “ ( W ) Shepherd My sheep. ”
NASB1995	John	21	17	He * said to him the third time , “ Simon , son of John , do you [ j ] love Me ? ” Peter was grieved because He said to him ( X ) the third time , “ Do you [ k ] love Me ? ” And he said to Him , “ Lord , ( Y ) You know all things ; You know that I [ l ] love You. ” Jesus * said to him , “ ( Z ) Tend My sheep . Our Times Are in His Hand
NASB1995	John	21	18	Truly , truly , I say to you , when you were younger , you used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wished ; but when you grow old , you will stretch out your hands and someone else will gird you , and bring you where you do not wish to go. ”
NASB1995	John	21	19	Now this He said , ( AA ) signifying by ( AB ) what kind of death he would glorify God . And when He had spoken this , He * said to him , “ ( AC ) Follow Me ! ”
NASB1995	John	21	20	Peter , turning around , * saw the ( AD ) disciple whom Jesus loved following them ; the one who also had ( AE ) leaned back on His bosom at the supper and said , “ Lord , who is the one who betrays You ? ”
NASB1995	John	21	22	Jesus * said to him , “ If I want him to remain ( AF ) until I come , what is that to you ? You ( AG ) follow Me ! ”
NASB1995	John	21	23	Therefore this saying went out among ( AH ) the brethren that that disciple would not die ; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die , but only , “ If I want him to remain ( AI ) until I come , what is that to you ? ”
NASB1995	John	21	24	This is the disciple who ( AJ ) is testifying to these things and wrote these things , and we know that his testimony is true .

NASB1995	Romans	1	10	always in my prayers making request , if perhaps now at last by ( U ) the will of God I may succeed in coming to you .
NASB1995	Romans	1	11	For ( V ) I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you , that you may be [ h ] established ;
NASB1995	Romans	1	12	that is , that I may be encouraged together with you while among you , each of us by the other ’ s faith , both yours and mine .

NASB1995	Romans	1	17	For in it ( AH ) the righteousness of God is revealed [ j ] from faith to faith ; as it is written , “ [ k ] ( AI ) But the righteous man shall live by faith. ” Unbelief and Its Consequences
NASB1995	Romans	1	18	For ( AJ ) the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who ( AK ) suppress the truth [ l ] in unrighteousness ,
NASB1995	Romans	1	19	because ( AL ) that which is known about God is evident [ m ] within them ; for God made it evident to them .

NASB1995	Romans	1	21	For even though they knew God , they did not [ n ] honor Him as God or give thanks , but they became ( AO ) futile in their speculations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
NASB1995	Romans	1	22	( AP ) Professing to be wise , they became fools ,
NASB1995	Romans	1	23	and ( AQ ) exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and [ o ] crawling creatures .
NASB1995	Romans	1	24	Therefore ( AR ) God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity , so that their bodies would be ( AS ) dishonored among them .
NASB1995	Romans	1	25	For they exchanged the truth of God for [ p ] a ( AT ) lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , ( AU ) who is blessed [ q ] forever . Amen .
NASB1995	Romans	1	26	For this reason ( AV ) God gave them over to ( AW ) degrading passions ; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is [ r ] unnatural ,
NASB1995	Romans	1	27	and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another , ( AX ) men with men committing [ s ] indecent acts and receiving in [ t ] their own persons the due penalty of their error .

NASB1995	Romans	2	4	Or do you think lightly of ( E ) the riches of His ( F ) kindness and ( G ) tolerance and ( H ) patience , not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance ?
NASB1995	Romans	2	5	But [ d ] because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart ( I ) you are storing up wrath for yourself ( J ) in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ,

NASB1995	Romans	2	9	There will be ( R ) tribulation and distress [ e ] for every soul of man who does evil , of the Jew ( S ) first and also of the Greek ,

NASB1995	Romans	2	11	For ( V ) there is no partiality with God .
NASB1995	Romans	2	12	For all who have sinned [ f ] ( W ) without the Law will also perish [ g ] without the Law , and all who have sinned [ h ] under the Law will be judged [ i ] by the Law ;

NASB1995	Romans	2	14	For when Gentiles who do not have [ m ] the Law do [ n ] ( Y ) instinctively the things of the Law , these , not having [ o ] the Law , are a law to themselves ,

NASB1995	Romans	2	22	You who say that one should not commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you ( AG ) rob temples ?
NASB1995	Romans	2	23	You who ( AH ) boast [ u ] in the Law , through your breaking the Law , do you dishonor God ?
NASB1995	Romans	2	24	For “ ( AI ) the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles ( AJ ) because of you , ” just as it is written .
NASB1995	Romans	2	25	For indeed circumcision is of value if you ( AK ) practice [ v ] the Law ; but if you are a transgressor [ w ] of the Law , ( AL ) your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
NASB1995	Romans	2	26	( AM ) So if ( AN ) the [ x ] uncircumcised man ( AO ) keeps the requirements of the Law , will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision ?
NASB1995	Romans	2	27	And ( AP ) he who is physically uncircumcised , if he keeps the Law , will he not ( AQ ) judge you who [ y ] though having the letter of the Law and circumcision are a transgressor [ z ] of the Law ?
NASB1995	Romans	2	28	For ( AR ) he is not a Jew who is one outwardly , nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh .
NASB1995	Romans	2	29	But ( AS ) he is a Jew who is one inwardly ; and ( AT ) circumcision is that which is of the heart , by the ( AU ) Spirit , not by the letter ; ( AV ) and his praise is not from men , but from God .

NASB1995	Romans	3	3	What then ? If ( C ) some [ b ] did not believe , their [ c ] unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God , will it ?
NASB1995	Romans	3	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	3	2	Great in every respect . First of all , that ( A ) they were entrusted with the ( B ) oracles of God .
NASB1995	Romans	3	4	( D ) May it never be ! Rather , let God be found true , though every man be found ( E ) a liar , as it is written ,
NASB1995	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness [ e ] ( G ) demonstrates the righteousness of God , ( H ) what shall we say ? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous , is He ? ( ( I ) I am speaking in human terms . )
NASB1995	Romans	3	6	( J ) May it never be ! For otherwise , how will ( K ) God judge the world ?
NASB1995	Romans	3	7	But if through my lie ( L ) the truth of God abounded to His glory , ( M ) why am I also still being judged as a sinner ?
NASB1995	Romans	3	8	And why not say ( as we are slanderously reported and as some claim that we say ) , “ ( N ) Let us do evil that good may come ” ? [ f ] Their condemnation is just .
NASB1995	Romans	3	9	What then ? [ g ] ( O ) Are we better than they ? Not at all ; for we have already charged that both ( P ) Jews and ( Q ) Greeks are ( R ) all under sin ;
NASB1995	Romans	3	10	as it is written , “ ( S ) There is none righteous , not even one ;
NASB1995	Romans	3	11	There is none who understands , There is none who seeks for God ;
NASB1995	Romans	3	12	All have turned aside , together they have become useless ; There is none who does good , There is not even one. ”
NASB1995	Romans	3	13	“ ( T ) Their throat is an open grave , With their tongues they keep deceiving , ” “ ( U ) The poison of asps is under their lips ” ;
NASB1995	Romans	3	14	“ ( V ) Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness ” ;
NASB1995	Romans	3	15	“ ( W ) Their feet are swift to shed blood ,
NASB1995	Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their paths ,
NASB1995	Romans	3	17	And the path of peace they have not known. ”
NASB1995	Romans	3	18	“ ( X ) There is no fear of God before their eyes. ”
NASB1995	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever the ( Y ) Law says , it speaks to ( Z ) those who are [ h ] under the Law , so that every mouth may be closed and ( AA ) all the world may become accountable to God ;
NASB1995	Romans	3	20	because ( AB ) by the works [ i ] of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight ; for [ j ] ( AC ) through the Law comes the knowledge of sin . Justification by Faith
NASB1995	Romans	3	21	But now apart [ k ] from the Law ( AD ) the righteousness of God has been manifested , being ( AE ) witnessed by the Law and the Prophets ,
NASB1995	Romans	3	22	even the ( AF ) righteousness of God through ( AG ) faith ( AH ) in Jesus Christ for ( AI ) all those [ l ] who believe ; for ( AJ ) there is no distinction ;
NASB1995	Romans	3	23	for all [ m ] ( AK ) have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
NASB1995	Romans	3	24	being justified as a gift ( AL ) by His grace through ( AM ) the redemption which is in Christ Jesus ;
NASB1995	Romans	3	25	whom God displayed publicly as ( AN ) a [ n ] propitiation [ o ] ( AO ) in His blood through faith . This was to demonstrate His righteousness , [ p ] because in the ( AP ) forbearance of God He ( AQ ) passed over the sins previously committed ;
NASB1995	Romans	3	26	for the demonstration , I say , of His righteousness at the present time , so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who [ q ] has faith in Jesus .
NASB1995	Romans	3	27	Where then is ( AR ) boasting ? It is excluded . By ( AS ) what kind of law ? Of works ? No , but by a law of faith .
NASB1995	Romans	3	28	[ r ] For ( AT ) we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works [ s ] of the Law .
NASB1995	Romans	3	29	Or ( AU ) is God the God of Jews only ? Is He not the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , of Gentiles also ,
NASB1995	Romans	3	30	since indeed ( AV ) God ( AW ) who will justify the [ t ] circumcised [ u ] by faith and the [ v ] uncircumcised through faith ( AX ) is one .

NASB1995	Romans	4	4	Now to the one who ( D ) works , his wage is not credited as a favor , but as what is due .
NASB1995	Romans	4	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified [ b ] by works , he has something to boast about , but ( B ) not [ c ] before God .
NASB1995	Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say ? “ ( C ) Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness. ”
NASB1995	Romans	4	5	But to the one who does not work , but ( E ) believes in Him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is credited as righteousness ,
NASB1995	Romans	4	6	just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
NASB1995	Romans	4	7	“ ( F ) Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven , And whose sins have been covered .
NASB1995	Romans	4	8	“ ( G ) Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not ( H ) take into account. ”
NASB1995	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing then on [ d ] ( I ) the circumcised , or on [ e ] the uncircumcised also ? For ( J ) we say , “ ( K ) Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness. ”
NASB1995	Romans	4	10	How then was it credited ? While he was [ f ] circumcised , or [ g ] uncircumcised ? Not while [ h ] circumcised , but while [ i ] uncircumcised ;
NASB1995	Romans	4	11	and he ( L ) received the sign of circumcision , ( M ) a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [ j ] he had while uncircumcised , so that he might be ( N ) the father of ( O ) all who believe without being circumcised , that righteousness might be credited to them ,
NASB1995	Romans	4	12	and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which [ k ] he had while uncircumcised .
NASB1995	Romans	4	13	For ( P ) the promise to Abraham or to his [ l ] descendants ( Q ) that he would be heir of the world was not [ m ] through the Law , but through the righteousness of faith .
NASB1995	Romans	4	14	For ( R ) if those who are [ n ] of the Law are heirs , faith is made void and the promise is nullified ;
NASB1995	Romans	4	15	for ( S ) the Law brings about wrath , but ( T ) where there is no law , there also is no violation .
NASB1995	Romans	4	16	For this reason it is [ o ] by faith , in order that it may be in accordance with ( U ) grace , so that the promise will be guaranteed to ( V ) all the [ p ] descendants , not only to [ q ] those who are of the Law , but also to [ r ] ( W ) those who are of the faith of Abraham , who is ( X ) the father of us all ,
NASB1995	Romans	4	17	( as it is written , “ ( Y ) A father of many nations have I made you ” ) in the presence of Him whom he believed , even God , ( Z ) who gives life to the dead and [ s ] ( AA ) calls into being ( AB ) that which does not exist .
NASB1995	Romans	4	18	In hope against hope he believed , so that he might become ( AC ) a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken , “ ( AD ) So shall your [ t ] descendants be. ”
NASB1995	Romans	4	19	Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body , now ( AE ) as good as dead since ( AF ) he was about a hundred years old , and ( AG ) the deadness of Sarah ’ s womb ;
NASB1995	Romans	4	20	yet , with respect to the promise of God , he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith , ( AH ) giving glory to God ,
NASB1995	Romans	4	21	and ( AI ) being fully assured that ( AJ ) what God had promised , He was able also to perform .
NASB1995	Romans	4	22	Therefore ( AK ) it was also credited to him as righteousness .
NASB1995	Romans	4	23	Now ( AL ) not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him ,
NASB1995	Romans	4	24	but for our sake also , to whom it will be credited , as those ( AM ) who believe in Him who ( AN ) raised Jesus our Lord from the dead ,
NASB1995	Romans	4	25	He who was ( AO ) delivered over because of our transgressions , and was ( AP ) raised because of our justification .

NASB1995	Romans	5	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	5	2	through whom also we have ( C ) obtained our introduction by faith into this grace ( D ) in which we stand ; and [ b ] we exult in hope of the glory of God .
NASB1995	Romans	5	3	( E ) And not only this , but [ c ] we also ( F ) exult in our tribulations , knowing that tribulation brings about ( G ) perseverance ;
NASB1995	Romans	5	4	and ( H ) perseverance , ( I ) proven character ; and proven character , hope ;
NASB1995	Romans	5	6	For while we were still ( L ) helpless , ( M ) at the right time ( N ) Christ died for the ungodly .
NASB1995	Romans	5	7	For one will hardly die for a righteous man ; [ d ] though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die .
NASB1995	Romans	5	8	But God ( O ) demonstrates ( P ) His own love toward us , in that while we were yet sinners , ( Q ) Christ died for us .
NASB1995	Romans	5	9	Much more then , having now been justified [ e ] ( R ) by His blood , we shall be saved ( S ) from the wrath of God through Him .
NASB1995	Romans	5	10	For if while we were ( T ) enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son , much more , having been reconciled , we shall be saved [ f ] ( U ) by His life .
NASB1995	Romans	5	11	( V ) And not only this , [ g ] but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received ( W ) the reconciliation .
NASB1995	Romans	5	12	Therefore , just as through ( X ) one man sin entered into the world , and ( Y ) death through sin , and ( Z ) so death spread to all men , because all sinned—
NASB1995	Romans	5	13	for [ h ] until the Law sin was in the world , but ( AA ) sin is not imputed when there is no law .
NASB1995	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses , even over those who had not sinned ( AB ) in the likeness of the offense of Adam , who is a [ i ] ( AC ) type of Him who was to come .
NASB1995	Romans	5	15	But [ j ] the free gift is not like the transgression . For if by the transgression of ( AD ) the one ( AE ) the many died , much more did the grace of God and the gift by ( AF ) the grace of the one Man , Jesus Christ , abound to the many .
NASB1995	Romans	5	16	The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned ; for on the one hand ( AG ) the judgment arose from one transgression [ k ] resulting in condemnation , but on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions [ l ] resulting in justification .
NASB1995	Romans	5	17	For if by the transgression of the one , death reigned ( AH ) through the one , much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will ( AI ) reign in life through the One , Jesus Christ .
NASB1995	Romans	5	18	So then as through ( AJ ) one transgression [ m ] there resulted condemnation to all men , even so through one ( AK ) act of righteousness [ n ] there resulted ( AL ) justification of life to all men .
NASB1995	Romans	5	19	For as through the one man ’ s disobedience ( AM ) the many ( AN ) were made sinners , even so through ( AO ) the obedience of the One ( AP ) the many will be made righteous .
NASB1995	Romans	5	20	[ o ] ( AQ ) The Law came in so that the transgression would increase ; but where sin increased , ( AR ) grace abounded all the more ,
NASB1995	Romans	5	21	so that , as ( AS ) sin reigned in death , even so ( AT ) grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .

NASB1995	Romans	6	3	Or do you not know that all of us who have been ( E ) baptized into ( F ) Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death ?
NASB1995	Romans	6	4	Therefore we have been ( G ) buried with Him through baptism into death , so that as Christ was ( H ) raised from the dead through the ( I ) glory of the Father , so we too might walk in ( J ) newness of life .
NASB1995	Romans	6	5	For ( K ) if we have become [ a ] united with Him in the likeness of His death , certainly we shall also be [ b ] in the likeness of His resurrection ,
NASB1995	Romans	6	7	for ( O ) he who has died is [ e ] freed from sin .
NASB1995	Romans	6	8	Now ( P ) if we have died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with Him ,
NASB1995	Romans	6	9	knowing that Christ , having been ( Q ) raised from the dead , [ f ] is never to die again ; ( R ) death no longer is master over Him .
NASB1995	Romans	6	10	For the death that He died , He died to sin once for all ; but the life that He lives , He lives to God .
NASB1995	Romans	6	11	Even so consider yourselves to be ( S ) dead to sin , but alive to God in Christ Jesus .
NASB1995	Romans	6	12	Therefore do not let sin ( T ) reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts ,
NASB1995	Romans	6	13	and do not go on ( U ) presenting [ g ] the members of your body to sin as [ h ] instruments of unrighteousness ; but ( V ) present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead , and your members as [ i ] instruments of righteousness to God .
NASB1995	Romans	6	14	For ( W ) sin shall not ( X ) be master over you , for ( Y ) you are not under law but ( Z ) under grace .
NASB1995	Romans	6	15	What then ? ( AA ) Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace ? ( AB ) May it never be !
NASB1995	Romans	6	16	Do you not ( AC ) know that when you present yourselves to someone as ( AD ) slaves for obedience , you are slaves of the one whom you obey , either of ( AE ) sin [ j ] resulting in death , or of obedience [ k ] resulting in righteousness ?
NASB1995	Romans	6	17	But ( AF ) thanks be to God that [ l ] though you were slaves of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that ( AG ) form of teaching to which you were committed ,
NASB1995	Romans	6	18	and having been ( AH ) freed from sin , you became slaves of righteousness .
NASB1995	Romans	6	19	( AI ) I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh . For just ( AJ ) as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness , [ m ] resulting in further lawlessness , so now present your members as slaves to righteousness , [ n ] resulting in sanctification .
NASB1995	Romans	6	20	For ( AK ) when you were slaves of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
NASB1995	Romans	6	21	Therefore what [ o ] ( AL ) benefit were you then [ p ] deriving [ q ] from the things of which you are now ashamed ? For the outcome of those things is ( AM ) death .
NASB1995	Romans	6	22	But now having been ( AN ) freed from sin and ( AO ) enslaved to God , you [ r ] derive your [ s ] ( AP ) benefit , [ t ] resulting in sanctification , and ( AQ ) the outcome , eternal life .

NASB1995	Romans	7	7	( M ) What shall we say then ? Is the Law sin ? ( N ) May it never be ! On the contrary , ( O ) I would not have come to know sin except [ e ] through the Law ; for I would not have known about [ f ] coveting if the Law had not said , “ ( P ) You shall not [ g ] covet. ”
NASB1995	Romans	7	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	7	2	For ( B ) the married woman is bound by law to her [ a ] husband while he is living ; but if her husband dies , she is released from the law [ b ] concerning the husband .
NASB1995	Romans	7	3	So then , if while her husband is living she is joined to another man , she shall be called an adulteress ; but if her husband dies , she is free from the law , so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man .
NASB1995	Romans	7	4	Therefore , my brethren , you also were ( C ) made to die ( D ) to the Law ( E ) through the body of Christ , so that you might be joined to another , to Him who was raised from the dead , in order that we might bear fruit for God .
NASB1995	Romans	7	5	For while we were ( F ) in the flesh , the sinful passions , which were ( G ) aroused by the Law , were at work ( H ) in [ c ] the members of our body to bear fruit for death .
NASB1995	Romans	7	6	But now we have been ( I ) released from the Law , having ( J ) died to that by which we were bound , so that we serve in ( K ) newness of ( L ) the [ d ] Spirit and not in oldness of the letter .
NASB1995	Romans	7	8	But sin , ( Q ) taking opportunity ( R ) through the commandment , produced in me [ h ] coveting of every kind ; for ( S ) apart [ i ] from the Law sin is dead .
NASB1995	Romans	7	9	I was once alive apart [ j ] from the Law ; but when the commandment came , sin became alive and I died ;
NASB1995	Romans	7	10	and this commandment , which was [ k ] ( T ) to result in life , proved [ l ] to result in death for me ;
NASB1995	Romans	7	11	for sin , ( U ) taking an opportunity ( V ) through the commandment , ( W ) deceived me and through it killed me .
NASB1995	Romans	7	12	( X ) So then , the Law is holy , and the commandment is holy and righteous and good .
NASB1995	Romans	7	13	Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me ? ( Y ) May it never be ! Rather it was sin , in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good , so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful . The Conflict of Two Natures
NASB1995	Romans	7	14	For we know that the Law is ( Z ) spiritual , but I am ( AA ) of flesh , ( AB ) sold [ m ] ( AC ) into bondage to sin .
NASB1995	Romans	7	15	For what I am doing , ( AD ) I do not understand ; for I am not practicing ( AE ) what I would like to do , but I am doing the very thing I hate .
NASB1995	Romans	7	16	But if I do the very thing I do not want to do , I agree with ( AF ) the Law , confessing that the Law is good .
NASB1995	Romans	7	17	So now , ( AG ) no longer am I the one doing it , but sin which dwells in me .
NASB1995	Romans	7	18	For I know that nothing good dwells in me , that is , in my ( AH ) flesh ; for the willing is present in me , but the doing of the good is not .
NASB1995	Romans	7	19	For ( AI ) the good that I want , I do not do , but I practice the very evil that I do not want .
NASB1995	Romans	7	20	But if I am doing the very thing I do not want , ( AJ ) I am no longer the one doing it , but sin which dwells in me .
NASB1995	Romans	7	21	I find then ( AK ) the [ n ] principle that evil is present in me , the one who wants to do good .
NASB1995	Romans	7	22	For I joyfully concur with the law of God [ o ] in ( AL ) the inner man ,
NASB1995	Romans	7	23	but I see ( AM ) a different law in [ p ] the members of my body , waging war against the ( AN ) law of my mind and making me a prisoner [ q ] of ( AO ) the law of sin which is in my members .
NASB1995	Romans	7	24	Wretched man that I am ! Who will set me free from [ r ] ( AP ) the body of this ( AQ ) death ?
NASB1995	Romans	7	25	( AR ) Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord !

NASB1995	Romans	7	1971	,
NASB1995	Romans	7	1977	,
NASB1995	Romans	8	8	and those who are ( Q ) in the flesh can not please God .
NASB1995	Romans	8	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	8	2	For ( D ) the law of the Spirit of life [ a ] in ( E ) Christ Jesus ( F ) has set you free from the law of sin and of death .
NASB1995	Romans	8	3	For ( G ) what the Law could not do , [ b ] ( H ) weak as it was through the flesh , God did : sending His own Son in ( I ) the likeness of [ c ] sinful flesh and as an offering for sin , He condemned sin in the flesh ,
NASB1995	Romans	8	4	so that the ( J ) requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us , who ( K ) do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
NASB1995	Romans	8	5	For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on ( L ) the things of the flesh , but those who are according to the Spirit , ( M ) the things of the Spirit .
NASB1995	Romans	8	6	( N ) For the mind set on the flesh is ( O ) death , but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace ,
NASB1995	Romans	8	7	because the mind set on the flesh is ( P ) hostile toward God ; for it does not subject itself to the law of God , for it is not even able to do so ,
NASB1995	Romans	8	9	However , you are not ( R ) in the flesh but in the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of God ( S ) dwells in you . But ( T ) if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , he does not belong to Him .
NASB1995	Romans	8	10	( U ) If Christ is in you , though the body is dead because of sin , yet the spirit is [ d ] alive because of righteousness .
NASB1995	Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of Him who ( V ) raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you , ( W ) He who raised ( X ) Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies [ e ] through His Spirit who dwells in you .
NASB1995	Romans	8	12	So then , brethren , we are under obligation , not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh—
NASB1995	Romans	8	13	for ( Y ) if you are living according to the flesh , you [ f ] must die ; but if by the Spirit you are ( Z ) putting to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
NASB1995	Romans	8	14	For all who are ( AA ) being led by the Spirit of God , these are ( AB ) sons of God .
NASB1995	Romans	8	15	For you ( AC ) have not received a spirit of slavery [ g ] leading to fear again , but you ( AD ) have received [ h ] a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out , “ ( AE ) Abba ! Father ! ”
NASB1995	Romans	8	16	The Spirit Himself ( AF ) testifies with our spirit that we are ( AG ) children of God ,
NASB1995	Romans	8	17	and if children , ( AH ) heirs also , heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ , ( AI ) if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him .
NASB1995	Romans	8	18	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time ( AJ ) are not worthy to be compared with the ( AK ) glory that is to be revealed to us .
NASB1995	Romans	8	19	For the ( AL ) anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for ( AM ) the revealing of the ( AN ) sons of God .
NASB1995	Romans	8	20	For the creation ( AO ) was subjected to ( AP ) futility , not willingly , but ( AQ ) because of Him who subjected it , [ i ] in hope
NASB1995	Romans	8	21	that ( AR ) the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God .
NASB1995	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation ( AS ) groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now .
NASB1995	Romans	8	23	( AT ) And not only this , but also we ourselves , having ( AU ) the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves ( AV ) groan within ourselves , ( AW ) waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons , ( AX ) the redemption of our body .
NASB1995	Romans	8	24	For ( AY ) in hope we have been saved , but ( AZ ) hope that is seen is not hope ; for who hopes for what he already sees ?
NASB1995	Romans	8	25	But ( BA ) if we hope for what we do not see , with perseverance we wait eagerly for it . Our Victory in Christ
NASB1995	Romans	8	26	In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness ; for ( BB ) we do not know how to pray as we should , but ( BC ) the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words ;
NASB1995	Romans	8	27	and ( BD ) He who searches the hearts knows what ( BE ) the mind of the Spirit is , because He ( BF ) intercedes for the [ j ] saints according to the will of God .
NASB1995	Romans	8	28	And we know that [ k ] God causes ( BG ) all things to work together for good to those who love God , to those who are ( BH ) called according to His purpose .
NASB1995	Romans	8	29	For those whom He ( BI ) foreknew , He also ( BJ ) predestined to become ( BK ) conformed to the image of His Son , so that He would be the ( BL ) firstborn among many brethren ;
NASB1995	Romans	8	30	and these whom He ( BM ) predestined , He also ( BN ) called ; and these whom He called , He also ( BO ) justified ; and these whom He justified , He also ( BP ) glorified .
NASB1995	Romans	8	31	( BQ ) What then shall we say to these things ? ( BR ) If God is for us , who is against us ?
NASB1995	Romans	8	32	He who ( BS ) did not spare His own Son , but ( BT ) delivered Him over for us all , how will He not also with Him freely give us all things ?
NASB1995	Romans	8	33	Who will bring a charge against ( BU ) God ’ s elect ? ( BV ) God is the one who justifies ;
NASB1995	Romans	8	34	who is the one who ( BW ) condemns ? Christ Jesus is He who ( BX ) died , yes , rather who was [ l ] ( BY ) raised , who is ( BZ ) at the right hand of God , who also ( CA ) intercedes for us .
NASB1995	Romans	8	35	Who will separate us from ( CB ) the love of [ m ] Christ ? Will ( CC ) tribulation , or distress , or ( CD ) persecution , or ( CE ) famine , or ( CF ) nakedness , or ( CG ) peril , or sword ?
NASB1995	Romans	8	36	Just as it is written , “ ( CH ) For Your sake we are being put to death all day long ; We were considered as sheep to be slaughtered. ”
NASB1995	Romans	8	37	But in all these things we overwhelmingly ( CI ) conquer through ( CJ ) Him who loved us .
NASB1995	Romans	8	38	For I am convinced that neither ( CK ) death , nor life , nor ( CL ) angels , nor principalities , nor ( CM ) things present , nor things to come , nor powers ,
NASB1995	Romans	8	39	nor height , nor depth , nor any other created thing , will be able to separate us from ( CN ) the love of God , which is ( CO ) in Christ Jesus our Lord .

NASB1995	Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise : “ ( W ) At this time I will come , and Sarah shall have a son. ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	9	2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart .
NASB1995	Romans	9	3	For ( B ) I could [ a ] wish that I myself were ( C ) accursed , separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren , my kinsmen ( D ) according to the flesh ,
NASB1995	Romans	9	4	who are ( E ) Israelites , to whom belongs ( F ) the adoption as sons , and ( G ) the glory and ( H ) the covenants and ( I ) the giving of the Law and ( J ) the temple service and ( K ) the promises ,
NASB1995	Romans	9	5	whose are ( L ) the fathers , and ( M ) from whom is [ b ] the Christ according to the flesh , ( N ) who is over all , ( O ) God ( P ) blessed [ c ] forever . Amen .
NASB1995	Romans	9	6	But it is not as though ( Q ) the word of God has failed . ( R ) For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel ;
NASB1995	Romans	9	7	nor are they all children ( S ) because they are Abraham ’ s [ d ] descendants , but : “ [ e ] ( T ) through Isaac your [ f ] descendants will be named. ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	8	That is , it is not the children of the flesh who are ( U ) children of God , but the ( V ) children of the promise are regarded as [ g ] descendants .
NASB1995	Romans	9	10	( X ) And not only this , but there was ( Y ) Rebekah also , when she had conceived twins by one man , our father Isaac ;
NASB1995	Romans	9	11	for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad , so that ( Z ) God ’ s purpose according to His choice would [ h ] stand , not [ i ] because of works but [ j ] because of Him who calls ,
NASB1995	Romans	9	12	it was said to her , “ ( AA ) The older will serve the younger. ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	13	Just as it is written , “ ( AB ) Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated. ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	14	( AC ) What shall we say then ? ( AD ) There is no injustice with God , is there ? ( AE ) May it never be !
NASB1995	Romans	9	15	For He says to Moses , “ ( AF ) I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	16	So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who ( AG ) runs , but on ( AH ) God who has mercy .
NASB1995	Romans	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , “ ( AI ) For this very purpose I raised you up , to demonstrate My power in you , and that My name might be proclaimed [ k ] throughout the whole earth. ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	18	So then He has mercy on whom He desires , and He ( AJ ) hardens whom He desires .
NASB1995	Romans	9	19	( AK ) You will say to me then , “ ( AL ) Why does He still find fault ? For ( AM ) who resists His will ? ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	20	On the contrary , who are you , ( AN ) O man , who ( AO ) answers back to God ? ( AP ) The thing molded will not say to the molder , “ Why did you make me like this , ” will it ?
NASB1995	Romans	9	21	Or does not the potter have a right over the clay , to make from the same lump one vessel [ l ] for honorable use and another [ m ] for common use ?
NASB1995	Romans	9	22	[ n ] What if God , although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known , endured with much ( AQ ) patience vessels of wrath ( AR ) prepared for destruction ?
NASB1995	Romans	9	23	And He did so to make known ( AS ) the riches of His glory upon ( AT ) vessels of mercy , which He ( AU ) prepared beforehand for glory ,
NASB1995	Romans	9	24	even us , whom He also ( AV ) called , ( AW ) not from among Jews only , but also from among Gentiles .
NASB1995	Romans	9	25	As He says also in Hosea , “ ( AX ) I will call those who were not My people , ‘ My people , ’ And her who was not beloved , ‘ beloved. ’ ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	26	“ ( AY ) And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them , ‘ you are not My people , ’ There they shall be called sons of ( AZ ) the living God. ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	27	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel , “ ( BA ) Though the number of the sons of Israel be ( BB ) like the sand of the sea , it is ( BC ) the remnant that will be saved ;
NASB1995	Romans	9	28	( BD ) for the Lord will execute His word on the earth , [ o ] thoroughly and [ p ] quickly. ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	29	And just as Isaiah foretold , “ ( BE ) Unless ( BF ) the Lord of [ q ] Sabaoth had left to us a [ r ] posterity , ( BG ) We would have become like Sodom , and would have [ s ] resembled Gomorrah. ”
NASB1995	Romans	9	30	( BH ) What shall we say then ? That Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness , attained righteousness , even ( BI ) the righteousness which is [ t ] by faith ;
NASB1995	Romans	9	31	but Israel , ( BJ ) pursuing a law of righteousness , did not ( BK ) arrive at that law .
NASB1995	Romans	9	32	Why ? Because they did not pursue it [ u ] by faith , but as though it were [ v ] by works . They stumbled over ( BL ) the stumbling stone ,
NASB1995	Romans	9	33	just as it is written , “ ( BM ) Behold , I lay in Zion ( BN ) a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense , ( BO ) And he who believes in Him ( BP ) will not be [ w ] disappointed. ” Footnotes - Romans 9:3 Lit pray - Romans 9:5 I.e . the Messiah - Romans 9:5 Lit unto the ages - Romans 9:7 Lit seed - Romans 9:7 Lit in - Romans 9:7 Lit seed - Romans 9:8 Lit seed - Romans 9:11 Lit remain - Romans 9:11 Lit from - Romans 9:11 Lit from - Romans 9:17 Lit in - Romans 9:21 Lit for honor - Romans 9:21 Lit for dishonor - Romans 9:22 Lit But - Romans 9:28 Lit finishing it - Romans 9:28 Lit cutting it short - Romans 9:29 I.e .

NASB1995	Romans	9	1977	,
NASB1995	Romans	10	10	for with the heart a person believes , [ f ] resulting in righteousness , and with the mouth he confesses , [ g ] resulting in salvation .
NASB1995	Romans	10	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	10	2	For I testify about them that they have ( A ) a zeal for God , but not in accordance with knowledge .
NASB1995	Romans	10	3	For not knowing about ( B ) God ’ s righteousness and ( C ) seeking to establish their own , they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
NASB1995	Romans	10	4	For ( D ) Christ is the [ a ] end of the law for righteousness to ( E ) everyone who believes .
NASB1995	Romans	10	5	For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is [ b ] based on law ( F ) shall live [ c ] by that righteousness .
NASB1995	Romans	10	6	But ( G ) the righteousness [ d ] based on faith speaks as follows : “ ( H ) Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will ascend into heaven ? ’ ( that is , to bring Christ down ) ,
NASB1995	Romans	10	7	or ‘ Who will descend into the ( I ) abyss ? ’ ( that is , to ( J ) bring Christ up from the dead ) . ”
NASB1995	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? “ ( K ) The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” —that is , the word of faith which we are preaching ,
NASB1995	Romans	10	9	[ e ] that ( L ) if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord , and ( M ) believe in your heart that ( N ) God raised Him from the dead , you will be saved ;
NASB1995	Romans	10	11	For the Scripture says , “ ( O ) Whoever believes in Him will not be [ h ] disappointed. ”
NASB1995	Romans	10	12	For ( P ) there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is ( Q ) Lord of ( R ) all , abounding in riches for all who call on Him ;
NASB1995	Romans	10	13	for “ ( S ) Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved. ”
NASB1995	Romans	10	14	How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed ? How will they believe in Him ( T ) whom they have not heard ? And how will they hear without ( U ) a preacher ?
NASB1995	Romans	10	15	How will they preach unless they are sent ? Just as it is written , “ ( V ) How beautiful are the feet of those who [ i ] ( W ) bring good news of good things ! ”
NASB1995	Romans	10	16	However , they ( X ) did not all heed the [ j ] good news ; for Isaiah says , “ ( Y ) Lord , who has believed our report ? ”
NASB1995	Romans	10	17	So faith comes from ( Z ) hearing , and hearing by ( AA ) the word [ k ] of Christ .
NASB1995	Romans	10	18	But I say , surely they have never heard , have they ? Indeed they have ;
NASB1995	Romans	10	19	But I say , surely Israel did not know , did they ? First Moses says , “ ( AC ) I will ( AD ) make you jealous by that which is not a nation , By a nation without understanding will I anger you. ”
NASB1995	Romans	10	20	And Isaiah is very bold and says , “ ( AE ) I was found by those who did not seek Me , I became manifest to those who did not ask for Me. ”
NASB1995	Romans	10	21	But as for Israel He says , “ ( AF ) All the day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and obstinate people. ” Footnotes - Romans 10:4 Or goal - Romans 10:5 Lit out of , from - Romans 10:5 Lit by it - Romans 10:6 Lit out of , from - Romans 10:9 Or because - Romans 10:10 Lit to righteousness - Romans 10:10 Lit to salvation - Romans 10:11 Lit put to shame - Romans 10:15 Or preach the gospel - Romans 10:16 Or gospel - Romans 10:17 Or concerning Christ - Romans 10:18 Or inhabited earth New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB1995	Romans	11	11	( P ) I say then , they did not stumble so as to fall , did they ? ( Q ) May it never be ! But by their transgression ( R ) salvation has come to the Gentiles , to ( S ) make them jealous .
NASB1995	Romans	11	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	11	2	God ( D ) has not rejected His people whom He ( E ) foreknew . ( F ) Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah , how he pleads with God against Israel ?
NASB1995	Romans	11	3	“ Lord , ( G ) they have killed Your prophets , they have torn down Your altars , and I alone am left , and they are seeking my life. ”
NASB1995	Romans	11	4	But what [ b ] is the divine response to him ? “ ( H ) I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. ”
NASB1995	Romans	11	5	In the same way then , there has also come to be at the present time ( I ) a remnant according to God ’ s [ c ] gracious choice .
NASB1995	Romans	11	6	But ( J ) if it is by grace , it is no longer [ d ] on the basis of works , otherwise grace is no longer grace .
NASB1995	Romans	11	7	What then ? What ( K ) Israel is seeking , it has not obtained , but [ e ] those who were chosen obtained it , and the rest were ( L ) hardened ;
NASB1995	Romans	11	8	just as it is written , “ ( M ) God gave them a spirit of stupor , Eyes to see not and ears to hear not , Down to this very day. ”
NASB1995	Romans	11	9	And David says , “ ( N ) Let their table become a snare and a trap , And a stumbling block and a retribution to them .
NASB1995	Romans	11	10	“ ( O ) Let their eyes be darkened to see not , And bend their backs forever. ”
NASB1995	Romans	11	12	Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles , how much more will their [ f ] ( T ) fulfillment be !
NASB1995	Romans	11	13	But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles . Inasmuch then as ( U ) I am an apostle of Gentiles , I magnify my ministry ,
NASB1995	Romans	11	14	if somehow I might ( V ) move to jealousy ( W ) my [ g ] fellow countrymen and ( X ) save some of them .
NASB1995	Romans	11	15	For if their rejection is the ( Y ) reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance be but ( Z ) life from the dead ?
NASB1995	Romans	11	16	If the ( AA ) first piece of dough is holy , the lump is also ; and if the root is holy , the branches are too .
NASB1995	Romans	11	17	But if some of the ( AB ) branches were broken off , and ( AC ) you , being a wild olive , were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the [ h ] rich root of the olive tree ,
NASB1995	Romans	11	18	do not be arrogant toward the branches ; but if you are arrogant , remember that ( AD ) it is not you who supports the root , but the root supports you .
NASB1995	Romans	11	19	( AE ) You will say then , “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. ”
NASB1995	Romans	11	20	Quite right , they were broken off for their unbelief , but you ( AF ) stand by your faith . ( AG ) Do not be conceited , but fear ;
NASB1995	Romans	11	21	for if God did not spare the natural branches , He will not spare you , either .
NASB1995	Romans	11	22	Behold then the kindness and severity of God ; to those who fell , severity , but to you , God ’ s ( AH ) kindness , ( AI ) if you continue in His kindness ; otherwise you also ( AJ ) will be cut off .
NASB1995	Romans	11	23	And they also , ( AK ) if they do not continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
NASB1995	Romans	11	24	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree ?
NASB1995	Romans	11	25	For ( AL ) I do not want you , brethren , to be uninformed of this ( AM ) mystery—so that you will not be ( AN ) wise in your own estimation—that a partial ( AO ) hardening has happened to Israel until the ( AP ) fullness of the Gentiles has come in ;
NASB1995	Romans	11	26	and so all Israel will be saved ; just as it is written , “ ( AQ ) The Deliverer will come from Zion , He will remove ungodliness from Jacob. ”
NASB1995	Romans	11	27	“ ( AR ) This is [ i ] My covenant with them , ( AS ) When I take away their sins. ”
NASB1995	Romans	11	28	[ j ] From the standpoint of the gospel they are ( AT ) enemies for your sake , but [ k ] from the standpoint of God ’ s choice they are beloved for ( AU ) the sake of the fathers ;
NASB1995	Romans	11	29	for the gifts and the ( AV ) calling of God ( AW ) are irrevocable .
NASB1995	Romans	11	30	For just as you once were disobedient to God , but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience ,
NASB1995	Romans	11	31	so these also now have been disobedient , that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy .
NASB1995	Romans	11	32	For ( AX ) God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all .
NASB1995	Romans	11	33	Oh , the depth of ( AY ) the riches [ l ] both of the ( AZ ) wisdom and knowledge of God ! ( BA ) How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways !
NASB1995	Romans	11	34	For ( BB ) who has known the mind of the Lord , or who became His counselor ?
NASB1995	Romans	11	35	Or ( BC ) who has first given to Him [ m ] that it might be paid back to him again ?
NASB1995	Romans	11	36	For ( BD ) from Him and through Him and to Him are all things . ( BE ) To Him be the glory [ n ] forever . Amen .

NASB1995	Romans	12	3	For through ( G ) the grace given to me I say to everyone among you ( H ) not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think ; but to think so as to have sound judgment , as God has allotted to ( I ) each a measure of faith .
NASB1995	Romans	12	4	For ( J ) just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function ,
NASB1995	Romans	12	5	so we , ( K ) who are many , are ( L ) one body in Christ , and individually members one of another .
NASB1995	Romans	12	6	Since we have gifts that ( M ) differ according to the grace given to us , each of us is to exercise them accordingly : if ( N ) prophecy , [ f ] according to the proportion of his faith ;

NASB1995	Romans	13	13	Let us [ h ] ( T ) behave properly as in the day , ( U ) not in carousing and drunkenness , not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality , not in strife and jealousy .
NASB1995	Romans	13	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	13	2	Therefore [ c ] whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God ; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves .
NASB1995	Romans	13	3	For ( D ) rulers are not a cause of fear for [ d ] good behavior , but for evil . Do you want to have no fear of authority ? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same ;
NASB1995	Romans	13	4	for it is a minister of God to you for good . But if you do what is evil , be afraid ; for it does not bear the sword for nothing ; for it is a minister of God , an ( E ) avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil .
NASB1995	Romans	13	5	Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection , not only because of wrath , but also ( F ) for conscience ’ sake .
NASB1995	Romans	13	6	For because of this you also pay taxes , for rulers are servants of God , devoting themselves to this very thing .
NASB1995	Romans	13	7	( G ) Render to all what is due them : ( H ) tax to whom tax is due ; ( I ) custom to whom custom ; fear to whom fear ; honor to whom honor .
NASB1995	Romans	13	8	Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another ; for ( J ) he who loves [ e ] his neighbor has fulfilled the law .
NASB1995	Romans	13	9	For this , “ ( K ) You shall not commit adultery , You shall not murder , You shall not steal , You shall not covet , ” and if there is any other commandment , it is summed up in this saying , “ ( L ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”
NASB1995	Romans	13	10	Love [ f ] does no wrong to a neighbor ; therefore ( M ) love is the fulfillment of the law .
NASB1995	Romans	13	11	Do this , knowing the time , that it is ( N ) already the hour for you to ( O ) awaken from sleep ; for now [ g ] salvation is nearer to us than when we believed .
NASB1995	Romans	13	12	( P ) The night is almost gone , and ( Q ) the day is near . Therefore let us lay aside ( R ) the deeds of darkness and put on ( S ) the armor of light .
NASB1995	Romans	13	14	But ( V ) put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh ( W ) in regard to its lusts .

NASB1995	Romans	14	14	I know and am convinced [ f ] in the Lord Jesus that ( W ) nothing is unclean in itself ; but to him who ( X ) thinks anything to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
NASB1995	Romans	14	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	14	2	( C ) One person has faith that he may eat all things , but he who is ( D ) weak eats vegetables only .
NASB1995	Romans	14	3	The one who eats is not to ( E ) regard with contempt the one who does not eat , and the one who does not eat is not to ( F ) judge the one who eats , for God has ( G ) accepted him .
NASB1995	Romans	14	4	( H ) Who are you to judge the [ a ] servant of another ? To his own [ b ] master he stands or falls ; and he will stand , for the Lord is able to make him stand .
NASB1995	Romans	14	5	( I ) One person [ c ] regards one day above another , another regards every day alike . Each person must be ( J ) fully convinced in his own mind .
NASB1995	Romans	14	6	He who observes the day , observes it for the Lord , and he who eats , [ d ] does so for the Lord , for he ( K ) gives thanks to God ; and he who eats not , for the Lord he does not eat , and gives thanks to God .
NASB1995	Romans	14	7	For not one of us ( L ) lives for himself , and not one dies for himself ;
NASB1995	Romans	14	8	for if we live , we live for the Lord , or if we die , we die for the Lord ; therefore ( M ) whether we live or die , we are the Lord ’ s .
NASB1995	Romans	14	9	For to this end ( N ) Christ died and lived again , that He might be ( O ) Lord both of the dead and of the living .
NASB1995	Romans	14	10	But you , why do you judge your brother ? Or you again , why do you ( P ) regard your brother with contempt ? For ( Q ) we will all stand before the judgment seat of God .
NASB1995	Romans	14	11	For it is written , “ ( R ) As I live , says the Lord , ( S ) every knee shall bow to Me , And every tongue shall [ e ] give praise to God. ”
NASB1995	Romans	14	12	So then ( T ) each one of us will give an account of himself to God .
NASB1995	Romans	14	13	Therefore let us not ( U ) judge one another anymore , but rather determine this— ( V ) not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother ’ s way .
NASB1995	Romans	14	15	For if because of food your brother is hurt , you are no longer ( Y ) walking according to love . ( Z ) Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died .
NASB1995	Romans	14	16	Therefore ( AA ) do not let what is for you a good thing be [ g ] spoken of as evil ;
NASB1995	Romans	14	17	for the kingdom of God ( AB ) is not eating and drinking , but righteousness and ( AC ) peace and ( AD ) joy in the Holy Spirit .
NASB1995	Romans	14	18	For he who in this way ( AE ) serves Christ is ( AF ) acceptable to God and approved by men .
NASB1995	Romans	14	19	So then [ h ] we ( AG ) pursue the things which make for peace and the ( AH ) building up of one another .
NASB1995	Romans	14	20	( AI ) Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food . ( AJ ) All things indeed are clean , but ( AK ) they are evil for the man who eats [ i ] and gives offense .
NASB1995	Romans	14	21	( AL ) It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine , or to do anything by which your brother stumbles .
NASB1995	Romans	14	22	The faith which you have , have [ j ] as your own conviction before God . Happy is he who ( AM ) does not condemn himself in what he approves .
NASB1995	Romans	14	23	But ( AN ) he who doubts is condemned if he eats , because his eating is not from faith ; and whatever is not from faith is sin .

NASB1995	Romans	15	15	But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again , because of ( Y ) the grace that was given me [ f ] from God ,
NASB1995	Romans	15	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Romans	15	2	Each of us is to ( B ) please his neighbor [ a ] for his good , to his ( C ) edification .
NASB1995	Romans	15	3	For even ( D ) Christ did not please Himself ; but as it is written , “ ( E ) The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me. ”
NASB1995	Romans	15	4	For ( F ) whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction , so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope .
NASB1995	Romans	15	5	Now may the ( G ) God [ b ] who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you ( H ) to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus ,
NASB1995	Romans	15	6	so that with one accord you may with one [ c ] voice glorify ( I ) the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB1995	Romans	15	7	Therefore , ( J ) accept one another , just as Christ also accepted [ d ] us to the glory of God .
NASB1995	Romans	15	8	For I say that Christ has become a servant to ( K ) the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm ( L ) the promises given to the fathers ,
NASB1995	Romans	15	9	and for ( M ) the Gentiles to ( N ) glorify God for His mercy ; as it is written ,
NASB1995	Romans	15	10	Again he says , “ ( P ) Rejoice , O Gentiles , with His people. ”
NASB1995	Romans	15	11	And again , “ ( Q ) Praise the Lord all you Gentiles , And let all the peoples praise Him. ”
NASB1995	Romans	15	12	Again Isaiah says , “ ( R ) There shall come ( S ) the root of Jesse , And He who arises to rule over the Gentiles , ( T ) In Him shall the Gentiles hope. ”
NASB1995	Romans	15	13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all ( U ) joy and peace in believing , so that you will abound in hope ( V ) by the power of the Holy Spirit .
NASB1995	Romans	15	14	And concerning you , my brethren , I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of ( W ) goodness , filled with ( X ) all knowledge and able also to admonish one another .
NASB1995	Romans	15	16	to be ( Z ) a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles , ministering as a priest the ( AA ) gospel of God , so that my ( AB ) offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
NASB1995	Romans	15	17	Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found ( AC ) reason for boasting in ( AD ) things pertaining to God .
NASB1995	Romans	15	18	For I will not presume to speak of anything [ g ] except what ( AE ) Christ has accomplished through me , [ h ] resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed ,
NASB1995	Romans	15	19	in the power of [ i ] ( AF ) signs and wonders , ( AG ) in the power of the Spirit ; so that ( AH ) from Jerusalem and round about as ( AI ) far as Illyricum I have [ j ] fully preached the gospel of Christ .
NASB1995	Romans	15	20	And thus I aspired to ( AJ ) preach the gospel , not where Christ was already named , ( AK ) so that I would not build on another man ’ s foundation ;
NASB1995	Romans	15	21	but as it is written , “ ( AL ) They who had no news of Him shall see , And they who have not heard shall understand. ”
NASB1995	Romans	15	22	For this reason ( AM ) I have often been prevented from coming to you ;
NASB1995	Romans	15	23	but now , with no further place for me in these regions , and since I ( AN ) have had for many years a longing to come to you
NASB1995	Romans	15	24	whenever I ( AO ) go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing , and to be ( AP ) helped on my way there by you , when I have first ( AQ ) enjoyed your company [ k ] for a while—
NASB1995	Romans	15	25	, note
NASB1995	Romans	15	26	For ( AT ) Macedonia and ( AU ) Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the [ m ] saints in Jerusalem .
NASB1995	Romans	15	27	Yes , they were pleased to do so , and they are indebted to them . For ( AV ) if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things , they are indebted to minister to them also in material things .
NASB1995	Romans	15	28	Therefore , when I have finished this , and ( AW ) have [ n ] put my seal on this fruit of theirs , I will ( AX ) go on by way of you to Spain .
NASB1995	Romans	15	29	I know that when ( AY ) I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ .
NASB1995	Romans	15	30	Now I urge you , brethren , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by ( AZ ) the love of the Spirit , to ( BA ) strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
NASB1995	Romans	15	31	that I may be ( BB ) rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea , and that my ( BC ) service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the [ o ] ( BD ) saints ;
NASB1995	Romans	15	32	so that ( BE ) I may come to you in joy by ( BF ) the will of God and find refreshing rest in your company .

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To ( E ) the church of God which is at ( F ) Corinth , to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus , [ b ] saints ( G ) by calling , with all who in every place ( H ) call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , their Lord and ours :
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	3	( I ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	4	( J ) I thank [ c ] my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	5	that in everything you were ( K ) enriched in Him , in all ( L ) speech and ( M ) all knowledge ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	6	even as ( N ) the testimony concerning Christ was confirmed [ d ] in you ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that you are not lacking in any gift , ( O ) awaiting eagerly the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	8	( P ) who will also confirm you to the end , blameless in ( Q ) the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	9	( R ) God is faithful , through whom you were ( S ) called into ( T ) fellowship with His Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now ( U ) I exhort you , ( V ) brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you all [ e ] agree and that there be no [ f ] ( W ) divisions among you , but that you be [ g ] made complete in ( X ) the same mind and in the same judgment .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For I have been informed concerning you , my brethren , by Chloe ’ s people , that there are quarrels among you .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now I mean this , that ( Y ) each one of you is saying , “ I am of Paul , ” and “ I of ( Z ) Apollos , ” and “ I of ( AA ) Cephas , ” and “ I of Christ. ”
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	13	[ h ] Has Christ been divided ? Paul was not crucified for you , was he ? Or were you ( AB ) baptized [ i ] in the name of Paul ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	14	[ j ] I thank God that I ( AC ) baptized none of you except ( AD ) Crispus and ( AE ) Gaius ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	15	so that no one would say you were baptized [ k ] in my name .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	16	Now I did baptize also the ( AF ) household of Stephanas ; beyond that , I do not know whether I baptized any other .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	17	( AG ) For Christ did not send me to baptize , but to preach the gospel , ( AH ) not in [ l ] cleverness of speech , so that the cross of Christ would not be made void . The Wisdom of God
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross is ( AI ) foolishness to ( AJ ) those who [ m ] are perishing , but to us who [ n ] are being saved it is ( AK ) the power of God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written , “ ( AL ) I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , And the cleverness of the clever I will set aside. ”
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	20	( AM ) Where is the wise man ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the debater of ( AN ) this age ? Has not God ( AO ) made foolish the wisdom of ( AP ) the world ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For since in the wisdom of God ( AQ ) the world through its wisdom did not come to know God , ( AR ) God was well-pleased through the ( AS ) foolishness of the [ o ] message preached to ( AT ) save those who believe .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For indeed ( AU ) Jews ask for [ p ] signs and Greeks search for wisdom ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we preach [ q ] ( AV ) Christ crucified , ( AW ) to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles ( AX ) foolishness ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but to those who are ( AY ) the called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ ( AZ ) the power of God and ( BA ) the wisdom of God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	25	Because the ( BB ) foolishness of God is wiser than men , and ( BC ) the weakness of God is stronger than men .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For [ r ] consider your ( BD ) calling , brethren , that there were ( BE ) not many wise according to [ s ] the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	27	but ( BF ) God has chosen the foolish things of ( BG ) the world to shame the wise , and God has chosen the weak things of ( BH ) the world to shame the things which are strong ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	28	and the base things of ( BI ) the world and the despised God has chosen , ( BJ ) the things that are not , so that He may ( BK ) nullify the things that are ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	29	so that ( BL ) no [ t ] man may boast before God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But [ u ] by His doing you are in ( BM ) Christ Jesus , who became to us ( BN ) wisdom from God , [ v ] and ( BO ) righteousness and ( BP ) sanctification , and ( BQ ) redemption ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	1	31	so that , just as it is written , “ ( BR ) Let him who boasts , boast in the Lord. ” Footnotes -

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	5	so that your faith would not [ c ] rest on the wisdom of men , but on ( H ) the power of God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are ( I ) mature ; a wisdom , however , not of ( J ) this age nor of the rulers of ( K ) this age , who are ( L ) passing away ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	7	but we speak God ’ s wisdom in a ( M ) mystery , the hidden wisdom which God ( N ) predestined before the ( O ) ages to our glory ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	8	the wisdom ( P ) which none of the rulers of ( Q ) this age has understood ; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified ( R ) the Lord of glory ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	9	but just as it is written , “ ( S ) Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard , And which have not entered the heart of man , All that God has prepared for those who love Him. ”
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	10	[ d ] ( T ) For to us God revealed them ( U ) through the Spirit ; for the Spirit searches all things , even the ( V ) depths of God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the ( W ) spirit of the man which is in him ? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we ( X ) have received , not the spirit of ( Y ) the world , but the Spirit who is from God , so that we may know the things freely given to us by God ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	13	which things we also speak , ( Z ) not in words taught by human wisdom , but in those taught by the Spirit , [ e ] combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But [ f ] a ( AA ) natural man ( AB ) does not accept the things of the Spirit of God , for they are ( AC ) foolishness to him ; and he can not understand them , because they are spiritually [ g ] appraised .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But he who is ( AD ) spiritual appraises all things , yet he himself is appraised by no one .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	2	16	For ( AE ) who has known the mind of the Lord , that he will instruct Him ? But ( AF ) we have the mind of Christ . Footnotes -

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I gave you ( D ) milk to drink , not solid food ; for you ( E ) were not yet able to receive it . Indeed , even now you are not yet able ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For when ( H ) one says , “ I am of Paul , ” and another , “ I am of Apollos , ” are you not mere ( I ) men ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	5	What then is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? ( J ) Servants through whom you believed , even ( K ) as the Lord gave opportunity to each one .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	6	( L ) I planted , ( M ) Apollos watered , but ( N ) God was causing the growth .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything , but God who causes the growth .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	8	Now he who plants and he who waters are one ; but each will ( O ) receive his own [ b ] reward according to his own labor .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are God ’ s ( P ) fellow workers ; you are God ’ s [ c ] ( Q ) field , God ’ s ( R ) building .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to ( S ) the grace of God which was given to me , like a wise master builder ( T ) I laid a foundation , and ( U ) another is building on it . But each man must be careful how he builds on it .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no man can lay a ( V ) foundation other than the one which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold , silver , [ d ] precious stones , wood , hay , straw ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	13	( W ) each man ’ s work will become evident ; for ( X ) the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire , and the fire itself will test [ e ] the quality of each man ’ s work .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If any man ’ s work which he has built on it remains , he will ( Y ) receive a reward .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If any man ’ s work is burned up , he will suffer loss ; but he himself will be saved , yet ( Z ) so as through fire .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	16	( AA ) Do you not know that ( AB ) you are a [ f ] temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If any man destroys the [ g ] temple of God , God will destroy him , for the [ h ] temple of God is holy , and [ i ] that is what you are .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	18	( AC ) Let no man deceive himself . ( AD ) If any man among you thinks that he is wise in ( AE ) this age , he must become foolish , so that he may become wise .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For ( AF ) the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God . For it is written , “ He is ( AG ) the one who catches the wise in their craftiness ” ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , “ ( AH ) The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise , that they are useless. ”
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So then ( AI ) let no one boast in men . For ( AJ ) all things belong to you ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	3	22	( AK ) whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or ( AL ) life or death or things present or things to come ; all things belong to you ,

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	2	In this case , moreover , it is required [ a ] of stewards that one be found trustworthy .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But to me it is a very small thing that I may be examined by you , or by any human [ b ] court ; in fact , I do not even examine myself .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	5	Therefore ( F ) do not go on [ c ] passing judgment before [ d ] the time , but wait ( G ) until the Lord comes who will both ( H ) bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men ’ s hearts ; and then each man ’ s ( I ) praise will come to him from God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now these things , brethren , I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes , so that in us you may learn not to exceed ( J ) what is written , so that no one of you will ( K ) become [ e ] arrogant ( L ) in behalf of one against the other .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who regards you as superior ? ( M ) What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	8	You are ( N ) already filled , you have already become rich , you have become kings without us ; and indeed , I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For , I think , God has exhibited us apostles last of all , as men ( O ) condemned to death ; because we ( P ) have become a spectacle to the world , [ f ] both to angels and to men .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are ( Q ) fools for Christ ’ s sake , but ( R ) you are prudent in Christ ; ( S ) we are weak , but you are strong ; you are distinguished , but we are without honor .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	11	To this present hour we are both ( T ) hungry and thirsty , and are poorly clothed , and are roughly treated , and are homeless ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	12	and we toil , ( U ) working with our own hands ; when we are ( V ) reviled , we bless ; when we are ( W ) persecuted , we endure ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	13	when we are slandered , we try to [ g ] conciliate ; we have ( X ) become as the scum of the world , the dregs of all things , even until now .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I do not write these things to ( Y ) shame you , but to admonish you as my beloved ( Z ) children .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For if you were to have countless ( AA ) tutors in Christ , yet you would not have many fathers , for in ( AB ) Christ Jesus I ( AC ) became your father through the ( AD ) gospel .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I exhort you , be ( AE ) imitators of me .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this reason I ( AF ) have sent to you ( AG ) Timothy , who is my ( AH ) beloved and faithful child in the Lord , and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ , ( AI ) just as I teach everywhere in every church .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Now some have become [ h ] ( AJ ) arrogant , as though I were not ( AK ) coming to you .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I ( AL ) will come to you soon , ( AM ) if the Lord wills , and I shall find out , not the [ i ] words of those who are ( AN ) arrogant but their power .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God does ( AO ) not consist in [ j ] words but in power .

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	6	3	( E ) Do you not know that we will judge angels ? How much more matters of this life ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	6	4	So if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life , [ e ] do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	6	5	( F ) I say this to your shame . Is it so , that there is not among you one wise man who will be able to decide between his ( G ) brethren ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Actually , then , it is already a defeat for you , that you have lawsuits with one another . ( I ) Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be defrauded ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	6	8	On the contrary , you yourselves wrong and defraud . You do this even to your ( J ) brethren .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Or ( K ) do you not know that the unrighteous will not ( L ) inherit the kingdom of God ? ( M ) Do not be deceived ; ( N ) neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor [ f ] effeminate , nor homosexuals ,

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	7	[ c ] Yet I wish that all men were ( E ) even as I myself am . However , ( F ) each man has his own gift from God , one in this manner , and another in that .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But because of immoralities , each man is to have his own wife , and each woman is to have her own husband .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband must [ a ] fulfill his duty to his wife , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife does not have authority over her own body , but the husband does ; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	5	( B ) Stop depriving one another , except by agreement for a time , so that you may devote yourselves to prayer , and [ b ] come together again so that ( C ) Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But this I say by way of concession , ( D ) not of command .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is ( G ) good for them if they remain ( H ) even as I .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they do not have self-control , ( I ) let them marry ; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	10	But to the married I give instructions , ( J ) not I , but the Lord , that the wife should not [ d ] leave her husband
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	11	( but if she does leave , she must remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband should not [ e ] divorce his wife .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest ( K ) I say , not the Lord , that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever , and she consents to live with him , he must not [ f ] divorce her .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And a woman who has an unbelieving husband , and he consents to live with her , she must not [ g ] send her husband away .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through [ h ] her believing husband ; for otherwise your children are unclean , but now they are ( L ) holy .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	15	Yet if the unbelieving one leaves , let him leave ; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called [ i ] us [ j ] ( M ) to peace .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know , O wife , whether you will ( N ) save your husband ? Or how do you know , O husband , whether you will save your wife ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Only , ( O ) as the Lord has assigned to each one , as God has called each , in this manner let him walk . And ( P ) so I direct in ( Q ) all the churches .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was any man called when he was already circumcised ? He is not to become uncircumcised . Has anyone been called in uncircumcision ? ( R ) He is not to be circumcised .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	19	( S ) Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but what matters is ( T ) the keeping of the commandments of God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	20	( U ) Each man must remain in that [ k ] condition in which he was called .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you called while a slave ? [ l ] Do not worry about it ; but if you are able also to become free , rather [ m ] do that .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For he who was called in the Lord while a slave , is ( V ) the Lord ’ s freedman ; likewise he who was called while free , is ( W ) Christ ’ s slave .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	23	( X ) You were bought with a price ; do not become slaves of men .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brethren , ( Y ) each one is to remain with God in that condition in which he was called .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins I have ( Z ) no command of the Lord , but I give an opinion as one who [ n ] ( AA ) by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I think then that this is good in view of the [ o ] present ( AB ) distress , that ( AC ) it is good for a man [ p ] to remain as he is .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be released . Are you released from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you marry , you have not sinned ; and if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . Yet such will have [ q ] trouble in this life , and I am trying to spare you .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	29	But this I say , brethren , ( AD ) the time has been shortened , so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and those who weep , as though they did not weep ; and those who rejoice , as though they did not rejoice ; and those who buy , as though they did not possess ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and those who use the world , as though they did not ( AE ) make full use of it ; for ( AF ) the form of this world is passing away .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I want you to be free from concern . One who is ( AG ) unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	33	but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world , how he may please his wife ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	34	and his interests are divided . The woman who is unmarried , and the virgin , is concerned about the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and spirit ; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	35	This I say for your own benefit ; not to put a restraint upon you , but [ r ] to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin daughter , if she is past her youth , and if it must be so , let him do what he wishes , he does not sin ; let [ s ] her marry .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But he who stands firm in his heart , [ t ] being under no constraint , but has authority [ u ] over his own will , and has decided this in his own heart , to keep his own virgin daughter , he will do well .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well , and he who does not give her in marriage will do better .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	39	( AH ) A wife is bound as long as her husband lives ; but if her husband [ v ] is dead , she is free to be married to whom she wishes , only ( AI ) in the Lord .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But ( AJ ) in my opinion she is happier if she remains as she is ; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God . Footnotes -

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	8	7	However not all men ( Q ) have this knowledge ; but ( R ) some , being accustomed to the idol until now , eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But ( T ) take care that this [ f ] liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the ( U ) weak .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if someone sees you , who have ( V ) knowledge , dining in an idol ’ s temple , will not his conscience , if he is weak , be strengthened to eat ( W ) things sacrificed to idols ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	8	11	For through ( X ) your knowledge he who is weak ( Y ) is ruined , the brother for whose sake Christ died .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	8	12	( Z ) And so , by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak , you sin ( AA ) against Christ .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Therefore , ( AB ) if food causes my brother to stumble , I will never eat meat again , so that I will not cause my brother to stumble . Footnotes -

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If to others I am not an apostle , at least I am to you ; for you are the ( E ) seal of my ( F ) apostleship in the Lord .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	3	My defense to those who examine me is this :
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	4	[ a ] ( G ) Do we not have a right to eat and drink ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	5	[ b ] ( H ) Do we not have a right to take along a [ c ] believing wife , even as the rest of the apostles and the ( I ) brothers of the Lord and ( J ) Cephas ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or do only [ d ] ( K ) Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from working ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who at any time serves ( L ) as a soldier at his own expense ? Who ( M ) plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it ? Or who tends a flock and does not [ e ] use the milk of the flock ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	8	I am not speaking these things ( N ) according to [ f ] human judgment , am I ? Or does not the Law also say these things ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Or is He speaking altogether for our sake ? Yes , ( Q ) for our sake it was written , because ( R ) the plowman ought to plow in hope , and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	11	( S ) If we sowed spiritual things in you , is it too much if we reap material things from you ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others share the right over you , do we not more ? Nevertheless , we ( T ) did not use this right , but we endure all things ( U ) so that we will cause no hindrance to the ( V ) gospel of Christ .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	13	( W ) Do you not know that those who ( X ) perform sacred services eat the food of the temple , and those who attend regularly to the altar have their share [ g ] from the altar ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	14	So also ( Y ) the Lord directed those who proclaim the ( Z ) gospel to ( AA ) get their living from the gospel .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have ( AB ) used none of these things . And I am not writing these things so that it will be done so in my case ; for it would be better for me to die than have any man make ( AC ) my boast an empty one .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the gospel , I have nothing to boast of , for ( AD ) I am under compulsion ; for woe is me if I do not preach ( AE ) the gospel .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this voluntarily , I have a ( AF ) reward ; but if against my will , I have a ( AG ) stewardship entrusted to me .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What then is my ( AH ) reward ? That , when I preach the gospel , I may offer the gospel ( AI ) without charge , so as ( AJ ) not to make full use of my right in the gospel .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For though I am ( AK ) free from all men , I have made myself ( AL ) a slave to all , so that I may ( AM ) win more .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	20	( AN ) To the Jews I became as a Jew , so that I might win Jews ; to those who are under [ h ] the Law , as under [ i ] the Law though ( AO ) not being myself under [ j ] the Law , so that I might win those who are under [ k ] the Law ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	21	to those who are ( AP ) without law , ( AQ ) as without law , though not being without the law of God but ( AR ) under the law of Christ , so that I might win those who are without law .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the ( AS ) weak I became weak , that I might win the weak ; I have become ( AT ) all things to all men , ( AU ) so that I may by all means save some .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do all things for the sake of the gospel , so that I may become a fellow partaker of it .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	24	( AV ) Do you not know that those who run in a race all run , but only one receives ( AW ) the prize ? ( AX ) Run in such a way that you may win .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	25	Everyone who ( AY ) competes in the games exercises self-control in all things . They then do it to receive a perishable ( AZ ) wreath , but we an imperishable .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	26	Therefore I ( BA ) run in such a way , as not without aim ; I box in such a way , as not ( BB ) beating the air ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	9	27	but I [ l ] discipline ( BC ) my body and make it my slave , so that , after I have preached to others , I myself will not be disqualified . Footnotes -

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man ; and ( W ) God is faithful , who will not allow you to be ( X ) tempted beyond what you are able , but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also , so that you will be able to endure it .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Therefore , my ( Y ) beloved , flee from ( Z ) idolatry .

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	10	16	Is not the ( AA ) cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ ? Is not the [ e ] ( AB ) bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ ?

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What do I mean then ? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything , or ( AF ) that an idol is anything ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	10	20	No , but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they ( AG ) sacrifice to demons and not to God ; and I do not want you to become sharers in demons .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	10	21	( AH ) You can not drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons ; you can not partake of the table of the Lord and ( AI ) the table of demons .

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Let no one ( AN ) seek his own good , but that of his [ i ] neighbor .

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	10	26	( AP ) for the earth is the Lord ’ s , and [ j ] all it contains .

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now ( B ) I praise you because you ( C ) remember me in everything and ( D ) hold firmly to the traditions , just as I delivered them to you .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to understand that [ a ] Christ is the ( E ) head of every man , and ( F ) the man is the head of a woman , and God is the ( G ) head of [ b ] Christ .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man who has something on his head while praying or ( H ) prophesying disgraces his head .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every ( I ) woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head , for she is one and the same as the woman [ c ] whose head is ( J ) shaved .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman does not cover [ d ] her head , let her also [ e ] have her hair cut off ; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to [ f ] have her hair cut off or [ g ] her head shaved , let her cover [ h ] her head .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For a man ought not to have his head covered , since he is the ( K ) image and glory of God ; but the woman is the glory of man .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For ( L ) man [ i ] does not originate from woman , but woman from man ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	9	for indeed man was not created for the woman ’ s sake , but ( M ) woman for the man ’ s sake .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	10	Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman [ l ] originates from the man , so also the man has his birth through the woman ; and ( N ) all things [ m ] originate ( O ) from God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	13	( P ) Judge [ n ] for yourselves : is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a dishonor to him ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	15	but if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her ? For her hair is given to her for a covering .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But if one is inclined to be contentious , ( Q ) we have no [ o ] other practice , nor have ( R ) the churches of God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	17	But in giving this instruction , ( S ) I do not praise you , because you come together not for the better but for the worse .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For , in the first place , when you come together [ p ] as a church , I hear that [ q ] ( T ) divisions exist among you ; and in part I believe it .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For there ( U ) must also be factions among you , ( V ) so that those who are approved may become [ r ] evident among you .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	20	Therefore when you meet together , it is not to eat the Lord ’ s Supper ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	21	for in your eating each one takes his own supper first ; and one is hungry and ( W ) another is drunk .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	22	What ! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink ? Or do you despise the ( X ) church of God and ( Y ) shame those who have nothing ? What shall I say to you ? Shall ( Z ) I praise you ? In this I will not praise you . The Lord ’ s Supper
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For ( AA ) I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you , that ( AB ) the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and when He had given thanks , He broke it and said , “ This is My body , which is for you ; do this in remembrance of Me. ”
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same way He took ( AC ) the cup also after supper , saying , “ This cup is the ( AD ) new covenant in My blood ; do this , as often as you drink it , in remembrance of Me. ”
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim the Lord ’ s death ( AE ) until He comes .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner , shall be ( AF ) guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But a man must ( AG ) examine himself , and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For he who eats and drinks , eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	30	For this reason many among you are weak and sick , and a number [ s ] ( AH ) sleep .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we judged ourselves rightly , we would not be judged .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged , we are ( AI ) disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with ( AJ ) the world .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So then , my brethren , when you come together to eat , wait for one another .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If anyone is ( AK ) hungry , let him eat ( AL ) at home , so that you will not come together for judgment . The remaining matters I will ( AM ) arrange ( AN ) when I come . Footnotes -

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking [ a ] ( F ) by the Spirit of God says , “ Jesus is [ b ] ( G ) accursed ” ; and no one can say , “ Jesus is ( H ) Lord , ” except [ c ] ( I ) by the Holy Spirit .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now there are ( J ) varieties of gifts , but the same Spirit .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	5	And there are varieties of ministries , and the same Lord .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	6	There are varieties of effects , but the same ( K ) God who works all things in all persons .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit ( L ) for the common good .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given the word of ( M ) wisdom through the Spirit , and to another the word of ( N ) knowledge according to the same Spirit ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	9	to another ( O ) faith [ d ] by the same Spirit , and to another ( P ) gifts of [ e ] healing [ f ] by the one Spirit ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	10	and to another the [ g ] effecting of [ h ] ( Q ) miracles , and to another ( R ) prophecy , and to another the [ i ] ( S ) distinguishing of spirits , to another various ( T ) kinds of tongues , and to another the ( U ) interpretation of tongues .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But one and the same Spirit works all these things , ( V ) distributing to each one individually just as He wills .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For [ j ] ( Y ) by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether ( Z ) Jews or Greeks , whether slaves or free , and we were all made to ( AA ) drink of one Spirit .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For ( AB ) the body is not one member , but many .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot says , “ Because I am not a hand , I am not a part of the body , ” it is not for this reason [ k ] any the less a part of the body .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear says , “ Because I am not an eye , I am not a part of the body , ” it is not for this reason [ l ] any the less a part of the body .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? If the whole were hearing , where would the sense of smell be ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now God has ( AC ) placed the members , each one of them , in the body , ( AD ) just as He desired .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	19	If they were all one member , where would the body be ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now ( AE ) there are many members , but one body .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	21	And the eye can not say to the hand , “ I have no need of you ” ; or again the head to the feet , “ I have no need of you. ”
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	22	On the contrary , [ m ] it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	23	and those members of the body which we [ n ] deem less honorable , [ o ] on these we bestow more abundant honor , and our less presentable members become much more presentable ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	24	whereas our more presentable members have no need of it . But God has so composed the body , giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	25	so that there may be no [ p ] division in the body , but that the members may have the same care for one another .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And if one member suffers , all the members suffer with it ; if one member is [ q ] honored , all the members rejoice with it .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now you are ( AF ) Christ ’ s body , and ( AG ) individually members of it .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And God has [ r ] ( AH ) appointed in ( AI ) the church , first ( AJ ) apostles , second ( AK ) prophets , third ( AL ) teachers , then [ s ] ( AM ) miracles , then ( AN ) gifts of healings , helps , ( AO ) administrations , various ( AP ) kinds of tongues .

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I used to speak like a child , think like a child , reason like a child ; when I [ d ] became a man , I did away with childish things .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For now we ( V ) see in a mirror [ e ] dimly , but then ( W ) face to face ; now I know in part , but then I will know fully just as I also ( X ) have been fully known .

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	2	-
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But one who prophesies speaks to men for ( G ) edification and ( H ) exhortation and consolation .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	4	One who ( I ) speaks in a tongue ( J ) edifies himself ; but one who ( K ) prophesies ( L ) edifies the church .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	5	Now I wish that you all ( M ) spoke in tongues , but ( N ) even more that you would prophesy ; and greater is one who prophesies than one who ( O ) speaks in tongues , unless he interprets , so that the church may receive ( P ) edifying .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	6	But now , brethren , if I come to you speaking in tongues , what will I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of ( Q ) revelation or of ( R ) knowledge or of ( S ) prophecy or of ( T ) teaching ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Yet even lifeless things , either flute or harp , in producing a sound , if they do not produce a distinction in the tones , how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	8	For if ( U ) the [ c ] bugle produces an indistinct sound , who will prepare himself for battle ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So also you , unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear , how will it be known what is spoken ? For you will be ( V ) speaking into the air .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , perhaps , a great many kinds of [ d ] languages in the world , and no kind is without meaning .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	11	If then I do not know the meaning of the language , I will be to the one who speaks a [ e ] ( W ) barbarian , and the one who speaks will be a [ f ] barbarian [ g ] to me .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	12	So also you , since you are zealous of [ h ] spiritual gifts , seek to abound for the ( X ) edification of the church .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	15	( Y ) What is the outcome then ? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also ; I will ( Z ) sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	16	, note
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For you are giving thanks well enough , but the other person is not ( AC ) edified .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God , I speak in tongues more than you all ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	19	however , in the church I desire to speak five words with my mind so that I may instruct others also , rather than ten thousand words in a tongue . Instruction for the Church
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	20	( AD ) Brethren , ( AE ) do not be children in your thinking ; yet in evil ( AF ) be infants , but in your thinking be mature .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In ( AG ) the Law it is written , “ ( AH ) By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people , and even so they will not listen to Me , ” says the Lord .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	22	So then tongues are for a sign , not to those who believe but to unbelievers ; but ( AI ) prophecy is for a sign , not to unbelievers but to those who believe .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues , and [ k ] ungifted men or unbelievers enter , will they not say that ( AJ ) you are mad ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all ( AK ) prophesy , and an unbeliever or an [ l ] ungifted man enters , he is ( AL ) convicted by all , he is called to account by all ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	25	( AM ) the secrets of his heart are disclosed ; and so he will ( AN ) fall on his face and worship God , ( AO ) declaring that God is certainly among you .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	26	( AP ) What is the outcome then , ( AQ ) brethren ? When you assemble , ( AR ) each one has a ( AS ) psalm , has a ( AT ) teaching , has a ( AU ) revelation , has a ( AV ) tongue , has an ( AW ) interpretation . Let ( AX ) all things be done for edification .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If anyone speaks in a ( AY ) tongue , it should be by two or at the most three , and each in turn , and one must ( AZ ) interpret ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	28	but if there is no interpreter , he must keep silent in the church ; and let him speak to himself and to God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Let two or three ( BA ) prophets speak , and let the others ( BB ) pass judgment .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	30	But if a revelation is made to another who is seated , the first one must keep silent .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For you can all prophesy one by one , so that all may learn and all may be exhorted ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	32	and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	33	for God is not a God of ( BC ) confusion but of [ m ] peace , as in ( BD ) all the churches of the ( BE ) saints .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	34	The women are to ( BF ) keep silent in the churches ; for they are not permitted to speak , but ( BG ) are to subject themselves , just as ( BH ) the Law also says .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	35	If they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home ; for it is [ n ] improper for a woman to speak in church .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	36	[ o ] Was it from you that the word of God first went forth ? Or has it come to you only ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	37	( BI ) If anyone thinks he is a prophet or ( BJ ) spiritual , let him recognize that the things which I write to you ( BK ) are the Lord ’ s commandment .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But if anyone does not recognize this , he [ p ] is not recognized .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	39	Therefore , my brethren , ( BL ) desire earnestly to ( BM ) prophesy , and do not forbid to speak in tongues .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	14	40	But ( BN ) all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner . Footnotes -

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	15	Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God , because we testified [ f ] against God that He ( Y ) raised [ g ] Christ , whom He did not raise , if in fact the dead are not raised .

NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For ( F ) I delivered to you [ b ] as of first importance what I also received , that Christ died ( G ) for our sins ( H ) according to the Scriptures ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	4	and that He was buried , and that He was ( I ) raised on the third day ( J ) according to the Scriptures ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that ( K ) He appeared to ( L ) Cephas , then ( M ) to the twelve .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time , most of whom remain until now , but some ( N ) have fallen asleep ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	7	then He appeared to [ c ] ( O ) James , then to ( P ) all the apostles ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	8	and last of all , as [ d ] to one untimely born , ( Q ) He appeared to me also .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am ( R ) the least of the apostles , [ e ] and not fit to be called an apostle , because I ( S ) persecuted the church of God .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by ( T ) the grace of God I am what I am , and His grace toward me did not prove vain ; but I ( U ) labored even more than all of them , yet ( V ) not I , but the grace of God with me .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Whether then it was I or they , so we preach and so you believed .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached , that He has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there ( W ) is no resurrection of the dead ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , not even Christ has been raised ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	14	and ( X ) if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is vain , your faith also is vain .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead are not raised , not even Christ has been raised ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	17	and if Christ has not been raised , your faith is worthless ; ( Z ) you are still in your sins .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then those also who ( AA ) have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If we have hoped in Christ in this life only , we are ( AB ) of all men most to be pitied . The Order of Resurrection
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But now Christ ( AC ) has been raised from the dead , the ( AD ) first fruits of those who ( AE ) are asleep .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since ( AF ) by a man came death , by a man also came the resurrection of the dead .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For ( AG ) as in Adam all die , so also in [ h ] Christ all will be made alive .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own order : Christ ( AH ) the first fruits , after that ( AI ) those who are Christ ’ s at ( AJ ) His coming ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	24	then comes the end , when He hands over ( AK ) the kingdom to the ( AL ) God and Father , when He has abolished ( AM ) all rule and all authority and power .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For He must reign ( AN ) until He has put all His enemies under His feet .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that will be ( AO ) abolished is death .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For ( AP ) He has put all things in subjection under His feet . But when He says , “ ( AQ ) All things are put in subjection , ” it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	28	When ( AR ) all things are subjected to Him , then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him , so that ( AS ) God may be all in all .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise , what will those do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why then are they baptized for them ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	30	Why are we also ( AT ) in danger every hour ?
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I affirm , brethren , by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , ( AU ) I die daily .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If [ i ] from human motives I ( AV ) fought with wild beasts at ( AW ) Ephesus , what does it profit me ? If the dead are not raised , ( AX ) let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	33	( AY ) Do not be deceived : “ Bad company corrupts good morals. ”
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	34	( AZ ) Become sober-minded [ j ] as you ought , and stop sinning ; for some have ( BA ) no knowledge of God . ( BB ) I speak this to your shame .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But ( BC ) someone will say , “ How are ( BD ) the dead raised ? And with what kind of body do they come ? ”
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	36	( BE ) You fool ! That which you ( BF ) sow does not come to life unless it dies ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	37	and that which you sow , you do not sow the body which is to be , but a bare grain , perhaps of wheat or of [ k ] something else .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body just as He wished , and ( BG ) to each of the seeds a body of its own .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of men , and another flesh of beasts , and another flesh of birds , and another of fish .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies , but the glory of the heavenly is one , and the glory of the earthly is another .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for star differs from star in glory .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	42	( BH ) So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown [ l ] ( BI ) a perishable body , it is raised [ m ] ( BJ ) an imperishable body ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	43	it is sown in dishonor , it is raised in ( BK ) glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	44	it is sown a ( BL ) natural body , it is raised a ( BM ) spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	45	So also it is written , “ The first ( BN ) man , Adam , became a living soul. ” The ( BO ) last Adam became a ( BP ) life-giving spirit .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	46	However , the spiritual is not first , but the natural ; then the spiritual .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man is ( BQ ) from the earth , [ n ] ( BR ) earthy ; the second man is from heaven .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As is the earthy , so also are those who are earthy ; and as is the heavenly , ( BS ) so also are those who are heavenly .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	49	Just as we have ( BT ) borne the image of the earthy , [ o ] we ( BU ) will also bear the image of the heavenly . The Mystery of Resurrection
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now I say this , brethren , that ( BV ) flesh and blood can not ( BW ) inherit the kingdom of God ; nor does [ p ] the perishable inherit [ q ] ( BX ) the imperishable .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I tell you a ( BY ) mystery ; we will not all sleep , but we will all be ( BZ ) changed ,
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet ; for ( CA ) the trumpet will sound , and ( CB ) the dead will be raised [ r ] imperishable , and ( CC ) we will be changed .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	53	, note
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	54	But when this [ u ] perishable will have put on [ v ] the imperishable , and this mortal will have put on immortality , then will come about the saying that is written , “ ( CF ) Death is swallowed up in victory .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	55	( CG ) O death , where is your victory ? O death , where is your sting ? ”
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of ( CH ) death is sin , and ( CI ) the power of sin is the law ;
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	57	but ( CJ ) thanks be to God , who gives us the ( CK ) victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB1995	1%20Corinthians	15	58	( CL ) Therefore , my beloved brethren , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in ( CM ) the work of the Lord , knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord . Footnotes -

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	3	( I ) Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and ( J ) God of all comfort ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	4	who ( K ) comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in [ b ] any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For just ( L ) as the sufferings of Christ are [ c ] ours in abundance , so also our comfort is abundant through Christ .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	6	But if we are afflicted , it is ( M ) for your comfort and salvation ; or if we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	7	and our hope for you is firmly grounded , knowing that ( N ) as you are sharers of our sufferings , so also you are sharers of our comfort .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For ( O ) we do not want you to be unaware , brethren , of our ( P ) affliction which came to us in [ d ] ( Q ) Asia , that we were burdened excessively , beyond our strength , so that we despaired even of life ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	9	[ e ] indeed , we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	10	who ( R ) delivered us from so great a peril of death , and will deliver us , [ f ] He ( S ) on whom we have set our hope . And He will yet deliver us ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	11	you also joining in ( T ) helping us through your prayers , so that thanks may be given by ( U ) many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed on us through the prayers of many . Paul ’ s Integrity
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our [ g ] proud confidence is this : the testimony of ( V ) our conscience , that in holiness and ( W ) godly sincerity , ( X ) not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God , we have conducted ourselves in the world , and especially toward you .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write nothing else to you than what you read and understand , and I hope you will understand ( Y ) until the end ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	14	just as you also partially did understand us , that we are your reason to be proud as you also are ours , in ( Z ) the day of our Lord Jesus .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	15	In this confidence I intended at first to ( AA ) come to you , so that you might [ h ] twice receive a [ i ] ( AB ) blessing ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	16	[ j ] that is , to ( AC ) pass [ k ] your way into ( AD ) Macedonia , and again from Macedonia to come to you , and by you to be ( AE ) helped on my journey to Judea .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Therefore , I was not vacillating when I intended to do this , was I ? Or what I purpose , do I purpose ( AF ) according to the flesh , so that with me there will be yes , yes and no , no at the same time ?
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But as ( AG ) God is faithful , ( AH ) our word to you is not yes and no .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For ( AI ) the Son of God , Christ Jesus , who was preached among you by us—by me and ( AJ ) Silvanus and ( AK ) Timothy—was not yes and no , but is yes ( AL ) in Him .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For ( AM ) as many as are the promises of God , ( AN ) in Him they are yes ; therefore also through Him is ( AO ) our Amen to the glory of God through us .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now He who ( AP ) establishes us with you in Christ and ( AQ ) anointed us is God ,

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	3	This is the very thing I ( C ) wrote you , so that ( D ) when I came , I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice ; having ( E ) confidence in you all that my joy would be the joy of you all .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I ( F ) wrote to you with many tears ; not so that you would be made sorrowful , but that you might know the love which I have especially for you .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But ( G ) if any has caused sorrow , he has caused sorrow not to me , but in some degree— [ b ] in order not to say too much—to all of you .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient for such a one is ( H ) this punishment which was inflicted by the majority ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	7	so that on the contrary you should rather ( I ) forgive and comfort him , otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also ( J ) I wrote , so that I might [ c ] ( K ) put you to the test , whether you are ( L ) obedient in all things .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	10	But one whom you forgive anything , I forgive also ; for indeed what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , I did it for your sakes ( M ) in the presence of Christ ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	11	so that no advantage would be taken of us by ( N ) Satan , for ( O ) we are not ignorant of his schemes .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Now when I came to ( P ) Troas for the ( Q ) gospel of Christ and when a ( R ) door was opened for me in the Lord ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I ( S ) had no rest for my spirit , not finding ( T ) Titus my brother ; but ( U ) taking my leave of them , I went on to ( V ) Macedonia .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	14	( W ) But thanks be to God , who always ( X ) leads us in triumph in Christ , and manifests through us the ( Y ) sweet aroma of the ( Z ) knowledge of Him in every place .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are a ( AA ) fragrance of Christ to God among ( AB ) those who are being saved and among those who are perishing ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	16	( AC ) to the one an aroma from death to death , to the other an aroma from life to life . And who is ( AD ) adequate for these things ?
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not like many , [ d ] ( AE ) peddling the word of God , but ( AF ) as from sincerity , but as from God , we speak in Christ ( AG ) in the sight of God . Footnotes -

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves , but ( J ) our adequacy is from God ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	6	who also made us adequate as ( K ) servants of a ( L ) new covenant , not of ( M ) the letter but of the Spirit ; for the letter kills , but ( N ) the Spirit gives life .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	7	But if the ( O ) ministry of death , ( P ) in letters engraved on stones , came [ c ] with glory , ( Q ) so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face , fading as it was ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	8	how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory ?
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if ( R ) the ministry of condemnation has glory , much more does the ( S ) ministry of righteousness abound in glory .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For indeed what had glory , in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses it .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that which fades away was [ d ] with glory , much more that which remains is in glory .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	12	( T ) Therefore having such a hope , ( U ) we use great boldness in our speech ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	13	and are not like Moses , ( V ) who used to put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not look intently at the end of what was fading away .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were ( W ) hardened ; for until this very day at the ( X ) reading of ( Y ) the old covenant the same veil [ e ] remains unlifted , because it is removed in Christ .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But to this day whenever Moses is read , a veil lies over their heart ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	16	( Z ) but whenever a person turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where ( AA ) the Spirit of the Lord is , ( AB ) there is liberty .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	3	18	But we all , with unveiled face , ( AC ) beholding as in a mirror the ( AD ) glory of the Lord , are being ( AE ) transformed into the same image from glory to glory , just as from ( AF ) the Lord , the Spirit . Footnotes -

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	3	inasmuch as we , having put it on , will not be found naked .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For indeed while we are in this tent , we ( F ) groan , being burdened , because we do not want to be unclothed but to be ( G ) clothed , so that what is ( H ) mortal will be swallowed up by life .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Therefore , being always of good courage , and knowing that ( J ) while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	7	for ( K ) we walk by faith , not by [ c ] sight—
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	8	we are of good courage , I say , and ( L ) prefer rather to be absent from the body and ( M ) to be at home with the Lord .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Therefore we also have as our ambition , whether at home or absent , to be ( N ) pleasing to Him .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear before ( O ) the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may be recompensed for [ d ] his deeds in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Therefore , knowing the ( P ) fear of the Lord , we persuade men , but we are made manifest to God ; and I hope that we are ( Q ) made manifest also in your consciences .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not ( R ) again commending ourselves to you but are giving you an ( S ) occasion to be proud of us , so that you will have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For if we [ e ] are ( T ) beside ourselves , it is for God ; if we are of sound mind , it is for you .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ ( U ) controls us , having concluded this , that ( V ) one died for all , therefore all died ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	15	and He died for all , so that they who live might no longer ( W ) live for themselves , but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	16	Therefore from now on we recognize no one [ f ] ( X ) according to the flesh ; even though we have known Christ [ g ] according to the flesh , yet now we know Him in this way no longer .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if anyone is ( Y ) in Christ , [ h ] he is ( Z ) a new creature ; ( AA ) the old things passed away ; behold , new things have come .

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not speak to condemn you , for I have said ( D ) before that you are ( E ) in our hearts to die together and to live together .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	4	Great is my ( F ) confidence [ a ] in you ; great is my ( G ) boasting on your behalf . I am filled with ( H ) comfort ; I am overflowing with ( I ) joy in all our affliction .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For even when we came into ( J ) Macedonia our flesh had no rest , but we were ( K ) afflicted on every side : ( L ) conflicts without , fears within .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But ( M ) God , who comforts the [ b ] depressed , ( N ) comforted us by the coming of ( O ) Titus ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For though I ( P ) caused you sorrow by my letter , I do not regret it ; though I did regret it—for I see that that letter caused you sorrow , though only for a while—
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	9	I now rejoice , not that you were made sorrowful , but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance ; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God , so that you might not suffer loss in anything [ c ] through us .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a ( Q ) repentance [ d ] without regret , leading to salvation , but the sorrow of the world produces death .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For behold what earnestness this very thing , this [ e ] godly sorrow , has produced in you : what vindication of yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what ( R ) longing , what zeal , what ( S ) avenging of wrong ! In everything you ( T ) demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So although ( U ) I wrote to you , it was not for the sake of ( V ) the offender nor for the sake of the one offended , but that your earnestness on our behalf might be made known to you in the sight of God .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	13	For this reason we have been ( W ) comforted . And besides our comfort , we rejoiced even much more for the joy of ( X ) Titus , because his ( Y ) spirit has been refreshed by you all .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if in anything I have ( Z ) boasted to him about you , I was not put to shame ; but as we spoke all things to you in truth , so also our boasting before ( AA ) Titus proved to be the truth .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	7	15	His [ f ] affection abounds all the more toward you , as he remembers the ( AB ) obedience of you all , how you received him with ( AC ) fear and trembling .

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For I testify that ( D ) according to their ability , and beyond their ability , they gave of their own accord ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	4	begging us with much urging for the ( E ) favor [ a ] of participation in the [ b ] ( F ) support of the [ c ] saints ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	5	and this , not as we had [ d ] expected , but they first ( G ) gave themselves to the Lord and to us by ( H ) the will of God .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So we ( I ) urged ( J ) Titus that as he had previously ( K ) made a beginning , so he would also complete in you ( L ) this gracious work as well .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	7	But just as you ( M ) abound ( N ) in everything , in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the [ e ] love we inspired in you , see that you ( O ) abound in this gracious work also .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For you know ( Q ) the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ( R ) though He was rich , yet for your sake He became poor , so that you through His poverty might become rich .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	10	I ( S ) give my opinion in this matter , for this is to your advantage , who were the first to begin ( T ) a year ago not only to do this , but also to desire to do it .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	11	But now finish [ f ] doing it also , so that just as there was the ( U ) readiness to desire it , so there may be also the completion of it by your ability .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the readiness is present , it is acceptable ( V ) according to what a person has , not according to what he does not have .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For this is not for the ease of others and for your affliction , but by way of equality—
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	14	at this present time your abundance being a supply for ( W ) their need , so that their abundance also may become a supply for ( X ) your need , that there may be equality ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	15	as it is written , “ ( Y ) He who gathered much did not have too much , and he who gathered little had no lack. ”
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But ( Z ) thanks be to God who ( AA ) puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of ( AB ) Titus .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For he not only accepted our ( AC ) appeal , but being himself very earnest , he has gone to you of his own accord .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	18	We have sent along with him ( AD ) the brother whose fame in the things of the ( AE ) gospel has spread through ( AF ) all the churches ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	19	( AG ) and not only this , but he has also been ( AH ) appointed by the churches to travel with us in ( AI ) this gracious work , which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself , and to show our ( AJ ) readiness ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	20	[ g ] taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	21	for we ( AK ) have regard for what is honorable , not only in ( AL ) the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	22	We have sent with them our brother , whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things , but now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	8	23	As for ( AM ) Titus , he is my ( AN ) partner and fellow worker [ h ] among you ; as for our ( AO ) brethren , they are [ i ] ( AP ) messengers of the churches , ( AQ ) a glory to Christ .

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	9	4	otherwise if any ( I ) Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , we—not to speak of you—will be put to shame by this confidence .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	9	5	So I thought it necessary to urge the ( J ) brethren that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised [ b ] ( K ) bountiful gift , so that the same would be ready as a [ c ] ( L ) bountiful gift and not [ d ] ( M ) affected by covetousness .

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart , not ( O ) grudgingly or under compulsion , for ( P ) God loves a cheerful giver .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And ( Q ) God is able to make all grace abound to you , so that always having all sufficiency in everything , you may have an abundance for every good deed ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Now He who supplies ( S ) seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and ( T ) increase the harvest of your righteousness ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	9	11	you will be ( U ) enriched in everything for all liberality , which through us is producing ( V ) thanksgiving to God .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	9	12	For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying ( W ) the needs of the [ h ] saints , but is also overflowing ( X ) through many thanksgivings to God .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	9	13	Because of the proof given by this ( Y ) ministry , they will ( Z ) glorify God for your obedience to your ( AA ) confession of the ( AB ) gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your [ i ] contribution to them and to all ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	9	14	while they also , by prayer on your behalf , yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you .

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	10	5	We are destroying speculations and every ( K ) lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God , and we are taking every thought captive to the ( L ) obedience of Christ ,

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	10	7	[ c ] ( N ) You are looking at [ d ] things as they are outwardly . ( O ) If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ ’ s , let him consider this again within himself , that just as he is Christ ’ s , ( P ) so also are we .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For even if ( Q ) I boast somewhat [ e ] further about our ( R ) authority , which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you , I will not be put to shame ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	10	9	[ f ] for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when absent , such persons we are also in deed when present .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	10	12	For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with [ h ] some of those who ( U ) commend themselves ; but when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves , they are without understanding .

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we are not overextending ourselves , as if we did not reach to you , for ( X ) we were the first to come even as far as you in the ( Y ) gospel of Christ ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	10	15	not boasting ( Z ) beyond our measure , that is , in ( AA ) other men ’ s labors , but with the hope that as ( AB ) your faith grows , we will be , [ j ] within our sphere , ( AC ) enlarged even more by you ,
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	10	16	so as to ( AD ) preach the gospel even to ( AE ) the regions beyond you , and not to boast [ k ] ( AF ) in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But ( AG ) he who boasts is to boast in the Lord .

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that , as the ( E ) serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness , your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if [ b ] one comes and preaches ( F ) another Jesus whom we have not preached , or you receive a ( G ) different spirit which you have not received , or a ( H ) different gospel which you have not accepted , you ( I ) bear this ( J ) beautifully .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I consider myself ( K ) not in the least inferior to the [ c ] most eminent apostles .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	6	But even if I am ( L ) unskilled in speech , yet I am not so in ( M ) knowledge ; in fact , in every way we have ( N ) made this evident to you in all things .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Or ( O ) did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted , because I preached the ( P ) gospel of God to you ( Q ) without charge ?
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches by ( R ) taking wages from them to serve you ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	9	and when I was present with you and was in need , I was ( S ) not a burden to anyone ; for when ( T ) the brethren came from ( U ) Macedonia they fully supplied my need , and in everything I kept myself from ( V ) being a burden to you , [ d ] and will continue to do so .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	10	( W ) As the truth of Christ is in me , ( X ) this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of ( Y ) Achaia .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I am doing I will continue to do , ( AB ) so that I may cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be [ e ] regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such men are ( AC ) false apostles , ( AD ) deceitful workers , disguising themselves as apostles of Christ .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	14	No wonder , for even ( AE ) Satan disguises himself as an ( AF ) angel of light .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness , ( AG ) whose end will be according to their deeds .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	16	( AH ) Again I say , let no one think me foolish ; but if you do , receive me even as foolish , so that I also may boast a little .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	17	What I am saying , I am not saying [ f ] ( AI ) as the Lord would , but as ( AJ ) in foolishness , in this confidence of boasting .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Since ( AK ) many boast ( AL ) according to the flesh , I will boast also .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For you , ( AM ) being so wise , tolerate the foolish gladly .

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	21	To my ( AS ) shame I must say that we have been ( AT ) weak by comparison . But in whatever respect anyone else ( AU ) is bold—I ( AV ) speak in foolishness—I am just as bold myself .

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received from the Jews ( BH ) thirty-nine lashes .

NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	5	( J ) On behalf of such a man I will boast ; but on my own behalf I will not boast , except in regard to my ( K ) weaknesses .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For if I do wish to boast I will not be ( L ) foolish , ( M ) for I will be speaking the truth ; but I refrain from this , so that no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me . A Thorn in the Flesh
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	7	Because of the surpassing greatness of the ( N ) revelations , for this reason , to keep me from exalting myself , there was given me a ( O ) thorn in the flesh , a ( P ) messenger of Satan to [ b ] torment me—to keep me from exalting myself !
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Concerning this I implored the Lord ( Q ) three times that it might leave me .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And He has said to me , “ My grace is sufficient for you , for ( R ) power is perfected in weakness. ” Most gladly , therefore , I will rather ( S ) boast [ c ] about my weaknesses , so that the power of Christ may dwell in me .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Therefore ( T ) I am well content with weaknesses , with [ d ] insults , with ( U ) distresses , with ( V ) persecutions , with ( W ) difficulties , ( X ) for Christ ’ s sake ; for ( Y ) when I am weak , then I am strong .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have become ( Z ) foolish ; you yourselves compelled me . Actually I should have been commended by you , for ( AA ) in no respect was I inferior to the [ e ] most eminent apostles , even though ( AB ) I am a nobody .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches , except that ( AD ) I myself did not become a burden to you ? Forgive me ( AE ) this wrong !
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Here ( AF ) for this third time I am ready to come to you , and I ( AG ) will not be a burden to you ; for I ( AH ) do not seek what is yours , but ( AI ) you ; for ( AJ ) children are not responsible to save up for their parents , but ( AK ) parents for their children .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	15	I will ( AL ) most gladly spend and be expended for your souls . If ( AM ) I love you more , am I to be loved less ?
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But be that as it may , I ( AN ) did not burden you myself ; nevertheless , crafty fellow that I am , I ( AO ) took you in by deceit .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	17	( AP ) Certainly I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you , have I ?
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I ( AQ ) urged ( AR ) Titus to go , and I sent ( AS ) the brother with him . Titus did not take any advantage of you , did he ? Did we not [ j ] conduct ourselves [ k ] in the same ( AT ) spirit and walk ( AU ) in the same steps ?
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	19	All this time [ l ] you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you . Actually , ( AV ) it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ ; and ( AW ) all for your upbuilding , ( AX ) beloved .
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I am afraid that perhaps ( AY ) when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish ; that perhaps there will be ( AZ ) strife , jealousy , ( BA ) angry tempers , ( BB ) disputes , ( BC ) slanders , ( BD ) gossip , ( BE ) arrogance , ( BF ) disturbances ;
NASB1995	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you , and I may mourn over many of those who have ( BG ) sinned in the past and not repented of the ( BH ) impurity , [ m ] immorality and sensuality which they have practiced . Footnotes -

NASB1995	Galatians	1	14	and I ( AD ) was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my [ h ] countrymen , being more extremely zealous for my ( AE ) ancestral traditions .
NASB1995	Galatians	1	15	But when God , who had set me apart even from my mother ’ s womb and ( AF ) called me through His grace , was pleased
NASB1995	Galatians	1	16	to reveal His Son in me so that I might ( AG ) preach Him among the Gentiles , ( AH ) I did not immediately consult with [ i ] ( AI ) flesh and blood ,
NASB1995	Galatians	1	17	( AJ ) nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me ; but I went away to Arabia , and returned once more to ( AK ) Damascus .

NASB1995	Galatians	2	3	But not even ( G ) Titus , who was with me , though he was a Greek , was ( H ) compelled to be circumcised .
NASB1995	Galatians	2	4	But it was because of the ( I ) false brethren secretly brought in , who ( J ) had sneaked in to spy out our ( K ) liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , in order to ( L ) bring us into bondage .
NASB1995	Galatians	2	5	But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour , so that ( M ) the truth of the gospel would remain with you .

NASB1995	Galatians	2	7	But on the contrary , seeing that I had been ( P ) entrusted with the ( Q ) gospel [ d ] to the uncircumcised , just as ( R ) Peter had been [ e ] to the circumcised

NASB1995	Galatians	2	11	But when ( AC ) Cephas came to ( AD ) Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he [ i ] stood condemned .

NASB1995	Galatians	2	13	The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy , with the result that even ( AH ) Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy .
NASB1995	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they ( AI ) were not [ l ] straightforward about ( AJ ) the truth of the gospel , I said to ( AK ) Cephas in the presence of all , “ If you , being a Jew , ( AL ) live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews , how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews ?

NASB1995	Galatians	2	16	nevertheless knowing that ( AO ) a man is not justified by the works of [ n ] the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus , even we have believed in Christ Jesus , so that we may be justified by ( AP ) faith in Christ and not by the works of [ o ] the Law ; since ( AQ ) by the works of [ p ] the Law no [ q ] flesh will be justified .
NASB1995	Galatians	2	17	But if , while seeking to be justified in Christ , we ourselves have also been found ( AR ) sinners , is Christ then a minister of sin ? ( AS ) May it never be !
NASB1995	Galatians	2	18	For if I rebuild what I have once destroyed , I ( AT ) prove myself to be a transgressor .
NASB1995	Galatians	2	19	For through [ r ] the Law I ( AU ) died to [ s ] the Law , so that I might live to God .
NASB1995	Galatians	2	20	I have been ( AV ) crucified with Christ ; and it is no longer I who live , but ( AW ) Christ lives in me ; and [ t ] the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in ( AX ) the Son of God , who ( AY ) loved me and ( AZ ) gave Himself up for me .

NASB1995	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish ? Having begun [ d ] by the Spirit , are you now [ e ] being perfected by the flesh ?
NASB1995	Galatians	3	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	2	This is the only thing I want to find out from you : did you receive the Spirit by the works of [ b ] the Law , or by [ c ] ( C ) hearing with faith ?
NASB1995	Galatians	3	4	Did you [ f ] suffer so many things in vain— ( D ) if indeed it was in vain ?
NASB1995	Galatians	3	5	So then , does He who ( E ) provides you with the Spirit and ( F ) works [ g ] miracles among you , do it by the works of [ h ] the Law , or by [ i ] ( G ) hearing with faith ?
NASB1995	Galatians	3	6	[ j ] Even so ( H ) Abraham ( I ) believed God , and it was reckoned to him as righteousness .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	7	Therefore , [ k ] be sure that ( J ) it is those who are of faith who are ( K ) sons of Abraham .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	8	The Scripture , foreseeing that God [ l ] would justify the [ m ] Gentiles by faith , preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham , saying , “ ( L ) All the nations will be blessed in you. ”
NASB1995	Galatians	3	9	So then ( M ) those who are of faith are blessed with [ n ] Abraham , the believer .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of [ o ] the Law are under a curse ; for it is written , “ ( N ) Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law , to perform them. ”
NASB1995	Galatians	3	11	Now that ( O ) no one is justified [ p ] by [ q ] the Law before God is evident ; for , “ [ r ] ( P ) The righteous man shall live by faith. ”
NASB1995	Galatians	3	12	[ s ] However , the Law is not [ t ] of faith ; on the contrary , “ ( Q ) He who practices them shall live [ u ] by them. ”
NASB1995	Galatians	3	13	Christ ( R ) redeemed us from the curse of the Law , having become a curse for us—for it is written , “ ( S ) Cursed is everyone who hangs on ( T ) a [ v ] tree ” —
NASB1995	Galatians	3	14	in order that ( U ) in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might [ w ] come to the Gentiles , so that we ( V ) would receive ( W ) the promise of the Spirit through faith . Intent of the Law
NASB1995	Galatians	3	15	( X ) Brethren , ( Y ) I speak [ x ] in terms of human relations : ( Z ) even though it is only a man ’ s [ y ] covenant , yet when it has been ratified , no one sets it aside or adds [ z ] conditions to it .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	16	Now the promises were spoken ( AA ) to Abraham and to his seed . He does not say , “ And to seeds , ” as referring to many , but rather to one , “ ( AB ) And to your seed , ” that is , Christ .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	17	What I am saying is this : the Law , which came ( AC ) four hundred and thirty years later , does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God , so as to nullify the promise .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	18	For ( AD ) if the inheritance is [ aa ] based on law , it is no longer [ ab ] based on a promise ; but ( AE ) God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	19	( AF ) Why the Law then ? It was added [ ac ] because of transgressions , having been ( AG ) ordained through angels ( AH ) by the [ ad ] agency of a mediator , until ( AI ) the seed would come to whom the promise had been made .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	20	Now ( AJ ) a mediator is not [ ae ] for one party only ; whereas God is only one .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	21	Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God ? ( AK ) May it never be ! For ( AL ) if a law had been given which was able to impart life , then righteousness [ af ] would indeed have been [ ag ] based on law .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	22	But the Scripture has ( AM ) shut up [ ah ] everyone under sin , so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came , we were kept in custody under the law , ( AN ) being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	24	Therefore the Law has become our ( AO ) tutor to lead us to Christ , so that ( AP ) we may be justified by faith .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	25	But now that faith has come , we are no longer under a [ ai ] ( AQ ) tutor .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	26	For you are all ( AR ) sons of God through faith in ( AS ) Christ Jesus .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	27	For all of you who were ( AT ) baptized into Christ have ( AU ) clothed yourselves with Christ .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	28	( AV ) There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free man , there is [ aj ] neither male nor female ; for ( AW ) you are all one in ( AX ) Christ Jesus .
NASB1995	Galatians	3	29	And if ( AY ) you [ ak ] belong to Christ , then you are Abraham ’ s [ al ] descendants , heirs according to ( AZ ) promise .

NASB1995	Galatians	4	4	But when ( C ) the fullness of the time came , God sent forth His Son , ( D ) born of a woman , born ( E ) under [ e ] the Law ,
NASB1995	Galatians	4	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	2	but he is under guardians and [ c ] managers until the date set by the father .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	3	So also we , while we were children , were held ( A ) in bondage under the [ d ] ( B ) elemental things of the world .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	5	so that He might redeem those who were under [ f ] the Law , that we might receive the adoption as ( F ) sons .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	6	Because you are sons , ( G ) God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts , crying , “ ( H ) Abba ! Father ! ”
NASB1995	Galatians	4	7	Therefore you are no longer a slave , but a son ; and ( I ) if a son , then an heir [ g ] through God .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	8	However at that time , ( J ) when you did not know God , you were ( K ) slaves to ( L ) those which by nature are no gods .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	9	But now that you have come to know God , or rather to be ( M ) known by God , ( N ) how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless [ h ] ( O ) elemental things , to which you desire to be enslaved all over again ?
NASB1995	Galatians	4	10	You ( P ) observe days and months and seasons and years .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	11	I fear for you , that perhaps I have labored [ i ] over you in vain .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	12	I beg of you , ( Q ) brethren , ( R ) become as I am , for I also have become as you are . You have done me no wrong ;
NASB1995	Galatians	4	13	but you know that it was because of a [ j ] bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the [ k ] first time ;
NASB1995	Galatians	4	14	and that which was a [ l ] trial to you in my [ m ] bodily condition you did not despise or [ n ] loathe , but ( S ) you received me as an angel of God , as ( T ) Christ Jesus Himself .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	15	Where then is [ o ] that sense of blessing you had ? For I bear you witness that , if possible , you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	16	So have I become your enemy ( U ) by [ p ] telling you the truth ?
NASB1995	Galatians	4	17	They eagerly seek you , not commendably , but they wish to shut you out so that you will seek them .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	18	But it is good always to be eagerly sought in a commendable [ q ] manner , and ( V ) not only when I am present with you .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	19	( W ) My children , with whom ( X ) I am again in labor until ( Y ) Christ is formed in you—
NASB1995	Galatians	4	20	but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone , for ( Z ) I am perplexed about you . Bond and Free
NASB1995	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , you who want to be under law , do you not ( AA ) listen to the law ?
NASB1995	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , ( AB ) one by the bondwoman and ( AC ) one by the free woman .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	23	But ( AD ) the son by the bondwoman [ r ] was born according to the flesh , and ( AE ) the son by the free woman through the promise .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	24	[ s ] ( AF ) This is allegorically speaking , for these women are two covenants : one proceeding from ( AG ) Mount Sinai bearing children [ t ] who are to be ( AH ) slaves ; [ u ] she is Hagar .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	25	Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery with her children .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	26	But ( AI ) the Jerusalem above is free ; [ v ] she is our mother .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	27	For it is written , “ ( AJ ) Rejoice , barren woman who does not bear ; Break forth and shout , you who are not in labor ; For more numerous are the children of the desolate Than of the one who has a husband. ”
NASB1995	Galatians	4	28	And you brethren , ( AK ) like Isaac , are ( AL ) children of promise .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	29	But as at that time ( AM ) he who was born according to the flesh ( AN ) persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , ( AO ) so it is now also .
NASB1995	Galatians	4	30	But what does the Scripture say ? “ ( AP ) Cast out the bondwoman and her son , For ( AQ ) the son of the bondwoman shall not be an heir with the son of the free woman. ”
NASB1995	Galatians	4	31	So then , brethren , we are not children of a bondwoman , [ w ] but of the free woman .

NASB1995	Galatians	5	2	Behold I , ( D ) Paul , say to you that if you receive ( E ) circumcision , Christ will be of no benefit to you .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	3	And I ( F ) testify again to every man who receives ( G ) circumcision , that he is under obligation to ( H ) keep the whole Law .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	4	You have been severed from Christ , you who [ b ] are seeking to be justified by law ; you have ( I ) fallen from grace .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	6	For in ( K ) Christ Jesus ( L ) neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything , but ( M ) faith working through love .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	7	You were ( N ) running well ; who hindered you from obeying the truth ?
NASB1995	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion did not come from ( O ) Him who calls you .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	9	( P ) A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	10	( Q ) I have confidence [ e ] in you in the Lord that you ( R ) will adopt no other view ; but the one who is ( S ) disturbing you will bear his judgment , whoever he is .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	11	But I , brethren , if I still preach circumcision , why am I still ( T ) persecuted ? Then ( U ) the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	12	I wish that ( V ) those who are troubling you would even [ f ] ( W ) mutilate themselves .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	13	For you were called to ( X ) freedom , brethren ; ( Y ) only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh , but through love ( Z ) serve one another .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	14	For ( AA ) the whole Law is fulfilled in one word , in the statement , “ ( AB ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”
NASB1995	Galatians	5	15	But if you ( AC ) bite and devour one another , take care that you are not consumed by one another .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	16	But I say , ( AD ) walk by the Spirit , and you will not carry out ( AE ) the desire of the flesh .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	17	For ( AF ) the flesh [ g ] sets its desire against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; for these are in opposition to one another , ( AG ) so that you may not do the things that you [ h ] please .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	18	But if you are ( AH ) led by the Spirit , ( AI ) you are not under the Law .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	19	Now the deeds of the flesh are evident , which are : [ i ] ( AJ ) immorality , impurity , sensuality ,
NASB1995	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , ( AK ) sorcery , enmities , ( AL ) strife , jealousy , outbursts of anger , ( AM ) disputes , dissensions , [ j ] ( AN ) factions ,
NASB1995	Galatians	5	21	envying , ( AO ) drunkenness , carousing , and things like these , of which I forewarn you , just as I have forewarned you , that those who practice such things will not ( AP ) inherit the kingdom of God .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	22	But ( AQ ) the fruit of the Spirit is ( AR ) love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
NASB1995	Galatians	5	23	gentleness , ( AS ) self-control ; against such things ( AT ) there is no law .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	24	Now those who [ k ] belong to ( AU ) Christ Jesus have ( AV ) crucified the flesh with its passions and ( AW ) desires .
NASB1995	Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit , let us also [ l ] walk ( AX ) by the Spirit .

NASB1995	Galatians	6	8	( P ) For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap ( Q ) corruption , but ( R ) the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
NASB1995	Galatians	6	9	( S ) Let us not lose heart in doing good , for in due time we will reap if we ( T ) do not grow weary .

NASB1995	Galatians	6	12	Those who desire ( Y ) to make a good showing in the flesh try to ( Z ) compel you to be circumcised , simply so that they ( AA ) will not be persecuted [ d ] for the cross of Christ .
NASB1995	Galatians	6	13	For those who [ e ] are circumcised do not even ( AB ) keep [ f ] the Law themselves , but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may ( AC ) boast in your flesh .
NASB1995	Galatians	6	14	But ( AD ) may it never be that I would boast , ( AE ) except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , ( AF ) through [ g ] which the world has been crucified to me , and ( AG ) I to the world .

NASB1995	Ephesians	2	4	But God , being ( K ) rich in mercy , because of ( L ) His great love with which He loved us ,
NASB1995	Ephesians	2	5	even when we were ( M ) dead [ f ] in our transgressions , made us alive together [ g ] with Christ ( ( N ) by grace you have been saved ) ,

NASB1995	Ephesians	2	7	so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing ( S ) riches of His grace in ( T ) kindness toward us in Christ Jesus .

NASB1995	Ephesians	2	9	( X ) not as a result of works , so that ( Y ) no one may boast .
NASB1995	Ephesians	2	10	For we are His workmanship , ( Z ) created in ( AA ) Christ Jesus for ( AB ) good works , which God ( AC ) prepared beforehand so that we would ( AD ) walk in them .
NASB1995	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore remember that ( AE ) formerly ( AF ) you , the Gentiles in the flesh , who are called “ ( AG ) Uncircumcision ” by the so-called “ ( AH ) Circumcision , ” which is performed in the flesh by human hands—
NASB1995	Ephesians	2	12	remember that you were at that time separate from Christ , [ i ] ( AI ) excluded from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers to ( AJ ) the covenants of promise , having ( AK ) no hope and ( AL ) without God in the world .
NASB1995	Ephesians	2	13	But now in ( AM ) Christ Jesus you who ( AN ) formerly were ( AO ) far off [ j ] have ( AP ) been brought near [ k ] ( AQ ) by the blood of Christ .
NASB1995	Ephesians	2	14	For He Himself is ( AR ) our peace , ( AS ) who made both groups into one and broke down the [ l ] barrier of the dividing wall ,
NASB1995	Ephesians	2	15	[ m ] by ( AT ) abolishing in His flesh the enmity , which is ( AU ) the Law of commandments contained in ordinances , so that in Himself He might [ n ] ( AV ) make the two into ( AW ) one new man , thus establishing ( AX ) peace ,
NASB1995	Ephesians	2	16	and might ( AY ) reconcile them both in ( AZ ) one body to God through the cross , [ o ] by it having ( BA ) put to death the enmity .
NASB1995	Ephesians	2	17	And ( BB ) He came and preached ( BC ) peace to you who were ( BD ) far away , and peace to those who were ( BE ) near ;

NASB1995	Ephesians	4	21	if indeed you ( AZ ) have heard Him and have ( BA ) been taught in Him , just as truth is in Jesus ,
NASB1995	Ephesians	4	22	that , in reference to your former manner of life , you ( BB ) lay aside the ( BC ) old [ p ] self , which is being corrupted in accordance with the ( BD ) lusts of deceit ,

NASB1995	Ephesians	5	11	( W ) Do not participate in the unfruitful ( X ) deeds of ( Y ) darkness , but instead even [ g ] ( Z ) expose them ;
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	12	for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret .
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	13	But all things become visible ( AA ) when they are [ h ] exposed by the light , for everything that becomes visible is light .

NASB1995	Ephesians	5	22	( AV ) Wives , ( AW ) be subject to your own husbands , ( AX ) as to the Lord .
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	23	For ( AY ) the husband is the head of the wife , as Christ also is the ( AZ ) head of the church , He Himself ( BA ) being the Savior of the body .
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	24	But as the church is subject to Christ , so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything .
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	25	( BB ) Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ also loved the church and ( BC ) gave Himself up for her ,
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	26	( BD ) so that He might sanctify her , having ( BE ) cleansed her by the ( BF ) washing of water with ( BG ) the word ,
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	27	that He might ( BH ) present to Himself the church [ q ] in all her glory , having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing ; but that she would be ( BI ) holy and blameless .
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	28	So husbands ought also to ( BJ ) love their own wives as their own bodies . He who loves his own wife loves himself ;
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	29	for no one ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , just as Christ also does the church ,
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	30	because we are ( BK ) members of His ( BL ) body .
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	31	( BM ) For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh .
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	32	This mystery is great ; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church .
NASB1995	Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless , each individual among you also is to ( BN ) love his own wife even as himself , and the wife must see to it that she [ r ] ( BO ) respects her husband .

NASB1995	Philippians	1	7	[ d ] For ( Q ) it is only right for me to feel this way about you all , because I ( R ) have you in my heart , since both in my [ e ] ( S ) imprisonment and in the ( T ) defense and confirmation of the ( U ) gospel , you all are partakers of grace with me .
NASB1995	Philippians	1	8	For ( V ) God is my witness , how I long for you all with the [ f ] affection of ( W ) Christ Jesus .
NASB1995	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray , that ( X ) your love may abound still more and more in ( Y ) real knowledge and all discernment ,
NASB1995	Philippians	1	10	so that you may [ g ] ( Z ) approve the things that are excellent , in order to be sincere and blameless [ h ] until ( AA ) the day of Christ ;
NASB1995	Philippians	1	11	having been filled with the ( AB ) fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ , to the glory and praise of God . The Gospel Is Preached
NASB1995	Philippians	1	12	Now I want you to know , brethren , that my circumstances ( AC ) have turned out for the greater progress of the ( AD ) gospel ,
NASB1995	Philippians	1	13	so that my [ i ] ( AE ) imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole [ j ] praetorian guard and to ( AF ) everyone else ,
NASB1995	Philippians	1	14	and that most of the [ k ] brethren , trusting in the Lord because of my [ l ] ( AG ) imprisonment , have ( AH ) far more courage to speak the word of God without fear .
NASB1995	Philippians	1	15	( AI ) Some , to be sure , are preaching Christ even [ m ] from envy and strife , but some also [ n ] from good will ;
NASB1995	Philippians	1	16	the latter do it out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the ( AJ ) gospel ;
NASB1995	Philippians	1	17	the former proclaim Christ ( AK ) out of selfish ambition [ o ] rather than from pure motives , thinking to cause me distress in my [ p ] ( AL ) imprisonment .
NASB1995	Philippians	1	18	What then ? Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed ; and in this I rejoice . Yes , and I will rejoice ,
NASB1995	Philippians	1	19	for I know that this will turn out for my [ q ] deliverance ( AM ) through your [ r ] prayers and the provision of ( AN ) the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
NASB1995	Philippians	1	20	according to my ( AO ) earnest expectation and ( AP ) hope , that I will not be put to shame in anything , but that with ( AQ ) all boldness , Christ will even now , as always , be ( AR ) exalted in my body , ( AS ) whether by life or by death . To Live Is Christ
NASB1995	Philippians	1	21	For to me , ( AT ) to live is Christ and to die is gain .
NASB1995	Philippians	1	22	[ s ] But if I am to live on in the flesh , this will mean ( AU ) fruitful labor for me ; and I do not know [ t ] which to choose .
NASB1995	Philippians	1	23	But I am hard-pressed from both directions , having the ( AV ) desire to depart and ( AW ) be with Christ , for that is very much better ;
NASB1995	Philippians	1	24	yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake .
NASB1995	Philippians	1	25	( AX ) Convinced of this , I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy [ u ] in the faith ,
NASB1995	Philippians	1	26	so that your ( AY ) proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again .
NASB1995	Philippians	1	27	Only conduct yourselves in a manner ( AZ ) worthy of the ( BA ) gospel of Christ , so that whether I come and see you or remain absent , I will hear of you that you are ( BB ) standing firm in ( BC ) one spirit , with one [ v ] mind ( BD ) striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
NASB1995	Philippians	1	28	in no way alarmed by your opponents—which is a ( BE ) sign of destruction for them , but of salvation for you , and that too , from God .
NASB1995	Philippians	1	29	For to you ( BF ) it has been granted for Christ ’ s sake , not only to believe in Him , but also to ( BG ) suffer for His sake ,
NASB1995	Philippians	1	30	experiencing the same ( BH ) conflict which ( BI ) you saw in me , and now hear to be in me .

NASB1995	Philippians	2	2	( C ) make my joy complete [ b ] by ( D ) being of the same mind , maintaining the same love , united in spirit , intent on one purpose .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	3	Do nothing [ c ] from [ d ] ( E ) selfishness or ( F ) empty conceit , but with humility of mind ( G ) regard one another as more important than yourselves ;
NASB1995	Philippians	2	4	( H ) do not merely look out for your own personal interests , but also for the interests of others .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	5	( I ) Have this attitude [ e ] in yourselves which was also in ( J ) Christ Jesus ,
NASB1995	Philippians	2	6	who , although He ( K ) existed in the ( L ) form of God , ( M ) did not regard equality with God a thing to be [ f ] grasped ,
NASB1995	Philippians	2	7	but [ g ] ( N ) emptied Himself , taking the form of a ( O ) bond-servant , and ( P ) being made in the likeness of men .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	8	Being found in appearance as a man , ( Q ) He humbled Himself by becoming ( R ) obedient to the point of death , even ( S ) death [ h ] on a cross .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	9	( T ) For this reason also , God ( U ) highly exalted Him , and bestowed on Him ( V ) the name which is above every name ,
NASB1995	Philippians	2	10	so that at the name of Jesus ( W ) every knee will bow , of ( X ) those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth ,
NASB1995	Philippians	2	11	and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is ( Y ) Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	12	So then , my beloved , ( Z ) just as you have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your ( AA ) salvation with ( AB ) fear and trembling ;
NASB1995	Philippians	2	13	for it is ( AC ) God who is at work in you , both to will and to work ( AD ) for His good pleasure .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without ( AE ) grumbling or disputing ;
NASB1995	Philippians	2	15	so that you will [ i ] prove yourselves to be ( AF ) blameless and innocent , ( AG ) children of God above reproach in the midst of a ( AH ) crooked and perverse generation , among whom you [ j ] ( AI ) appear as [ k ] lights in the world ,
NASB1995	Philippians	2	16	holding [ l ] fast the word of life , so that in ( AJ ) the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not ( AK ) run in vain nor ( AL ) toil in vain .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	17	But even if I am being ( AM ) poured out as a drink offering upon ( AN ) the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice and share my joy with you all .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	18	You too , I urge you , rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me . Timothy and Epaphroditus
NASB1995	Philippians	2	19	But I hope [ m ] in the Lord Jesus to ( AO ) send ( AP ) Timothy to you shortly , so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one else ( AQ ) of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	21	For they all ( AR ) seek after their own interests , not those of Christ Jesus .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	22	But you know ( AS ) of his proven worth , that ( AT ) he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel ( AU ) like a child serving his father .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	23	( AV ) Therefore I hope to send him immediately , as soon as I see how things go with me ;
NASB1995	Philippians	2	24	and ( AW ) I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	25	But I thought it necessary to send to you ( AX ) Epaphroditus , my brother and ( AY ) fellow worker and ( AZ ) fellow soldier , who is also your [ n ] ( BA ) messenger and ( BB ) minister to my need ;
NASB1995	Philippians	2	26	because he was longing [ o ] for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick to the point of death , but God had mercy on him , and not on him only but also on me , so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	28	Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you .
NASB1995	Philippians	2	29	( BC ) Receive him then in the Lord with all joy , and ( BD ) hold men like him in high regard ;
NASB1995	Philippians	2	30	because he came close to death [ p ] ( BE ) for the work of Christ , risking his life to ( BF ) complete [ q ] what was deficient in your service to me .

NASB1995	Philippians	3	3	for ( D ) we are the true [ b ] circumcision , who ( E ) worship in the Spirit of God and ( F ) glory in ( G ) Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh ,
NASB1995	Philippians	3	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Philippians	3	2	Beware of the ( B ) dogs , beware of the ( C ) evil workers , beware of the [ a ] false circumcision ;
NASB1995	Philippians	3	4	although ( H ) I myself might have confidence even in the flesh . If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh , I far more :
NASB1995	Philippians	3	5	( I ) circumcised the eighth day , of the ( J ) nation of Israel , of the ( K ) tribe of Benjamin , a ( L ) Hebrew of Hebrews ; as to the Law , ( M ) a Pharisee ;
NASB1995	Philippians	3	6	as to zeal , ( N ) a persecutor of the church ; as to the ( O ) righteousness which is in the Law , found ( P ) blameless .
NASB1995	Philippians	3	7	But ( Q ) whatever things were gain to me , those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ .
NASB1995	Philippians	3	8	More than that , I count all things to be loss [ c ] in view of the surpassing value of [ d ] ( R ) knowing ( S ) Christ Jesus my Lord , [ e ] for whom I have suffered the loss of all things , and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ ,
NASB1995	Philippians	3	9	and may be found in Him , not having ( T ) a righteousness of my own derived from the Law , but that which is through faith in Christ , ( U ) the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith ,
NASB1995	Philippians	3	10	that I may ( V ) know Him and ( W ) the power of His resurrection and [ f ] ( X ) the fellowship of His sufferings , being ( Y ) conformed to His death ;
NASB1995	Philippians	3	11	[ g ] in order that I may ( Z ) attain to the resurrection from the dead .
NASB1995	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already ( AA ) obtained it or have already ( AB ) become perfect , but I press on [ h ] so that I may ( AC ) lay hold of that [ i ] for which also I ( AD ) was laid hold of by ( AE ) Christ Jesus .
NASB1995	Philippians	3	13	Brethren , I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet ; but one thing I do : ( AF ) forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead ,
NASB1995	Philippians	3	14	I ( AG ) press on toward the goal for the prize of the ( AH ) upward call of God in ( AI ) Christ Jesus .
NASB1995	Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore , as many as are [ j ] ( AJ ) perfect , have this attitude ; and if in anything you have a ( AK ) different attitude , ( AL ) God will reveal that also to you ;
NASB1995	Philippians	3	16	however , let us keep [ k ] ( AM ) living by that same standard to which we have attained .
NASB1995	Philippians	3	17	Brethren , ( AN ) join in following my example , and observe those who walk according to the ( AO ) pattern you have in us .
NASB1995	Philippians	3	18	For ( AP ) many walk , of whom I often told you , and now tell you even ( AQ ) weeping , that they are enemies of ( AR ) the cross of Christ ,
NASB1995	Philippians	3	19	whose end is destruction , whose god is their [ l ] ( AS ) appetite , and whose ( AT ) glory is in their shame , who ( AU ) set their minds on earthly things .
NASB1995	Philippians	3	20	For ( AV ) our [ m ] citizenship is in heaven , from which also we eagerly ( AW ) wait for a Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ;
NASB1995	Philippians	3	21	who will ( AX ) transform [ n ] the body of our humble state into ( AY ) conformity with [ o ] the ( AZ ) body of His glory , ( BA ) by the exertion of the power that He has even to ( BB ) subject all things to Himself .

NASB1995	Philippians	4	5	Let your gentle spirit be known to all men . ( G ) The Lord is [ c ] near .

NASB1995	Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak [ g ] from want , for I have learned to be [ h ] ( R ) content in whatever circumstances I am .
NASB1995	Philippians	4	12	I know how to get along with humble means , and I also know how to live in prosperity ; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going ( S ) hungry , both of having abundance and ( T ) suffering need .
NASB1995	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things [ i ] through Him who ( U ) strengthens me .
NASB1995	Philippians	4	14	Nevertheless , you have done well to ( V ) share with me in my affliction .
NASB1995	Philippians	4	15	You yourselves also know , Philippians , that at the [ j ] ( W ) first preaching of the gospel , after I left ( X ) Macedonia , no church ( Y ) shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone ;
NASB1995	Philippians	4	16	for even in ( Z ) Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs .
NASB1995	Philippians	4	17	( AA ) Not that I seek the gift itself , but I seek for the [ k ] profit which increases to your account .
NASB1995	Philippians	4	18	But I have received everything in full and have an abundance ; I am [ l ] amply supplied , having received from ( AB ) Epaphroditus [ m ] what you have sent , [ n ] ( AC ) a fragrant aroma , an acceptable sacrifice , well-pleasing to God .
NASB1995	Philippians	4	19	And ( AD ) my God will supply [ o ] all your needs according to His ( AE ) riches in glory in Christ Jesus .

NASB1995	Colossians	1	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	2	To the [ c ] ( E ) saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae : ( F ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	3	( G ) We give thanks to God , ( H ) the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
NASB1995	Colossians	1	4	( I ) since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the ( J ) love which you have [ d ] for ( K ) all the [ e ] saints ;
NASB1995	Colossians	1	5	because of the ( L ) hope ( M ) laid up for you in [ f ] heaven , of which you previously ( N ) heard in the word of truth , [ g ] the gospel
NASB1995	Colossians	1	6	which has come to you , just as [ h ] ( O ) in all the world also it is constantly bearing ( P ) fruit and [ i ] increasing , even as it has been doing in you also since the day you ( Q ) heard of it and [ j ] understood the grace of God in truth ;
NASB1995	Colossians	1	7	just as you learned it from ( R ) Epaphras , our ( S ) beloved fellow bond-servant , who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf ,
NASB1995	Colossians	1	8	and he also informed us of your ( T ) love in the Spirit .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	9	For this reason also , ( U ) since the day we heard of it , ( V ) we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the [ k ] ( W ) knowledge of His will in all spiritual ( X ) wisdom and understanding ,
NASB1995	Colossians	1	10	so that you will ( Y ) walk in a manner worthy of the Lord , [ l ] ( Z ) to please Him in all respects , ( AA ) bearing fruit in every good work and [ m ] increasing in the [ n ] knowledge of God ;
NASB1995	Colossians	1	11	( AB ) strengthened with all power , according to [ o ] His glorious might , [ p ] for the attaining of all steadfastness and [ q ] patience ; ( AC ) joyously
NASB1995	Colossians	1	12	giving thanks to ( AD ) the Father , who has qualified us [ r ] to share in ( AE ) the inheritance of the [ s ] saints in ( AF ) Light . The Incomparable Christ
NASB1995	Colossians	1	13	[ t ] For He rescued us from the [ u ] ( AG ) domain of darkness , and transferred us to the kingdom of [ v ] ( AH ) His beloved Son ,
NASB1995	Colossians	1	14	( AI ) in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of sins .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	15	[ w ] He is the ( AJ ) image of the ( AK ) invisible God , the ( AL ) firstborn of all creation .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	16	For [ x ] ( AM ) by Him all things were created , ( AN ) both in the heavens and on earth , visible and invisible , whether ( AO ) thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities— ( AP ) all things have been created through Him and for Him .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	17	He [ y ] ( AQ ) is before all things , and in Him all things [ z ] hold together .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	18	He is also ( AR ) head of ( AS ) the body , the church ; and He is ( AT ) the beginning , ( AU ) the firstborn from the dead , so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	19	For [ aa ] it was ( AV ) the Father ’ s good pleasure for all ( AW ) the [ ab ] fullness to dwell in Him ,
NASB1995	Colossians	1	20	and through Him to ( AX ) reconcile all things to Himself , having made ( AY ) peace through ( AZ ) the blood of His cross ; through Him , I say , ( BA ) whether things on earth or things in [ ac ] heaven .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	21	And although you were ( BB ) formerly alienated and hostile in mind , engaged in evil deeds ,
NASB1995	Colossians	1	22	yet He has now ( BC ) reconciled you in His fleshly ( BD ) body through death , in order to ( BE ) present you before Him ( BF ) holy and blameless and beyond reproach—
NASB1995	Colossians	1	23	if indeed you continue in [ ad ] the faith firmly ( BG ) established and steadfast , and not moved away from the ( BH ) hope of the gospel that you have heard , which was proclaimed ( BI ) in all creation under heaven , ( BJ ) and of which I , Paul , [ ae ] was made a [ af ] ( BK ) minister .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	24	( BL ) Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and in my flesh ( BM ) I [ ag ] do my share on behalf of ( BN ) His body , which is the church , in filling up what is lacking [ ah ] in Christ ’ s afflictions .
NASB1995	Colossians	1	25	( BO ) Of this church I [ ai ] was made a minister according to the ( BP ) stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit , so that I might [ aj ] fully carry out the preaching of the word of God ,
NASB1995	Colossians	1	26	that is , ( BQ ) the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations , but has now been manifested to His [ ak ] saints ,
NASB1995	Colossians	1	27	to whom ( BR ) God willed to make known what is ( BS ) the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is ( BT ) Christ in you , the ( BU ) hope of glory .

NASB1995	Colossians	2	3	in whom are hidden all ( H ) the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
NASB1995	Colossians	2	4	( I ) I say this so that no one will delude you with ( J ) persuasive argument .
NASB1995	Colossians	2	5	For even though I am ( K ) absent in body , nevertheless I am with you in spirit , rejoicing [ c ] to see [ d ] your ( L ) good discipline and the ( M ) stability of your faith in Christ .
NASB1995	Colossians	2	6	Therefore as you have received ( N ) Christ Jesus the Lord , so [ e ] ( O ) walk in Him ,
NASB1995	Colossians	2	7	having been firmly ( P ) rooted and now being ( Q ) built up in Him and ( R ) established [ f ] in your faith , just as you ( S ) were instructed , and overflowing [ g ] with gratitude .
NASB1995	Colossians	2	8	( T ) See to it that no one takes you captive through ( U ) philosophy and empty deception , according to the tradition of men , according to the ( V ) elementary principles of the world , [ h ] rather than according to Christ .
NASB1995	Colossians	2	9	For in Him all the ( W ) fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form ,
NASB1995	Colossians	2	10	and in Him you have been ( X ) made [ i ] complete , and ( Y ) He is the head [ j ] over all ( Z ) rule and authority ;
NASB1995	Colossians	2	11	and in Him ( AA ) you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands , in the removal of ( AB ) the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ ;
NASB1995	Colossians	2	12	having been ( AC ) buried with Him in baptism , in which you were also ( AD ) raised up with Him through faith in the working of God , who ( AE ) raised Him from the dead .
NASB1995	Colossians	2	13	When you were ( AF ) dead [ k ] in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh , He ( AG ) made you alive together with Him , having forgiven us all our transgressions ,

NASB1995	Colossians	2	15	When He had [ l ] ( AJ ) disarmed the ( AK ) rulers and authorities , He ( AL ) made a public display of them , having ( AM ) triumphed over them through [ m ] Him .
NASB1995	Colossians	2	16	Therefore no one is to [ n ] ( AN ) act as your judge in regard to ( AO ) food or ( AP ) drink or in respect to a ( AQ ) festival or a ( AR ) new moon or a ( AS ) Sabbath [ o ] day—
NASB1995	Colossians	2	17	things which are ( AT ) a mere shadow of what is to come ; but the [ p ] substance [ q ] belongs to Christ .
NASB1995	Colossians	2	18	Let no one keep [ r ] ( AU ) defrauding you of your prize by ( AV ) delighting in [ s ] self-abasement and the worship of the angels , [ t ] taking his stand on visions he has seen , [ u ] ( AW ) inflated without cause by his ( AX ) fleshly mind ,
NASB1995	Colossians	2	19	and not holding fast to ( AY ) the head , from whom ( AZ ) the entire body , being supplied and held together by the joints and [ v ] ligaments , grows with a growth [ w ] which is from God .

NASB1995	Colossians	3	2	[ a ] ( C ) Set your mind on the things above , not on the things that are on earth .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	4	When Christ , ( E ) who is our life , is revealed , ( F ) then you also will be revealed with Him in glory .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	5	( G ) Therefore [ b ] consider ( H ) the members of your earthly body as dead to [ c ] ( I ) immorality , impurity , passion , evil desire , and greed , which [ d ] amounts to idolatry .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	6	For it is because of these things that ( J ) the wrath of God will come [ e ] upon the sons of disobedience ,
NASB1995	Colossians	3	7	and ( K ) in them you also once walked , when you were living [ f ] in them .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	8	But now you also , ( L ) put them all aside : ( M ) anger , wrath , malice , slander , and ( N ) abusive speech from your mouth .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	9	[ g ] ( O ) Do not lie to one another , since you ( P ) laid aside the old [ h ] self with its evil practices ,

NASB1995	Colossians	3	11	a renewal in which ( U ) there is no distinction between Greek and Jew , ( V ) circumcised and uncircumcised , [ j ] ( W ) barbarian , Scythian , ( X ) slave and freeman , but ( Y ) Christ is all , and in all .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	12	So , as those who have been ( Z ) chosen of God , holy and beloved , ( AA ) put on a ( AB ) heart of compassion , kindness , ( AC ) humility , gentleness and [ k ] ( AD ) patience ;
NASB1995	Colossians	3	13	( AE ) bearing with one another , and ( AF ) forgiving each other , whoever has a complaint against anyone ; ( AG ) just as the Lord forgave you , so also should you .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	14	Beyond all these things put on love , which is [ l ] ( AH ) the perfect bond of ( AI ) unity .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	15	Let ( AJ ) the peace of Christ [ m ] rule in your hearts , to which [ n ] indeed you were called in ( AK ) one body ; and [ o ] be thankful .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	16	Let ( AL ) the word of [ p ] Christ richly dwell within you , [ q ] with all wisdom ( AM ) teaching and admonishing [ r ] one another ( AN ) with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , ( AO ) singing [ s ] with thankfulness in your hearts to God .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	17	( AP ) Whatever you do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , ( AQ ) giving thanks through Him to God the Father . Family Relations
NASB1995	Colossians	3	18	( AR ) Wives , ( AS ) be subject to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	19	( AT ) Husbands , love your wives and do not be embittered against them .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	20	( AU ) Children , be obedient to your parents in all things , for this is well-pleasing [ t ] to the Lord .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	21	( AV ) Fathers , do not exasperate your children , so that they will not lose heart .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	22	( AW ) Slaves , in all things obey those who are your masters [ u ] on earth , ( AX ) not with [ v ] external service , as those who merely please men , but with sincerity of heart , fearing the Lord .
NASB1995	Colossians	3	23	Whatever you do , do your work [ w ] heartily , ( AY ) as for the Lord [ x ] rather than for men ,
NASB1995	Colossians	3	24	( AZ ) knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward [ y ] of ( BA ) the inheritance . It is the Lord Christ whom you ( BB ) serve .

NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	You also became ( R ) imitators of us and of the Lord , ( S ) having received ( T ) the word in much tribulation with the ( U ) joy of the Holy Spirit ,

NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	nor did we ( R ) seek glory from men , either from you or from others , even though as ( S ) apostles of Christ [ f ] we might have [ g ] asserted our authority .

NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what commandments we gave you [ c ] by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God , your sanctification ; that is , that you ( F ) abstain from [ d ] sexual immorality ;
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	not in [ g ] ( J ) lustful passion , like the Gentiles who ( K ) do not know God ;
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	and that no man transgress and ( L ) defraud his brother ( M ) in the matter because ( N ) the Lord is the avenger in all these things , just as we also ( O ) told you before and solemnly warned you .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	For ( P ) God has not called us for ( Q ) the purpose of impurity , but [ h ] in sanctification .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	So , he who rejects this is not rejecting man but the God who ( R ) gives His Holy Spirit to you .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	Now as to the ( S ) love of the brethren , you ( T ) have no need for anyone to write to you , for you yourselves are ( U ) taught by God to love one another ;
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	for indeed ( V ) you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia . But we urge you , brethren , to ( W ) excel still more ,
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	and to make it your ambition ( X ) to lead a quiet life and ( Y ) attend to your own business and ( Z ) work with your hands , just as we commanded you ,
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	so that you will [ i ] ( AA ) behave properly toward ( AB ) outsiders and [ j ] ( AC ) not be in any need . Those Who Died in Christ
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	But ( AD ) we do not want you to be uninformed , brethren , about those who ( AE ) are asleep , so that you will not grieve as do ( AF ) the rest who have ( AG ) no hope .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , ( AH ) even so God will bring with Him ( AI ) those who have fallen asleep [ k ] in Jesus .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	For this we say to you ( AJ ) by the word of the Lord , that ( AK ) we who are alive [ l ] and remain until ( AL ) the coming of the Lord , will not precede ( AM ) those who have fallen asleep .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord ( AN ) Himself ( AO ) will descend from heaven with a [ m ] ( AP ) shout , with the voice of ( AQ ) the archangel and with the ( AR ) trumpet of God , and ( AS ) the dead in Christ will rise first .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	Then ( AT ) we who are alive [ n ] and remain will be ( AU ) caught up together with them ( AV ) in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air , and so we shall always ( AW ) be with the Lord .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	4	18	Therefore comfort one another with these words . Footnotes -

NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	For you yourselves know full well that ( C ) the day of the Lord [ a ] will come ( D ) just like a thief in the night .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	While they are saying , “ ( E ) Peace and safety ! ” then [ b ] ( F ) destruction [ c ] will come upon them suddenly like ( G ) labor pains upon a woman with child , and they will not escape .

NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	so then let us not ( L ) sleep as [ e ] ( M ) others do , but let us be alert and [ f ] ( N ) sober .

NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	But since ( P ) we are of the day , let us ( Q ) be [ g ] sober , having put on the ( R ) breastplate of ( S ) faith and love , and as a ( T ) helmet , the ( U ) hope of salvation .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	For God has not destined us for ( V ) wrath , but for ( W ) obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	10	( X ) who died for us , so that whether we are awake or asleep , we will live together with Him .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	11	Therefore [ h ] encourage one another and ( Y ) build up one another , just as you also are doing . Christian Conduct
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	12	But we request of you , brethren , that you [ i ] ( Z ) appreciate those ( AA ) who diligently labor among you , and ( AB ) have charge over you in the Lord and give you [ j ] instruction ,

NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	14	We urge you , brethren , admonish ( AD ) the [ k ] unruly , encourage ( AE ) the fainthearted , help ( AF ) the weak , be ( AG ) patient with everyone .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	15	See that ( AH ) no one repays another with evil for evil , but always ( AI ) seek after that which is good for one another and for all people .
NASB1995	1%20Thessalonians	5	16	( AJ ) Rejoice always ;

NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	1	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We ought always ( F ) to give thanks to God for you , ( G ) brethren , as is only fitting , because your faith is greatly enlarged , and the ( H ) love of each one of you toward one another grows ever greater ;
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	therefore , we ourselves ( I ) speak proudly of you among ( J ) the churches of God for your [ a ] perseverance and faith ( K ) in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	This is a ( L ) plain indication of God ’ s righteous judgment so that you will be ( M ) considered worthy of the kingdom of God , for which indeed you are suffering .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	[ b ] For after all ( N ) it is only just [ c ] for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you ,
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	and to give relief to you who are afflicted [ d ] and to us as well [ e ] ( O ) when the Lord Jesus will be revealed ( P ) from heaven ( Q ) with [ f ] His mighty angels ( R ) in flaming fire ,
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	dealing out retribution to those who ( S ) do not know God and to those who ( T ) do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	These will pay the penalty of ( U ) eternal destruction , ( V ) away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power ,
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	when He comes to be ( W ) glorified [ g ] in His [ h ] saints on that ( X ) day , and to be marveled at among all who have believed—for our ( Y ) testimony to you was believed .

NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	( I ) Let no one in any way deceive you , for it will not come unless the [ d ] ( J ) apostasy comes first , and the ( K ) man of lawlessness is revealed , the ( L ) son of destruction ,
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	who opposes and exalts himself above [ e ] ( M ) every so-called god or object of worship , so that he takes his seat in the temple of God , ( N ) displaying himself as being God .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Do you not remember that ( O ) while I was still with you , I was telling you these things ?
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And you know ( P ) what restrains him now , so that in his time he will be revealed .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For ( Q ) the mystery of lawlessness is already at work ; only ( R ) he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	Then that lawless one ( S ) will be revealed whom the Lord will slay ( T ) with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the ( U ) appearance of His [ f ] coming ;
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	that is , the one whose [ g ] coming is in accord with the activity of ( V ) Satan , with all power and [ h ] ( W ) signs and false wonders ,
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	and with [ i ] all the deception of wickedness for ( X ) those who perish , because they did not receive the love of ( Y ) the truth so as to be saved .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	For this reason ( Z ) God [ j ] will send upon them [ k ] a ( AA ) deluding influence so that they will believe [ l ] what is false ,
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	in order that they all may be [ m ] judged who ( AB ) did not believe the truth , but [ n ] ( AC ) took pleasure in wickedness .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	( AD ) But we should always give thanks to God for you , ( AE ) brethren beloved by the Lord , because ( AF ) God has chosen you [ o ] from the beginning ( AG ) for salvation [ p ] ( AH ) through sanctification [ q ] by the Spirit and faith in the truth .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	It was for this He ( AI ) called you through ( AJ ) our gospel , [ r ] that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	So then , brethren , ( AK ) stand firm and ( AL ) hold to the traditions which you were taught , whether ( AM ) by word of mouth or ( AN ) by letter [ s ] from us .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	( AO ) Now may our Lord Jesus Christ ( AP ) Himself and God our Father , who has ( AQ ) loved us and given us eternal comfort and ( AR ) good hope by grace ,

NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For you yourselves know how you ought to [ j ] ( N ) follow our example , because we did not act in an undisciplined manner among you ,

NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	not because we do not have ( R ) the right to this , but in order to offer ourselves ( S ) as a model for you , so that you would [ m ] follow our example .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For even ( T ) when we were with you , we used to give you this order : ( U ) if anyone is not willing to work , then he is not to eat , either .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear that some among you are ( V ) leading an undisciplined life , doing no work at all , but acting like ( W ) busybodies .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Now such persons we command and ( X ) exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to ( Y ) work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread .
NASB1995	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	But as for you , ( Z ) brethren , ( AA ) do not grow weary of doing good .

NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I urged you [ a ] upon my departure for ( K ) Macedonia , [ b ] remain on at ( L ) Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to ( M ) teach strange doctrines ,
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	4	nor to [ c ] pay attention to ( N ) myths and endless ( O ) genealogies , which give rise to mere ( P ) speculation rather than ( Q ) furthering [ d ] the administration of God which is by faith .
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	5	But the goal of our [ e ] ( R ) instruction is love ( S ) from a pure heart and a ( T ) good conscience and a sincere ( U ) faith .
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	6	For some men , straying from these things , have turned aside to ( V ) fruitless discussion ,
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	7	( W ) wanting to be ( X ) teachers of the Law , even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions .
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	8	But we know that ( Y ) the Law is good , if one uses it lawfully ,
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	9	realizing the fact that ( Z ) law is not made for a righteous person , but for those who are lawless and ( AA ) rebellious , for the ( AB ) ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and ( AC ) profane , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	10	[ f ] and [ g ] ( AD ) immoral men [ h ] and ( AE ) homosexuals [ i ] and ( AF ) kidnappers [ j ] and ( AG ) liars [ k ] and ( AH ) perjurers , and whatever else is contrary to ( AI ) sound teaching ,
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	11	according to ( AJ ) the glorious gospel of ( AK ) the blessed God , with which I have been ( AL ) entrusted .
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	12	I thank ( AM ) Christ Jesus our Lord , who has ( AN ) strengthened me , because He considered me faithful , ( AO ) putting me into service ,
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	13	even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a ( AP ) persecutor and a violent aggressor . Yet I was ( AQ ) shown mercy because ( AR ) I acted ignorantly in unbelief ;
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	14	and the ( AS ) grace of our Lord was more than abundant , with the ( AT ) faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus .
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	15	( AU ) It is a trustworthy statement , deserving full acceptance , that ( AV ) Christ Jesus came into the world to ( AW ) save sinners , among whom ( AX ) I am foremost of all .
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	16	Yet for this reason I ( AY ) found mercy , so that in me as the foremost , Jesus Christ might ( AZ ) demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those [ l ] who would believe in Him for eternal life .
NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now to the ( BA ) King [ m ] eternal , ( BB ) immortal , ( BC ) invisible , the ( BD ) only God , ( BE ) be honor and glory [ n ] forever and ever . Amen .

NASB1995	1%20Timothy	1	19	keeping ( BJ ) faith and a good conscience , which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to [ p ] ( BK ) their faith .

NASB1995	Hebrews	2	9	But we do see Him who was ( T ) made [ j ] for a little while lower than the angels , namely , Jesus , ( U ) because of the suffering of death ( V ) crowned with glory and honor , so that ( W ) by the grace of God He might ( X ) taste death ( Y ) for everyone .

NASB1995	Hebrews	3	2	[ a ] He was faithful to Him who appointed Him , as ( F ) Moses also was in all His house .
NASB1995	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone , but the builder of all things is God .

NASB1995	Hebrews	3	6	but Christ was faithful as ( L ) a Son over His house— ( M ) whose house we are , ( N ) if we hold fast our ( O ) confidence and the boast of our ( P ) hope firm until the end .

NASB1995	Hebrews	4	7	He again fixes a certain day , “ Today , ” saying [ c ] through David after so long a time just ( J ) as has been said before , “ ( K ) Today if you hear His voice , Do not harden your hearts. ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	4	8	For ( L ) if [ d ] Joshua had given them rest , He would not have spoken of another day after that .
NASB1995	Hebrews	4	9	So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God .

NASB1995	Hebrews	4	12	For ( Q ) the word of God is ( R ) living and ( S ) active and sharper than any two-edged ( T ) sword , and piercing as far as the division of ( U ) soul and ( V ) spirit , of both joints and marrow , and ( W ) able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart .
NASB1995	Hebrews	4	13	And ( X ) there is no creature hidden from His sight , but all things are ( Y ) open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do .
NASB1995	Hebrews	4	14	Therefore , since we have a great ( Z ) high priest who has ( AA ) passed through the heavens , Jesus ( AB ) the Son of God , let us hold fast our ( AC ) confession .
NASB1995	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have ( AD ) a high priest who can not sympathize with our weaknesses , but One who has been ( AE ) tempted in all things as we are , yet ( AF ) without sin .

NASB1995	Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness , for he is an ( AF ) infant .

NASB1995	Hebrews	6	9	But , ( T ) beloved , we are convinced of better things concerning you , and things that [ h ] accompany salvation , though we are speaking in this way .
NASB1995	Hebrews	6	10	For ( U ) God is not unjust so as to forget ( V ) your work and the love which you have shown toward His name , in having ( W ) ministered and in still ministering to the [ i ] saints .

NASB1995	Hebrews	7	2	to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils , was first of all , by the translation of his name , king of righteousness , and then also king of Salem , which is king of peace .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	3	Without father , without mother , ( C ) without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like ( D ) the Son of God , he remains a priest perpetually .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	4	Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham , the ( E ) patriarch , ( F ) gave a tenth of the choicest spoils .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	5	And those indeed of ( G ) the sons of Levi who receive the priest ’ s office have commandment [ a ] in the Law to collect [ b ] a tenth from the people , that is , from their brethren , although these [ c ] are descended from Abraham .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	6	But the one ( H ) whose genealogy is not traced from them ( I ) collected [ d ] a tenth from Abraham and [ e ] ( J ) blessed the one who ( K ) had the promises .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	8	In this case mortal men receive tithes , but in that case one receives them , ( L ) of whom it is witnessed that he lives on .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	9	And , so to speak , through Abraham even Levi , who received tithes , paid tithes ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	10	for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	11	( M ) Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood ( for on the basis of it ( N ) the people received the Law ) , what further need was there for another priest to arise ( O ) according to the order of Melchizedek , and not be designated according to the order of Aaron ?
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	12	For when the priesthood is changed , of necessity there takes place a change of law also .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	13	For ( P ) the one concerning whom ( Q ) these things are spoken belongs to another tribe , from which no one has officiated at the altar .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord [ f ] was ( R ) descended from Judah , a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	15	And this is clearer still , if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	16	who has become such not on the basis of a law of [ g ] ( S ) physical requirement , but according to the power of ( T ) an indestructible life .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	17	For it is attested of Him , “ ( U ) You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek. ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	18	For , on the one hand , there is a setting aside of a former commandment ( V ) because of its weakness and uselessness
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	19	( for ( W ) the Law made nothing perfect ) , and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better ( X ) hope , through which we ( Y ) draw near to God .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as it was not without an oath
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	21	( for they indeed became priests without an oath , but He with an oath through the One who said to Him ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	22	so much the more also Jesus has become the ( AC ) guarantee of ( AD ) a better covenant .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	23	[ h ] The former priests , on the one hand , existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	24	but Jesus , on the other hand , because He continues ( AE ) forever , holds His priesthood permanently .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore He is able also to ( AF ) save [ i ] forever those who ( AG ) draw near to God through Him , since He always lives to ( AH ) make intercession for them .
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	26	For it was fitting for us to have such a ( AI ) high priest , ( AJ ) holy , ( AK ) innocent , undefiled , separated from sinners and ( AL ) exalted above the heavens ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	7	27	who does not need daily , like those high priests , to ( AM ) offer up sacrifices , ( AN ) first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people , because this He did ( AO ) once for all when He ( AP ) offered up Himself .

NASB1995	Hebrews	8	4	Now if He were on earth , He would not be a priest at all , since there are those who ( I ) offer the gifts according to the Law ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	8	5	who serve ( J ) a copy and ( K ) shadow of the heavenly things , just as Moses [ d ] was ( L ) warned by God when he was about to erect the [ e ] tabernacle ; for , “ ( M ) See , ” He says , “ that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain. ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	8	6	But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry , by as much as He is also the ( N ) mediator of ( O ) a better covenant , which has been enacted on better promises . A New Covenant

NASB1995	Hebrews	9	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	2	For there was ( C ) a [ a ] tabernacle prepared , the [ b ] outer one , in which were ( D ) the lampstand and ( E ) the table and ( F ) the [ c ] sacred bread ; this is called the holy place .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	3	Behind ( G ) the second veil there was a [ d ] tabernacle which is called the ( H ) Holy of Holies ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	4	having a golden [ e ] ( I ) altar of incense and ( J ) the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold , in which was ( K ) a golden jar holding the manna , and ( L ) Aaron ’ s rod which budded , and ( M ) the tables of the covenant ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	5	and above it were the ( N ) cherubim of glory ( O ) overshadowing the mercy seat ; but of these things we can not now speak in detail .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things have been so prepared , the priests ( P ) are continually entering the [ f ] outer [ g ] tabernacle performing the divine worship ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	7	but into ( Q ) the second , only ( R ) the high priest enters ( S ) once a year , ( T ) not without taking blood , which he ( U ) offers for himself and for the [ h ] ( V ) sins of the people committed in ignorance .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	8	( W ) The Holy Spirit is signifying this , ( X ) that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the [ i ] outer tabernacle is still standing ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	10	since they relate only to ( AA ) food and ( AB ) drink and various ( AC ) washings , ( AD ) regulations for the [ j ] body imposed until ( AE ) a time of reformation .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	11	But when Christ appeared as a ( AF ) high priest of the ( AG ) good things [ k ] to come , He entered through ( AH ) the greater and more perfect [ l ] tabernacle , ( AI ) not made with hands , that is to say , ( AJ ) not of this creation ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	12	and not through ( AK ) the blood of goats and calves , but ( AL ) through His own blood , He ( AM ) entered the holy place ( AN ) once for all , [ m ] having obtained ( AO ) eternal redemption .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	13	For if ( AP ) the blood of goats and bulls and ( AQ ) the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the [ n ] cleansing of the flesh ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	14	how much more will ( AR ) the blood of Christ , who through [ o ] ( AS ) the eternal Spirit ( AT ) offered Himself without blemish to God , ( AU ) cleanse [ p ] your conscience from ( AV ) dead works to serve ( AW ) the living God ?
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	15	For this reason ( AX ) He is the ( AY ) mediator of a ( AZ ) new covenant , so that , since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant , those who have been ( BA ) called may ( BB ) receive the promise of ( BC ) the eternal inheritance .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	16	For where a [ q ] covenant is , there must of necessity [ r ] be the death of the one who made it .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	17	For a [ s ] covenant is valid only when [ t ] men are dead , [ u ] for it is never in force while the one who made it lives .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	18	Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment had been ( BD ) spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law , ( BE ) he took the ( BF ) blood of the calves and the goats , with ( BG ) water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both ( BH ) the book itself and all the people ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	20	saying , “ ( BI ) This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you. ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	21	And in the same way he ( BJ ) sprinkled both the [ v ] tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	22	And according to the [ w ] Law , one may ( BK ) almost say , all things are cleansed with blood , and ( BL ) without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	23	Therefore it was necessary for the ( BM ) copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these , but ( BN ) the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ ( BO ) did not enter a holy place made with hands , a mere copy of ( BP ) the true one , but into ( BQ ) heaven itself , now ( BR ) to appear in the presence of God for us ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	25	nor was it that He would offer Himself often , as ( BS ) the high priest enters ( BT ) the holy place ( BU ) year by year with blood that is not his own .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	26	Otherwise , He would have needed to suffer often since ( BV ) the foundation of the world ; but now ( BW ) once at ( BX ) the consummation of the ages He has been ( BY ) manifested to put away sin [ x ] ( BZ ) by the sacrifice of Himself .
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	27	And inasmuch as ( CA ) it is [ y ] appointed for men to die once and after this ( CB ) comes judgment ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	9	28	so Christ also , having been ( CC ) offered once to ( CD ) bear the sins of many , will appear ( CE ) a second time for ( CF ) salvation ( CG ) without reference to sin , to those who ( CH ) eagerly await Him .

NASB1995	Hebrews	10	4	For it is ( G ) impossible for the ( H ) blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore , ( I ) when He comes into the world , He says , “ ( J ) Sacrifice and offering You have not desired , But ( K ) a body You have prepared for Me ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	6	( L ) In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You have taken no pleasure .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	7	“ ( M ) Then I said , ‘ Behold , I have come ( In ( N ) the scroll of the book it is written of Me ) To do Your will , O God. ’ ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	8	After saying above , “ ( O ) Sacrifices and offerings and ( P ) whole burnt offerings and sacrifices ( Q ) for sin You have not desired , nor have You taken pleasure in them ” ( which are offered according to the Law ) ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	9	then He [ d ] said , “ ( R ) Behold , I have come to do Your will. ” He takes away the first in order to establish the second .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	11	Every priest stands daily ministering and ( W ) offering time after time the same sacrifices , which ( X ) can never take away sins ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	12	but He , having offered one sacrifice ( Y ) for [ f ] sins ( Z ) for all time , ( AA ) sat down at the right hand of God ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	13	waiting from that time onward ( AB ) until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering He has ( AC ) perfected ( AD ) for all time those who are [ g ] sanctified .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	15	And ( AE ) the Holy Spirit also testifies to us ; for after saying ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	16	“ ( AF ) This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days , says the Lord : I will put My laws upon their heart , And on their mind I will write them , ” He then says ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	17	“ ( AG ) And their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more. ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	18	Now where there is forgiveness of these things , there is no longer any offering for sin . A New and Living Way
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	19	Therefore , brethren , since we ( AH ) have confidence to ( AI ) enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	20	by ( AJ ) a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through ( AK ) the veil , that is , His flesh ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	21	and since we have ( AL ) a great priest ( AM ) over the house of God ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	22	let us ( AN ) draw near with a [ h ] sincere heart in ( AO ) full assurance of faith , having our hearts ( AP ) sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies ( AQ ) washed with pure water .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the ( AR ) confession of our ( AS ) hope without wavering , for ( AT ) He who promised is faithful ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	24	and let us consider how ( AU ) to stimulate one another to love and ( AV ) good deeds ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	25	not forsaking our own ( AW ) assembling together , as is the habit of some , but ( AX ) encouraging one another ; and all the more as you see ( AY ) the day drawing near . Christ or Judgment
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	26	For if we go on ( AZ ) sinning willfully after receiving ( BA ) the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	27	but a terrifying expectation of ( BB ) judgment and ( BC ) the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	28	( BD ) Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	29	( BE ) How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve ( BF ) who has trampled under foot the Son of God , and has regarded as unclean ( BG ) the blood of the covenant ( BH ) by which he was sanctified , and has ( BI ) insulted the Spirit of grace ?
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	30	For we know Him who said , “ ( BJ ) Vengeance is Mine , I will repay. ” And again , “ ( BK ) The Lord will judge His people. ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	31	It is a ( BL ) terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the ( BM ) living God .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	32	But remember ( BN ) the former days , [ i ] when , after being ( BO ) enlightened , you endured a great ( BP ) conflict of sufferings ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	33	partly by being ( BQ ) made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations , and partly by becoming ( BR ) sharers with those who were so treated .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	34	For you ( BS ) showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted ( BT ) joyfully the seizure of your property , knowing that you have for yourselves ( BU ) a better possession and a lasting one .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	35	Therefore , do not throw away your ( BV ) confidence , which has a great ( BW ) reward .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	36	For you have need of ( BX ) endurance , so that when you have ( BY ) done the will of God , you may ( BZ ) receive [ j ] what was promised .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	37	( CA ) For yet in a very little while , ( CB ) He who is coming will come , and will not delay .
NASB1995	Hebrews	10	38	( CC ) But My righteous one shall live by faith ; And if he shrinks back , My soul has no pleasure in him .

NASB1995	Hebrews	11	2	For by it the ( D ) men of old [ d ] ( E ) gained approval .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the [ e ] ( F ) worlds were prepared ( G ) by the word of God , so that what is seen ( H ) was not made out of things which are visible .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	4	By faith ( I ) Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain , through which he ( J ) obtained the testimony that he was righteous , God testifying [ f ] about his ( K ) gifts , and through [ g ] faith , though ( L ) he is dead , he still speaks .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	5	By faith ( M ) Enoch was taken up so that he would not ( N ) see death ; and he was not found because God took him up ; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	6	And without faith it is impossible to please Him , for he who ( O ) comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	7	By faith ( P ) Noah , being ( Q ) warned by God about ( R ) things not yet seen , [ h ] ( S ) in reverence ( T ) prepared an ark for the salvation of his household , by which he condemned the world , and became an heir of ( U ) the righteousness which is according to faith .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	8	By faith ( V ) Abraham , when he was called , obeyed [ i ] by going out to a place which he was to ( W ) receive for an inheritance ; and he went out , not knowing where he was going .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he lived as an alien in ( X ) the land of promise , as in a foreign land , ( Y ) dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob , ( Z ) fellow heirs of the same promise ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	10	for he was looking for ( AA ) the city which has ( AB ) foundations , ( AC ) whose architect and builder is God .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	12	Therefore there was born even of one man , and ( AF ) him as good as dead [ k ] at that , as many descendants ( AG ) as the stars of heaven in number , and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	13	( AH ) All these died in faith , ( AI ) without receiving the promises , but ( AJ ) having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance , and ( AK ) having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	14	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	15	And indeed if they had been [ l ] thinking of that country from which they went out , ( AL ) they would have had opportunity to return .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	16	But as it is , they desire a better country , that is , a ( AM ) heavenly one . Therefore ( AN ) God is not [ m ] ashamed to be ( AO ) called their God ; for ( AP ) He has prepared a city for them .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	17	By faith ( AQ ) Abraham , when he was tested , offered up Isaac , and he who had ( AR ) received the promises was offering up his only begotten son ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	18	it was he to whom it was said , “ ( AS ) In Isaac your [ n ] descendants shall be called. ”

NASB1995	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , ( BB ) when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	25	choosing rather to ( BC ) endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	26	( BD ) considering the reproach of [ q ] Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt ; for he was looking to the ( BE ) reward .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he ( BF ) left Egypt , not ( BG ) fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured , as ( BH ) seeing Him who is unseen .

NASB1995	Hebrews	11	30	By faith ( BL ) the walls of Jericho fell down ( BM ) after they had been encircled for seven days .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	31	By faith ( BN ) Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient , after she had welcomed the spies [ t ] in peace .
NASB1995	Hebrews	11	32	And what more shall I say ? For time will fail me if I tell of ( BO ) Gideon , ( BP ) Barak , ( BQ ) Samson , ( BR ) Jephthah , of ( BS ) David and ( BT ) Samuel and the prophets ,

NASB1995	Hebrews	12	2	[ a ] fixing our eyes on Jesus , the [ b ] ( D ) author and perfecter of faith , who for the joy set before Him ( E ) endured the cross , ( F ) despising the shame , and has ( G ) sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	3	For ( H ) consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself , so that you will not grow weary [ c ] ( I ) and lose heart . A Father ’ s Discipline
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	4	( J ) You have not yet resisted [ d ] ( K ) to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	5	and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons , “ ( L ) My son , do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord , Nor ( M ) faint when you are reproved by Him ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	6	( N ) For those ( O ) whom the Lord loves He disciplines , And He scourges every son whom He receives. ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	7	It is for discipline that you endure ; ( P ) God deals with you as with sons ; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline ?
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	8	But if you are without discipline , ( Q ) of which all have become partakers , then you are illegitimate children and not sons .
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore , we had [ e ] earthly fathers to discipline us , and we ( R ) respected them ; shall we not much rather be subject to ( S ) the Father of [ f ] spirits , and ( T ) live ?
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	10	For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them , but He disciplines us for our good , ( U ) so that we may share His holiness .
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	11	All discipline ( V ) for the moment seems not to be joyful , but sorrowful ; yet to those who have been trained by it , afterwards it yields the ( W ) peaceful fruit of righteousness .
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	13	and ( Y ) make straight paths for your feet , so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint , but rather ( Z ) be healed .
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	14	( AA ) Pursue peace with all men , and the ( AB ) sanctification without which no one will ( AC ) see the Lord .
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	15	See to it that no one ( AD ) comes short of the grace of God ; that no ( AE ) root of bitterness springing up causes trouble , and by it many be ( AF ) defiled ;
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	16	that there be no ( AG ) immoral or ( AH ) godless person like Esau , ( AI ) who sold his own birthright for a single meal .
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that even afterwards , ( AJ ) when he desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no place for repentance , though he sought for it with tears . Contrast of Sinai and Zion
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	18	( AK ) For you have not come to ( AL ) a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire , and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	19	and to the ( AM ) blast of a trumpet and the ( AN ) sound of words which sound was such that those who heard ( AO ) begged that no further word be spoken to them .
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	20	For they could not bear the command , “ ( AP ) If even a beast touches the mountain , it will be stoned. ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	21	And so terrible was the sight , that Moses said , “ ( AQ ) I am full of fear and trembling. ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	22	But ( AR ) you have come to Mount Zion and to ( AS ) the city of ( AT ) the living God , ( AU ) the heavenly Jerusalem , and to ( AV ) myriads of [ h ] angels ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	23	to the general assembly and ( AW ) church of the firstborn who ( AX ) are enrolled in heaven , and to God , ( AY ) the Judge of all , and to the ( AZ ) spirits of the righteous made perfect ,
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	24	and to Jesus , the ( BA ) mediator of a new covenant , and to the ( BB ) sprinkled blood , which speaks better than ( BC ) the blood of Abel . The Unshaken Kingdom
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	25	( BD ) See to it that you do not refuse Him who is ( BE ) speaking . For ( BF ) if those did not escape when they ( BG ) refused him who ( BH ) warned them on earth , [ i ] much less will we escape who turn away from Him who ( BI ) warns from heaven .
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	26	And ( BJ ) His voice shook the earth then , but now He has promised , saying , “ ( BK ) Yet once more I will shake not only the earth , but also the heaven. ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	27	This expression , “ Yet once more , ” denotes ( BL ) the removing of those things which can be shaken , as of created things , so that those things which can not be shaken may remain .
NASB1995	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore , since we receive a ( BM ) kingdom which can not be shaken , let us [ j ] show gratitude , by which we may ( BN ) offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe ;

NASB1995	Hebrews	13	4	( F ) Marriage is to be held in honor among all , and the marriage bed is to be undefiled ; ( G ) for fornicators and adulterers God will judge .
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	5	Make sure that your character is ( H ) free from the love of money , ( I ) being content with what you have ; for He Himself has said , “ ( J ) I will never desert you , nor will I ever forsake you , ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	6	so that we confidently say , “ ( K ) The Lord is my helper , I will not be afraid . What will man do to me ? ”
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	7	Remember ( L ) those who led you , who spoke ( M ) the word of God to you ; and considering the [ a ] result of their conduct , ( N ) imitate their faith .
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	8	( O ) Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever .
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	9	( P ) Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings ; for it is good for the heart to ( Q ) be strengthened by grace , not by ( R ) foods , ( S ) through which those who [ b ] were so occupied were not benefited .
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar ( T ) from which those ( U ) who serve the [ c ] tabernacle have no right to eat .
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	11	For ( V ) the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned outside the camp .
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	12	Therefore Jesus also , ( W ) that He might sanctify the people ( X ) through His own blood , suffered ( Y ) outside the gate .

NASB1995	Hebrews	13	15	( AC ) Through Him then , let us continually offer up a ( AD ) sacrifice of praise to God , that is , ( AE ) the fruit of lips that [ d ] give thanks to His name .
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	16	And do not neglect doing good and ( AF ) sharing , for ( AG ) with such sacrifices God is pleased .
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	17	( AH ) Obey your leaders and submit to them , for ( AI ) they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account . [ e ] Let them do this with joy and not [ f ] with grief , for this would be unprofitable for you .
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	18	( AJ ) Pray for us , for we are sure that we have a ( AK ) good conscience , desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things .
NASB1995	Hebrews	13	19	And I urge you all the more to do this , ( AL ) so that I may be restored to you the sooner . Benediction

NASB1995	James	1	2	( G ) Consider it all joy , my brethren , when you encounter ( H ) various [ c ] trials ,
NASB1995	James	1	3	, note
NASB1995	James	1	4	And let [ e ] ( L ) endurance have its perfect [ f ] result , so that you may be [ g ] ( M ) perfect and complete , lacking in nothing .
NASB1995	James	1	5	But if any of you ( N ) lacks wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all generously and [ h ] without reproach , and ( O ) it will be given to him .
NASB1995	James	1	6	But he must ( P ) ask in faith ( Q ) without any doubting , for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea , ( R ) driven and tossed by the wind .
NASB1995	James	1	7	For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord ,
NASB1995	James	1	8	being a [ i ] ( S ) double-minded man , ( T ) unstable in all his ways .
NASB1995	James	1	9	( U ) But the [ j ] brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position ;
NASB1995	James	1	10	and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation , because ( V ) like [ k ] flowering grass he will pass away .
NASB1995	James	1	11	For the sun rises with [ l ] ( W ) a scorching wind and ( X ) withers the grass ; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed ; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away .
NASB1995	James	1	12	( Y ) Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial ; for once he has [ m ] been approved , he will receive ( Z ) the crown of life which the Lord ( AA ) has promised to those who ( AB ) love Him .
NASB1995	James	1	13	Let no one say when he is tempted , “ ( AC ) I am being tempted [ n ] by God ” ; for God can not be tempted [ o ] by evil , and He Himself does not tempt anyone .
NASB1995	James	1	14	But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust .
NASB1995	James	1	15	Then ( AD ) when lust has conceived , it gives birth to sin ; and when ( AE ) sin [ p ] is accomplished , it brings forth death .
NASB1995	James	1	16	( AF ) Do not be [ q ] deceived , ( AG ) my beloved brethren .
NASB1995	James	1	17	Every good thing given and every perfect gift is ( AH ) from above , coming down from ( AI ) the Father of lights , ( AJ ) with whom there is no variation or [ r ] shifting shadow .
NASB1995	James	1	18	In the exercise of ( AK ) His will He ( AL ) brought us forth by ( AM ) the word of truth , so that we would be [ s ] a kind of ( AN ) first fruits [ t ] among His creatures .
NASB1995	James	1	19	[ u ] This ( AO ) you know , ( AP ) my beloved brethren . But everyone must be quick to hear , ( AQ ) slow to speak and ( AR ) slow to anger ;
NASB1995	James	1	20	for ( AS ) the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God .
NASB1995	James	1	21	Therefore , ( AT ) putting aside all filthiness and all [ v ] that remains of wickedness , in [ w ] humility receive ( AU ) the word implanted , which is able to save your souls .
NASB1995	James	1	22	( AV ) But prove yourselves doers of the word , and not merely hearers who delude themselves .
NASB1995	James	1	23	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man who looks at his [ x ] natural face ( AW ) in a mirror ;
NASB1995	James	1	24	for once he has looked at himself and gone away , [ y ] he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was .
NASB1995	James	1	25	But one who looks intently at the perfect law , ( AX ) the law of liberty , and abides by it , not having become a forgetful hearer but [ z ] an effectual doer , this man will be ( AY ) blessed in [ aa ] what he does .
NASB1995	James	1	26	If anyone thinks himself to be religious , and yet does not [ ab ] ( AZ ) bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart , this man ’ s religion is worthless .
NASB1995	James	1	27	Pure and undefiled religion ( BA ) in the sight of our God and Father is this : to ( BB ) visit ( BC ) orphans and widows in their distress , and to keep oneself unstained [ ac ] by ( BD ) the world .

NASB1995	James	2	3	and you [ c ] pay special attention to the one who is wearing the ( G ) fine clothes , and say , “ You sit here in a good place , ” and you say to the poor man , “ You stand over there , or sit down by my footstool , ”
NASB1995	James	2	4	have you not made distinctions among yourselves , and become judges ( H ) with evil [ d ] motives ?
NASB1995	James	2	5	Listen , ( I ) my beloved brethren : did not ( J ) God choose the poor [ e ] of this world to be ( K ) rich in faith and ( L ) heirs of the kingdom which He ( M ) promised to those who love Him ?
NASB1995	James	2	6	But you have dishonored the poor man . Is it not the rich who oppress you and [ f ] personally ( N ) drag you into [ g ] court ?
NASB1995	James	2	7	( O ) Do they not blaspheme the fair name [ h ] by which you have been called ?
NASB1995	James	2	8	If , however , you ( P ) are fulfilling the [ i ] royal law according to the Scripture , “ ( Q ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” you are doing well .
NASB1995	James	2	9	But if you ( R ) show partiality , you are committing sin and are convicted by the [ j ] law as transgressors .
NASB1995	James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole [ k ] law and yet ( S ) stumbles in one point , he has become ( T ) guilty of all .
NASB1995	James	2	11	For He who said , “ ( U ) Do not commit adultery , ” also said , “ ( V ) Do not commit murder. ” Now if you do not commit adultery , but do commit murder , you have become a transgressor of the [ l ] law .
NASB1995	James	2	12	So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by ( W ) the law of liberty .
NASB1995	James	2	13	For ( X ) judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy ; mercy [ m ] triumphs over judgment . Faith and Works
NASB1995	James	2	14	( Y ) What use is it , ( Z ) my brethren , if someone says he has faith but he has no works ? Can [ n ] that faith save him ?
NASB1995	James	2	15	( AA ) If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food ,
NASB1995	James	2	16	and one of you says to them , “ ( AB ) Go in peace , [ o ] be warmed and be filled , ” and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body , what use is that ?
NASB1995	James	2	17	Even so ( AC ) faith , if it has no works , is [ p ] dead , being by itself .
NASB1995	James	2	18	( AD ) But someone [ q ] may well say , “ You have faith and I have works ; show me your ( AE ) faith without the works , and I will ( AF ) show you my faith ( AG ) by my works. ”
NASB1995	James	2	19	You believe that [ r ] ( AH ) God is one . ( AI ) You do well ; ( AJ ) the demons also believe , and shudder .
NASB1995	James	2	20	But are you willing to recognize , ( AK ) you foolish fellow , that ( AL ) faith without works is useless ?
NASB1995	James	2	21	( AM ) Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar ?
NASB1995	James	2	22	You see that ( AN ) faith was working with his works , and [ s ] as a result of the ( AO ) works , faith was [ t ] perfected ;
NASB1995	James	2	23	and the Scripture was fulfilled which says , “ ( AP ) And Abraham believed God , and it was reckoned to him as righteousness , ” and he was called ( AQ ) the friend of God .
NASB1995	James	2	24	You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone .
NASB1995	James	2	25	In the same way , was not ( AR ) Rahab the harlot also justified by works ( AS ) when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way ?
NASB1995	James	2	26	For just as the body without the spirit is dead , so also ( AT ) faith without works is dead .

NASB1995	James	3	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	James	3	2	For we all ( C ) stumble in many ways . ( D ) If anyone does not stumble in [ b ] what he says , he is a ( E ) perfect man , able to ( F ) bridle the whole body as well .
NASB1995	James	3	4	Look at the ships also , though they are so great and are driven by strong winds , are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires .
NASB1995	James	3	5	So also the tongue is a small part of the body , and yet it ( H ) boasts of great things . ( I ) See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire !
NASB1995	James	3	6	And ( J ) the tongue is a fire , the very world of iniquity ; the tongue is set among our members as that which ( K ) defiles the entire body , and sets on fire the course of our [ c ] life , and is set on fire by [ d ] ( L ) hell .
NASB1995	James	3	7	For every [ e ] species of beasts and birds , of reptiles and creatures of the sea , is tamed and has been tamed by the human [ f ] race .
NASB1995	James	3	8	But no one can tame the tongue ; it is a restless evil and full of ( M ) deadly poison .
NASB1995	James	3	9	With it we bless ( N ) our Lord and Father , and with it we curse men , ( O ) who have been made in the likeness of God ;
NASB1995	James	3	10	from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not to be this way .
NASB1995	James	3	11	, note
NASB1995	James	3	12	( P ) Can a fig tree , my brethren , produce olives , or a vine produce figs ? Nor can salt water produce [ h ] fresh . Wisdom from Above

NASB1995	James	3	14	, note
NASB1995	James	3	15	This wisdom is not that which comes down ( U ) from above , but is ( V ) earthly , [ j ] ( W ) natural , ( X ) demonic .
NASB1995	James	3	16	For where ( Y ) jealousy and [ k ] selfish ambition exist , [ l ] there is disorder and every evil thing .
NASB1995	James	3	17	But the wisdom ( Z ) from above is first ( AA ) pure , then ( AB ) peaceable , ( AC ) gentle , [ m ] reasonable , ( AD ) full of mercy and good fruits , ( AE ) unwavering , without ( AF ) hypocrisy .

NASB1995	James	4	7	( M ) Submit therefore to God . ( N ) Resist the devil and he will flee from you .

NASB1995	James	4	10	( T ) Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord , and He will exalt you .
NASB1995	James	4	11	( U ) Do not speak against one another , ( V ) brethren . He who speaks against a brother or ( W ) judges his brother , speaks against ( X ) the law and judges the law ; but if you judge the law , you are not ( Y ) a doer of the law but a judge of it .
NASB1995	James	4	12	There is only one ( Z ) Lawgiver and Judge , the One who is ( AA ) able to save and to destroy ; but ( AB ) who are you who judge your neighbor ?

NASB1995	James	5	6	You have condemned and [ c ] ( K ) put to death ( L ) the righteous man ; he does not resist you . Exhortation
NASB1995	James	5	7	Therefore be patient , ( M ) brethren , ( N ) until the coming of the Lord . ( O ) The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil , being patient about it , until [ d ] it gets ( P ) the early and late rains .
NASB1995	James	5	8	( Q ) You too be patient ; ( R ) strengthen your hearts , for ( S ) the coming of the Lord is ( T ) near .

NASB1995	James	5	10	As an example , ( Y ) brethren , of suffering and patience , take ( Z ) the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
NASB1995	James	5	11	We count those ( AA ) blessed who endured . You have heard of ( AB ) the [ h ] endurance of Job and have seen ( AC ) the [ i ] outcome of the Lord ’ s dealings , that ( AD ) the Lord is full of compassion and is merciful .
NASB1995	James	5	12	But above all , ( AE ) my brethren , ( AF ) do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath ; but [ j ] your yes is to be yes , and your no , no , so that you may not fall under judgment .
NASB1995	James	5	13	Is anyone among you ( AG ) suffering ? ( AH ) Then he must pray . Is anyone cheerful ? He is to ( AI ) sing praises .
NASB1995	James	5	14	Is anyone among you sick ? Then he must call for ( AJ ) the elders of the church and they are to pray over him , [ k ] ( AK ) anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ;
NASB1995	James	5	15	and the ( AL ) prayer [ l ] offered in faith will [ m ] ( AM ) restore the one who is sick , and the Lord will ( AN ) raise him up , and if he has committed sins , [ n ] they will be forgiven him .
NASB1995	James	5	16	Therefore , ( AO ) confess your sins to one another , and pray for one another so that you may be ( AP ) healed . ( AQ ) The effective [ o ] prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much .
NASB1995	James	5	17	Elijah was ( AR ) a man with a nature like ours , and ( AS ) he prayed [ p ] earnestly that it would not rain , and it did not rain on the earth for ( AT ) three years and six months .

NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	4	but let it be ( E ) the hidden person of the heart , with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is precious in the sight of God .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	5	For in this way in former times the holy women also , ( F ) who hoped in God , used to adorn themselves , being submissive to their own husbands ;
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	6	just as Sarah obeyed Abraham , ( G ) calling him lord , and you have become her children if you do what is right [ b ] ( H ) without being frightened by any fear .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	7	( I ) You husbands in the same way , live with your wives in an understanding way , as with [ c ] ( J ) someone weaker , since she is a woman ; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life , so that your prayers will not be hindered .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	8	[ d ] To sum up , ( K ) all of you be harmonious , sympathetic , ( L ) brotherly , ( M ) kindhearted , and ( N ) humble in spirit ;
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	9	( O ) not returning evil for evil or ( P ) insult for insult , but [ e ] giving a ( Q ) blessing instead ; for ( R ) you were called for the very purpose that you might ( S ) inherit a blessing .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	10	For , “ ( T ) The one who desires life , to love and see good days , Must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	11	“ ( U ) He must turn away from evil and do good ; He must seek peace and pursue it .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	12	“ ( V ) For the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous , And His ears attend to their prayer , But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil. ”
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	13	( W ) Who is [ f ] there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good ?
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	14	But even if you should ( X ) suffer for the sake of righteousness , ( Y ) you [ g ] are blessed . ( Z ) And do not fear their [ h ] intimidation , and do not be troubled ,
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	15	but [ i ] sanctify ( AA ) Christ as Lord in your hearts , always being ready ( AB ) to make a [ j ] defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the ( AC ) hope that is in you , yet ( AD ) with gentleness and [ k ] ( AE ) reverence ;
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	16	[ l ] and keep a ( AF ) good conscience so that in the thing in which ( AG ) you are slandered , those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	17	For ( AH ) it is better , ( AI ) if [ m ] God should will it so , that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	18	For ( AJ ) Christ also died for sins ( AK ) once for all , the just for the unjust , so that He might ( AL ) bring us to God , having been put to death ( AM ) in the flesh , but made alive ( AN ) in the [ n ] spirit ;
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	19	in [ o ] which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison ,
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	20	who once were disobedient , when the ( AO ) patience of God ( AP ) kept waiting in the days of Noah , during the construction of ( AQ ) the ark , in which a few , that is , ( AR ) eight ( AS ) persons , were brought safely through the [ p ] water .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	21	( AT ) Corresponding to that , baptism now saves you— ( AU ) not the removal of dirt from the flesh , but an appeal to God [ q ] for a ( AV ) good conscience—through ( AW ) the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
NASB1995	1%20Peter	3	22	( AX ) who is at the right hand of God , ( AY ) having gone into heaven , ( AZ ) after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him . Footnotes -

NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	2	( D ) so as to live ( E ) the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men , but for the ( F ) will of God .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	3	For ( G ) the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles , [ c ] ( H ) having pursued a course of sensuality , lusts , drunkenness , carousing , drinking parties and [ d ] abominable idolatries .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	5	but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge ( K ) the living and the dead .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	6	For ( L ) the gospel has for this purpose been [ e ] preached even to those who are dead , that though they are judged in the flesh as men , they may live in the spirit according to the will of God .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	7	( M ) The end of all things [ f ] is near ; therefore , ( N ) be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of [ g ] prayer .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	8	Above all , ( O ) keep fervent in your love for one another , because ( P ) love covers a multitude of sins .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	9	( Q ) Be hospitable to one another without ( R ) complaint .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	10	( S ) As each one has received a special gift , employ it in serving one another as good ( T ) stewards of the manifold grace of God .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	11	( U ) Whoever speaks , is to do so [ h ] as one who is speaking the ( V ) utterances of God ; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving [ i ] ( W ) by the strength which God supplies ; so that ( X ) in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ , ( Y ) to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever . Amen . Share the Sufferings of Christ
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	12	( Z ) Beloved , do not be surprised at the ( AA ) fiery ordeal among you , which comes upon you for your testing , as though some strange thing were happening to you ;
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	13	but to the degree that you ( AB ) share the sufferings of Christ , keep on rejoicing , so that also at the ( AC ) revelation of His glory ( AD ) you may rejoice with exultation .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	14	If you are reviled [ j ] ( AE ) for the name of Christ , ( AF ) you are blessed , ( AG ) because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	15	Make sure that ( AH ) none of you suffers as a murderer , or thief , or evildoer , or a [ k ] ( AI ) troublesome meddler ;
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	16	but if anyone suffers as a ( AJ ) Christian , he is not to be ashamed , but is to ( AK ) glorify God in this name .
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	17	For it is time for judgment ( AL ) to begin [ l ] with ( AM ) the household of God ; and if it ( AN ) begins with us first , what will be the outcome for those ( AO ) who do not obey the ( AP ) gospel of God ?
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	18	( AQ ) And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved , [ m ] what will become of the ( AR ) godless man and the sinner ?
NASB1995	1%20Peter	4	19	Therefore , those also who suffer according to ( AS ) the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right . Footnotes -

NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	1	[ a ] Simon Peter , a ( A ) bond-servant and ( B ) apostle of Jesus Christ , To those who have received ( C ) a faith of the same [ b ] kind as ours , [ c ] by ( D ) the righteousness of ( E ) our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	1995	by The Lockman Foundation . All rights reserved .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	3	seeing that His ( H ) divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness , through the true ( I ) knowledge of Him who ( J ) called us [ d ] by His own glory and [ e ] excellence .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	4	[ f ] For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent ( K ) promises , so that by them you may become ( L ) partakers of the divine nature , having ( M ) escaped the ( N ) corruption that is in ( O ) the world by lust .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	5	Now for this very reason also , applying all diligence , in your faith ( P ) supply ( Q ) moral [ g ] excellence , and in your moral excellence , ( R ) knowledge ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	6	and in your knowledge , ( S ) self-control , and in your self-control , ( T ) perseverance , and in your perseverance , ( U ) godliness ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	7	and in your godliness , ( V ) brotherly kindness , and in your brotherly kindness , love .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	8	For if these qualities are yours and are increasing , they render you neither useless nor ( W ) unfruitful in the true ( X ) knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	9	For he who lacks these qualities is ( Y ) blind or short-sighted , having forgotten his ( Z ) purification from his former sins .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	10	Therefore , brethren , be all the more diligent to make certain about His ( AA ) calling and ( AB ) choosing you ; for as long as you practice these things , you will never ( AC ) stumble ;
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	11	for in this way the entrance into ( AD ) the eternal kingdom of our ( AE ) Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be ( AF ) abundantly ( AG ) supplied to you .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	12	Therefore , ( AH ) I will always be ready to remind you of these things , even though you already know them , and have been established in ( AI ) the truth which is present with you .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	13	I consider it ( AJ ) right , as long as I am in ( AK ) this earthly dwelling , to ( AL ) stir you up by way of reminder ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	14	knowing that ( AM ) the laying aside of my earthly dwelling is imminent , ( AN ) as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	15	And I will also be diligent that at any time after my ( AO ) departure you will be able to call these things to mind . Eyewitnesses
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	16	For we did not follow cleverly devised ( AP ) tales when we made known to you the ( AQ ) power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were ( AR ) eyewitnesses of His majesty .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	17	For when He received honor and glory from God the Father , such an [ h ] ( AS ) utterance as this was [ i ] made to Him by the ( AT ) Majestic Glory , “ This is My beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased ” —
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	18	and we ourselves heard this [ j ] utterance made from heaven when we were with Him on the ( AU ) holy mountain .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	19	[ k ] So we have ( AV ) the prophetic word made more ( AW ) sure , to which you do well to pay attention as to ( AX ) a lamp shining in a dark place , until the ( AY ) day dawns and the ( AZ ) morning star arises ( BA ) in your hearts .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	20	But ( BB ) know this first of all , that ( BC ) no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one ’ s own interpretation ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	1	21	for ( BD ) no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will , but men ( BE ) moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God . Footnotes -

NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	4	For ( P ) if God did not spare angels when they sinned , but cast them into hell and ( Q ) committed them to pits of darkness , reserved for judgment ;
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	5	and did not spare ( R ) the ancient world , but preserved ( S ) Noah , a [ a ] preacher of righteousness , with seven others , when He brought a ( T ) flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	6	and if He ( U ) condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes , having made them an ( V ) example to those who would ( W ) live ungodly lives thereafter ;
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	7	and if He ( X ) rescued righteous Lot , oppressed by the ( Y ) sensual conduct of ( Z ) unprincipled men
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	8	( for by what he saw and heard that ( AA ) righteous man , while living among them , felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds ) ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	9	( AB ) then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from [ b ] temptation , and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the ( AC ) day of judgment ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	10	and especially those who [ c ] ( AD ) indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and ( AE ) despise authority . Daring , ( AF ) self-willed , they do not tremble when they ( AG ) revile angelic [ d ] majesties ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	11	( AH ) whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	12	But ( AI ) these , like unreasoning animals , ( AJ ) born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed , reviling where they have no knowledge , will in [ e ] the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	13	suffering wrong as ( AK ) the wages of doing wrong . They count it a pleasure to ( AL ) revel in the ( AM ) daytime . They are stains and blemishes , ( AN ) reveling in their [ f ] deceptions , as they ( AO ) carouse with you ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	14	having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin , ( AP ) enticing ( AQ ) unstable souls , having a heart trained in ( AR ) greed , ( AS ) accursed children ;
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	15	forsaking ( AT ) the right way , they have gone astray , having followed ( AU ) the way of Balaam , the son of Beor , who loved ( AV ) the wages of unrighteousness ;
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	16	but he received a rebuke for his own transgression , ( AW ) for a mute donkey , speaking with a voice of a man , restrained the madness of the prophet .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	17	These are ( AX ) springs without water and mists driven by a storm , ( AY ) for whom the [ g ] black darkness has been reserved .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	18	For speaking out ( AZ ) arrogant words of ( BA ) vanity they ( BB ) entice by fleshly desires , by ( BC ) sensuality , those who barely ( BD ) escape from the ones who live in error ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	19	promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption ; for ( BE ) by what a man is overcome , by this he is enslaved .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	20	For if , after they have ( BF ) escaped the defilements of the world by ( BG ) the knowledge of the ( BH ) Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again ( BI ) entangled in them and are overcome , ( BJ ) the last state has become worse for them than the first .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	21	( BK ) For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than having known it , to turn away from ( BL ) the holy commandment ( BM ) handed on to them .
NASB1995	2%20Peter	2	22	[ h ] It has happened to them according to the true proverb , “ ( BN ) A dog returns to its own vomit , ” and , “ A sow , after washing , returns to wallowing in the mire. ” Footnotes -

NASB1995	2%20Peter	3	5	For [ a ] when they maintain this , it escapes their notice that ( N ) by the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was ( O ) formed out of water and by water ,

NASB1995	2%20Peter	3	14	( AL ) Therefore , ( AM ) beloved , since you look for these things , be diligent to be ( AN ) found by Him in peace , ( AO ) spotless and blameless ,
NASB1995	2%20Peter	3	15	and regard the ( AP ) patience of our Lord as salvation ; just as also ( AQ ) our beloved brother Paul , ( AR ) according to the wisdom given him , wrote to you ,

NASB1995	2%20Peter	3	17	You therefore , ( AW ) beloved , knowing this beforehand , ( AX ) be on your guard so that you are not carried away by ( AY ) the error of ( AZ ) unprincipled men and ( BA ) fall from your own steadfastness ,

NASB1995	1%20John	2	8	[ c ] On the other hand , I am writing ( V ) a new commandment to you , which is true in Him and in you , because ( W ) the darkness is passing away and ( X ) the true Light is already shining .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	9	The one who says he is in the Light and yet ( Y ) hates his ( Z ) brother is in the darkness until now .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	10	( AA ) The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	11	But the one who ( AB ) hates his brother is in the darkness and ( AC ) walks in the darkness , and does not know where he is going because the darkness has ( AD ) blinded his eyes .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	12	I am writing to you , ( AE ) little children , because ( AF ) your sins have been forgiven you for His name ’ s sake .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	13	I am writing to you , fathers , because you know Him ( AG ) who has been from the beginning . I am writing to you , young men , because ( AH ) you have overcome ( AI ) the evil one . I have written to you , children , because ( AJ ) you know the Father .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	14	I have written to you , fathers , because you know Him ( AK ) who has been from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are ( AL ) strong , and the ( AM ) word of God abides in you , and ( AN ) you have overcome the evil one . Do Not Love the World
NASB1995	1%20John	2	15	Do not love ( AO ) the world nor the things in the world . ( AP ) If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	16	For all that is in the world , ( AQ ) the lust of the flesh and ( AR ) the lust of the eyes and ( AS ) the boastful pride of life , is not from the Father , but is from the world .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	17	( AT ) The world is passing away , and also its lusts ; but the one who ( AU ) does the will of God lives forever .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	18	Children , ( AV ) it is the last hour ; and just as you heard that ( AW ) antichrist is coming , ( AX ) even now many antichrists have appeared ; from this we know that it is the last hour .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	19	( AY ) They went out from us , but they were not really of us ; for if they had been of us , they would have remained with us ; but they went out , ( AZ ) so that [ d ] it would be shown that they all are not of us .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	20	[ e ] But you have an ( BA ) anointing from ( BB ) the Holy One , and ( BC ) you all know .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	21	I have not written to you because you do not know the truth , but ( BD ) because you do know it , and [ f ] because no lie is ( BE ) of the truth .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	22	Who is the liar but ( BF ) the one who denies that Jesus is the [ g ] Christ ? This is ( BG ) the antichrist , the one who denies the Father and the Son .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	23	( BH ) Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father ; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	24	As for you , let that abide in you which you heard ( BI ) from the beginning . If what you heard from the beginning abides in you , you also ( BJ ) will abide in the Son and in the Father . The Promise Is Eternal Life
NASB1995	1%20John	2	25	( BK ) This is the promise which He Himself [ h ] made to us : eternal life .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	26	These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to ( BL ) deceive you .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	27	As for you , the ( BM ) anointing which you received from Him abides in you , and you have no need for anyone to teach you ; but as His anointing ( BN ) teaches you about all things , and is ( BO ) true and is not a lie , and just as it has taught you , [ i ] you abide in Him .
NASB1995	1%20John	2	28	Now , ( BP ) little children , abide in Him , so that when He ( BQ ) appears , we may have ( BR ) confidence and ( BS ) not [ j ] shrink away from Him in shame [ k ] at His ( BT ) coming .

NASB1995	1%20John	3	2	( D ) Beloved , now we are ( E ) children of God , and ( F ) it has not appeared as yet what we will be . We know that when He ( G ) appears , we will be ( H ) like Him , because we will ( I ) see Him just as He is .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	4	Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness ; and ( L ) sin is lawlessness .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	5	You know that He ( M ) appeared in order to ( N ) take away sins ; and ( O ) in Him there is no sin .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	6	No one who abides in Him ( P ) sins ; no one who sins has seen Him or [ b ] ( Q ) knows Him .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	7	( R ) Little children , make sure no one ( S ) deceives you ; ( T ) the one who practices righteousness is righteous , just as He is righteous ;
NASB1995	1%20John	3	8	the one who practices sin is ( U ) of the devil ; for the devil [ c ] has sinned from the beginning . ( V ) The Son of God ( W ) appeared for this purpose , ( X ) to destroy the works of the devil .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	9	No one who is [ d ] ( Y ) born of God ( Z ) practices sin , because His seed abides in him ; and he can not sin , because he is [ e ] born of God .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	10	By this the ( AA ) children of God and the ( AB ) children of the devil are obvious : [ f ] anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God , nor the one who ( AC ) does not love his ( AD ) brother .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	11	( AE ) For this is the message ( AF ) which you have heard from the beginning , ( AG ) that we should love one another ;
NASB1995	1%20John	3	12	not as ( AH ) Cain , who was of ( AI ) the evil one and slew his brother . And for what reason did he slay him ? Because ( AJ ) his deeds were evil , and his brother ’ s were righteous .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	13	Do not be surprised , brethren , if ( AK ) the world hates you .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have ( AL ) passed out of death into life , ( AM ) because we love the brethren . He who does not love abides in death .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	15	Everyone who ( AN ) hates his brother is a murderer ; and you know that ( AO ) no murderer has eternal life abiding in him .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	16	We know love by this , that ( AP ) He laid down His life for us ; and ( AQ ) we ought to lay down our lives for the ( AR ) brethren .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	17	But ( AS ) whoever has the world ’ s goods , and sees his brother in need and ( AT ) closes his [ g ] heart [ h ] against him , ( AU ) how does the love of God abide in him ?
NASB1995	1%20John	3	18	( AV ) Little children , let us not love with word or with tongue , but in deed and ( AW ) truth .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	19	We will know by this that we are ( AX ) of the truth , and will [ i ] assure our heart before Him
NASB1995	1%20John	3	20	[ j ] in whatever our heart condemns us ; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	21	( AY ) Beloved , if our heart does not condemn us , we have ( AZ ) confidence [ k ] before God ;
NASB1995	1%20John	3	22	and ( BA ) whatever we ask we receive from Him , because we ( BB ) keep His commandments and do ( BC ) the things that are pleasing in His sight .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	23	This is His commandment , that we [ l ] ( BD ) believe in ( BE ) the name of His Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , just as ( BF ) He [ m ] commanded us .
NASB1995	1%20John	3	24	The one who ( BG ) keeps His commandments ( BH ) abides in Him , and He in him . ( BI ) We know by this that ( BJ ) He abides in us , by the Spirit whom He has given us . Footnotes -

NASB1995	1%20John	4	7	( T ) Beloved , let us ( U ) love one another , for love is from God ; and ( V ) everyone who loves is [ a ] ( W ) born of God and ( X ) knows God .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	8	The one who does not love does not know God , for ( Y ) God is love .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	9	By this the love of God was manifested [ b ] ( Z ) in us , that ( AA ) God has sent His [ c ] only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	10	In this is love , ( AB ) not that we loved God , but that ( AC ) He loved us and sent His Son to be ( AD ) the propitiation for our sins .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	11	( AE ) Beloved , if God so loved us , ( AF ) we also ought to love one another .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	12	( AG ) No one has seen God at any time ; if we love one another , God abides in us , and His ( AH ) love is perfected in us .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	13	( AI ) By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us , because He has given us of His Spirit .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	14	We have seen and ( AJ ) testify that the Father has ( AK ) sent the Son to be the Savior of the world .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	15	( AL ) Whoever confesses that ( AM ) Jesus is the Son of God , God ( AN ) abides in him , and he in God .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	16	( AO ) We have come to know and have believed the love which God has [ d ] ( AP ) for us . ( AQ ) God is love , and the one who ( AR ) abides in love abides in God , and God abides in him .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	17	By this , ( AS ) love is perfected with us , so that we may have ( AT ) confidence in ( AU ) the day of judgment ; because ( AV ) as He is , so also are we in this world .
NASB1995	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love ; but ( AW ) perfect love casts out fear , because fear [ e ] involves punishment , and the one who fears is not ( AX ) perfected in love .

NASB1995	1%20John	5	9	( O ) If we receive the testimony of men , the testimony of God is greater ; for the testimony of God is this , that ( P ) He has testified concerning His Son .
NASB1995	1%20John	5	10	The one who believes in the Son of God ( Q ) has the testimony in himself ; the one who does not believe God has ( R ) made Him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son .

NASB1995	Jude	1	3	( G ) Beloved , while I was making every effort to write you about our ( H ) common salvation , I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you ( I ) contend earnestly for ( J ) the faith which was once for all ( K ) handed down to ( L ) the [ c ] saints .
NASB1995	Jude	1	4	For certain persons have ( M ) crept in unnoticed , those who were long beforehand [ d ] ( N ) marked out for this condemnation , ungodly persons who turn ( O ) the grace of our God into ( P ) licentiousness and ( Q ) deny our only Master and Lord , Jesus Christ .
NASB1995	Jude	1	5	Now I desire to ( R ) remind you , though ( S ) you know all things once for all , that [ e ] the Lord , ( T ) after saving a people out of the land of Egypt , [ f ] subsequently destroyed those who did not believe .
NASB1995	Jude	1	6	And ( U ) angels who did not keep their own domain , but abandoned their proper abode , He has ( V ) kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day ,
NASB1995	Jude	1	7	just as ( W ) Sodom and Gomorrah and the ( X ) cities around them , since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and ( Y ) went after [ g ] strange flesh , are exhibited as an [ h ] ( Z ) example in undergoing the ( AA ) punishment of eternal fire .
NASB1995	Jude	1	8	Yet in the same way these men , also by dreaming , ( AB ) defile the flesh , and reject authority , and revile [ i ] angelic majesties .
NASB1995	Jude	1	9	But ( AC ) Michael ( AD ) the archangel , when he disputed with the devil and argued about ( AE ) the body of Moses , did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment , but said , “ ( AF ) The Lord rebuke you ! ”
NASB1995	Jude	1	10	But ( AG ) these men revile the things which they do not understand ; and ( AH ) the things which they know by instinct , ( AI ) like unreasoning animals , by these things they are [ j ] destroyed .
NASB1995	Jude	1	11	Woe to them ! For they have gone ( AJ ) the way of Cain , and for pay [ k ] they have rushed headlong into ( AK ) the error of Balaam , and ( AL ) perished in the rebellion of Korah .
NASB1995	Jude	1	12	These are the men who are [ l ] hidden reefs ( AM ) in your love feasts when they feast with you ( AN ) without fear , caring for themselves ; ( AO ) clouds without water , ( AP ) carried along by winds ; autumn trees without fruit , [ m ] doubly dead , ( AQ ) uprooted ;
