KJ21	Matthew	1	1	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the Son of David , the Son of Abraham .
KJ21	Matthew	1	2	Abraham begot Isaac , and Isaac begot Jacob , and Jacob begot Judah and his brethren .
KJ21	Matthew	1	3	And Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar , and Perez begot Hezron , and Hezron begot Aram ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	4	and Aram begot Aminadab , and Aminadab begot Nahshon , and Nahshon begot Salmon ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	5	and Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab , and Boaz begot Obed by Ruth , and Obed begot Jesse ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	6	and Jesse begot David the king . And David the king begot Solomon by her that had been the wife of Uriah ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	7	and Solomon begot Rehoboam , and Rehoboam begot Abijah , and Abijah begot Asa ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	8	and Asa begot Jehoshaphat , and Jehoshaphat begot Joram , and Joram begot Uzziah ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	9	and Uzziah begot Jotham , and Jotham begot Ahaz , and Ahaz begot Hezekiah ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	10	and Hezekiah begot Manasseh , and Manasseh begot Amon , and Amon begot Josiah ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	11	and Josiah begot Jechonias and his brethren , about the time they were carried away to Babylon .
KJ21	Matthew	1	12	And after they were brought to Babylon , Jechonias begot Salathiel , and Salathiel begot Zerubbabel ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	13	and Zerubbabel begot Abiud , and Abiud begot Eliakim , and Eliakim begot Azor ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	14	and Azor begot Zadok , and Zadok begot Achim , and Achim begot Eliud ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	15	and Eliud begot Eleazar , and Eleazar begot Matthan , and Matthan begot Jacob ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	16	and Jacob begot Joseph , the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
KJ21	Matthew	1	17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations , and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations , and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations .
KJ21	Matthew	1	18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way : When His mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy Ghost .
KJ21	Matthew	1	19	And Joseph her husband , being a just man and not willing to make her a public example , was minded to put her away privily .
KJ21	Matthew	1	20	But while he thought on these things , behold , the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream , saying , “ Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife , for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost .
KJ21	Matthew	1	21	And she shall bring forth a Son , and thou shalt call His name Jesus , for He shall save His people from their sins. ”
KJ21	Matthew	1	22	Now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	23	“ Behold , a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son , and they shall call His name Emmanuel ” ( which being interpreted is , “ God with us ” ) .
KJ21	Matthew	1	24	Then Joseph , being raised from sleep , did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife ,
KJ21	Matthew	1	25	and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn Son . And he called His name Jesus .
KJ21	Matthew	2	2	saying , “ Where is He that is born King of the Jews ? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him. ”
KJ21	Matthew	2	3	When Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
KJ21	Matthew	2	4	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
KJ21	Matthew	2	5	And they said unto him , “ In Bethlehem of Judea , for thus it is written by the prophet :
KJ21	Matthew	2	6	‘ And thou , Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , art not the least among the princes of Judah ; for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule My people Israel. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod , when he had privily called the wise men , inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
KJ21	Matthew	2	8	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said , “ Go and search diligently for the young child , and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also. ”
KJ21	Matthew	2	9	When they had heard the king , they departed ; and lo , the star which they saw in the East went before them until it came and stood over where the young Child was .
KJ21	Matthew	2	10	When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
KJ21	Matthew	2	11	And when they had come into the house , they saw the young Child with Mary His mother , and fell down and worshiped Him . And when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto Him gifts : gold and frankincense and myrrh .
KJ21	Matthew	2	12	And being warned by God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
KJ21	Matthew	2	13	And when they had departed , behold , the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream , saying , “ Arise , and take the young Child and His mother , and flee into Egypt , and be thou there until I bring thee word ; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him. ”
KJ21	Matthew	2	14	When he arose , he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt ,
KJ21	Matthew	2	15	and was there until the death of Herod , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , “ Out of Egypt have I called My Son. ”
KJ21	Matthew	2	16	Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth and slew all the children who were in Bethlehem and in all the region thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men .
KJ21	Matthew	2	17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	2	18	“ In Ramah was there a voice heard , lamentation and weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted , because they are no more. ”
KJ21	Matthew	2	19	But when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
KJ21	Matthew	2	20	saying , “ Arise , and take the young Child and His mother , and go into the land of Israel , for they are dead who sought the young Child ’ s life. ”
KJ21	Matthew	2	21	And he arose and took the young Child and His mother , and came into the land of Israel .
KJ21	Matthew	2	22	But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judea in place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither . Notwithstanding , being warned by God in a dream , he turned aside into the region of Galilee .
KJ21	Matthew	2	23	And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets : “ He shall be called a Nazarene . ”
KJ21	Matthew	3	3	For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah , saying , “ The voice of one crying in the wilderness : ‘ Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make His paths straight. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	3	2	and saying , “ Repent ye , for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. ”
KJ21	Matthew	3	4	And the same John had his raiment of camel ’ s hair , and a leather girdle about his loins ; and his meat was locusts and wild honey .
KJ21	Matthew	3	5	Then there went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region round about the Jordan .
KJ21	Matthew	3	6	And they were baptized by him in the Jordan , confessing their sins .
KJ21	Matthew	3	7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism , he said unto them , “ O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
KJ21	Matthew	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance ,
KJ21	Matthew	3	9	and think not to say to yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father. ’ For I say unto you that God is able from these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
KJ21	Matthew	3	10	And now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees ; therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire .
KJ21	Matthew	3	11	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance , but He that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear . He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire .
KJ21	Matthew	3	12	His fan is in His hand , and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor and gather His wheat into the garner ; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. ”
KJ21	Matthew	3	13	Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John to be baptized by him .
KJ21	Matthew	3	14	But John forbad Him , saying , “ I have need to be baptized by Thee , and comest Thou to me ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	3	15	And Jesus answering said unto him , “ Suffer it to be so now , for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. ” Then John suffered Him .
KJ21	Matthew	3	16	And Jesus , when He had been baptized , went up straightway out of the water . And lo , the heavens were opened unto Him , and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon Him .
KJ21	Matthew	3	17	And lo , a voice came from Heaven , saying , “ This Is My Beloved Son , In Whom I Am Well Pleased . ”
KJ21	Matthew	4	4	But He answered and said , “ It is written : ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	4	2	And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights , He afterward hungered .
KJ21	Matthew	4	3	And when the tempter came to Him , he said , “ If Thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread. ”
KJ21	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil took Him up into the holy city , and set Him on a pinnacle of the temple , and
KJ21	Matthew	4	6	said unto Him , “ If Thou be the Son of God , cast Thyself down . For it is written : ‘ He shall give His angels charge concerning thee ; and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said unto him , “ It is written again : ‘ Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	4	8	Again , the devil took Him up onto an exceeding high mountain , and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them ,
KJ21	Matthew	4	9	and said unto Him , “ All these things will I give Thee if Thou wilt fall down and worship me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	4	10	Then said Jesus unto him , “ Get thee hence , Satan ! For it is written : ‘ Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and Him only shalt thou serve. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil left Him , and behold , angels came and ministered unto Him .
KJ21	Matthew	4	12	Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison , He departed into Galilee .
KJ21	Matthew	4	13	And leaving Nazareth , He came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the seacoast in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
KJ21	Matthew	4	14	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	4	15	“ The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , by the way of the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles :
KJ21	Matthew	4	16	the people who sat in darkness saw a great Light ; and to them that sat in the region and shadow of death , Light has sprung up. ”
KJ21	Matthew	4	17	From that time Jesus began to preach and to say , “ Repent , for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. ”
KJ21	Matthew	4	18	And Jesus , walking by the Sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fishers .
KJ21	Matthew	4	19	And He said unto them , “ Follow Me , and I will make you fishers of men. ”
KJ21	Matthew	4	20	And they straightway left their nets and followed Him .
KJ21	Matthew	4	21	And going on from thence He saw two other brethren , James the son of Zebedee and John his brother , in a boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets . And He called them ,
KJ21	Matthew	4	22	and they immediately left the boat and their father , and followed Him .
KJ21	Matthew	4	23	And Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
KJ21	Matthew	4	24	And His fame went throughout all Syria . And they brought unto Him all sick people who were taken with divers diseases and torments , and those who were possessed with devils , and those who were lunatic , and those who had the palsy ; and He healed them .
KJ21	Matthew	4	25	And there followed Him great multitudes of people from Galilee and from Decapolis , and from Jerusalem and from Judea , and from beyond the Jordan .
KJ21	Matthew	5	5	Blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit the earth .
KJ21	Matthew	5	2	And He opened His mouth and taught them , saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	5	3	“ Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	5	4	Blessed are they that mourn , for they shall be comforted .
KJ21	Matthew	5	6	Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness , for they shall be filled .
KJ21	Matthew	5	7	Blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy .
KJ21	Matthew	5	8	Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God .
KJ21	Matthew	5	9	Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called the children of God .
KJ21	Matthew	5	10	Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness ’ sake , for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	5	11	Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for My sake .
KJ21	Matthew	5	12	Rejoice and be exceeding glad , for great is your reward in Heaven ; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you .
KJ21	Matthew	5	13	“ Ye are the salt of the earth , but if the salt has lost his savor , wherewith shall it be salted ? It is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men .
KJ21	Matthew	5	14	“ Ye are the light of the world . A city that is set on a hill can not be hid .
KJ21	Matthew	5	15	Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick , and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
KJ21	Matthew	5	16	Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	5	17	“ Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets . I am not come to destroy , but to fulfill .
KJ21	Matthew	5	18	For verily I say unto you , till heaven and earth pass away , not one jot or one tittle shall in any wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled .
KJ21	Matthew	5	19	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven ; but whosoever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	5	20	For I say unto you that unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	5	21	“ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old , ‘ Thou shalt not kill , ’ and ‘ Whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. ’
KJ21	Matthew	5	22	But I say unto you , that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment ; and whosoever shall say to his brother , ‘ Raca , ’ shall be in danger of the council ; but whosoever shall say , ‘ Thou fool , ’ shall be in danger of hell fire .
KJ21	Matthew	5	23	Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee ,
KJ21	Matthew	5	24	leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way . First be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
KJ21	Matthew	5	25	“ Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art on the way with him , lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
KJ21	Matthew	5	26	Verily I say unto thee , thou shalt by no means come out thence until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
KJ21	Matthew	5	27	“ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old , ‘ Thou shalt not commit adultery. ’
KJ21	Matthew	5	28	But I say unto you , that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
KJ21	Matthew	5	29	And if thy right eye cause thee to fall , pluck it out and cast it from thee ; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
KJ21	Matthew	5	30	And if thy right hand cause thee to fall , cut it off and cast it from thee ; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
KJ21	Matthew	5	31	“ It hath been said , ‘ Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement. ’
KJ21	Matthew	5	32	But I say unto you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , except for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery ; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .
KJ21	Matthew	5	33	“ Again , ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old times , ‘ Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. ’
KJ21	Matthew	5	34	But I say unto you , swear not at all : neither by Heaven , for it is God ’ s throne ;
KJ21	Matthew	5	35	nor by the earth , for it is His footstool ; neither by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King .
KJ21	Matthew	5	36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .
KJ21	Matthew	5	37	But let your communication be ‘ yea , yea ’ or ‘ nay , nay ’ ; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil .
KJ21	Matthew	5	38	“ Ye have heard that it hath been said , ‘ An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth. ’
KJ21	Matthew	5	39	But I say unto you that ye resist not evil , but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also .
KJ21	Matthew	5	40	And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also .
KJ21	Matthew	5	41	And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile , go with him two .
KJ21	Matthew	5	42	Give to him that asketh thee ; and from him that would borrow of thee , turn not thou away .
KJ21	Matthew	5	43	“ Ye have heard that it hath been said , ‘ Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. ’
KJ21	Matthew	5	44	But I say unto you , love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you ,
KJ21	Matthew	5	45	that ye may be the children of your Father who is in Heaven . For He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .
KJ21	Matthew	5	46	For if ye love them that love you , what reward have ye ? Do not even the publicans the same ?
KJ21	Matthew	5	47	And if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? Do not even the publicans so ?
KJ21	Matthew	5	48	Be ye therefore perfect , even as your Father who is in Heaven is perfect .
KJ21	Matthew	6	6	But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father who is in secret ; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
KJ21	Matthew	6	2	Therefore when thou givest thine alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . Verily I say unto you , they have their reward .
KJ21	Matthew	6	3	But when thou givest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth ,
KJ21	Matthew	6	4	that thine almsgiving may be in secret ; and thy Father who seeth in secret , Himself shall reward thee openly .
KJ21	Matthew	6	5	“ And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are . For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets , that they may be seen by men . Verily I say unto you , they have their reward .
KJ21	Matthew	6	7	But when ye pray , use not vain repetitions as the heathen do , for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
KJ21	Matthew	6	8	Be not ye therefore like unto them , for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask Him .
KJ21	Matthew	6	9	In this manner therefore pray ye : Our Father who art in Heaven , hallowed be Thy name .
KJ21	Matthew	6	10	Thy Kingdom come . Thy will be done on earth , as it is in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	6	11	Give us this day our daily bread .
KJ21	Matthew	6	12	And forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors .
KJ21	Matthew	6	13	And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil . For Thine is the Kingdom , and the power and the glory for ever . Amen .
KJ21	Matthew	6	14	For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
KJ21	Matthew	6	15	But if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
KJ21	Matthew	6	16	“ Moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance . For they disfigure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . Verily I say unto you , they have their reward .
KJ21	Matthew	6	17	But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thine head and wash thy face ,
KJ21	Matthew	6	18	that thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father who is in secret ; and thy Father , who seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
KJ21	Matthew	6	19	“ Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth and rust doth corrupt , and where thieves break through and steal ;
KJ21	Matthew	6	20	but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal .
KJ21	Matthew	6	21	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
KJ21	Matthew	6	22	“ The light of the body is the eye . If therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light .
KJ21	Matthew	6	23	But if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is that darkness !
KJ21	Matthew	6	24	“ No man can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or else he will hold to the one and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon .
KJ21	Matthew	6	25	“ Therefore I say unto you , take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . Is not the life more than meat , and the body than raiment ?
KJ21	Matthew	6	26	Behold the fowls of the air , for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are ye not much better than they ?
KJ21	Matthew	6	27	“ Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ?
KJ21	Matthew	6	28	And why take ye thought for raiment ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow . They toil not , neither do they spin ,
KJ21	Matthew	6	29	and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
KJ21	Matthew	6	30	Therefore , if God so clothe the grass of the field , which today is , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , shall He not much more clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
KJ21	Matthew	6	31	Therefore take no thought , saying , ‘ What shall we eat ? ’ or ‘ What shall we drink ? ’ or ‘ Wherewith shall we be clothed ? ’
KJ21	Matthew	6	32	( For after all these things do the Gentiles seek . ) For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
KJ21	Matthew	6	33	But seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness , and all these things shall be added unto you .
KJ21	Matthew	6	34	“ Take therefore no thought for the morrow , for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
KJ21	Matthew	7	7	“ Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
KJ21	Matthew	7	2	For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged ; and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again .
KJ21	Matthew	7	3	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
KJ21	Matthew	7	4	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , ‘ Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye , ’ and behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
KJ21	Matthew	7	5	Thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother ’ s eye .
KJ21	Matthew	7	6	“ Give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you .
KJ21	Matthew	7	8	For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
KJ21	Matthew	7	9	“ Or what man is there among you whom , if his son ask for bread , will give him a stone ?
KJ21	Matthew	7	10	Or if he ask for a fish , will give him a serpent ?
KJ21	Matthew	7	11	If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father who is in Heaven give good things to them that ask Him ?
KJ21	Matthew	7	12	Therefore , all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them ; for this is the Law and the Prophets .
KJ21	Matthew	7	13	“ Enter ye in at the strait gate , for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction , and many there be who go in thereat .
KJ21	Matthew	7	14	Because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
KJ21	Matthew	7	15	“ Beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep ’ s clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves .
KJ21	Matthew	7	16	Ye shall know them by their fruits . Do men gather grapes from thorns , or figs from thistles ?
KJ21	Matthew	7	17	Even so , every good tree bringeth forth good fruit , but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
KJ21	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
KJ21	Matthew	7	19	Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire .
KJ21	Matthew	7	20	Therefore , by their fruits ye shall know them .
KJ21	Matthew	7	21	“ Not every one that saith unto Me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven , but he that doeth the will of My Father who is in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	7	22	Many will say to Me in that Day , ‘ Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in Thy name , and in Thy name have cast out devils , and in Thy name done many wonderful works ? ’
KJ21	Matthew	7	23	And then will I profess unto them , ‘ I never knew you : depart from Me , ye that work iniquity. ’
KJ21	Matthew	7	24	“ Therefore , whosoever heareth these sayings of Mine and doeth them , I will liken him unto a wise man , who built his house upon a rock .
KJ21	Matthew	7	25	And the rain descended and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat upon that house ; and it fell not , for it was founded upon a rock .
KJ21	Matthew	7	26	And every one that heareth these sayings of Mine and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , who built his house upon the sand ;
KJ21	Matthew	7	27	and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell , and great was the fall of it. ”
KJ21	Matthew	7	28	And it came to pass , when Jesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at His doctrine ;
KJ21	Matthew	7	29	for He taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .
KJ21	Matthew	8	8	The centurion answered and said , “ Lord , I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof . But speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed .
KJ21	Matthew	8	2	And behold , there came a leper and worshiped Him , saying , “ Lord , if Thou wilt , Thou canst make me clean. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	3	And Jesus put forth His hand and touched him , saying , “ I will : be thou clean. ” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
KJ21	Matthew	8	4	And Jesus said unto him , “ See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , show thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony unto them. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	5	And when Jesus had entered into Capernaum , there came unto Him a centurion , beseeching Him
KJ21	Matthew	8	6	and saying , “ Lord , my servant lieth at home sick with the palsy and grievously tormented. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	7	And Jesus said unto him , “ I will come and heal him. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	9	For I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me . And I say to this man , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goeth ; and to another , ‘ Come ! ’ and he cometh ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he doeth it. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard it , He marveled and said to those who followed , “ Verily I say unto you , I have not found such great faith , no , not in Israel .
KJ21	Matthew	8	11	And I say unto you , that many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	8	12	But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	13	And Jesus said unto the centurion , “ Go thy way , and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee. ” And his servant was healed in that selfsame hour .
KJ21	Matthew	8	14	And when Jesus had come into Peter ’ s house , He saw his wife ’ s mother lying and sick with a fever .
KJ21	Matthew	8	15	And He touched her hand , and the fever left her , and she arose and ministered unto them .
KJ21	Matthew	8	16	When the evening had come , they brought unto Him many who were possessed with devils , and He cast out the spirits with His word and healed all who were sick ,
KJ21	Matthew	8	17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet , who said , “ He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	18	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him , He gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
KJ21	Matthew	8	19	And a certain scribe came and said unto Him , “ Master , I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	20	And Jesus said unto him , “ The foxes have holes , and the birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man hath nowhere to lay His head. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	21	And another of His disciples said unto Him , “ Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus said unto him , “ Follow Me , and let the dead bury their dead. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	23	And when He had entered into a boat , His disciples followed Him .
KJ21	Matthew	8	24	And behold , there arose a great tempest on the sea , insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves ; but He was asleep .
KJ21	Matthew	8	25	And His disciples came to Him and awoke Him , saying , “ Lord , save us ! We perish ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	26	And He said unto them , “ Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? ” Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great calm .
KJ21	Matthew	8	27	But the men marveled , saying , “ What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey Him ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	28	And when He had come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met Him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceedingly fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
KJ21	Matthew	8	29	And behold , they cried out , saying , “ What have we to do with Thee , Jesus , Thou Son of God ? Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	30	Now there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine feeding .
KJ21	Matthew	8	31	So the devils besought Him , saying , “ If Thou cast us out , suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. ”
KJ21	Matthew	8	32	And He said to them , “ Go. ” And when they had come out , they went into the herd of swine , and behold , the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters .
KJ21	Matthew	8	33	And those who kept them fled and went their ways into the city , and told everything and what had befallen the ones possessed with the devils .
KJ21	Matthew	8	34	And behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus . And when they saw Him , they besought Him that He would depart out of their borders .
KJ21	Matthew	9	9	And as Jesus passed forth from thence , He saw a man named Matthew , sitting in the customhouse . And He said unto him , “ Follow Me. ” And he arose and followed Him .
KJ21	Matthew	9	2	And behold , they brought to Him a man sick with the palsy , lying on a bed . And Jesus , seeing their faith , said unto the one sick with the palsy , “ Son , be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	3	And behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , “ This man blasphemeth. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	4	And Jesus , knowing their thoughts , said , “ Why think ye evil in your hearts ?
KJ21	Matthew	9	5	For which is easier : to say , ‘ Thy sins be forgiven thee , ’ or to say , ‘ Arise and walk ’ ?
KJ21	Matthew	9	6	But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ” — ( then said He to the one sick with palsy ) “ Arise , take up thy bed and go unto thine house. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	7	And he arose and departed to his house .
KJ21	Matthew	9	8	But when the multitudes saw it , they marveled and glorified God , who had given such power unto men .
KJ21	Matthew	9	10	And it came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples .
KJ21	Matthew	9	11	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto His disciples , “ Why eateth your master with publicans and sinners ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	12	But when Jesus heard that , He said unto them , “ They that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
KJ21	Matthew	9	13	But go ye and learn what this meaneth : ‘ I will have mercy and not sacrifice. ’ For I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	14	Then the disciples of John came to Him , saying , “ Why do we and the Pharisees fast often , but Thy disciples fast not ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said unto them , “ Can the attendants of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them ? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
KJ21	Matthew	9	16	“ No man putteth a piece of new cloth upon an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
KJ21	Matthew	9	17	Neither do men put new wine into old wineskins , else the wineskins burst and the wine runneth out and the skins perish . But they put new wine into new wineskins , and both are preserved. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	18	While He spoke these things unto them , behold , there came a certain ruler and worshiped Him , saying , “ My daughter is even now dead , but come and lay Thy hand upon her , and she shall live. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	19	And Jesus arose and followed him , and so did His disciples .
KJ21	Matthew	9	20	And behold , a woman who was diseased with an issue of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the hem of His garment ;
KJ21	Matthew	9	21	for she said to herself , “ If I may but touch His garment , I shall be whole. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	22	But Jesus turned about , and when He saw her , He said , “ Daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole. ” And the woman was made whole from that hour .
KJ21	Matthew	9	23	And when Jesus came into the ruler ’ s house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
KJ21	Matthew	9	24	He said unto them , “ Give way , for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth. ” And they laughed Him to scorn .
KJ21	Matthew	9	25	But when the people were put outside , He went in and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
KJ21	Matthew	9	26	And the fame thereof went abroad throughout all the land .
KJ21	Matthew	9	27	And when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed Him , crying and saying , “ Thou Son of David , have mercy on us ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	28	And when He had come into the house , the blind men came to Him , and Jesus said unto them , “ Believe ye that I am able to do this ? ” They said unto Him , “ Yea , Lord. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	29	Then He touched their eyes , saying , “ According to your faith , be it unto you. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened , and Jesus strictly charged them , saying , “ See that no man know it. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	31	But they , when they had departed , spread abroad His fame in all that country .
KJ21	Matthew	9	32	As they went out , behold , they brought to Him a man , dumb and possessed with a devil .
KJ21	Matthew	9	33	And when the devil was cast out , the dumb spoke ; and the multitudes marveled , saying , “ It was never so seen in Israel. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , “ He casteth out the devils through the prince of the devils. ”
KJ21	Matthew	9	35	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
KJ21	Matthew	9	36	But when He saw the multitudes , He was moved with compassion for them , because they were faint and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
KJ21	Matthew	9	37	Then said He unto His disciples , “ The harvest truly is plenteous , but the laborers are few .
KJ21	Matthew	9	38	Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that He will send forth laborers into His harvest . ”
KJ21	Matthew	10	10	nor pack for your journey , neither two coats , neither shoes , nor yet staves ; for the workman is worthy of his meat .
KJ21	Matthew	10	2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these : the first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
KJ21	Matthew	10	3	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the publican ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Lebbaeus , whose surname was Thaddaeus ;
KJ21	Matthew	10	4	Simon the Canaanite , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed Him .
KJ21	Matthew	10	5	These twelve Jesus sent forth and commanded them , saying , “ Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not .
KJ21	Matthew	10	6	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
KJ21	Matthew	10	7	And as ye go , preach , saying , ‘ The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. ’
KJ21	Matthew	10	8	Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils . Freely ye have received ; freely give .
KJ21	Matthew	10	9	Provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses ,
KJ21	Matthew	10	11	And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter , inquire who in it is worthy , and there abide till ye go thence .
KJ21	Matthew	10	12	And when ye come into a house , salute it ,
KJ21	Matthew	10	13	and if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it ; but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
KJ21	Matthew	10	14	And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
KJ21	Matthew	10	15	Verily I say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for that city .
KJ21	Matthew	10	16	“ Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves . Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves .
KJ21	Matthew	10	17	But beware of men , for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ,
KJ21	Matthew	10	18	and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles .
KJ21	Matthew	10	19	But when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak , for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
KJ21	Matthew	10	20	For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father who speaketh in you .
KJ21	Matthew	10	21	And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child ; and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death .
KJ21	Matthew	10	22	And ye shall be hated by all men for My name ’ s sake , but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
KJ21	Matthew	10	23	But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another ; for verily I say unto you , ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel till the Son of Man be come .
KJ21	Matthew	10	24	“ The disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord .
KJ21	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household !
KJ21	Matthew	10	26	Fear them not therefore , for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed , and hid that shall not be known .
KJ21	Matthew	10	27	What I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light ; and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
KJ21	Matthew	10	28	And fear not them that kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul ; but rather fear Him that is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
KJ21	Matthew	10	29	“ Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .
KJ21	Matthew	10	30	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
KJ21	Matthew	10	31	Fear ye not , therefore ; ye are of more value than many sparrows .
KJ21	Matthew	10	32	“ Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men , him will I confess also before My Father who is in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	10	33	But whosoever shall deny Me before men , him will I also deny before My Father who is in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	10	34	“ Think not that I am come to send peace on earth . I came not to send peace , but a sword .
KJ21	Matthew	10	35	For I am come to ‘ set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. ’
KJ21	Matthew	10	36	And ‘ a man ’ s foes shall be they of his own household. ’
KJ21	Matthew	10	37	He that loveth father or mother more than Me , is not worthy of Me . And he that loveth son or daughter more than Me , is not worthy of Me .
KJ21	Matthew	10	38	And he that taketh not his cross and followeth after Me , is not worthy of Me .
KJ21	Matthew	10	39	He that findeth his life , shall lose it ; and he that loseth his life for My sake , shall find it .
KJ21	Matthew	10	40	“ He that receiveth you , receiveth Me ; and he that receiveth Me , receiveth Him that sent Me .
KJ21	Matthew	10	41	He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet , shall receive a prophet ’ s reward . And he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man , shall receive a righteous man ’ s reward .
KJ21	Matthew	10	42	And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only , in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward . ”
KJ21	Matthew	11	11	Verily I say unto you , among them that are born of women , there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist ; notwithstanding , he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he .
KJ21	Matthew	11	2	Now when John had heard in prison of the works of Christ , he sent two of his disciples ,
KJ21	Matthew	11	3	and they said unto Him , “ Art thou He that should come , or do we look for another ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	11	4	Jesus answered and said unto them , “ Go and show John again those things which ye hear and see :
KJ21	Matthew	11	5	the blind receive their sight and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up and the poor have the Gospel preached to them .
KJ21	Matthew	11	6	And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in Me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	11	7	And as they departed , Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , “ What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
KJ21	Matthew	11	8	But what went ye out to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ’ houses .
KJ21	Matthew	11	9	But what went ye out to see ? A prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and more than a prophet .
KJ21	Matthew	11	10	For this is he of whom it is written : ‘ Behold , I send My messenger before Thy face , who shall prepare Thy way before Thee. ’
KJ21	Matthew	11	12	And from the days of John the Baptist until now , the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
KJ21	Matthew	11	13	For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John .
KJ21	Matthew	11	14	And if ye will receive it , this is Elijah , who was to come .
KJ21	Matthew	11	15	He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
KJ21	Matthew	11	16	“ But to what shall I liken this generation ? It is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows ,
KJ21	Matthew	11	17	and saying , ‘ We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned unto you , and ye have not lamented. ’
KJ21	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He hath a devil ! ’
KJ21	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners ! ’ But wisdom is justified by her children. ”
KJ21	Matthew	11	20	Then He began to upbraid the cities wherein most of His mighty works were done , because they repented not .
KJ21	Matthew	11	21	“ Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! Woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
KJ21	Matthew	11	22	But I say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Day of Judgment than for you .
KJ21	Matthew	11	23	And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell ; for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
KJ21	Matthew	11	24	But I say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the Day of Judgment than for thee. ”
KJ21	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus answered and said , “ I thank Thee , O Father , Lord of Heaven and earth , because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes .
KJ21	Matthew	11	26	Even so , Father , for so it seemed good in Thy sight .
KJ21	Matthew	11	27	“ All things are delivered unto Me by My Father , and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him .
KJ21	Matthew	11	28	“ Come unto Me all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
KJ21	Matthew	11	29	Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me , for I am meek and lowly in heart , and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
KJ21	Matthew	11	30	For My yoke is easy , and My burden is light . ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	12	How much then is a man better than a sheep ? Therefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days. ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	2	But when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto Him , “ Behold , thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day. ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	3	But He said unto them , “ Have ye not read what David did when he hungered and they that were with him :
KJ21	Matthew	12	4	how he entered into the house of God and ate the showbread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
KJ21	Matthew	12	5	Or have ye not read in the law how on the Sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless ?
KJ21	Matthew	12	6	But I say unto you , that in this place is One greater than the temple .
KJ21	Matthew	12	7	But if ye had known what this meaneth , ‘ I will have mercy and not sacrifice , ’ ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
KJ21	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day. ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	9	And when He had departed thence , He went into their synagogue .
KJ21	Matthew	12	10	And behold , there was a man who had his hand withered . And they asked Him , saying , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath days ? ” — that they might accuse Him .
KJ21	Matthew	12	11	And He said unto them , “ What man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep , and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day , will not lay hold on it and lift it out ?
KJ21	Matthew	12	13	Then He said to the man , “ Stretch forth thine hand. ” And he stretched it forth , and it was restored whole like the other .
KJ21	Matthew	12	14	Then the Pharisees went out and held a council against Him , how they might destroy Him .
KJ21	Matthew	12	15	But when Jesus knew of it , He withdrew Himself from thence . And great multitudes followed Him , and He healed them all .
KJ21	Matthew	12	16	And He charged them that they should not make Him known ,
KJ21	Matthew	12	17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	12	18	“ Behold My Servant whom I have chosen , My Beloved in whom My soul is well pleased : I will put My Spirit upon Him , and He shall show judgment to the Gentiles .
KJ21	Matthew	12	19	He shall not strive nor cry , neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets .
KJ21	Matthew	12	20	A bruised reed shall He not break , and smoking flax shall He not quench till He send forth judgment unto victory ;
KJ21	Matthew	12	21	and in His name shall the Gentiles trust. ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	22	Then was brought unto Him one possessed with a devil , blind and dumb ; and He healed him , so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw .
KJ21	Matthew	12	23	And all the people were amazed and said , “ Is not this the Son of David ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	24	But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , “ This fellow doth not cast out devils , except by Beelzebub , the prince of devils. ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	25	And Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation , and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand .
KJ21	Matthew	12	26	And if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how then shall his kingdom stand ?
KJ21	Matthew	12	27	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ? Therefore they shall be your judges .
KJ21	Matthew	12	28	But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the Kingdom of God is come unto you .
KJ21	Matthew	12	29	Or else how can one enter into a strong man ’ s house and despoil his goods , unless he first bind the strong man ? And then he will despoil his house .
KJ21	Matthew	12	30	“ He that is not with Me is against Me , and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad .
KJ21	Matthew	12	31	Therefore I say unto you , all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men , but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men .
KJ21	Matthew	12	32	And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man , it shall be forgiven him ; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
KJ21	Matthew	12	33	Either make the tree good and his fruit good , or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt ; for the tree is known by his fruit .
KJ21	Matthew	12	34	“ O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
KJ21	Matthew	12	35	A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
KJ21	Matthew	12	36	But I say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the Day of Judgment .
KJ21	Matthew	12	37	For by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	38	Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered , saying , “ Master , we would see a sign from thee. ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	39	But He answered and said unto them , “ An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign , and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonah .
KJ21	Matthew	12	40	For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale ’ s belly , so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
KJ21	Matthew	12	41	The men of Nineveh shall rise in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it , because they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , a greater than Jonah is here .
KJ21	Matthew	12	42	The queen of the south shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it , for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
KJ21	Matthew	12	43	“ When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest , and findeth none .
KJ21	Matthew	12	44	Then he saith , ‘ I will return into my house from whence I came out. ’ And when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
KJ21	Matthew	12	45	Then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there ; and the last state of that man is worse than the first . Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	46	While He yet talked to the people , behold , His mother and His brethren stood outside , desiring to speak with Him .
KJ21	Matthew	12	47	Then one said unto Him , “ Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand outside , desiring to speak with thee. ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	48	But He answered and said unto him that told Him , “ Who is My mother ? And who are My brethren ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	12	49	And He stretched forth His hand toward His disciples and said , “ Behold , My mother and My brethren !
KJ21	Matthew	12	50	For whosoever shall do the will of My Father who is in Heaven , the same is My brother , and sister , and mother . ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	13	Therefore speak I to them in parables , because seeing , they see not , and hearing , they hear not , neither do they understand .
KJ21	Matthew	13	2	And great multitudes were gathered together unto Him , so that He went into a boat and sat , and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
KJ21	Matthew	13	3	And He spoke many things unto them in parables , saying , “ Behold , a sower went forth to sow .
KJ21	Matthew	13	4	And when he sowed , some seeds fell by the wayside ; and the fowls came and devoured them up .
KJ21	Matthew	13	5	Some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth ; and forthwith they sprang up , because they had no deepness of earth .
KJ21	Matthew	13	6	And when the sun was up they were scorched , and because they had no root they withered away .
KJ21	Matthew	13	7	And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up and choked them .
KJ21	Matthew	13	8	But others fell into good ground and brought forth fruit , some a hundredfold , some sixtyfold , some thirtyfold .
KJ21	Matthew	13	9	Who hath ears to hear , let him hear. ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	10	And the disciples came and said unto Him , “ Why speakest Thou unto them in parables ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	11	He answered and said unto them , “ Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven , but to them it is not given .
KJ21	Matthew	13	12	For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance . But whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he hath .
KJ21	Matthew	13	14	And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah , which saith , ‘ By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive .
KJ21	Matthew	13	15	For this people ’ s heart has waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them. ’
KJ21	Matthew	13	16	But blessed are your eyes , for they see ; and your ears , for they hear .
KJ21	Matthew	13	17	For verily I say unto you , that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them , and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
KJ21	Matthew	13	18	“ Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower :
KJ21	Matthew	13	19	When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdom and understandeth it not , then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart . This is he that received seed by the wayside .
KJ21	Matthew	13	20	But he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the Word and at once with joy receiveth it ;
KJ21	Matthew	13	21	yet hath he not root in himself , but endureth for a while . For when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the Word , by and by he loses faith .
KJ21	Matthew	13	22	He also that received the seed among the thorns is he that heareth the Word ; and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the Word , and he becometh unfruitful .
KJ21	Matthew	13	23	But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the Word and understandeth it ; who also beareth fruit and bringeth forth , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty. ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	24	Another parable put He forth before them , saying , “ The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man who sowed good seed in his field ;
KJ21	Matthew	13	25	but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way .
KJ21	Matthew	13	26	But when the blades had sprung up and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
KJ21	Matthew	13	27	So the servants of the householder came and said unto him , ‘ Sir , didst not thou sow good seed in thy field ? From whence then hath come the tares ? ’
KJ21	Matthew	13	28	He said unto them , ‘ An enemy hath done this. ’ The servants said unto him , ‘ Wilt thou then have us go and gather them up ? ’
KJ21	Matthew	13	29	But he said , ‘ Nay , lest while ye gather up the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them .
KJ21	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest , and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers , “ Gather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them , but gather the wheat into my barn. ” ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	31	Another parable put He forth before them , saying , “ The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field ,
KJ21	Matthew	13	32	which indeed is the least of all seeds ; but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	33	Another parable spoke He unto them : “ The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened. ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	34	All these things spoke Jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spoke He not unto them ,
KJ21	Matthew	13	35	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying , “ I will open My mouth in parables ; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	36	Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house , and His disciples came unto Him , saying , “ Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field. ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	37	He answered and said unto them , “ He that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man .
KJ21	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world , the good seed are the children of the Kingdom , but the tares are the children of the wicked one .
KJ21	Matthew	13	39	The enemy that sowed them is the devil , the harvest is the end of the world , and the reapers are the angels .
KJ21	Matthew	13	40	As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire , so shall it be at the end of this world .
KJ21	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man shall send forth His angels , and they shall gather out of His Kingdom all things that offend and them that do iniquity ,
KJ21	Matthew	13	42	and shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
KJ21	Matthew	13	43	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father . Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
KJ21	Matthew	13	44	“ Again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field , which , when a man hath found , he hideth ; and for the joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
KJ21	Matthew	13	45	“ Again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls ,
KJ21	Matthew	13	46	who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had and bought it .
KJ21	Matthew	13	47	“ Again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind ,
KJ21	Matthew	13	48	which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
KJ21	Matthew	13	49	So shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just ,
KJ21	Matthew	13	50	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	51	Jesus said unto them , “ Have ye understood all these things ? ” They said unto Him , “ Yea , Lord. ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	52	Then said He unto them , “ Therefore every scribe who is instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is a householder , who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	53	And it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these parables , He departed thence .
KJ21	Matthew	13	54	And when He had come into His own country , He taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished and said , “ From whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works ?
KJ21	Matthew	13	55	Is not this the carpenter ’ s son ? Is not his mother called Mary and his brethren James and Joseph , and Simon and Judas ?
KJ21	Matthew	13	56	And his sisters , are they not all with us ? From whence then hath this man all these things ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	57	And they were offended at Him . But Jesus said unto them , “ A prophet is not without honor , save in his own country and in his own house. ”
KJ21	Matthew	13	58	And He did not many mighty works there , because of their unbelief .
KJ21	Matthew	14	14	And Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and He healed their sick .
KJ21	Matthew	14	2	and said unto his servants , “ This is John the Baptist . He is risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works show forth themselves in him. ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	3	For Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife .
KJ21	Matthew	14	4	For John said unto him , “ It is not lawful for thee to have her. ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	5	And when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
KJ21	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod ’ s birthday was kept , the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod ,
KJ21	Matthew	14	7	whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask .
KJ21	Matthew	14	8	And she , being beforehand instructed by her mother , said , “ Give me here John the Baptist ’ s head on a charger. ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	9	And the king was sorry ; nevertheless for the oath ’ s sake , and those who sat with him at meat , he commanded it to be given her .
KJ21	Matthew	14	10	And he sent , and beheaded John in the prison .
KJ21	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought on a charger and given to the damsel , and she brought it to her mother .
KJ21	Matthew	14	12	And his disciples came , and took up the body and buried it , and went and told Jesus .
KJ21	Matthew	14	13	When Jesus heard of it , He departed thence by boat into a desert place apart . And when the people had heard thereof , they followed Him on foot out of the cities .
KJ21	Matthew	14	15	And when it was evening , His disciples came to Him , saying , “ This is a desert place and the time is now past . Send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages and buy themselves victuals. ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said unto them , “ They need not depart . Give ye them to eat. ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	17	And they said unto Him , “ We have here but five loaves and two fishes. ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	18	And He said , “ Bring them hither to Me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	19	And He commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves and the two fishes ; and looking up to Heaven , He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to His disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
KJ21	Matthew	14	20	And they all ate and were filled . And they took up the fragments that remained , twelve baskets full .
KJ21	Matthew	14	21	And those who had eaten were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
KJ21	Matthew	14	22	And straightway Jesus constrained His disciples to get into a boat and to go before Him unto the other side , while He sent the multitudes away .
KJ21	Matthew	14	23	And when He had sent the multitudes away , He went up onto a mountain apart to pray . And when evening had come , He was there alone .
KJ21	Matthew	14	24	But the boat was now in the midst of the sea , tossed by the waves , for the wind was contrary .
KJ21	Matthew	14	25	And in the fourth watch of the night , Jesus went unto them , walking on the sea .
KJ21	Matthew	14	26	And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , “ It is a spirit ” ; and they cried out for fear .
KJ21	Matthew	14	27	But straightway Jesus spoke unto them , saying , “ Be of good cheer . It is I ; be not afraid. ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	28	And Peter answered Him and said , “ Lord , if it be Thou , bid me come unto Thee on the water. ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	29	And He said , “ Come. ” And when Peter had come down out of the boat , he walked on the water to go to Jesus .
KJ21	Matthew	14	30	But when he saw that the wind was boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , “ Lord , save me ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	31	And immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand and caught him and said unto him , “ O thou of little faith , why didst thou doubt ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	32	And when they had come into the boat , the wind ceased .
KJ21	Matthew	14	33	Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him , saying , “ In truth Thou art the Son of God. ”
KJ21	Matthew	14	34	And when they had gone over , they came into the land of Gennesaret .
KJ21	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place learned of Him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought unto Him all who were diseased .
KJ21	Matthew	14	36	And they besought Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment . And as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
KJ21	Matthew	15	15	Then answered Peter and said unto Him , “ Explain to us this parable. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	2	“ Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	3	But He answered and said unto them , “ Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition ?
KJ21	Matthew	15	4	For God commanded , saying , ‘ Honor thy father and mother , ’ and , ‘ He that curseth father or mother , let him die the death. ’
KJ21	Matthew	15	5	But ye say that whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , ‘ by whatsoever thou might have profited by me , it is a gift , ’
KJ21	Matthew	15	6	and honor not his father or his mother , he shall be free . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition .
KJ21	Matthew	15	7	Ye hypocrites , well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	15	8	‘ This people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth , and honoreth Me with their lips , but their heart is far from Me .
KJ21	Matthew	15	9	But in vain they do worship Me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	10	And He called the multitude and said unto them , “ Hear and understand :
KJ21	Matthew	15	11	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man , but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	12	Then came His disciples and said unto Him , “ Knowest Thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	13	But He answered and said , “ Every plant which My heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up .
KJ21	Matthew	15	14	Let them alone ; they are blind leaders of the blind . And if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	16	And Jesus said , “ Are ye also yet without understanding ?
KJ21	Matthew	15	17	Do ye not yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the drain ?
KJ21	Matthew	15	18	But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart , and they defile the man .
KJ21	Matthew	15	19	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies :
KJ21	Matthew	15	20	these are the things which defile a man . But to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	21	Then Jesus went thence and departed into the region of Tyre and Sidon .
KJ21	Matthew	15	22	And behold , a woman of Canaan came out of the same region and cried unto Him , saying , “ Have mercy on me , O Lord , Thou Son of David ! My daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	23	But He answered her not a word . And His disciples came and besought Him , saying , “ Send her away , for she crieth after us. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	24	But He answered and said , “ I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	25	Then she came and worshiped Him , saying , “ Lord help me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	26	But He answered and said , “ It is not meet to take children ’ s bread and cast it to dogs. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	27	And she said , “ Truth , Lord ; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ’ table. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answered and said unto her , “ O woman , great is thy faith . Be it unto thee even as thou wilt. ” And her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
KJ21	Matthew	15	29	And Jesus departed from thence and came nigh unto the Sea of Galilee , and went up onto a mountain and sat down there .
KJ21	Matthew	15	30	And great multitudes came unto Him , having with them those who were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ’ feet , and He healed them ,
KJ21	Matthew	15	31	insomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak , and the maimed to be whole , the lame to walk , and the blind to see . And they glorified the God of Israel .
KJ21	Matthew	15	32	Then Jesus called His disciples unto Him and said , “ I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with Me now three days and have had nothing to eat ; and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint on the way. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	33	And His disciples said unto Him , “ From whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus said unto them , “ How many loaves have ye ? ” And they said , “ Seven , and a few little fishes. ”
KJ21	Matthew	15	35	And He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
KJ21	Matthew	15	36	And He took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and broke them and gave to His disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
KJ21	Matthew	15	37	And they all ate and were filled . And they took up of the broken pieces that were left , seven baskets full .
KJ21	Matthew	15	38	And those who ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .
KJ21	Matthew	15	39	And He sent away the multitude , and took the boat and went into the coasts of Magdala .
KJ21	Matthew	16	16	And Simon Peter answered and said , “ Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God. ”
KJ21	Matthew	16	2	He answered and said unto them , “ When it is evening ye say , ‘ It will be fair weather , for the sky is red. ’
KJ21	Matthew	16	3	And in the morning , ‘ It will be foul weather today , for the sky is red and lowering. ’ O ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky , but can ye not discern the signs of the times ?
KJ21	Matthew	16	4	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign , and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet Jonah. ” And He left them and departed .
KJ21	Matthew	16	5	And when His disciples had come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
KJ21	Matthew	16	6	Then Jesus said unto them , “ Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. ”
KJ21	Matthew	16	7	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ It is because we have taken no bread. ”
KJ21	Matthew	16	8	But when Jesus perceived this , He said unto them , “ O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , ‘ because ye have brought no bread ’ ?
KJ21	Matthew	16	9	Do ye not yet understand , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
KJ21	Matthew	16	10	Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
KJ21	Matthew	16	11	How is it that ye do not understand that I spoke it not to you concerning bread , but that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	16	12	Then understood they that He bade them not to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
KJ21	Matthew	16	13	When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi , He asked His disciples , saying , “ Who do men say that I , the Son of Man , am ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	16	14	And they said , “ Some say that Thou art John the Baptist , some Elijah , and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets. ”
KJ21	Matthew	16	17	And Jesus answered and said unto him , “ Blessed art thou , Simon Bar-Jonah , for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , but My Father who is in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	16	18	And I say also unto thee , that thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build My church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
KJ21	Matthew	16	19	And I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven . And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven , and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven. ”
KJ21	Matthew	16	20	Then He charged His disciples that they should tell no man that He was Jesus the Christ .
KJ21	Matthew	16	21	From that time forth began Jesus to show unto His disciples that He must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
KJ21	Matthew	16	22	Then Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him , saying , “ Be it far from Thee , Lord ; this shall not happen unto Thee. ”
KJ21	Matthew	16	23	But He turned and said unto Peter , “ Get thee behind Me , Satan ! Thou art an offense unto Me ; for thou savorest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men. ”
KJ21	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus said unto His disciples , “ If any man will come after Me , let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me .
KJ21	Matthew	16	25	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it , and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall find it .
KJ21	Matthew	16	26	For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul ? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
KJ21	Matthew	16	27	For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels , and then He shall reward every man according to his works .
KJ21	Matthew	16	28	Verily I say unto you , there are some standing here who shall not taste of death till they see the Son of Man coming in His Kingdom . ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	17	Then Jesus answered and said , “ O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I suffer you ? Bring him hither to Me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	2	And He was transfigured before them ; and His face shone as the sun , and His raiment was white as the light .
KJ21	Matthew	17	3	And behold , there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah , talking with Him .
KJ21	Matthew	17	4	Then answered Peter and said unto Jesus , “ Lord , it is good for us to be here . If Thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles : one for Thee and one for Moses and one for Elijah. ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	5	While he yet spoke , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them . And behold , a voice out of the cloud , said , “ This Is My Beloved Son In Whom I Am Well Pleased . Hear Ye Him ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	6	And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their faces and were sore afraid .
KJ21	Matthew	17	7	And Jesus came and touched them and said , “ Arise , and be not afraid. ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	8	And when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save Jesus only .
KJ21	Matthew	17	9	And as they came down from the mountain , Jesus charged them , saying , “ Tell the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead. ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	10	And His disciples asked Him , saying , “ Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	11	And Jesus answered and said unto them , “ Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things .
KJ21	Matthew	17	12	But I say unto you that Elijah is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they pleased . Likewise shall also the Son of Man suffer by them. ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood that He spoke unto them of John the Baptist .
KJ21	Matthew	17	14	And when they had come to the multitude , there came to Him a certain man , kneeling down to Him and saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	17	15	“ Lord , have mercy on my son , for he is lunatic and sorely vexed ; for ofttimes he falleth into the fire and oft into the water .
KJ21	Matthew	17	16	And I brought him to Thy disciples , and they could not cure him. ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	18	And Jesus rebuked the devil , and he departed out of him , and the child was cured from that very hour .
KJ21	Matthew	17	19	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said , “ Why could we not cast him out ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	20	And Jesus said unto them , “ Because of your unbelief ; for verily I say unto you , if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye shall say unto this mountain , ‘ Remove hence to yonder place , ’ and it shall remove . And nothing shall be impossible unto you .
KJ21	Matthew	17	21	However this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	22	And while they abode in Galilee , Jesus said unto them , “ The Son of Man shall be betrayed into the hands of men .
KJ21	Matthew	17	23	And they shall kill Him , and the third day He shall be raised again. ” And they were exceeding sorry .
KJ21	Matthew	17	24	And when they had come to Capernaum , those who collected the tribute money came to Peter and said , “ Doth not your master pay tribute ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	25	He said , “ Yes. ” And when he had come into the house , Jesus preceded him , saying , “ What thinkest thou , Simon ? From whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute ? From their own children , or from strangers ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	17	26	Peter said unto Him , “ From strangers. ” Jesus said unto him , “ Then are the children free .
KJ21	Matthew	17	27	Notwithstanding , lest we should offend them , go thou to the sea and cast a hook , and take up the fish that first cometh up . And when thou hast opened his mouth , thou shalt find a piece of money . That take , and give unto them for Me and thee . ”
KJ21	Matthew	18	18	Verily I say unto you , whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven ; and so whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	18	2	And Jesus called a little child unto Him , and set him in the midst of them ,
KJ21	Matthew	18	3	and said , “ Verily I say unto you , unless ye be converted and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	18	4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	18	5	And whoso shall receive one such little child in My name , receiveth Me .
KJ21	Matthew	18	6	But whoso shall cause one of these little ones who believe in Me to fall , it were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
KJ21	Matthew	18	7	“ Woe unto the world because of offenses ! For it must happen that offenses come , but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh .
KJ21	Matthew	18	8	Therefore if thy hand or thy foot cause thee to fall , cut them off and cast them from thee ; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet , to be cast into everlasting fire .
KJ21	Matthew	18	9	And if thine eye cause thee to fall , pluck it out and cast it from thee ; it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes , to be cast into hell fire .
KJ21	Matthew	18	10	“ Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones ; for I say unto you that in Heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father who is in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	18	11	“ For the Son of Man is come to save that which was lost .
KJ21	Matthew	18	12	How think ye ? If a man have a hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray ?
KJ21	Matthew	18	13	And if it so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth more over that sheep than over the ninety and nine which went not astray .
KJ21	Matthew	18	14	Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in Heaven that one of these little ones should perish .
KJ21	Matthew	18	15	“ Moreover , if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone . If he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
KJ21	Matthew	18	16	But if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that ‘ in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. ’
KJ21	Matthew	18	17	And if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church ; but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican .
KJ21	Matthew	18	19	“ Again I say unto you , that if two of you shall agree on earth concerning anything that they shall ask , it shall be done for them by My Father who is in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	18	20	For where two or three are gathered together in My name , there am I in the midst of them. ”
KJ21	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter came to Him and said , “ Lord , how often shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? Until seven times ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	18	22	And Jesus said unto him , “ I say not unto thee , until seven times , but until seventy times seven .
KJ21	Matthew	18	23	“ Therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain king who would settle accounts with his servants .
KJ21	Matthew	18	24	And when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him who owed him ten thousand talents .
KJ21	Matthew	18	25	But inasmuch as he could not pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife and children and all that he had , and payment to be made .
KJ21	Matthew	18	26	The servant therefore fell down and did homage to him , saying , ‘ Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all. ’
KJ21	Matthew	18	27	Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him and forgave him the debt .
KJ21	Matthew	18	28	But the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred pence . And he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , ‘ Pay me what thou owest. ’
KJ21	Matthew	18	29	And his fellow servant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , ‘ Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all. ’
KJ21	Matthew	18	30	And he would not , but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt .
KJ21	Matthew	18	31	So when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
KJ21	Matthew	18	32	Then his lord , after he had called him , said unto him , ‘ O thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me .
KJ21	Matthew	18	33	Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant , even as I had pity on thee ? ’
KJ21	Matthew	18	34	And his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him .
KJ21	Matthew	18	35	So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also unto you , if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother ’ s trespasses . ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	19	honor thy father and thy mother ; and , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	2	And great multitudes followed Him , and He healed them there .
KJ21	Matthew	19	3	The Pharisees also came unto Him , testing Him and saying unto Him , “ Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	4	And He answered and said unto them , “ Have ye not read , that He that made them at the beginning made them male and female ,
KJ21	Matthew	19	5	and said , ‘ For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife , and the two shall be one flesh ’ ?
KJ21	Matthew	19	6	Therefore they are no more two , but one flesh . What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder. ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	7	They said unto Him , “ Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	8	He said unto them , “ Moses , because of the hardness of your hearts , suffered you to put away your wives , but from the beginning it was not so .
KJ21	Matthew	19	9	And I say unto you , whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery ; and whoso marrieth her who is put away doth commit adultery. ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	10	His disciples said unto Him , “ If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry. ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	11	But He said unto them , “ All men can not receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
KJ21	Matthew	19	12	For there are some eunuchs who were so born from their mother ’ s womb , and there are some eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men , and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven ’ s sake . He that is able to receive it , let him receive it. ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	13	Then were there brought unto Him little children , that He should put His hands on them and pray . And the disciples rebuked them ,
KJ21	Matthew	19	14	but Jesus said , “ Suffer little children , and forbid them not to come unto Me , for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	15	And He laid His hands on them and departed thence .
KJ21	Matthew	19	16	And behold , one came and said unto Him , “ Good Master , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	17	And He said unto him , “ Why callest thou Me good ? There is none good but One , that is , God . But if thou wilt enter into Life , keep the commandments. ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	18	He said unto Him , “ Which ? ” Jesus said , “ ‘ Thou shalt do no murder ; thou shalt not commit adultery ; thou shalt not steal ; thou shalt not bear false witness ;
KJ21	Matthew	19	20	The young man said unto Him , “ All these things have I kept from my youth up . What lack I yet ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said unto him , “ If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell what thou hast and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven ; and come and follow Me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowful , for he had great possessions .
KJ21	Matthew	19	23	Then said Jesus unto His disciples , “ Verily I say unto you , that a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	19	24	And again I say unto you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	25	When His disciples heard it , they were exceedingly amazed , saying , “ Who then can be saved ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	26	But Jesus beheld them and said unto them , “ With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible. ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	27	Then Peter answered and said unto Him , “ Behold , we have forsaken all and followed Thee . What shall we have therefore ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	19	28	And Jesus said unto them , “ Verily I say unto you , that ye that have followed Me , in the regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
KJ21	Matthew	19	29	And everyone that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands , for My name ’ s sake , shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life .
KJ21	Matthew	19	30	But many that are first shall be last , and the last shall be first .
KJ21	Matthew	20	20	Then came to Him the mother of Zebedee ’ s children with her sons , worshiping Him and desiring a certain thing of Him .
KJ21	Matthew	20	2	And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
KJ21	Matthew	20	3	And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
KJ21	Matthew	20	4	and said unto them , ‘ Go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right I will give you. ’ And they went their way .
KJ21	Matthew	20	5	Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise .
KJ21	Matthew	20	6	And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle , and said unto them , ‘ Why stand ye here all the day idle ? ’
KJ21	Matthew	20	7	They said unto him , ‘ Because no man hath hired us. ’ He said unto them , ‘ Go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive. ’
KJ21	Matthew	20	8	So when evening had come , the lord of the vineyard said unto his steward , ‘ Call the laborers and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first. ’
KJ21	Matthew	20	9	And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a penny .
KJ21	Matthew	20	10	But when the first came , they supposed they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
KJ21	Matthew	20	11	And when they had received it , they murmured against the master of the house ,
KJ21	Matthew	20	12	saying , ‘ These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day. ’
KJ21	Matthew	20	13	But he answered one of them and said , ‘ Friend , I do thee no wrong . Didst thou not agree with me for a penny ?
KJ21	Matthew	20	14	Take that which is thine and go thy way . I will give unto this last , even as unto thee .
KJ21	Matthew	20	15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ? Is thine eye evil , because I am good ? ’
KJ21	Matthew	20	16	So the last shall be first , and the first last . For many are called , but few are chosen. ”
KJ21	Matthew	20	17	And Jesus , going up to Jerusalem , took the twelve disciples apart on the way and said unto them ,
KJ21	Matthew	20	18	“ Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes , and they shall condemn Him to death ,
KJ21	Matthew	20	19	and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him . And the third day , He shall rise again. ”
KJ21	Matthew	20	21	And He said unto her , “ What wilt thou ? ” She said unto Him , “ Grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on Thy right hand and the other on the left in Thy Kingdom. ”
KJ21	Matthew	20	22	But Jesus answered and said , “ Ye know not what ye ask . Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? ” They said unto Him , “ We are able. ”
KJ21	Matthew	20	23	And He said unto them , “ Ye shall drink indeed of My cup , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give , but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared by My Father. ”
KJ21	Matthew	20	24	And when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren .
KJ21	Matthew	20	25	But Jesus called them unto Him and said , “ Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
KJ21	Matthew	20	26	But it shall not be so among you ; but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ;
KJ21	Matthew	20	27	and whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant ,
KJ21	Matthew	20	28	even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give His life as a ransom for many. ”
KJ21	Matthew	20	29	And as they departed from Jericho , a great multitude followed Him .
KJ21	Matthew	20	30	And behold , two blind men were sitting by the wayside when they heard that Jesus was passing by , and they cried out , saying , “ Have mercy on us , O Lord , Thou Son of David ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	20	31	And the multitude rebuked them , that they should hold their peace ; but they cried out the more , saying , “ Have mercy on us , O Lord , Thou Son of David ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	20	32	And Jesus stood still , and called them and said , “ What will ye that I shall do unto you ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	20	33	They said unto Him , “ Lord , that our eyes may be opened. ”
KJ21	Matthew	20	34	So Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes , and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed Him .
KJ21	Matthew	21	21	Jesus answered and said unto them , “ Verily I say unto you , if ye have faith and doubt not , ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree , but also if ye shall say unto this mountain , ‘ Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea , ’ it shall be done .
KJ21	Matthew	21	2	saying unto them , “ Go into the village opposite you , and straightway ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her . Loose them and bring them unto Me .
KJ21	Matthew	21	3	And if any man say aught unto you , ye shall say , ‘ The Lord hath need of them , ’ and straightway he will send them. ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	4	All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	21	5	“ Tell ye the daughter of Zion , ‘ Behold , thy King cometh unto thee , meek and sitting upon an ass , and a colt , the foal of an ass. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	6	And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them .
KJ21	Matthew	21	7	And they brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes , and they set Him thereon .
KJ21	Matthew	21	8	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; and others cut down branches from the trees and strewed them in the way .
KJ21	Matthew	21	9	And the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried out , saying , “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	10	And when He had come into Jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , “ Who is this ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	11	And the multitude said , “ This is Jesus , the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	12	And Jesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold doves ,
KJ21	Matthew	21	13	and said unto them , “ It is written , ‘ My house shall be called the house of prayer , ’ but ye have made it a den of thieves. ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	14	And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple , and He healed them .
KJ21	Matthew	21	15	And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did , and the children crying out in the temple and saying , “ Hosanna to the Son of David , ” they were sore displeased ,
KJ21	Matthew	21	16	and said unto Him , “ Hearest thou what these say ? ” And Jesus said unto them , “ Yea , have ye never read , ‘ Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise ’ ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	17	And He left them and went out of the city into Bethany , and He lodged there .
KJ21	Matthew	21	18	Now in the morning as He returned into the city , He hungered .
KJ21	Matthew	21	19	And when He saw a fig tree by the wayside , He came to it and found nothing thereon , but leaves only . And He said unto it , “ Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. ” And immediately the fig tree withered away .
KJ21	Matthew	21	20	And when the disciples saw it , they marveled , saying , “ How soon has the fig tree withered away ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	22	And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive. ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	23	And when He had come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto Him as He was teaching and said , “ By what authority doest thou these things ? And who gave thee this authority ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	24	And Jesus answered and said unto them , “ I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell Me , I in like manner will tell you by what authority I do these things .
KJ21	Matthew	21	25	The baptism of John : whence was it ? From Heaven , or of men ? ” And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we shall say , ‘ From Heaven , ’ he will say unto us , ‘ Why did ye not then believe him ? ’
KJ21	Matthew	21	26	But if we shall say , ‘ Of men , ’ we fear the people , for all hold John to be a prophet. ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	27	And they answered Jesus and said , “ We can not tell. ” And He said unto them , “ Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
KJ21	Matthew	21	28	“ But what think ye ? A certain man had two sons . And he came to the first and said , ‘ Son , go work today in my vineyard. ’
KJ21	Matthew	21	29	He answered and said , ‘ I will not , ’ but afterward he repented and went .
KJ21	Matthew	21	30	And he came to the second and said likewise . And he answered and said , ‘ I go , sir , ’ and went not .
KJ21	Matthew	21	31	Which of those two did the will of his father ? ” They said unto Him , “ The first. ” Jesus said unto them , “ Verily I say unto you , that the publicans and the harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you .
KJ21	Matthew	21	32	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not ; but the publicans and harlots believed him . And ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
KJ21	Matthew	21	33	“ Hear another parable : There was a certain householder who planted a vineyard , and hedged it round about , and dug a wine press in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country .
KJ21	Matthew	21	34	And when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
KJ21	Matthew	21	35	And the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one and killed another and stoned another .
KJ21	Matthew	21	36	Again , he sent other servants , more than the first ; and they did unto them likewise .
KJ21	Matthew	21	37	But last of all he sent unto them his son , saying , ‘ They will reverence my son. ’
KJ21	Matthew	21	38	But when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance. ’
KJ21	Matthew	21	39	And they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him .
KJ21	Matthew	21	40	When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh , what will he do unto those husbandmen ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	41	They said unto Him , “ He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , who shall render him the fruits in their seasons. ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	42	Jesus said unto them , “ Did ye never read in the Scriptures : ‘ The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner . This is the Lord ’ s doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ?
KJ21	Matthew	21	43	Therefore say I unto you , the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
KJ21	Matthew	21	44	And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder. ”
KJ21	Matthew	21	45	And when the chief priests and the Pharisees had heard His parables , they perceived that He spoke of them .
KJ21	Matthew	21	46	But when they sought to lay hands on Him , they feared the multitude , because they took Him for a prophet .
KJ21	Matthew	22	22	When they had heard these words , they marveled , and left Him and went their way .
KJ21	Matthew	22	2	“ The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain king , who made a marriage for his son .
KJ21	Matthew	22	3	And he sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding , and they would not come .
KJ21	Matthew	22	4	Again he sent forth other servants , saying , ‘ Tell them that are bidden , “ Behold , I have prepared my dinner ; my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready . Come unto the marriage. ” ’
KJ21	Matthew	22	5	But they made light of it and went their ways , one to his farm , and another to his merchandise ,
KJ21	Matthew	22	6	and the remnant took his servants and treated them spitefully and slew them .
KJ21	Matthew	22	7	But when the king heard thereof he was wroth , and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city .
KJ21	Matthew	22	8	Then said he to his servants , ‘ The wedding is ready , but they that were bidden were not worthy .
KJ21	Matthew	22	9	Go ye therefore into the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage. ’
KJ21	Matthew	22	10	So those servants went out into the highways , and gathered all together as many as they found , both bad and good , and the wedding was furnished with guests .
KJ21	Matthew	22	11	And when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man who did not have on a wedding garment .
KJ21	Matthew	22	12	And he said unto him , ‘ Friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? ’ And he was speechless .
KJ21	Matthew	22	13	Then said the king to the servants , ‘ Bind him hand and foot and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ’
KJ21	Matthew	22	14	For many are called , but few are chosen. ”
KJ21	Matthew	22	15	Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entangle Him in His talk .
KJ21	Matthew	22	16	And they sent out unto Him their disciples with the Herodians , saying , “ Master , we know that thou art true and teachest the way of God in truth ; neither carest thou for any man , for thou regardest not the person of men .
KJ21	Matthew	22	17	Tell us therefore , what thinkest thou ? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said , “ Why tempt ye Me , ye hypocrites ?
KJ21	Matthew	22	19	Show Me the tribute money. ” And they brought unto Him a penny .
KJ21	Matthew	22	20	And He said unto them , “ Whose is this image and superscription ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	22	21	And they said unto Him , “ Caesar ’ s. ” Then said He unto them , “ Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar ’ s , and unto God the things that are God ’ s. ”
KJ21	Matthew	22	23	The same day the Sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection , came to Him and asked Him ,
KJ21	Matthew	22	24	saying , “ Master , Moses said , ‘ If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother. ’
KJ21	Matthew	22	25	Now there were with us seven brethren . And the first , when he had married a wife , died ; and having no issue , he left his wife unto his brother .
KJ21	Matthew	22	26	Likewise the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
KJ21	Matthew	22	27	And last of all , the woman died also .
KJ21	Matthew	22	28	Therefore in the resurrection , whose wife shall she be of the seven ? For they all had her. ”
KJ21	Matthew	22	29	Jesus answered and said unto them , “ Ye do err , not knowing the Scriptures , nor the power of God .
KJ21	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	22	31	But concerning the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	22	32	‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living. ”
KJ21	Matthew	22	33	And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at His doctrine .
KJ21	Matthew	22	34	But when the Pharisees had heard that He had put the Sadducees to silence , they were gathered together .
KJ21	Matthew	22	35	Then one of them , who was a lawyer , asked Him a question , tempting Him and saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	22	36	“ Master , which is the great commandment in the law ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	22	37	Jesus said unto him , “ ‘ Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind. ’
KJ21	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and great commandment .
KJ21	Matthew	22	39	And the second is like unto it : ‘ Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. ’
KJ21	Matthew	22	40	On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. ”
KJ21	Matthew	22	41	While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
KJ21	Matthew	22	42	saying , “ What think ye of Christ ? Whose Son is He ? ” They said unto Him , “ The son of David. ”
KJ21	Matthew	22	43	He said unto them , “ How then doth David in the Spirit call Him ‘ Lord , ’ saying ,
KJ21	Matthew	22	44	‘ The Lord said unto my Lord , “ Sit Thou on My right hand until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool ” ’ ?
KJ21	Matthew	22	45	If David then call Him ‘ Lord , ’ how is He his son ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	22	46	And no man was able to answer Him a word ; neither dared any man from that day forth ask Him any more questions .
KJ21	Matthew	23	23	“ Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin , and have omitted the weightier matters of the law : judgment , mercy , and faith . These ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone .
KJ21	Matthew	23	2	saying , “ The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses ’ seat .
KJ21	Matthew	23	3	All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe , that observe and do ; but do ye not according to their works ; for they say , and do not .
KJ21	Matthew	23	4	For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne , and lay them on men ’ s shoulders , but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers .
KJ21	Matthew	23	5	But all their works they do to be seen by men . They make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
KJ21	Matthew	23	6	and love the uppermost places at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
KJ21	Matthew	23	7	and greetings in the markets , and to be called by men , ‘ Rabbi , Rabbi. ’
KJ21	Matthew	23	8	But be not ye called ‘ Rabbi , ’ for One is your Master , even Christ ; and all ye are brethren .
KJ21	Matthew	23	9	“ And call no man your father upon earth , for One is your Father , who is in Heaven .
KJ21	Matthew	23	10	Neither be ye called masters , for One is your Master , even Christ .
KJ21	Matthew	23	11	But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant .
KJ21	Matthew	23	12	And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased , and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
KJ21	Matthew	23	13	“ But woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For ye shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men , for ye neither go in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in .
KJ21	Matthew	23	14	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For ye devour widows ’ houses , and for a pretense make long prayers ; therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation .
KJ21	Matthew	23	15	“ Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte , and when he is made , ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves .
KJ21	Matthew	23	16	“ Woe unto you , ye blind guides , who say , ‘ Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is obligated. ’
KJ21	Matthew	23	17	Ye fools and blind ! For which is greater , the gold , or the temple that sanctifieth the gold ?
KJ21	Matthew	23	18	And ye say , ‘ Whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it , he is liable. ’
KJ21	Matthew	23	19	Ye fools and blind ! For which is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
KJ21	Matthew	23	20	Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar , sweareth by it and by all things thereon .
KJ21	Matthew	23	21	And whoso shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it and by Him that dwelleth therein .
KJ21	Matthew	23	22	And he that shall swear by Heaven , sweareth by the throne of God and by Him that sitteth thereon .
KJ21	Matthew	23	24	Ye blind guides , who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel !
KJ21	Matthew	23	25	“ Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
KJ21	Matthew	23	26	Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
KJ21	Matthew	23	27	“ Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For ye are like unto whited sepulchers , which indeed appear beautiful outwardly , but are within full of dead men ’ s bones and of all uncleanness .
KJ21	Matthew	23	28	Even so , ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
KJ21	Matthew	23	29	“ Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! Because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous ,
KJ21	Matthew	23	30	and say , ‘ If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. ’
KJ21	Matthew	23	31	Therefore ye are witnesses against yourselves , that ye are the children of them that killed the prophets .
KJ21	Matthew	23	32	Fill ye up , then , the measure of your fathers .
KJ21	Matthew	23	33	“ Ye serpents , ye generation of vipers ! How can ye escape the damnation of hell ?
KJ21	Matthew	23	34	Therefore , behold , I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes , and some of them ye shall kill and crucify , and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city ,
KJ21	Matthew	23	35	that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zechariah , son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
KJ21	Matthew	23	36	Verily I say unto you , all these things shall come upon this generation .
KJ21	Matthew	23	37	“ O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
KJ21	Matthew	23	38	Behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
KJ21	Matthew	23	39	For I say unto you , ye shall not see Me henceforth till ye shall say , ‘ Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord ! ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	24	24	For there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders , insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect .
KJ21	Matthew	24	2	And Jesus said unto them , “ See ye not all these things ? Verily I say unto you , there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. ”
KJ21	Matthew	24	3	And as He sat upon the Mount of Olives , the disciples came unto Him privately , saying , “ Tell us , when shall these things be ? And what shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the end of the world ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	24	4	And Jesus answered and said unto them , “ Take heed that no man deceive you ;
KJ21	Matthew	24	5	for many shall come in My name , saying , ‘ I am Christ , ’ and shall deceive many .
KJ21	Matthew	24	6	And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars . See that ye be not troubled , for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
KJ21	Matthew	24	7	For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom , and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places .
KJ21	Matthew	24	8	All these are the beginning of sorrows .
KJ21	Matthew	24	9	Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you , and ye shall be hated by all nations for My name ’ s sake .
KJ21	Matthew	24	10	And then shall many lose faith and shall betray one another and shall hate one another .
KJ21	Matthew	24	11	And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many .
KJ21	Matthew	24	12	And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold .
KJ21	Matthew	24	13	But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
KJ21	Matthew	24	14	And this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations , and then shall the end come .
KJ21	Matthew	24	15	“ When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( whoso readeth , let him understand ) ,
KJ21	Matthew	24	16	then let them that be in Judea flee unto the mountains .
KJ21	Matthew	24	17	Let him that is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house ;
KJ21	Matthew	24	18	neither let him that is in the field return back to take his clothes .
KJ21	Matthew	24	19	And woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
KJ21	Matthew	24	20	But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the Sabbath day .
KJ21	Matthew	24	21	For then shall be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be .
KJ21	Matthew	24	22	And unless those days should be shortened , there should no flesh be saved ; but for the elect ’ s sake , those days shall be shortened .
KJ21	Matthew	24	23	Then if any man shall say unto you , ‘ Lo , here is Christ , ’ or ‘ there , ’ believe it not .
KJ21	Matthew	24	25	Behold , I have told you before .
KJ21	Matthew	24	26	Therefore , if they shall say unto you , ‘ Behold , He is in the desert ! ’ go not forth ; or ‘ Behold , He is in the secret chambers ! ’ believe it not .
KJ21	Matthew	24	27	For as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west , so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be .
KJ21	Matthew	24	28	For wheresoever the carcass is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
KJ21	Matthew	24	29	“ Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken ,
KJ21	Matthew	24	30	and then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven . And then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and with great glory .
KJ21	Matthew	24	31	And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
KJ21	Matthew	24	32	“ Now learn a parable of the fig tree : When his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh .
KJ21	Matthew	24	33	So likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
KJ21	Matthew	24	34	Verily I say unto you , this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled .
KJ21	Matthew	24	35	Heaven and earth shall pass away , but My Words shall not pass away .
KJ21	Matthew	24	36	But of that day and hour , knoweth no man , no , not the angels of Heaven , but My Father only .
KJ21	Matthew	24	37	But as the days of Noah were , so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be .
KJ21	Matthew	24	38	For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark
KJ21	Matthew	24	39	and knew not until the flood came and took them all away , so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be .
KJ21	Matthew	24	40	Then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken and the other left .
KJ21	Matthew	24	41	Two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken and the other left .
KJ21	Matthew	24	42	“ Watch therefore , for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come .
KJ21	Matthew	24	43	But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken into .
KJ21	Matthew	24	44	Therefore be ye also ready , for in such an hour as ye think not , the Son of Man cometh .
KJ21	Matthew	24	45	“ Who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
KJ21	Matthew	24	46	Blessed is that servant whom his lord , when he cometh , shall find so doing .
KJ21	Matthew	24	47	Verily I say unto you , that he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
KJ21	Matthew	24	48	But if that evil servant shall say in his heart , ‘ My lord delayeth his coming , ’
KJ21	Matthew	24	49	and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken ,
KJ21	Matthew	24	50	the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him , and in an hour that he is not aware of ,
KJ21	Matthew	24	51	and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
KJ21	Matthew	25	25	And I was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth . Lo , there thou hast what is thine. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	2	And five of them were wise , and five were foolish .
KJ21	Matthew	25	3	They that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them ,
KJ21	Matthew	25	4	but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
KJ21	Matthew	25	5	While the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
KJ21	Matthew	25	6	And at midnight there was a cry made : ‘ Behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	7	Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps .
KJ21	Matthew	25	8	And the foolish said unto the wise , ‘ Give us of your oil , for our lamps are gone out. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	9	But the wise answered , saying , ‘ Not so , lest there be not enough for us and you ; but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	10	And while they went to buy , the bridegroom came , and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage , and the door was shut .
KJ21	Matthew	25	11	Afterward came also the other virgins , saying , ‘ Lord , lord , open to us ! ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	12	But he answered and said , ‘ Verily I say unto you , I know you not. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	13	Watch therefore , for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh .
KJ21	Matthew	25	14	“ For the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country , who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods .
KJ21	Matthew	25	15	And unto one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one , to every man according to his several ability , and straightway tookhis journey .
KJ21	Matthew	25	16	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them another five talents .
KJ21	Matthew	25	17	And likewise he that had received two , he also gained another two .
KJ21	Matthew	25	18	But he that had received one went and dug in the earth and hid his lord ’ s money .
KJ21	Matthew	25	19	After a long time the lord of those servants came and reckoned with them .
KJ21	Matthew	25	20	And so he that had received five talents came and brought the other five talents , saying , ‘ Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents . Behold , I have gained beside them five talents more. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	21	His lord said unto him , ‘ Well done , thou good and faithful servant . Thou hast been faithful over a few things ; I will make thee ruler over many things . Enter thou into the joy of thy lord. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	22	“ He also that had received two talents came and said , ‘ Lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents ; behold , I have gained two other talents beside them. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	23	His lord said unto him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant . Thou hast been faithful over a few things ; I will make thee ruler over many things . Enter thou into the joy of thy lord. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	24	“ Then he that had received the one talent came and said , ‘ Lord , I knew thee , that thou art a hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strewed .
KJ21	Matthew	25	26	His lord answered and said unto him , ‘ Thou wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not , and gather where I have not strewed .
KJ21	Matthew	25	27	Thou ought therefore to have placed my money with the exchangers , and then at my coming I should have received mine own with interest .
KJ21	Matthew	25	28	Take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him that hath ten talents .
KJ21	Matthew	25	29	For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance ; but from him that hath not , shall be taken away even that which he hath .
KJ21	Matthew	25	30	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	31	“ When the Son of Man shall come in His glory and all the holy angels with Him , then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory .
KJ21	Matthew	25	32	And before Him shall be gathered all nations , and He shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats .
KJ21	Matthew	25	33	And He shall set the sheep on His right hand , but the goats on the left .
KJ21	Matthew	25	34	Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand , ‘ Come , ye blessed of My Father , inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
KJ21	Matthew	25	35	For I hungered , and ye gave Me meat ; I was thirsty , and ye gave Me drink ; I was a stranger , and ye took Me in ;
KJ21	Matthew	25	36	naked , and ye clothed Me ; I was sick , and ye visited Me ; I was in prison , and ye came unto Me. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	37	Then shall the righteous answer Him , saying , ‘ Lord , when saw we Thee hungering and fed Thee , or thirsty and gave Thee drink ?
KJ21	Matthew	25	38	When saw we Thee a stranger and took Thee in , or naked and clothed Thee ?
KJ21	Matthew	25	39	Or when saw we Thee sick , or in prison , and came unto Thee ? ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	40	And the King shall answer and say unto them , ‘ Verily I say unto you , inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren , ye have done it unto Me. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	41	“ Then shall He say also unto them on the left hand , ‘ Depart from Me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels .
KJ21	Matthew	25	42	For I hungered , and ye gave Me no meat ; I was thirsty , and ye gave Me no drink ;
KJ21	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger , and ye took Me not in ; naked , and ye clothed Me not ; sick and in prison , and ye visited Me not. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	44	Then shall they also answer Him , saying , ‘ Lord , when saw we Thee hungering or athirst or a stranger , or naked or sick or in prison , and did not minister unto Thee ? ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	45	Then shall He answer them , saying , ‘ Verily I say unto you , inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to Me. ’
KJ21	Matthew	25	46	And these shall go away into everlasting punishment , but the righteous into life eternal . ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	26	And as they were eating , Jesus took bread and blessed it and broke it , and gave it to the disciples and said , “ Take , eat ; this is My body. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	2	“ Ye know that after two days is the Feast of the Passover , and the Son of Man is betrayed to be crucified. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	3	Then the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people assembled together unto the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
KJ21	Matthew	26	4	and consulted that they might take Jesus by stealth and kill Him .
KJ21	Matthew	26	5	But they said , “ Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar among the people. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper ,
KJ21	Matthew	26	7	there came unto Him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment , and poured it on His head as He sat at meat .
KJ21	Matthew	26	8	But when His disciples saw it , they were indignant , saying , “ To what purpose is this waste ?
KJ21	Matthew	26	9	For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	10	When Jesus perceived this , He said unto them , “ Why trouble ye the woman ? For she hath wrought a good work upon Me .
KJ21	Matthew	26	11	For ye have the poor always with you , but Me ye have not always .
KJ21	Matthew	26	12	For in that she hath poured this ointment on My body , she did it for My burial .
KJ21	Matthew	26	13	Verily I say unto you , wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , which this woman hath done , be told as a memorial of her. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the twelve , called Judas Iscariot , went unto the chief priests
KJ21	Matthew	26	15	and said unto them , “ What will ye give me if I will deliver Him unto you ? ” And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
KJ21	Matthew	26	16	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him .
KJ21	Matthew	26	17	Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the disciples came to Jesus , saying unto Him , “ Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Passover ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	18	And He said , “ Go into the city to a certain man and say unto him , ‘ The Master saith , “ My time is at hand ; I will keep the Passover at thy house with My disciples. ” ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	19	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them , and they made ready the Passover .
KJ21	Matthew	26	20	Now when the evening had come , He sat down with the twelve .
KJ21	Matthew	26	21	And as they ate , He said , “ Verily I say unto you , that one of you shall betray Me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	22	And they were exceeding sorrowful , and began every one of them to say unto Him , “ Lord , is it I ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	23	And He answered and said , “ He that dippeth his hand with Me in the dish , the same shall betray Me .
KJ21	Matthew	26	24	The Son of Man goeth as it is written of Him , but woe unto that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It had been good for that man if he had not been born. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	25	Then Judas , who betrayed Him , answered and said , “ Master , is it I ? ” He said unto him , “ Thou hast said. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	27	And He took the cup and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , “ Drink ye all of it ;
KJ21	Matthew	26	28	for this is My blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
KJ21	Matthew	26	29	But I say unto you , I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father ’ s Kingdom. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	30	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out unto the Mount of Olives .
KJ21	Matthew	26	31	Then Jesus said unto them , “ All ye shall be offended because of Me this night ; for it is written : ‘ I will smite the Shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. ’
KJ21	Matthew	26	32	But after I am risen again , I will go before you into Galilee. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	33	Peter answered and said unto Him , “ Though all men shall be offended because of Thee , yet I will never be offended. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said unto him , “ Verily I say unto thee , that this night before the cock crow , thou shalt deny Me thrice. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	35	Peter said unto Him , “ Though I should die with Thee , yet will I not deny Thee. ” Likewise also said all the disciples .
KJ21	Matthew	26	36	Then Jesus came with them unto a place called Gethsemane , and said unto the disciples , “ Sit ye here while I go and pray yonder. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	37	And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
KJ21	Matthew	26	38	Then He said unto them , “ My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death ; tarry ye here and watch with Me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	39	And He went a little farther , and fell on His face and prayed , saying , “ O My Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from Me ; nevertheless , not as I will , but as Thou wilt. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	40	And He came unto the disciples and found them asleep , and said unto Peter , “ What , could ye not watch with Me one hour ?
KJ21	Matthew	26	41	Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	42	He went away again the second time and prayed , saying , “ O My Father , if this cup may not pass away from Me , unless I drink it , Thy will be done. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	43	And He came and found them asleep again , for their eyes were heavy .
KJ21	Matthew	26	44	And He left them and went away again , and prayed a third time , saying the same words .
KJ21	Matthew	26	45	Then came He to His disciples and said unto them , “ Sleep on now , and take your rest . Behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
KJ21	Matthew	26	46	Rise , let us be going . Behold , he is at hand that doth betray Me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	47	And while He yet spoke , lo , Judas , one of the twelve came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
KJ21	Matthew	26	48	Now he that betrayed Him gave them a sign , saying , “ Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is He ; hold Him fast. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	49	And forthwith he came to Jesus and said , “ Hail , Master ! ” and kissed Him .
KJ21	Matthew	26	50	And Jesus said unto him , “ Friend , why art thou come ? ” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him .
KJ21	Matthew	26	51	And behold , one of those who was with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear .
KJ21	Matthew	26	52	Then said Jesus unto him , “ Put up again thy sword into his place , for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
KJ21	Matthew	26	53	Thinkest thou that I can not now pray to My Father , and He shall at once give Me more than twelve legions of angels ?
KJ21	Matthew	26	54	But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	55	In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes , “ Are ye come out as against a thief , with swords and staves to take Me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on Me .
KJ21	Matthew	26	56	But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. ” Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled .
KJ21	Matthew	26	57	And those who had laid hold on Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
KJ21	Matthew	26	58	But Peter followed Him afar off unto the high priest ’ s palace , and went in and sat with the servants to see the end .
KJ21	Matthew	26	59	Now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against Jesus to put Him to death ,
KJ21	Matthew	26	60	but found none . Yea , though many false witnesses came , yet found they none . At the last came two false witnesses ,
KJ21	Matthew	26	61	and said , “ This fellow said , ‘ I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	62	And the high priest arose and said unto Him , “ Answerest thou nothing ? What is it which these witnesses say against thee ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus held His peace . And the high priest answered and said unto Him , “ I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ , the Son of God. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	64	Jesus said unto him , “ Thou hast said ; nevertheless I say unto you , hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming in the clouds of heaven. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , “ He hath spoken blasphemy ! What further need have we of witnesses ? Behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy !
KJ21	Matthew	26	66	What think ye ? ” They answered and said , “ He is deserving of death ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	67	Then they spit in His face and buffeted Him , and others smote Him with the palms of their hands ,
KJ21	Matthew	26	68	saying , “ Prophesy unto us , thou Christ ! Who is he that smote thee ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	69	Now Peter sat outside in the palace , and a damsel came unto him , saying , “ Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it before them all , saying , “ I know not what thou sayest. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	71	And when he had gone out onto the porch , another maid saw him and said unto those who were there , “ This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied with an oath , “ I do not know the man ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	73	And after a while came unto him those who stood by , and said to Peter , “ Surely thou also art one of them , for thy speech betrayeth thee. ”
KJ21	Matthew	26	74	Then he began to curse and to swear , saying , “ I know not the man ! ” And immediately the cock crowed .
KJ21	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , when He said unto him , “ Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny Me thrice. ” And he went out and wept bitterly .
KJ21	Matthew	27	27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall , and gathered unto Him the whole detachment of soldiers .
KJ21	Matthew	27	2	And when they had bound Him , they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate , the governor .
KJ21	Matthew	27	3	Then Judas , who had betrayed Him , when he saw that He was condemned , repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
KJ21	Matthew	27	4	saying , “ I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. ” And they said , “ What is that to us ? See thou to that ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	5	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed , and went and hanged himself .
KJ21	Matthew	27	6	And the chief priests took the silver pieces and said , “ It is not lawful to put them into the treasury , because it is the price of blood. ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	7	And they took counsel and bought with them the potter ’ s field , to bury strangers in .
KJ21	Matthew	27	8	Therefore that field was called the Field of Blood unto this day .
KJ21	Matthew	27	9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying , “ And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of Him that was valued , whom they the children of Israel did value ,
KJ21	Matthew	27	10	and gave them for the potter ’ s field , as the Lord appointed me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	11	And Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor asked Him , saying , “ Art thou the King of the Jews ? ” And Jesus said unto him , “ Thou sayest. ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	12	And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders , He answered nothing .
KJ21	Matthew	27	13	Then said Pilate unto Him , “ Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	14	And He answered him never a word , insomuch that the governor marveled greatly .
KJ21	Matthew	27	15	Now at that feast , the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
KJ21	Matthew	27	16	And they had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas .
KJ21	Matthew	27	17	Therefore when they were gathered together , Pilate said unto them , “ Whom will ye that I release unto you : Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that for envy they had delivered Him .
KJ21	Matthew	27	19	When he had sat down on the judgment seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , “ Have thou nothing to do with that just man ; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus .
KJ21	Matthew	27	21	The governor answered and said unto them , “ Which of the two will ye that I release unto you ? ” They said , “ Barabbas ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	22	Pilate said unto them , “ What shall I do then with Jesus , who is called Christ ? ” They all said unto him , “ Let him be crucified ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	23	And the governor said , “ Why , what evil hath he done ? ” But they cried out the more , saying , “ Let him be crucified ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he could not prevail , but rather that a tumult was beginning , he took water and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , “ I am innocent of the blood of this just person . See ye to it. ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	25	Then answered all the people and said , “ His blood be on us , and on our children ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	26	Then released he Barabbas unto them ; and when he had scourged Jesus , he delivered Him to be crucified .
KJ21	Matthew	27	28	And they stripped Him and put on Him a scarlet robe .
KJ21	Matthew	27	29	And when they had plaited a crown of thorns , they put it upon His head and a reed in His right hand , and they bowed their knees before Him and mocked Him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	30	And they spat upon Him , and took the reed and smote Him on the head .
KJ21	Matthew	27	31	And after they had mocked Him , they took the robe off from Him and put His own raiment on Him , and led Him away to crucify Him .
KJ21	Matthew	27	32	And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name ; him they compelled to bear His cross .
KJ21	Matthew	27	33	And when they had come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a Place of a Skull ,
KJ21	Matthew	27	34	they gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with gall . And when He had tasted thereof , He would not drink .
KJ21	Matthew	27	35	And they crucified Him and parted His garments , casting lots , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet : “ They parted My garments among them , and upon My vesture did they cast lots. ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	36	And sitting down , they watched Him there ,
KJ21	Matthew	27	37	and set up over His head His accusation , written : This Is Jesus The King Of The Jews .
KJ21	Matthew	27	38	Then were there two thieves crucified with Him , one on the right hand and another on the left .
KJ21	Matthew	27	39	And those who passed by reviled Him , wagging their heads
KJ21	Matthew	27	40	and saying , “ Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days , save thyself ! If thou be the Son of God , come down from the cross ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	41	Likewise also the chief priests mocking Him , with the scribes and elders said ,
KJ21	Matthew	27	42	“ He saved others ; himself he can not save . If he be the King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
KJ21	Matthew	27	43	He trusted in God ; let Him deliver him now , if He will have him . For he said , ‘ I am the Son of God. ’ ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	44	The thieves also , who were crucified with Him , cast the same in His teeth .
KJ21	Matthew	27	45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour .
KJ21	Matthew	27	46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? ” that is to say , “ My God , My God , why hast Thou forsaken Me ? ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	47	Some of those who stood there , when they heard that , said , “ This man calleth for Elijah. ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	48	And straightway one of them ran and took a sponge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed and gave Him to drink .
KJ21	Matthew	27	49	The rest said , “ Let be ; let us see whether Elijah will come to save him. ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	50	Jesus , when He had cried out again with a loud voice , yielded up the ghost .
KJ21	Matthew	27	51	And behold , the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom , and the earth quaked and the rocks rent .
KJ21	Matthew	27	52	And the graves were opened ; and many bodies of the saints who slept arose ,
KJ21	Matthew	27	53	and came out of the graves after His resurrection , and went into the Holy City and appeared unto many .
KJ21	Matthew	27	54	Now when the centurion , and those who were with him watching Jesus , saw the earthquake and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , “ Truly , this was the Son of God ! ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	55	And many women were there beholding afar off , who followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering unto Him ,
KJ21	Matthew	27	56	among whom were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of Zebedee ’ s children .
KJ21	Matthew	27	57	When the evening had come , there came a rich man of Arimathea named Joseph , who himself also was Jesus ’ disciple .
KJ21	Matthew	27	58	He went to Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered .
KJ21	Matthew	27	59	And when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
KJ21	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock . And he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher and departed .
KJ21	Matthew	27	61	And Mary Magdalene was there , and the other Mary , sitting opposite the sepulcher .
KJ21	Matthew	27	62	Now the next day , that following the Day of the Preparation , the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate ,
KJ21	Matthew	27	63	saying , “ Sir , we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive , ‘ After three days I will rise again. ’
KJ21	Matthew	27	64	Command therefore that the sepulcher be made secure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night and steal him away , and say unto the people , ‘ He is risen from the dead , ’ so that the last error shall be worse than the first. ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said unto them , “ Ye have a watch . Go your way , make it as secure as ye can. ”
KJ21	Matthew	27	66	So they went and made the sepulcher secure , sealing the stone and setting up a watch .
KJ21	Matthew	28	28	At the end of the Sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher .
KJ21	Matthew	28	2	And behold , there was a great earthquake , for the angel of the Lord descended from Heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
KJ21	Matthew	28	3	His countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow .
KJ21	Matthew	28	4	And for fear of him the guards shook and became as dead men .
KJ21	Matthew	28	5	And the angel answered and said unto the women , “ Fear ye not , for I know that ye seek Jesus , who was crucified .
KJ21	Matthew	28	6	He is not here , for He is risen , as He said . Come , see the place where the Lord lay .
KJ21	Matthew	28	7	And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead , and behold , He goeth before you into Galilee . There shall ye see Him . Lo , I have told you. ”
KJ21	Matthew	28	8	And they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy , and ran to bring His disciples word .
KJ21	Matthew	28	9	And as they went to tell His disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , “ All hail. ” And they came , and held Him by the feet , and worshiped Him .
KJ21	Matthew	28	10	Then said Jesus unto them , “ Be not afraid . Go tell My brethren to go into Galilee , and there shall they see Me. ”
KJ21	Matthew	28	11	Now when they were going , behold , some of the guards came into the city and reported unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
KJ21	Matthew	28	12	And when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel , they gave a large sum of money unto the soldiers ,
KJ21	Matthew	28	13	saying , “ Say ye , ‘ His disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. ’
KJ21	Matthew	28	14	And if this come to the governor ’ s ears , we will persuade him and secure you. ”
KJ21	Matthew	28	15	So they took the money , and did as they were taught ; and this account is commonly reported among the Jews until this day .
KJ21	Matthew	28	16	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee onto a mountain where Jesus had appointed them .
KJ21	Matthew	28	17	And when they saw Him , they worshiped Him ; but some doubted .
KJ21	Matthew	28	18	And Jesus came and spoke unto them , saying , “ All power is given unto Me in Heaven and on earth .
KJ21	Matthew	28	19	Go ye therefore and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost ,
KJ21	Matthew	28	20	teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you . And lo , I am with you always , even unto the end of the world. ” Amen .
KJ21	Mark	1	1	The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
KJ21	Mark	1	2	As it is written in the Prophets : “ Behold , I send My messenger before Thy face , who shall prepare Thy way before Thee. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	3	“ The voice of one crying in the wilderness : ‘ Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make His paths straight. ’ ”
KJ21	Mark	1	4	John baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
KJ21	Mark	1	5	And there went out unto him all the land of Judea and those of Jerusalem ; and they were all baptized by him in the River Jordan , confessing their sins .
KJ21	Mark	1	6	And John was clothed with camel ’ s hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins , and he ate locusts and wild honey .
KJ21	Mark	1	7	And he preached , saying , “ There cometh after me One mightier than I , the strap of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose .
KJ21	Mark	1	8	I indeed have baptized you with water , but He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	9	And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
KJ21	Mark	1	10	And straightway coming up out of the water , He saw the heavens opened , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him .
KJ21	Mark	1	11	And there came a voice from Heaven , saying , “ Thou Art My Beloved Son , In Whom I Am Well Pleased. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	12	And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness .
KJ21	Mark	1	13	And He was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted by Satan , and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto Him .
KJ21	Mark	1	14	Now after John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God
KJ21	Mark	1	15	and saying , “ The time is fulfilled , and the Kingdom of God is at hand . Repent ye and believe the Gospel. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	16	Now as He walked by the Sea of Galilee , He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea , for they were fishers .
KJ21	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said unto them , “ Come ye after Me , and I will make you to become fishers of men. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	18	And straightway they forsook their nets , and followed Him .
KJ21	Mark	1	19	And when He had gone a little farther thence , He saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the boat mending their nets .
KJ21	Mark	1	20	And straightway He called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , and went after Him .
KJ21	Mark	1	21	And they went into Capernaum , and straightway on the Sabbath day He entered into the synagogue and taught .
KJ21	Mark	1	22	And they were astonished at His doctrine , for He taught them as one who had authority , and not as the scribes .
KJ21	Mark	1	23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
KJ21	Mark	1	24	saying , “ Let us alone . What have we to do with Thee , Thou Jesus of Nazareth ? Hast Thou come to destroy us ? I know Thee and who Thou art — the Holy One of God ! ”
KJ21	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Hold thy peace , and come out of him ! ”
KJ21	Mark	1	26	And when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried out with a loud voice , he came out of him .
KJ21	Mark	1	27	And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , “ What thing is this ? What new doctrine is this ? For with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits , and they obey him. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	28	And immediately His fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee .
KJ21	Mark	1	29	And forthwith when they had come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
KJ21	Mark	1	30	But Simon ’ s wife ’ s mother lay sick with a fever , and at once they told Him of her .
KJ21	Mark	1	31	And He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
KJ21	Mark	1	32	And at evening , when the sun had set , they brought unto Him all who were diseased and those who were possessed with devils .
KJ21	Mark	1	33	And all the city was gathered together at the door .
KJ21	Mark	1	34	And He healed many who were sick with divers diseases , and cast out many devils ; and He suffered not the devils to speak , because they knew Him .
KJ21	Mark	1	35	And in the morning , rising up a great while before day , He went out and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed .
KJ21	Mark	1	36	And Simon and those who were with Him followed after Him .
KJ21	Mark	1	37	And when they had found Him , they said unto Him , “ All men seek for Thee. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	38	And He said unto them , “ Let us go into the next towns , that I may preach there also ; for therefore came I forth. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	39	And He preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee , and cast out devils .
KJ21	Mark	1	40	And there came a leper to Him , beseeching Him and kneeling down to Him and saying unto Him , “ If Thou wilt , Thou canst make me clean. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	41	And Jesus , moved with compassion , put forth His hand and touched him , and said unto him , “ I will ; be thou clean. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	42	And as soon as He had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
KJ21	Mark	1	43	And He strictly charged him , and forthwith sent him away ,
KJ21	Mark	1	44	saying unto him , “ See that thou say nothing to any man ; but go thy way , show thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , as a testimony unto them. ”
KJ21	Mark	1	45	But he went out and began to proclaim it much and to blaze abroad the matter , insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city , and was outside in desert places . And they came to Him from every quarter .
KJ21	Mark	2	2	And straightway many were gathered together , insomuch that there was no room to receive them , no , not even about the door ; and He preached the Word unto them .
KJ21	Mark	2	3	And they came unto Him , bringing one sick with the palsy , who was borne by four .
KJ21	Mark	2	4	And when they could not come nigh unto Him because of the throng , they uncovered the roof where He was . And when they had broken through , they let down the bed on which the one sick with the palsy lay .
KJ21	Mark	2	5	When Jesus saw their faith , He said unto the one sick with the palsy , “ Son , thy sins are forgiven thee. ”
KJ21	Mark	2	6	But there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts ,
KJ21	Mark	2	7	“ Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins but God only ? ”
KJ21	Mark	2	8	And immediately , when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , He said unto them , “ Why reason ye these things in your hearts :
KJ21	Mark	2	9	whether it is easier to say to the sick with the palsy , ‘ Thy sins are forgiven thee , ’ or to say , ‘ Arise , and take up thy bed and walk ’ ?
KJ21	Mark	2	10	But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins— ” He said to the one sick with the palsy ,
KJ21	Mark	2	11	“ I say unto thee , arise , and take up thy bed , and go thy way into thine house. ”
KJ21	Mark	2	12	And immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all , insomuch that they all were amazed and glorified God , saying , “ We never saw it in this fashion ! ”
KJ21	Mark	2	13	And He went forth again by the seaside ; and all the multitude resorted unto Him , and He taught them .
KJ21	Mark	2	14	And as He passed by , He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the custom booth , and said unto him , “ Follow Me. ” And he arose and followed Him .
KJ21	Mark	2	15	And it came to pass , as Jesus sat at meat at Levi ’ s house , that many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and His disciples ; for there were many , and they followed Him .
KJ21	Mark	2	16	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with publicans and sinners , they said unto His disciples , “ How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners ? ”
KJ21	Mark	2	17	When Jesus heard it , He said unto them , “ They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick . I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance. ”
KJ21	Mark	2	18	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast ; and they came and said unto Him , “ Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ? ”
KJ21	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said unto them , “ Can the attendants of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast .
KJ21	Mark	2	20	But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
KJ21	Mark	2	21	“ No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment , else the new piece that filled it up teareth away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
KJ21	Mark	2	22	And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins , else the new wine doth burst the skins , and the wine is spilled and the skins will be marred . But new wine must be put into new wineskins. ”
KJ21	Mark	2	23	And it came to pass that He went through the cornfields on the Sabbath day ; and His disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn .
KJ21	Mark	2	24	And the Pharisees said unto Him , “ Behold , why do they do on the Sabbath day that which is not lawful ? ”
KJ21	Mark	2	25	And He said unto them , “ Have ye never read what David did when he was in need and hungered , he and they that were with him ?
KJ21	Mark	2	26	How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest , and ate the showbread which is not lawful to eat except for the priests , and gave it also to those who were with him ? ”
KJ21	Mark	2	27	And He said unto them , “ The Sabbath was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath .
KJ21	Mark	2	28	Therefore the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath . ”
KJ21	Mark	3	3	And He said unto the man who had the withered hand , “ Stand forth. ”
KJ21	Mark	3	2	And they watched Him to see whether He would heal him on the Sabbath day , that they might accuse Him .
KJ21	Mark	3	4	And He said unto them , “ Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days , or to do evil ? To save life , or to kill ? ” But they held their peace .
KJ21	Mark	3	5	And when He had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved by the hardness of their hearts , He said unto the man , “ Stretch forth thine hand. ” And he stretched it out , and his hand was restored whole as the other .
KJ21	Mark	3	6	And the Pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against Him , how they might destroy Him .
KJ21	Mark	3	7	But Jesus withdrew Himself with His disciples to the sea . And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him , and from Judea ,
KJ21	Mark	3	8	and from Jerusalem , and from Idumea , and from beyond the Jordan . And those from around Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things He did , came unto Him .
KJ21	Mark	3	9	And He spoke to His disciples that a small boat should await Him because of the multitude , lest they should throng Him .
KJ21	Mark	3	10	For He had healed many , insomuch that they pressed upon Him to touch Him , as many as had plagues .
KJ21	Mark	3	11	And unclean spirits , when they saw Him , fell down before Him and cried , saying , “ Thou art the Son of God ! ”
KJ21	Mark	3	12	And He strictly charged them that they should not make Him known .
KJ21	Mark	3	13	And He went up onto a mountain , and called unto Him whom He would have , and they came unto Him .
KJ21	Mark	3	14	And He ordained twelve , that they should be with Him , and that He might send them forth to preach ,
KJ21	Mark	3	15	and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils :
KJ21	Mark	3	16	Simon ( He surnamed Peter ) ;
KJ21	Mark	3	17	and James the son of Zebedee , and John the brother of James ( and He surnamed them Boanerges , which means The Sons of Thunder ) ;
KJ21	Mark	3	18	and Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Thadaeus , and Simon the Canaanite ,
KJ21	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed Him . And they went into a house ;
KJ21	Mark	3	20	and the multitude came together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
KJ21	Mark	3	21	And when His friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on Him ; for they said , “ He is beside himself. ”
KJ21	Mark	3	22	And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , “ He hath Beelzebub , and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils. ”
KJ21	Mark	3	23	And He called them unto Him , and said unto them in parables , “ How can Satan cast out Satan ?
KJ21	Mark	3	24	And if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
KJ21	Mark	3	25	And if a house be divided against itself , that house can not stand .
KJ21	Mark	3	26	And if Satan rise up against himself and be divided , he can not stand , but hath an end .
KJ21	Mark	3	27	No man can enter into a strong man ’ s house and despoil his goods , unless he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will despoil his house .
KJ21	Mark	3	28	“ Verily I say unto you , all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and blasphemies , however they shall blaspheme ;
KJ21	Mark	3	29	but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness , but is in danger of eternal damnation ” ;
KJ21	Mark	3	30	because they said , “ He hath an unclean spirit. ”
KJ21	Mark	3	31	There came then His brethren and His mother , and standing outside they sent unto Him , calling Him .
KJ21	Mark	3	32	And the multitude sat about Him , and they said unto Him , “ Behold , thy mother and thy brethren outside seek for thee. ”
KJ21	Mark	3	33	And He answered them , saying , “ Who is My mother , or My brethren ? ”
KJ21	Mark	3	34	And He looked round about on those who sat about Him and said , “ Behold , My mother and My brethren .
KJ21	Mark	3	35	For whosoever shall do the will of God , the same is My brother , and My sister , and mother . ”
KJ21	Mark	4	4	And it came to pass as he sowed , some seed fell by the wayside ; and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
KJ21	Mark	4	2	And He taught them many things by parables , and said unto them in His doctrine :
KJ21	Mark	4	3	“ Hearken ! Behold , there went out a sower to sow .
KJ21	Mark	4	5	And some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth .
KJ21	Mark	4	6	But when the sun was up , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
KJ21	Mark	4	7	And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns grew up and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
KJ21	Mark	4	8	And other fell on good ground ; and it yielded fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth : some thirty , and some sixty , and some a hundredfold. ”
KJ21	Mark	4	9	And He said unto them , “ He that hath ears to hear , let him hear. ”
KJ21	Mark	4	10	And when He was alone , those who were about Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable .
KJ21	Mark	4	11	And He said unto them , “ Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God ; but unto them that are without , all these things are done in parables ,
KJ21	Mark	4	12	that , ‘ seeing they may see , and not perceive , and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them. ’ ”
KJ21	Mark	4	13	And He said unto them , “ Know you not this parable ? And how then will ye know all parables ?
KJ21	Mark	4	14	The sower soweth the Word .
KJ21	Mark	4	15	And these are they by the wayside , where the Word is sown ; but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the Word that was sown in their hearts .
KJ21	Mark	4	16	And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who , when they have heard the Word , immediately receive it with gladness ;
KJ21	Mark	4	17	but they have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time . Afterward , when affliction or persecution ariseth for the Word ’ s sake , immediately they are offended .
KJ21	Mark	4	18	And these are they which are sown among thorns , such as hear the Word ,
KJ21	Mark	4	19	but the cares of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the Word , and it becometh unfruitful .
KJ21	Mark	4	20	And these are they which are sown on good ground , such as hear the Word and receive it and bring forth fruit : some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some a hundred. ”
KJ21	Mark	4	21	And He said unto them , “ Is a candle brought to be put under a basket or under a bed , and not to be set on a candlestick ?
KJ21	Mark	4	22	For there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested ; neither was anything kept secret , but that it should be revealed .
KJ21	Mark	4	23	If any man have ears to hear , let him hear. ”
KJ21	Mark	4	24	And He said unto them , “ Take heed what ye hear . With what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you ; and unto you that hear shall more be given .
KJ21	Mark	4	25	For he that hath , to him shall be given ; and he that hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he hath. ”
KJ21	Mark	4	26	And He said , “ So is the Kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground ,
KJ21	Mark	4	27	and should sleep , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring up and grow , he knoweth not how .
KJ21	Mark	4	28	For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself : first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear .
KJ21	Mark	4	29	But when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come. ”
KJ21	Mark	4	30	And He said , “ To what shall we liken the Kingdom of God ? Or with what comparison shall we compare it ?
KJ21	Mark	4	31	It is like a grain of mustard seed which , when it is sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds that are in the earth .
KJ21	Mark	4	32	But when it is sown , it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs , and shooteth out great branches , so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. ”
KJ21	Mark	4	33	And with many such parables He spoke the Word unto them , as they were able to hear it ;
KJ21	Mark	4	34	but without a parable spoke He not unto them . And when they were alone , He expounded all things to His disciples .
KJ21	Mark	4	35	And that same day , when the evening had come , He said unto them , “ Let us pass over unto the other side. ”
KJ21	Mark	4	36	And when they had sent away the multitude , they took Him even as He was in the boat ; and there were also with Him other little boats .
KJ21	Mark	4	37	And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the boat , so that it was now full .
KJ21	Mark	4	38	But He was in the hind part of the boat , asleep on a pillow ; and they awoke Him and said unto Him , “ Master , carest thou not that we perish ? ”
KJ21	Mark	4	39	And He arose , and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea , “ Peace , be still. ” And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
KJ21	Mark	4	40	And He said unto them , “ Why are you so fearful ? How is it that ye have no faith ? ”
KJ21	Mark	4	41	And they feared exceedingly and said one to another , “ What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? ”
KJ21	Mark	5	5	And always , night and day , he was in the mountains and in the tombs , crying out and cutting himself with stones .
KJ21	Mark	5	2	And when He had come out of the boat , immediately there met Him from out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
KJ21	Mark	5	3	who had his dwelling among the tombs . And no man could bind him , no , not even with chains ,
KJ21	Mark	5	4	because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been rent asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces ; neither could any man tame him .
KJ21	Mark	5	6	But when he saw Jesus afar off , he ran and worshiped Him ,
KJ21	Mark	5	7	and cried with a loud voice , and said , “ What have I to do with Thee , Jesus , Thou Son of the Most High God ? I adjure Thee by God that Thou torment me not ! ”
KJ21	Mark	5	8	For He had said unto him , “ Come out of the man , thou unclean spirit. ”
KJ21	Mark	5	9	And Jesus asked him , “ What is thy name ? ” And he answered , saying , “ My name is Legion , for we are many. ”
KJ21	Mark	5	10	And he besought Him much that He would not send them away out of the country .
KJ21	Mark	5	11	Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding .
KJ21	Mark	5	12	And all the devils besought Him , saying , “ Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them. ”
KJ21	Mark	5	13	And forthwith Jesus gave them leave . And the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine ; and the herd ran violently down a steep place and into the sea ( they were about two thousand ) , and were choked in the sea .
KJ21	Mark	5	14	And those who fed the swine fled , and told it in the city and in the country . And the people went out to see what it was that had been done .
KJ21	Mark	5	15	And they came to Jesus , and saw him that had been possessed by the devil and had the legion , sitting and clothed and in his right mind ; and they were afraid .
KJ21	Mark	5	16	And those who saw it told the people what had befallen him that was possessed by the devil , and also concerning the swine .
KJ21	Mark	5	17	And they began to pray Him to depart from their borders .
KJ21	Mark	5	18	And when He had gotten into the boat , he that had been possessed with the devil prayed Him that he might be with Him .
KJ21	Mark	5	19	But Jesus suffered him not , and said unto him , “ Go home to thy friends , and tell them what great things the Lord hath done for thee , and how He hath had compassion on thee. ”
KJ21	Mark	5	20	And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him . And all men marveled .
KJ21	Mark	5	21	And when Jesus had passed over again by boat unto the other side , many people gathered unto Him ; and He was nigh unto the sea .
KJ21	Mark	5	22	And behold , there came one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and when he saw Him , he fell at His feet
KJ21	Mark	5	23	and besought Him greatly , saying , “ My little daughter lieth at the point of death . I pray Thee , come and lay Thy hands on her , that she may be healed , and she shall live. ”
KJ21	Mark	5	24	And Jesus went with him , and many people followed Him and thronged Him .
KJ21	Mark	5	25	And a certain woman who had an issue of blood twelve years ,
KJ21	Mark	5	26	and had suffered many things under many physicians , and had spent all that she had and was no better , but rather grew worse ,
KJ21	Mark	5	27	when she had heard of Jesus , came up behind Him in the press of the crowd and touched His garment ;
KJ21	Mark	5	28	for she said , “ If I may touch but His clothes , I shall be whole. ”
KJ21	Mark	5	29	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up , and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
KJ21	Mark	5	30	And Jesus , immediately knowing in Himself that virtue had gone out of Him , turned about in the press of the crowd and said , “ Who touched My clothes ? ”
KJ21	Mark	5	31	And His disciples said unto Him , “ Thou seest the multitude thronging Thee , and sayest Thou , ‘ Who touched Me ? ’ ”
KJ21	Mark	5	32	And He looked round about to see her who had done this thing .
KJ21	Mark	5	33	But the woman , fearing and trembling , knowing what had been done in her , came and fell down before Him and told Him all the truth .
KJ21	Mark	5	34	And He said unto her , “ Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole . Go in peace , and be whole of thy plague. ”
KJ21	Mark	5	35	While He yet spoke , there came from the ruler of the synagogue ’ s house certain ones who said , “ Thy daughter is dead ; why troublest thou the master any further ? ”
KJ21	Mark	5	36	As soon as Jesus heard the word that had been spoken , He said unto the ruler of the synagogue , “ Be not afraid ; only believe. ”
KJ21	Mark	5	37	And He suffered no man to follow Him , save Peter and James and John , the brother of James .
KJ21	Mark	5	38	And He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and saw the tumult and those who wept and wailed greatly .
KJ21	Mark	5	39	And when He had come in , He said unto them , “ Why make ye this ado and weep ? The damsel is not dead , but sleepeth. ”
KJ21	Mark	5	40	And they laughed Him to scorn . But when He had put them all out , He took the father and the mother of the damsel and those who were with Him , and entered in where the damsel was lying .
KJ21	Mark	5	41	And He took the damsel by the hand and said unto her , “ Talitha cumi , ” which is , being interpreted , “ Damsel , I say unto thee , arise. ”
KJ21	Mark	5	42	And straightway the damsel arose and walked , for she was of the age of twelve years . And they were astonished with a great astonishment .
KJ21	Mark	5	43	And He charged them strictly that no man should know about it , and commanded that something should be given her to eat .
KJ21	Mark	6	6	And He marveled because of their unbelief . And He went round about the villages teaching .
KJ21	Mark	6	2	And when the Sabbath day had come , He began to teach in the synagogue . And many hearing Him were astonished , saying , “ From whence hath this man these things ? And what wisdom is this which is given unto him , that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands ?
KJ21	Mark	6	3	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , the brother of James and Joses , and of Judas and Simon ? And are not his sisters here with us ? ” And they were offended at Him .
KJ21	Mark	6	4	But Jesus said unto them , “ A prophet is not without honor , save in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	5	And He could do no mighty works there , except that He laid His hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
KJ21	Mark	6	7	And He called unto Him the twelve , and began to send them forth two by two , and gave them power over unclean spirits ,
KJ21	Mark	6	8	and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only — no wallet , no bread , and no money in their purse ,
KJ21	Mark	6	9	but be shod with sandals , and not put on two coats .
KJ21	Mark	6	10	And He said unto them , “ In whatever place ye enter into a house , there abide until ye depart from that place .
KJ21	Mark	6	11	And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you , when ye depart thence , shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them . Verily I say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for that city. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	12	And they went out and preached that men should repent .
KJ21	Mark	6	13	And they cast out many devils , and anointed with oil many who were sick , and healed them .
KJ21	Mark	6	14	And King Herod heard of Him , for His name was spread abroad . And he said , “ John the Baptist has risen from the dead , and therefore these mighty works show forth themselves in him. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	15	Others said , “ It is Elijah , ” and others said , “ It is a prophet , or like one of the prophets. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard of it , he said , “ It is John , whom I beheaded ; he is risen from the dead. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and had bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife ; for he had married her .
KJ21	Mark	6	18	For John had said unto Herod , “ It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother ’ s wife. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	19	Therefore Herodias had an inward grudge against him and would have killed him , but she could not ;
KJ21	Mark	6	20	for Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man and holy , and kept him safe . And when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
KJ21	Mark	6	21	And when a convenient day had come , when Herod on his birthday gave a supper for his lords , high officers , and chief officials of Galilee ,
KJ21	Mark	6	22	and when the daughter of the said Herodias came in and danced , and pleased Herod and those who sat with him , the king said unto the damsel , “ Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give it to thee. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	23	And he swore unto her , “ Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it to thee , unto the half of my kingdom. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	24	And she went forth and said unto her mother , “ What shall I ask ? ” And Herodias said , “ The head of John the Baptist. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	25	And she came back straightway with haste unto the king and asked , saying , “ I will that thou give me at once on a charger the head of John the Baptist. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	26	And the king was exceedingly sorry , yet for his oath ’ s sake and for their sakes who sat with him , he would not reject her .
KJ21	Mark	6	27	And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded John ’ s head to be brought . And he went and beheaded him in prison ,
KJ21	Mark	6	28	and brought his head on a charger and gave it to the damsel ; and the damsel gave it to her mother .
KJ21	Mark	6	29	And when John ’ s disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb .
KJ21	Mark	6	30	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus and told Him all things , both what they had done and what they had taught .
KJ21	Mark	6	31	And He said unto them , “ Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while. ” For there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure , even so much as to eat .
KJ21	Mark	6	32	And they departed into a desert place by boat privately .
KJ21	Mark	6	33	And the people saw them departing , and many recognized Him and ran thither on foot out of all the cities and outdistanced them , and came together unto Him .
KJ21	Mark	6	34	And Jesus , when He came out , saw many people and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd ; and He began to teach them many things .
KJ21	Mark	6	35	And when the day was now far spent , His disciples came unto Him and said , “ This is a desert place , and now the day is far spent .
KJ21	Mark	6	36	Send them away , that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread , for they have nothing to eat. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	37	He answered and said unto them , “ Give ye them to eat. ” And they said to Him , “ Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat ? ”
KJ21	Mark	6	38	He said unto them , “ How many loaves have ye ? Go and see. ” And when they knew , they said , “ Five , and two fishes. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	39	And He commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass .
KJ21	Mark	6	40	And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds and by fifties .
KJ21	Mark	6	41	And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , He looked up to Heaven , and blessed and broke the loaves , and gave them to His disciples to set before them ; and He divided the two fishes among them all .
KJ21	Mark	6	42	And they all ate and were filled .
KJ21	Mark	6	43	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes .
KJ21	Mark	6	44	And those who ate of the loaves were about five thousand men .
KJ21	Mark	6	45	And straightway He constrained His disciples to get into the boat , and go to the other side before Him unto Bethsaida , while He sent away the people .
KJ21	Mark	6	46	And when He had sent them away , He departed onto a mountain to pray .
KJ21	Mark	6	47	And when evening had come , the boat was in the midst of the sea ; and He was alone on the land .
KJ21	Mark	6	48	And He saw them toiling in rowing , for the wind was contrary unto them . And about the fourth watch of the night , He came unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
KJ21	Mark	6	49	But when they saw Him walking upon the sea , they supposed it was a spirit and cried out ,
KJ21	Mark	6	50	for they all saw Him and were troubled . And immediately He talked with them , and said unto them , “ Be of good cheer ! It is I ; be not afraid. ”
KJ21	Mark	6	51	And He went up unto them and into the boat , and the wind ceased . And they were sore amazed within themselves beyond measure and wondered ,
KJ21	Mark	6	52	for they had considered not the miracle of the loaves , as their hearts were hardened .
KJ21	Mark	6	53	And when they had crossed over , they came into the land of Gennesaret , and drew to the shore .
KJ21	Mark	6	54	And when they had come out of the boat , straightway the people recognized Him ,
KJ21	Mark	6	55	and ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry on beds those who were sick to where they heard He was .
KJ21	Mark	6	56	And whithersoever He entered , into villages or cities or the country , they laid the sick in the streets , and besought Him that they might touch even the border of His garment . And as many as touched Him were made whole .
KJ21	Mark	7	7	Therefore , in vain do they worship Me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. ’
KJ21	Mark	7	2	And when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled ( that is to say , unwashed ) hands , they found fault .
KJ21	Mark	7	3	For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat , unless they wash their hands oft , holding to the tradition of the elders .
KJ21	Mark	7	4	And when they come from the market , they eat not unless they wash ; and there are many other customs which they have received and hold to , as the washing of cups , pots , brazen vessels and of tables .
KJ21	Mark	7	5	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him , “ Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashed hands ? ”
KJ21	Mark	7	6	He answered and said unto them , “ Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites , as it is written : ‘ This people honoreth Me with their lips , but their heart is far from Me .
KJ21	Mark	7	8	For laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold to the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups , and many other like things ye do. ”
KJ21	Mark	7	9	And He said unto them , “ Full well ye reject the commandment of God , that ye may keep your own tradition .
KJ21	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , ‘ Honor thy father and thy mother , ’ and , ‘ Whoso curseth father or mother , let him die the death. ’
KJ21	Mark	7	11	But ye say that if a man shall say to his father or mother , ‘ It is Corban ’ ( that is to say , a gift of whatsoever thou mightest have profited from me ) , he shall be freed ;
KJ21	Mark	7	12	and ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother ,
KJ21	Mark	7	13	thus making the Word of God of no effect through your tradition , which ye have delivered . And many like things do ye. ”
KJ21	Mark	7	14	And when He had called all the people unto Him , He said unto them , “ Hearken unto Me every one of you , and understand :
KJ21	Mark	7	15	There is nothing from outside a man that , entering into him , can defile him ; but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
KJ21	Mark	7	16	If any man have ears to hear , let him hear. ”
KJ21	Mark	7	17	And when He had entered into the house away from the people , His disciples asked Him concerning the parable .
KJ21	Mark	7	18	And He said unto them , “ Are ye so without understanding also ? Do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from outside entereth into a man , it can not defile him ,
KJ21	Mark	7	19	because it entereth not into his heart , but into the belly and goeth out into the drain , thereby purging all meats ? ”
KJ21	Mark	7	20	And He said , “ That which cometh out of the man , that defileth the man .
KJ21	Mark	7	21	For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
KJ21	Mark	7	22	thefts , covetousness , wickedness , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness :
KJ21	Mark	7	23	all these evil things come from within and defile the man. ”
KJ21	Mark	7	24	And from thence He arose and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into a house , and would have no man know about it ; but He could not be hid .
KJ21	Mark	7	25	For a certain woman , whose young daughter had an unclean spirit , heard of Him , and came and fell at His feet .
KJ21	Mark	7	26	The woman was a Greek , a Syrophoenician by nation , and she besought Him that He would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
KJ21	Mark	7	27	But Jesus said unto her , “ Let the children first be filled , for it is not meet to take the children ’ s bread and to cast it unto the dogs. ”
KJ21	Mark	7	28	And she answered and said unto Him , “ Yes , Lord , yet the dogs under the table eat of the children ’ s crumbs. ”
KJ21	Mark	7	29	And He said unto her , “ For this saying go thy way ; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. ”
KJ21	Mark	7	30	And when she had come to her house , she found the devil gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
KJ21	Mark	7	31	And again , departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon , He came unto the Sea of Galilee through the midst of the region of Decapolis .
KJ21	Mark	7	32	And they brought unto Him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech , and they besought Him to put His hand upon him .
KJ21	Mark	7	33	And He took him aside from the multitude and put His fingers into his ears , and He spat and touched his tongue .
KJ21	Mark	7	34	And looking up to Heaven , He sighed and said unto him , “ Ephphatha , ” that is , “ Be opened. ”
KJ21	Mark	7	35	And straightway his ears were opened , and the bond of his tongue was loosed and he spoke plainly .
KJ21	Mark	7	36	And He charged them that they should tell no man . But the more He charged them , the more widely they proclaimed it
KJ21	Mark	7	37	and were astonished beyond measure , saying , “ He hath done all things well ; he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak . ”
KJ21	Mark	8	8	So they ate and were filled ; and they took up of the broken meat that was left , seven baskets .
KJ21	Mark	8	2	“ I have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with Me three days and have nothing to eat .
KJ21	Mark	8	3	And if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way ; for divers of them came from afar. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	4	And His disciples answered Him , “ From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness ? ”
KJ21	Mark	8	5	And He asked them , “ How many loaves have ye ? ” And they said , “ Seven. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	6	And He commanded the people to sit down on the ground . And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks and broke , and gave to His disciples to set before them ; and they set them before the people .
KJ21	Mark	8	7	And they had a few small fishes , and He blessed them and commanded to set them also before them .
KJ21	Mark	8	9	And those who had eaten were about four thousand . And He sent them away .
KJ21	Mark	8	10	And straightway He entered into a boat with His disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha .
KJ21	Mark	8	11	And the Pharisees came forth and began to question with Him , seeking from Him a sign from Heaven , testing Him .
KJ21	Mark	8	12	And He sighed deeply in His spirit and said , “ Why doth this generation seek after a sign ? Verily I say unto you , there shall no sign be given unto this generation. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	13	And He left them and , entering into the boat again , departed to the other side .
KJ21	Mark	8	14	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the boat with them more than one loaf .
KJ21	Mark	8	15	And He charged them , saying , “ Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	16	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ It is because we have no bread. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	17	And when Jesus knew it , He said unto them , “ Why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? Do ye not yet perceive , nor understand ? Have ye your heart yet hardened ?
KJ21	Mark	8	18	Having eyes , see ye not ? And having ears , hear ye not ? And do ye not remember ?
KJ21	Mark	8	19	When I broke the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? ” They said unto Him , “ Twelve. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	20	“ And when the seven among four thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? ” And they said , “ Seven. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	21	And He said unto them , “ How is it that ye do not understand ? ”
KJ21	Mark	8	22	And He came to Bethsaida , and they brought a blind man unto Him , and besought Him to touch him .
KJ21	Mark	8	23	And He took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town . And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands upon him , He asked him if he saw anything .
KJ21	Mark	8	24	And he looked up and said , “ I see men as trees , walking. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	25	After that He put His hands again upon his eyes and made him look up ; and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
KJ21	Mark	8	26	And He sent him away to his house , saying , “ Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	27	And Jesus went out with His disciples into the towns of Caesarea Philippi ; and on the way He asked His disciples , saying unto them , “ Who do men say that I am ? ”
KJ21	Mark	8	28	And they answered , “ John the Baptist ; but some say Elijah , and others , one of the prophets. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	29	And He said unto them , “ But whom say ye that I am ? ” And Peter answered and said unto Him , “ Thou art the Christ. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	30	And He charged them that they should tell no man of Him .
KJ21	Mark	8	31	And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders and by the chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
KJ21	Mark	8	32	And He spoke that saying openly . And Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him .
KJ21	Mark	8	33	But when He had turned about and looked on His disciples , He rebuked Peter , saying , “ Get thee behind Me , Satan ; for thou savorest not the things that are of God , but the things that are of men. ”
KJ21	Mark	8	34	And when He had called the people unto Him with His disciples also , He said unto them , “ Whosoever will come after Me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow Me .
KJ21	Mark	8	35	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for My sake and the Gospel ’ s , the same shall save it .
KJ21	Mark	8	36	For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
KJ21	Mark	8	37	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
KJ21	Mark	8	38	Whosoever , therefore , shall be ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation , of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He cometh in the glory of His Father with the holy angels . ”
KJ21	Mark	9	9	And as they came down from the mountain , He charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of Man were risen from the dead .
KJ21	Mark	9	2	And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John , and led them up onto a high mountain apart by themselves ; and He was transfigured before them .
KJ21	Mark	9	3	And His raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow , such as no fuller on earth could whiten them .
KJ21	Mark	9	4	And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses , and they were talking with Jesus .
KJ21	Mark	9	5	And Peter spoke and said to Jesus , “ Master , it is good for us to be here . Let us make three tabernacles : one for Thee , one for Moses , and one for Elijah— ”
KJ21	Mark	9	6	for he knew not what to say , for they were sore afraid .
KJ21	Mark	9	7	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them ; and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , “ This Is My Beloved Son : Hear Him ! ”
KJ21	Mark	9	8	And suddenly when they had looked round about , they saw no man anymore , save Jesus only with them .
KJ21	Mark	9	10	And they kept that saying to themselves , questioning one another what “ rising from the dead ” should mean .
KJ21	Mark	9	11	And they asked Him , saying , “ Why say the scribes that first Elijah must come ? ”
KJ21	Mark	9	12	And He answered and told them , “ Elijah verily cometh first and restoreth all things , and how it is written of the Son of Man that He must suffer many things and be set at nought .
KJ21	Mark	9	13	But I say unto you that Elijah has indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they pleased , as it is written of him. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	14	And when He came to His disciples , He saw a great multitude about them and the scribes questioning with them .
KJ21	Mark	9	15	And straightway all the people , when they beheld Him , were greatly amazed ; and running to Him , they greeted Him .
KJ21	Mark	9	16	And He asked the scribes , “ What question ye with them ? ”
KJ21	Mark	9	17	And one of the multitude answered and said , “ Master , I have brought unto thee my son , who hath a dumb spirit .
KJ21	Mark	9	18	And wheresoever he taketh him , he teareth him ; and he foameth and gnasheth his teeth and pineth away . And I spoke to thy disciples that they should cast him out , and they could not. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	19	Jesus answered him and said , “ O faithless generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I suffer you ? Bring him unto Me. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	20	And they brought the boy unto Him . And when the spirit saw Him , straightway he tore the boy ; and he fell on the ground and wallowed about foaming .
KJ21	Mark	9	21	And He asked his father , “ How long is it ago since this came unto him ? ” And he said , “ From childhood .
KJ21	Mark	9	22	And oftentimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him ; but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us and help us. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	23	Jesus said unto him , “ If thou canst believe , all things are possible to him that believeth. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	24	And straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears , “ Lord , I believe ; help Thou mine unbelief ! ”
KJ21	Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that the people came running together , He rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , “ Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him and enter no more into him. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	26	And the spirit cried , and rent the boy sorely and came out of him ; and he was as one dead , insomuch that many said , “ He is dead. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up , and he arose .
KJ21	Mark	9	28	And when He had come into the house , His disciples asked Him privately , “ Why could not we cast him out ? ”
KJ21	Mark	9	29	And He said unto them , “ This kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	30	And they departed thence and passed through Galilee , and He would not that any man should know it .
KJ21	Mark	9	31	For He taught His disciples and said unto them , “ The Son of Man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill Him ; and after He is killed , He shall rise the third day. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	32	But they understood not that saying , and were afraid to ask Him .
KJ21	Mark	9	33	And He came to Capernaum ; and being in the house , He asked them , “ What was it that ye disputed among yourselves on the way ? ”
KJ21	Mark	9	34	But they held their peace , for on the way they had disputed among themselves as to who should be the greatest .
KJ21	Mark	9	35	And He sat down , and called the twelve and said unto them , “ If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all and servant of all. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	36	And He took a child and set him in the midst of them . And when He had taken him in His arms , He said unto them ,
KJ21	Mark	9	37	“ Whosoever shall receive one of such children in My name , receiveth Me ; and whosoever shall receive Me , receiveth not Me , but Him that sent Me. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	38	And John answered Him , saying , “ Master , we saw one casting out devils in Thy name , but he followeth us not , so we forbad him because he followeth not us. ”
KJ21	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , “ Forbid him not , for there is no man who shall do a miracle in My name that can lightly speak evil of Me .
KJ21	Mark	9	40	For he that is not against us is on our side .
KJ21	Mark	9	41	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in My name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
KJ21	Mark	9	42	And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe in Me to fall , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea .
KJ21	Mark	9	43	And if thy hand cause thee to fall , cut it off . It is better for thee to enter into life maimed than , having two hands , to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched ,
KJ21	Mark	9	44	where ‘ their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched. ’
KJ21	Mark	9	45	And if thy foot cause thee to fall , cut it off . It is better for thee to enter halt into life than , having two feet , to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched ,
KJ21	Mark	9	46	where ‘ their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched. ’
KJ21	Mark	9	47	And if thine eye cause thee to fall , pluck it out . It is better for thee to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye than , having two eyes , to be cast into hell fire ,
KJ21	Mark	9	48	where ‘ their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched. ’
KJ21	Mark	9	49	For every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
KJ21	Mark	9	50	Salt is good , but if the salt has lost his saltness , with what will ye season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and have peace one with another . ”
KJ21	Mark	10	10	And in the house His disciples asked Him again about the same matter .
KJ21	Mark	10	2	And the Pharisees came to Him and asked Him , “ Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? ” — testing Him .
KJ21	Mark	10	3	And He answered and said unto them , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
KJ21	Mark	10	4	And they said , “ Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	5	And Jesus answered and said unto them , “ Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept .
KJ21	Mark	10	6	But from the beginning of the creation , ’ God made them male and female .
KJ21	Mark	10	7	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ,
KJ21	Mark	10	8	and the two shall be one flesh. ’ So then they are no more two , but one flesh .
KJ21	Mark	10	9	What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	11	And He said unto them , “ Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another , committeth adultery against her .
KJ21	Mark	10	12	And if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another , she committeth adultery. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	13	And they brought young children to Him , that He should touch them ; and His disciples rebuked those who brought them .
KJ21	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw it , He was much displeased and said unto them , “ Suffer the little children to come unto Me , and forbid them not , for of such is the Kingdom of God .
KJ21	Mark	10	15	Verily I say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child , he shall not enter therein. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	16	And He took them up in His arms , put His hands upon them , and blessed them .
KJ21	Mark	10	17	And when He had gone forth onto the road , there came one running , and knelt before Him and asked Him , “ Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? ”
KJ21	Mark	10	18	And Jesus said unto him , “ Why callest thou Me good ? There is none good but One , that is , God .
KJ21	Mark	10	19	Thou knowest the commandments : ‘ Do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , do not bear false witness , defraud not , honor thy father and mother. ’ ”
KJ21	Mark	10	20	And he answered and said unto Him , “ Master , all these have I observed from my youth. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	21	Then Jesus , beholding him , loved him and said unto him , “ One thing thou lackest : Go thy way , sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven ; and come , take up the cross , and follow Me. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	22	And he was sad at that saying and went away grieved , for he had great possessions .
KJ21	Mark	10	23	And Jesus looked round about and said unto His disciples , “ How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God ! ”
KJ21	Mark	10	24	And the disciples were astonished at His words , but Jesus answered again and said unto them , “ Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God !
KJ21	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	26	And they were astonished beyond measure , saying among themselves , “ Who then can be saved ? ”
KJ21	Mark	10	27	And Jesus , looking upon them , said , “ With men it is impossible , but not with God ; for with God all things are possible. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	28	Then Peter began to say unto Him , “ Lo , we have left all and have followed Thee. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	29	And Jesus answered and said , “ Verily I say unto you , there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for My sake and the Gospel ’ s ,
KJ21	Mark	10	30	but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time , houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands , with persecutions , and in the world to come , eternal life .
KJ21	Mark	10	31	But many that are first shall be last , and the last first. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	32	And they were on the way going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus went before them ; and they were amazed , and as they followed , they were afraid . And He took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things would happen unto Him ,
KJ21	Mark	10	33	saying , “ Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes ; and they shall condemn Him to death , and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles .
KJ21	Mark	10	34	And they shall mock Him and shall scourge Him , and shall spit upon Him and shall kill Him . And the third day He shall rise again. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	35	And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came unto Him , saying , “ Master , we would that Thou should do for us whatsoever we shall desire. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	36	And He said unto them , “ What would ye that I should do for you ? ”
KJ21	Mark	10	37	They said unto Him , “ Grant unto us that we may sit , one on Thy right hand and the other on Thy left hand , in Thy glory. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said unto them , “ Ye know not what ye ask . Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? ”
KJ21	Mark	10	39	And they said unto Him , “ We can. ” And Jesus said unto them , “ Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized with , also shall ye be baptized .
KJ21	Mark	10	40	But to sit on My right hand and on My left hand is not Mine to give , but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	41	And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
KJ21	Mark	10	42	But Jesus called them to Him and said unto them , “ Ye know that they that are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them , and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
KJ21	Mark	10	43	But so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister ,
KJ21	Mark	10	44	and whosoever of you would be the chiefest shall be servant of all .
KJ21	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister and to give His life as a ransom for many. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	46	And they came to Jericho . And as He went out of Jericho with His disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the wayside begging .
KJ21	Mark	10	47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out and say , “ Jesus , Thou Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
KJ21	Mark	10	48	And many charged him that he should hold his peace ; but he cried out all the more , “ Thou Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
KJ21	Mark	10	49	And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . And they called the blind man , saying unto him , “ Be of good comfort ; rise ; He calleth thee. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	50	And he , casting away his garment , rose and came to Jesus .
KJ21	Mark	10	51	And Jesus answered and said unto him , “ What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? ” The blind man said unto Him , “ Lord , that I might receive my sight. ”
KJ21	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said unto him , “ Go thy way . Thy faith hath made thee whole. ” And immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
KJ21	Mark	11	11	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple . And when He had looked round about upon all things , as now the eventide had come , He went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
KJ21	Mark	11	2	and said unto them , “ Go your way into the village opposite you , and as soon as ye have entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon man never sat . Loose him and bring him .
KJ21	Mark	11	3	And if any man say unto you , ‘ Why do ye this ? ’ say ye that the Lord hath need of him , and straightway he will send him hither. ”
KJ21	Mark	11	4	And they went their way and found the colt tied outside by the door at a place where two ways met , and they loosed him .
KJ21	Mark	11	5	And certain of those who stood there said unto them , “ What do ye , loosing the colt ? ”
KJ21	Mark	11	6	And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded , and they let them go .
KJ21	Mark	11	7	And they brought the colt to Jesus and cast their garments on him , and He sat upon him .
KJ21	Mark	11	8	And many spread their garments upon the way , and others cut down branches off the trees and strewed them upon the way .
KJ21	Mark	11	9	And those who went before , and those who followed , cried , saying , “ Hosanna ! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord !
KJ21	Mark	11	10	Blessed be the kingdom of our father David , that cometh in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! ”
KJ21	Mark	11	12	And on the morrow , when they had come from Bethany , He was hungry ;
KJ21	Mark	11	13	and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , He went to see if perhaps He might find any thing thereon . But when He came to it He found nothing but leaves , for the time for figs was not yet .
KJ21	Mark	11	14	And Jesus spoke and said unto it , “ Let no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. ” And His disciples heard it .
KJ21	Mark	11	15	And they came to Jerusalem . And Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold doves .
KJ21	Mark	11	16	And He would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
KJ21	Mark	11	17	And He taught , saying unto them , “ Is it not written , ‘ My house shall be called for all nations the house of prayer ’ ? But ye have made it a den of thieves. ”
KJ21	Mark	11	18	And the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy Him ; for they feared Him , because all the people were astonished at His doctrine .
KJ21	Mark	11	19	And when evening had come , He went out of the city .
KJ21	Mark	11	20	And in the morning as they passed by , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
KJ21	Mark	11	21	And Peter , calling to remembrance , said unto Him , “ Master , behold , the fig tree which Thou cursed is withered away. ”
KJ21	Mark	11	22	And Jesus answering , said unto them , “ Have faith in God .
KJ21	Mark	11	23	For verily I say unto you , that whosoever shall say unto this mountain , ‘ Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea , ’ and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass , he shall have whatsoever he saith .
KJ21	Mark	11	24	Therefore I say unto you , what things so ever ye desire when ye pray , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
KJ21	Mark	11	25	And when ye stand praying , forgive if ye have aught against any , that your Father also who is in Heaven may forgive you your trespasses .
KJ21	Mark	11	26	But if ye do not forgive , neither will your Father who is in Heaven forgive your trespasses. ”
KJ21	Mark	11	27	And they came again to Jerusalem . And as He was walking in the temple , there came to Him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders ,
KJ21	Mark	11	28	and said unto Him , “ By what authority doest thou these things ? And who gave thee this authority to do these things ? ”
KJ21	Mark	11	29	And Jesus answered and said unto them , “ I will also ask of you one question ; answer Me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
KJ21	Mark	11	30	The baptism of John : was it from Heaven , or of men ? Answer Me. ”
KJ21	Mark	11	31	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we shall say ‘ From Heaven , ’ he will say ‘ Why then did ye not believe him ? ’
KJ21	Mark	11	32	But if we shall say ‘ Of men ’ ” — they feared the people , for all men counted John that he was a prophet indeed .
KJ21	Mark	11	33	And they answered and said unto Jesus , “ We can not tell. ” And Jesus answering , said unto them , “ Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
KJ21	Mark	12	12	And they sought to lay hold on Him , but they feared the people , for they knew that He had spoken the parable against them . And they left Him , and went their way .
KJ21	Mark	12	2	And at the harvest season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
KJ21	Mark	12	3	And they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
KJ21	Mark	12	4	And again he sent unto them another servant , and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
KJ21	Mark	12	5	And again he sent another , and him they killed , and many others , beating some and killing some .
KJ21	Mark	12	6	Having yet therefore one son , his wellbeloved , he sent him also last unto them , saying , ‘ They will reverence my son. ’
KJ21	Mark	12	7	But those husbandmen said among themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours. ’
KJ21	Mark	12	8	And they took him and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
KJ21	Mark	12	9	What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
KJ21	Mark	12	10	And have ye not read this Scripture ? ‘ The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner ;
KJ21	Mark	12	11	this was the Lord ’ s doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes. ’ ”
KJ21	Mark	12	13	And they sent unto Him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to catch Him in His words .
KJ21	Mark	12	14	And when they had come , they said unto Him , “ Master , we know that thou art true and carest for no man ; for thou regardest not the person of men , but teachest the way of God in truth . Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar , or not ?
KJ21	Mark	12	15	Shall we give , or shall we not give ? ” But He , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , “ Why tempt ye Me ? Bring Me a penny , that I may see it. ”
KJ21	Mark	12	16	And they brought it , and He said unto them , “ Whose image and superscription is this ? ” And they said unto Him , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
KJ21	Mark	12	17	And Jesus answering , said unto them , “ Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and to God the things that are God ’ s. ” And they marveled at Him .
KJ21	Mark	12	18	Then came unto Him the Sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection . And they asked Him , saying ,
KJ21	Mark	12	19	“ Master , Moses wrote unto us that if a man ’ s brother die , and leave his wife behind him , and leave no children , then his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother .
KJ21	Mark	12	20	Now there were seven brethren ; and the first took a wife , and dying , left no seed .
KJ21	Mark	12	21	And the second took her and died , neither leaving any seed . And the third likewise .
KJ21	Mark	12	22	So the seven had her and left no seed . Last of all the woman died also .
KJ21	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be , for all seven had her for a wife ? ”
KJ21	Mark	12	24	And Jesus answering , said unto them , “ Do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the Scriptures , neither the power of God ?
KJ21	Mark	12	25	For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels who are in Heaven .
KJ21	Mark	12	26	And concerning the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spoke unto him , saying , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ?
KJ21	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living . Ye therefore do greatly err. ”
KJ21	Mark	12	28	And one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that He had answered them well , asked Him , “ Which is the first commandment of all ? ”
KJ21	Mark	12	29	And Jesus answered him , “ The first of all the commandments is : ‘ Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God is one Lord .
KJ21	Mark	12	30	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength ; ’ this is the first commandment .
KJ21	Mark	12	31	And the second is like , namely this : ‘ Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. ’ There is no other commandment greater than these. ”
KJ21	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said unto Him , “ Well , Master , thou hast said the truth , for there is one God , and there is none other than He .
KJ21	Mark	12	33	And to love Him with all the heart , with all the understanding , with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. ”
KJ21	Mark	12	34	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , He said unto him , “ Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God. ” And no man after that dared ask Him any question .
KJ21	Mark	12	35	And Jesus answered and said , while He taught in the temple , “ How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David ?
KJ21	Mark	12	36	For David himself said by the Holy Ghost : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit Thou at My right hand until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. ” ’
KJ21	Mark	12	37	David therefore himself calleth Him ‘ Lord ’ ; and whence is He then his son ? ” And the common people heard Him gladly .
KJ21	Mark	12	38	And He said unto them in His doctrine , “ Beware of the scribes , who love to go in long clothing , and love salutations in the marketplaces ,
KJ21	Mark	12	39	and the chief seats in the synagogues , and the uppermost rooms at feasts ,
KJ21	Mark	12	40	who devour widows ’ houses , and for a pretense make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation. ”
KJ21	Mark	12	41	And Jesus sat opposite the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury . And many who were rich cast in much .
KJ21	Mark	12	42	And there came a certain poor widow , and she threw in two mites , which make a farthing .
KJ21	Mark	12	43	And He called unto Him His disciples and said unto them , “ Verily I say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they that have cast into the treasury ;
KJ21	Mark	12	44	for they all cast in of their abundance , but she of her want cast in all that she had , even all her living . ”
KJ21	Mark	13	13	And ye shall be hated by all men for My name ’ s sake ; but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
KJ21	Mark	13	2	And Jesus answering , said unto him , “ Seest thou these great buildings ? There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. ”
KJ21	Mark	13	3	And as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately ,
KJ21	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , when shall these things be ? And what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ? ”
KJ21	Mark	13	5	And Jesus answering them , began to say , “ Take heed lest any man deceive you .
KJ21	Mark	13	6	For many shall come in My name , saying , ‘ I am Christ ! ’ and shall deceive many .
KJ21	Mark	13	7	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars , be ye not troubled , for such things must come to pass ; but the end shall not be yet .
KJ21	Mark	13	8	For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles . These are the beginnings of sorrows .
KJ21	Mark	13	9	“ But take heed for yourselves , for they shall deliver you up to councils , and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten . And ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for My sake , for a testimony against them .
KJ21	Mark	13	10	And the Gospel must first be proclaimed among all nations .
KJ21	Mark	13	11	But when then shall lead you and deliver you up , take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak ; neither need ye premeditate . But whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye ; for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy Ghost .
KJ21	Mark	13	12	Now the brother shall betray the brother to death , and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents and shall cause them to be put to death .
KJ21	Mark	13	14	“ But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not be ” ( let him that readeth understand ) , “ then let them that be in Judea flee to the mountains .
KJ21	Mark	13	15	And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house .
KJ21	Mark	13	16	And let him that is in the field not turn back again to take up his garment .
KJ21	Mark	13	17	But woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days !
KJ21	Mark	13	18	And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter .
KJ21	Mark	13	19	For in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created until this time , neither shall be .
KJ21	Mark	13	20	And except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved ; but for the elect ’ s sake , whom He hath chosen , He hath shortened the days .
KJ21	Mark	13	21	And then if any man shall say to you , ‘ Lo , here is Christ ! ’ or , ‘ Lo , He is there ! ’ believe him not ;
KJ21	Mark	13	22	for false christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall show signs and wonders to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
KJ21	Mark	13	23	But take ye heed ; behold , I have foretold you all things .
KJ21	Mark	13	24	“ But in those days , after that tribulation , ‘ the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
KJ21	Mark	13	25	and the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. ’
KJ21	Mark	13	26	And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
KJ21	Mark	13	27	And then shall He send His angels and shall gather together His elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
KJ21	Mark	13	28	“ Now learn a parable of the fig tree : When her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near .
KJ21	Mark	13	29	So ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
KJ21	Mark	13	30	Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done .
KJ21	Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth shall pass away , but My words shall not pass away .
KJ21	Mark	13	32	But of that day and that hour knoweth no man — no , not the angels who are in Heaven , neither the Son , but only the Father .
KJ21	Mark	13	33	“ Take ye heed , watch and pray ; for ye know not when the time is .
KJ21	Mark	13	34	For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the doorkeeper to watch .
KJ21	Mark	13	35	Watch ye therefore , for ye know not when the Master of the house cometh — at evening , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning —
KJ21	Mark	13	36	lest coming suddenly , He find you sleeping .
KJ21	Mark	13	37	And what I say unto you , I say unto all : Watch ! ”
KJ21	Mark	14	14	And wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the master of the house , ‘ The Master saith , “ Where is the guestchamber where I shall eat the Passover with My disciples ? ” ’
KJ21	Mark	14	2	But they said , “ Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar of the people. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	3	And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as He sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard , very precious ; and she broke the box and poured it on His head .
KJ21	Mark	14	4	And there were some who were indignant within themselves and said , “ Why was this ointment wasted ?
KJ21	Mark	14	5	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor. ” And they murmured against her .
KJ21	Mark	14	6	And Jesus said , “ Let her alone . Why trouble ye her ? She hath wrought a good work on Me .
KJ21	Mark	14	7	For ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will , ye may do them good ; but Me ye have not always .
KJ21	Mark	14	8	She hath done what she could ; she hath come beforehand to anoint My body for burial .
KJ21	Mark	14	9	Verily I say unto you , wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of as a memorial of her. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	10	And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went unto the chief priests to betray Him unto them .
KJ21	Mark	14	11	And when they heard it , they were glad and promised to give him money . And he sought how he might conveniently betray Him .
KJ21	Mark	14	12	And on the first day of Unleavened Bread , when they killed the Passover lamb , His disciples said unto Him , “ Where wilt Thou have us go and prepare , that Thou mayest eat the Passover ? ”
KJ21	Mark	14	13	And He sent forth two of His disciples and said unto them , “ Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him .
KJ21	Mark	14	15	And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared ; there make ready for us. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	16	And His disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found it as He had said unto them ; and they made ready the Passover .
KJ21	Mark	14	17	And in the evening He came with the twelve .
KJ21	Mark	14	18	And as they sat and ate , Jesus said , “ Verily I say unto you , one of you who eateth with Me shall betray Me. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	19	And they began to be sorrowful and to say unto Him one by one , “ Is it I ? ” And another said , “ Is it I ? ”
KJ21	Mark	14	20	And He answered and said unto them , “ It is one of the twelve that dippeth with Me in the dish .
KJ21	Mark	14	21	The Son of Man indeed goeth , as it is written of Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! Good were it for that man if he had never been born. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	22	And as they ate , Jesus took bread , and blessed and broke it , and gave it to them and said , “ Take , eat ; this is My body. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	23	And He took the cup , and when He had given thanks He gave it to them , and they all drank of it .
KJ21	Mark	14	24	And He said unto them , “ This is My blood of the new testament , which is shed for many .
KJ21	Mark	14	25	Verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	26	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out into the Mount of Olives .
KJ21	Mark	14	27	And Jesus said unto them , “ All ye shall be offended because of Me this night , for it is written : ‘ I will smite the Shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered. ’
KJ21	Mark	14	28	But after I am risen , I will go before you into Galilee. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	29	But Peter said unto Him , “ Although all shall be offended , yet will I not. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	30	And Jesus said unto him , “ Verily I say unto thee that this day , even in this night , before the cock crows twice , thou shalt deny Me thrice. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	31	But Peter spoke the more vehemently , “ If I should die with Thee , I will not deny Thee in any way. ” Likewise also said they all .
KJ21	Mark	14	32	And they came to a place which is named Gethsemane ; and He said to His disciples , “ Sit ye here while I shall pray. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	33	And He took with Him Peter and James and John , and began to be sore amazed and very heavy of heart .
KJ21	Mark	14	34	And He said unto them , “ My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death ; tarry ye here , and watch. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	35	And He went forward a little , and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible , the hour might pass from Him .
KJ21	Mark	14	36	And He said , “ Abba , Father , all things are possible unto Thee . Take away this cup from Me ; nevertheless not what I will , but what Thou wilt. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	37	And He came back and found them sleeping , and said unto Peter , “ Simon , sleepest thou ? Couldest thou not watch one hour ?
KJ21	Mark	14	38	Watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . The spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	39	And again He went away and prayed and spoke the same words .
KJ21	Mark	14	40	And when He returned He found them asleep again , for their eyes were heavy ; neither knew they what to answer Him .
KJ21	Mark	14	41	And He came the third time and said unto them , “ Sleep on now and take your rest . It is enough : the hour is come ; behold , the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
KJ21	Mark	14	42	Rise up ; let us go . Lo , he that betrayeth Me is at hand. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	43	And immediately , while He yet spoke came Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
KJ21	Mark	14	44	And he that betrayed Him had given them a sign , saying , “ Whomever I shall kiss , that same is he . Take him and lead him away safely. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	45	And as soon as he had come , he went straightway to Him and said , “ Master , Master ! ” and kissed Him .
KJ21	Mark	14	46	And they laid their hands on Him and took Him .
KJ21	Mark	14	47	And one of those who stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
KJ21	Mark	14	48	And Jesus answered and said unto them , “ Have ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take Me ?
KJ21	Mark	14	49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took Me not . But the Scriptures must be fulfilled. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	50	And they all forsook Him and fled .
KJ21	Mark	14	51	And there followed Him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him .
KJ21	Mark	14	52	And he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked .
KJ21	Mark	14	53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest ; and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
KJ21	Mark	14	54	And Peter followed Him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest . And he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
KJ21	Mark	14	55	And the chief priests and all of the council sought for witness against Jesus to put Him to death , and found none .
KJ21	Mark	14	56	For many bore false witness against Him , but their witness agreed not together .
KJ21	Mark	14	57	And there arose certain ones who bore false witness against Him , saying ,
KJ21	Mark	14	58	“ We heard him say , ‘ I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands. ’ ”
KJ21	Mark	14	59	But neither did their witness agree together .
KJ21	Mark	14	60	And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus , saying , “ Answerest thou nothing ? What is it which these witness against thee ? ”
KJ21	Mark	14	61	But He held His peace and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked Him and said unto Him , “ Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? ”
KJ21	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said , “ I am ; and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming in the clouds of heaven. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	63	Then the high priest rent his clothes and said , “ Why need we any further witnesses ?
KJ21	Mark	14	64	Ye have heard the blasphemy . What think ye ? ” And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death .
KJ21	Mark	14	65	And some began to spit on Him , and to cover His face , and to buffet Him , and to say unto Him , “ Prophesy ! ” And the servants struck Him with the palms of their hands .
KJ21	Mark	14	66	And as Peter was below in the courtyard , there came one of the maids of the high priest .
KJ21	Mark	14	67	And when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him and said , “ And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	68	But he denied it , saying , “ I know not , neither understand I what thou sayest. ” And he went out into the porch , and the cock crowed .
KJ21	Mark	14	69	And a maid saw him again and began to say to those who stood by , “ This is one of them. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	70	And he denied it again . And a little after , those who stood by said again to Peter , “ Surely thou art one of them , for thou art a Galilean , and thy speech agreeth thereto. ”
KJ21	Mark	14	71	But he began to curse and to swear , saying , “ I know not this man of whom ye speak ! ”
KJ21	Mark	14	72	And the second time the cock crowed . And Peter called to mind the words that Jesus had said unto him : “ Before the cock crows twice , thou shalt deny Me thrice. ” And when he thought thereon , he wept .
KJ21	Mark	15	15	And so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas unto them and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged Him , to be crucified .
KJ21	Mark	15	2	And Pilate asked Him , “ Art thou the King of the Jews ? ” And answering He said unto him , “ Thou sayest it. ”
KJ21	Mark	15	3	And the chief priests accused Him of many things , but He answered nothing .
KJ21	Mark	15	4	And Pilate asked Him again , saying , “ Answerest thou nothing ? Behold how many things they witness against thee. ”
KJ21	Mark	15	5	But Jesus yet answered nothing , so that Pilate marveled .
KJ21	Mark	15	6	Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner , whomsoever they desired .
KJ21	Mark	15	7	And there was one named Barabbas , who lay bound with those who had made insurrection with him , and who had committed murder in the insurrection .
KJ21	Mark	15	8	And the multitude , crying aloud , began to desire Pilate to do as he had ever done unto them .
KJ21	Mark	15	9	But Pilate answered them , saying , “ Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ? ”
KJ21	Mark	15	10	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him out of envy .
KJ21	Mark	15	11	But the chief priests moved the people , that he should rather release Barabbas unto them .
KJ21	Mark	15	12	And Pilate answered and said again unto them , “ What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews ? ”
KJ21	Mark	15	13	And they cried out again , “ Crucify him ! ”
KJ21	Mark	15	14	Then Pilate said unto them , “ Why , what evil hath he done ? ” But they cried out the more exceedingly , “ Crucify him ! ”
KJ21	Mark	15	16	And the soldiers led Him away into the hall called the Praetorium , and they called together the whole detachment .
KJ21	Mark	15	17	And they clothed Him with purple , and they platted a crown of thorns and put it about His head ,
KJ21	Mark	15	18	and began to salute Him , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
KJ21	Mark	15	19	And they smote Him on the head with a reed and spat upon Him and , bowing their knees , worshiped Him .
KJ21	Mark	15	20	And when they had mocked Him , they took off the purple from Him , and put His own clothes on Him , and led Him out to crucify Him .
KJ21	Mark	15	21	And they compelled one Simon , a Cyrenian , the father of Alexander and Rufus , who was passing by , coming from the country , to bear His cross .
KJ21	Mark	15	22	And they brought Him unto the place called Golgotha ( which is , being interpreted , The Place of a Skull ) .
KJ21	Mark	15	23	And they gave Him to drink wine mingled with myrrh , but He received it not .
KJ21	Mark	15	24	And when they had crucified Him , they parted His garments , casting lots for them to see what every man should take .
KJ21	Mark	15	25	And it was the third hour when they crucified Him .
KJ21	Mark	15	26	And the superscription of His accusation was written above : The King Of The Jews .
KJ21	Mark	15	27	And with Him they crucified two thieves , the one on His right hand and the other on His left .
KJ21	Mark	15	28	And the Scripture was fulfilled which saith , “ And He was numbered with the transgressors. ”
KJ21	Mark	15	29	And those who passed by railed at Him , wagging their heads and saying , “ Ah , thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days ,
KJ21	Mark	15	30	save thyself and come down from the cross ! ”
KJ21	Mark	15	31	Likewise also the chief priests , mocking , said among themselves with the scribes , “ He saved others ; himself he can not save !
KJ21	Mark	15	32	Let Christ , the King of Israel , descend now from the cross , that we may see and believe. ” And those who were crucified with Him reviled Him .
KJ21	Mark	15	33	And when the sixth hour had come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
KJ21	Mark	15	34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? ” which is , being interpreted , “ My God , My God , why hast Thou forsaken Me ? ”
KJ21	Mark	15	35	And some of those who stood by , when they heard it , said , “ Behold , he calleth Elijah. ”
KJ21	Mark	15	36	And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed and gave it to Him to drink , saying , “ Let him alone . Let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down. ”
KJ21	Mark	15	37	And Jesus cried out with a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
KJ21	Mark	15	38	And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom .
KJ21	Mark	15	39	And when the centurion who stood opposite Him saw that He so cried out and gave up the ghost , he said , “ Truly , this Man was the Son of God ! ”
KJ21	Mark	15	40	There were also women looking on afar off , among whom were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses , and Salome
KJ21	Mark	15	41	( who also , when He was in Galilee , had followed Him and ministered unto Him ) , and many other women who came up with Him unto Jerusalem .
KJ21	Mark	15	42	And now when the evening had come , because it was the Preparation ( that is , the day before the Sabbath ) ,
KJ21	Mark	15	43	Joseph of Arimathea , an honorable council member who also was waiting for the Kingdom of God , came and went in boldly unto Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
KJ21	Mark	15	44	And Pilate wondered if He were already dead ; and calling unto him the centurion , he asked him whether He had been any while dead .
KJ21	Mark	15	45	And when he learned it from the centurion , he gave the body to Joseph .
KJ21	Mark	15	46	And Joseph bought fine linen , and took Him down and wrapped Him in the linen . And he laid Him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulcher .
KJ21	Mark	15	47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where He was laid .
KJ21	Mark	16	16	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned .
KJ21	Mark	16	2	And very early in the morning on the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun .
KJ21	Mark	16	3	And they said among themselves , “ Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher ? ”
KJ21	Mark	16	4	And when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away , for it was very large .
KJ21	Mark	16	5	And entering into the sepulcher , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were frightened .
KJ21	Mark	16	6	And he said unto them , “ Be not afraid . Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified . He is risen ! He is not here . Behold the place where they laid Him .
KJ21	Mark	16	7	But go your way . Tell His disciples and Peter that He goeth before you into Galilee . There shall ye see Him , as He said unto you. ”
KJ21	Mark	16	8	And they went out quickly and fled from the sepulcher , for they trembled and were amazed ; neither said they any thing to any man , for they were afraid .
KJ21	Mark	16	9	Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week , He appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom He had cast seven devils .
KJ21	Mark	16	10	And she went and told those who had been with Him , as they mourned and wept .
KJ21	Mark	16	11	And they , when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her , believed not .
KJ21	Mark	16	12	After that , He appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country .
KJ21	Mark	16	13	And they went and told it unto the rest , but neither did they believe them .
KJ21	Mark	16	14	Afterward He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat ; and He upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not those who had seen Him after He was risen .
KJ21	Mark	16	15	And He said unto them , “ Go ye into all the world , and preach the Gospel to every creature .
KJ21	Mark	16	17	And these signs shall follow them that believe : In My name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
KJ21	Mark	16	18	they shall take up serpents , and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them . They shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover. ”
KJ21	Mark	16	19	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them , He was received up into Heaven , and sat at the right hand of God .
KJ21	Mark	16	20	And they went forth and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them and confirming the Word with signs following . Amen .
KJ21	Luke	1	1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us ,
KJ21	Luke	1	2	even as they were delivered unto us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word ,
KJ21	Luke	1	3	it seemed good to me also , having had perfect understanding of things from the very first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent Theophilus ,
KJ21	Luke	1	4	that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed .
KJ21	Luke	1	5	There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the priestly course of Abijah ; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
KJ21	Luke	1	6	And they were both righteous before God , walking blameless in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord .
KJ21	Luke	1	7	And they had no child because Elizabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years .
KJ21	Luke	1	8	And it came to pass that while he executed the priest ’ s office before God in the order of his course ,
KJ21	Luke	1	9	according to the custom of the priest ’ s office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
KJ21	Luke	1	10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense .
KJ21	Luke	1	11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord , standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
KJ21	Luke	1	12	And when Zacharias saw him he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
KJ21	Luke	1	13	But the angel said unto him , “ Fear not , Zacharias , for thy prayer is heard , and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
KJ21	Luke	1	14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness , and many shall rejoice at his birth .
KJ21	Luke	1	15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink , and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother ’ s womb .
KJ21	Luke	1	16	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God .
KJ21	Luke	1	17	And he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just , to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	18	And Zacharias said unto the angel , “ Whereby shall I know this ? For I am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	19	And the angel answering said unto him , “ I am Gabriel who stands in the presence of God , and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these glad tidings .
KJ21	Luke	1	20	And behold , thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	21	And the people waited for Zacharias , and marveled that he tarried so long in the temple .
KJ21	Luke	1	22	And when he came out , he could not speak unto them , and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple ; for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless .
KJ21	Luke	1	23	And it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
KJ21	Luke	1	24	And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying ,
KJ21	Luke	1	25	“ Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein He looked on me , to take away my reproach among men. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	26	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth ,
KJ21	Luke	1	27	to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin ’ s name was Mary .
KJ21	Luke	1	28	And the angel came in unto her and said , “ Hail , thou that art highly favored , the Lord is with thee ; blessed art thou among women. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	29	And when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying and cast about in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .
KJ21	Luke	1	30	And the angel said unto her , “ Fear not , Mary , for thou hast found favor with God .
KJ21	Luke	1	31	And behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a Son , and shalt call His name Jesus .
KJ21	Luke	1	32	He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest ; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David ,
KJ21	Luke	1	33	and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of His Kingdom there shall be no end. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	34	Then said Mary unto the angel , “ How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ? ”
KJ21	Luke	1	35	And the angel answered and said unto her , “ The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee . Therefore also that Holy Being who shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God .
KJ21	Luke	1	36	And behold , thy cousin Elizabeth : she hath also conceived a son in her old age , and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
KJ21	Luke	1	37	For with God nothing shall be impossible. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	38	And Mary said , “ Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word. ” And the angel departed from her .
KJ21	Luke	1	39	And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Judah ,
KJ21	Luke	1	40	and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth .
KJ21	Luke	1	41	And it came to pass , when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary , that the babe leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost .
KJ21	Luke	1	42	And she spoke out with a loud voice and said , “ Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
KJ21	Luke	1	43	And why is it granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
KJ21	Luke	1	44	For lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
KJ21	Luke	1	45	And blessed is she that believed ; for there shall be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	46	And Mary said , “ My soul doth magnify the Lord ,
KJ21	Luke	1	47	and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior .
KJ21	Luke	1	48	For He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden ; for behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
KJ21	Luke	1	49	For He that is mighty hath done to me great things , and holy is His name .
KJ21	Luke	1	50	And His mercy is on them that fear Him , from generation to generation .
KJ21	Luke	1	51	He hath shown strength with His arm ; He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
KJ21	Luke	1	52	He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree .
KJ21	Luke	1	53	He hath filled the hungry with good things , and the rich He hath sent empty away .
KJ21	Luke	1	54	He hath helped His servant Israel , in remembrance of His mercy ,
KJ21	Luke	1	55	as He spoke to our fathers , to Abraham and to his seed for ever. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	56	And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her own house .
KJ21	Luke	1	57	Now Elizabeth ’ s full time came that she should be delivered , and she brought forth a son .
KJ21	Luke	1	58	And her neighbors and her kindred heard how the Lord had shown great mercy upon her , and they rejoiced with her .
KJ21	Luke	1	59	And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
KJ21	Luke	1	60	But his mother answered and said , “ Not so , but he shall be called John. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	61	And they said unto her , “ There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	62	And they made signs to his father , how he would have him called .
KJ21	Luke	1	63	And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote , saying , “ His name is John. ” And they marveled all .
KJ21	Luke	1	64	And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spoke and praised God .
KJ21	Luke	1	65	And fear came on all who dwelt round about them ; and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea .
KJ21	Luke	1	66	And all those who heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , “ What manner of child shall this be ? ” And the hand of the Lord was with him .
KJ21	Luke	1	67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied , saying ,
KJ21	Luke	1	68	“ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , for He hath visited and redeemed His people ,
KJ21	Luke	1	69	and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David .
KJ21	Luke	1	70	As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets , who have been since the world began ,
KJ21	Luke	1	71	that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us ,
KJ21	Luke	1	72	to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant ,
KJ21	Luke	1	73	the oath which He swore to our father Abraham :
KJ21	Luke	1	74	that He would grant unto us that we , being delivered out of the hand of our enemies , might serve Him without fear ,
KJ21	Luke	1	75	in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life .
KJ21	Luke	1	76	And thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the Highest ; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways ,
KJ21	Luke	1	77	to give knowledge of salvation unto His people by the remission of their sins ,
KJ21	Luke	1	78	through the tender mercy of our God , whereby the Dayspring from on high hath visited us ,
KJ21	Luke	1	79	to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace. ”
KJ21	Luke	1	80	And the child grew and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts until the day of his appearing unto Israel .
KJ21	Luke	2	2	( And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria . )
KJ21	Luke	2	3	And all went to be taxed , every one into his own city .
KJ21	Luke	2	4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea , unto the City of David which is called Bethlehem ( because he was of the house and lineage of David )
KJ21	Luke	2	5	to be taxed with Mary , his espoused wife , who was great with child .
KJ21	Luke	2	6	And so it was that while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered .
KJ21	Luke	2	7	And she brought forth her firstborn Son , and wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger , because there was no room for them in the inn .
KJ21	Luke	2	8	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
KJ21	Luke	2	9	And lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them , and they were sore afraid .
KJ21	Luke	2	10	And the angel said unto them , “ Fear not , for behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people .
KJ21	Luke	2	11	For unto you is born this day in the City of David a Savior , who is Christ the Lord .
KJ21	Luke	2	12	And this shall be a sign unto you : Ye shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger. ”
KJ21	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying ,
KJ21	Luke	2	14	“ Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace , good will toward men ! ”
KJ21	Luke	2	15	And it came to pass , when the angels were gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , “ Let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass , which the Lord hath made known unto us. ”
KJ21	Luke	2	16	And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph , and the Babe lying in a manger .
KJ21	Luke	2	17	And when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this Child .
KJ21	Luke	2	18	And all those who heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds .
KJ21	Luke	2	19	But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart .
KJ21	Luke	2	20	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
KJ21	Luke	2	21	And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the Child , His name was called Jesus , who was so named by the angel before He was conceived in the womb .
KJ21	Luke	2	22	And when the days of her purification according to the Law of Moses were accomplished , they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
KJ21	Luke	2	23	( as it is written in the law of the Lord : “ Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ” ) ,
KJ21	Luke	2	24	and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord : “ A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons. ”
KJ21	Luke	2	25	And behold , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon , and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel ; and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
KJ21	Luke	2	26	And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord ’ s Christ .
KJ21	Luke	2	27	And he came by the Spirit into the temple ; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for Him after the custom of the law ,
KJ21	Luke	2	28	then he took Him up in his arms , and blessed God and said ,
KJ21	Luke	2	29	“ Lord , now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace , according to Thy word ;
KJ21	Luke	2	30	for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation ,
KJ21	Luke	2	31	which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people ,
KJ21	Luke	2	32	a light to lighten the Gentiles , and the glory of Thy people Israel. ”
KJ21	Luke	2	33	And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken of Him .
KJ21	Luke	2	34	And Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary His mother , “ Behold , this Child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel , and for a sign which shall be spoken against
KJ21	Luke	2	35	( yea , a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also ) , that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. ”
KJ21	Luke	2	36	And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher . She was of great age and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity ,
KJ21	Luke	2	37	and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years . She departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
KJ21	Luke	2	38	And she , coming in that instant , gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and spoke of Him to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
KJ21	Luke	2	39	And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee to their own city , Nazareth .
KJ21	Luke	2	40	And the Child grew and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon Him .
KJ21	Luke	2	41	Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover .
KJ21	Luke	2	42	And when He was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the Feast .
KJ21	Luke	2	43	And when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and His mother knew not of it .
KJ21	Luke	2	44	But they , supposing Him to have been in the company , went a day ’ s journey ; and they sought Him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances .
KJ21	Luke	2	45	And when they found Him not , they turned back again to Jerusalem , seeking Him .
KJ21	Luke	2	46	And it came to pass that after three days they found Him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them and asking them questions .
KJ21	Luke	2	47	And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers .
KJ21	Luke	2	48	And when they saw Him they were amazed , and His mother said unto Him , “ Son , why hast Thou thus dealt with us ? Behold , Thy father and I have sought Thee sorrowing. ”
KJ21	Luke	2	49	And He said unto them , “ How is it that ye sought Me ? Knew ye not that I must be about My Father ’ s business ? ”
KJ21	Luke	2	50	And they understood not the saying which He spoke unto them .
KJ21	Luke	2	51	And He went down with them and came to Nazareth , and was subject unto them . But His mother kept all these things in her heart .
KJ21	Luke	2	52	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and man .
KJ21	Luke	3	3	And he came into all the country about the Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ,
KJ21	Luke	3	2	Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests , the Word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness .
KJ21	Luke	3	4	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , saying , “ The voice of one crying in the wilderness : ‘ Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make His paths straight .
KJ21	Luke	3	5	Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ;
KJ21	Luke	3	6	and all flesh shall see the salvation of God. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	3	7	Then said he to the multitude who came forth to be baptized by him , “ O generation of vipers ! Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
KJ21	Luke	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say among yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father. ’ For I say unto you , that God is able from these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
KJ21	Luke	3	9	And now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees . Every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire. ”
KJ21	Luke	3	10	And the people asked him , saying , “ What shall we do then ? ”
KJ21	Luke	3	11	He answered and said unto them , “ He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none . And he that hath meat , let him do likewise. ”
KJ21	Luke	3	12	Then came also publicans to be baptized , and said unto him , “ Master , what shall we do ? ”
KJ21	Luke	3	13	And he said unto them , “ Exact no more than that which is appointed you. ”
KJ21	Luke	3	14	And the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , “ And what shall we do ? ” And he said unto them , “ Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages. ”
KJ21	Luke	3	15	And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts whether John was the Christ or not ,
KJ21	Luke	3	16	John answered , saying unto them all , “ I indeed baptize you with water ; but One mightier than I cometh , the straps of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose . He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire .
KJ21	Luke	3	17	His winnowing fan is in His hand , and He will thoroughly purge His floor and will gather the wheat into His garner ; but the chaff He will burn with fire unquenchable. ”
KJ21	Luke	3	18	And with many other exhortations preached he unto the people .
KJ21	Luke	3	19	But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him because of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done ,
KJ21	Luke	3	20	added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison .
KJ21	Luke	3	21	Now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass that Jesus also was baptized . And while He prayed the heaven was opened ,
KJ21	Luke	3	22	and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him , and a voice came from Heaven , which said , “ Thou Art My Beloved Son ; In Thee I Am Well Pleased. ”
KJ21	Luke	3	23	And Jesus Himself had become about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , who was the son of Heli ,
KJ21	Luke	3	24	who was the son of Matthat , who was the son of Levi , who was the son of Melchi , who was the son of Janna , who was the son of Joseph ,
KJ21	Luke	3	25	who was the son of Mattathias , who was the son of Amos , who was the son of Nahum , who was the son of Esli , who was the son of Naggai ,
KJ21	Luke	3	26	who was the son of Maath , who was the son of Mattathias , who was the son of Semei , who was the son of Joseph , who was the son of Juda ,
KJ21	Luke	3	27	who was the son of Joanna , who was the son of Rhesa , who was the son of Zerubbabel , who was the son of Shealtiel , who was the son of Neri ,
KJ21	Luke	3	28	who was the son of Melchi , who was the son of Addi , who was the son of Cosam , who was the son of Elmodam , who was the son of Er ,
KJ21	Luke	3	29	who was the son of Jose , who was the son of Eliezer , who was the son of Jorim , who was the son of Matthat , who was the son of Levi ,
KJ21	Luke	3	30	who was the son of Simeon , who was the son of Judah , who was the son of Joseph , who was the son of Jonan , who was the son of Eliakim ,
KJ21	Luke	3	31	who was the son of Melea , who was the son of Menan , who was the son of Mattatha , who was the son of Nathan , who was the son of David ,
KJ21	Luke	3	32	who was the son of Jesse , who was the son of Obed , who was the son of Boaz , who was the son of Salmon , who was the son of Nahshon ,
KJ21	Luke	3	33	who was the son of Amminadab , who was the son of Aram , who was the son of Hezron , who was the son of Perez , who was the son of Judah ,
KJ21	Luke	3	34	who was the son of Jacob , who was the son of Isaac , who was the son of Abraham , who was the son of Terah , who was the son of Nahor ,
KJ21	Luke	3	35	who was the son of Serug , who was the son of Reu , who was the son of Peleg , who was the son of Eber , who was the son of Shelah ,
KJ21	Luke	3	36	who was the son of Cainan , who was the son of Arphaxad , who was the son of Shem , who was the son of Noah , who was the son of Lamech ,
KJ21	Luke	3	37	who was the son of Methuselah , who was the son of Enoch , who was the son of Jared , who was the son of Mahalaleel , who was the son of Cainan ,
KJ21	Luke	3	38	who was the son of Enos , who was the son of Seth , who was the son of Adam , who was the son of God .
KJ21	Luke	4	4	And Jesus answered him , saying , “ It is written : ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	4	2	and for forty days was tempted by the devil . And in those days He ate nothing , and afterward when they were ended , He hungered .
KJ21	Luke	4	3	And the devil said unto Him , “ If Thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread. ”
KJ21	Luke	4	5	And the devil , taking Him up onto a high mountain , showed unto Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
KJ21	Luke	4	6	And the devil said unto Him , “ All this power will I give Thee , and the glory of them ; for this has been delivered unto me , and to whomsoever I will , I give it .
KJ21	Luke	4	7	If Thou therefore wilt worship me , all shall be Thine. ”
KJ21	Luke	4	8	And Jesus answered and said unto him , “ Get thee behind Me , Satan ! For it is written : ‘ Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and Him only shalt thou serve. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	4	9	And he brought Him to Jerusalem , and set Him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto Him , “ If Thou be the Son of God , cast Thyself down from hence .
KJ21	Luke	4	10	For it is written : ‘ He shall give His angels charge over thee to keep thee , ’
KJ21	Luke	4	11	and , ‘ In their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	4	12	And Jesus answering said unto him , “ It is said , ‘ Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	4	13	And when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from Him for a season .
KJ21	Luke	4	14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee , and His fame went out through all the region round about .
KJ21	Luke	4	15	And He taught in their synagogues , being glorified by all .
KJ21	Luke	4	16	And He came to Nazareth where He had been brought up . And as His custom was , He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read .
KJ21	Luke	4	17	And there was delivered unto Him the book of the prophet Isaiah . And when He had opened the book , He found the place where it was written :
KJ21	Luke	4	18	“ The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me , because He hath anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor . He hath sent Me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised ,
KJ21	Luke	4	19	to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. ”
KJ21	Luke	4	20	And He closed the book , and He gave it again to the minister and sat down . And the eyes of all those who were in the synagogue were fastened on Him .
KJ21	Luke	4	21	And He began to say unto them , “ This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears. ”
KJ21	Luke	4	22	And all bore Him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth . And they said , “ Is not this Joseph ’ s son ? ”
KJ21	Luke	4	23	And He said unto them , “ Ye will surely say unto Me this proverb : ‘ Physician , heal thyself ! Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum , do also here in thy country. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	4	24	And He said , “ Verily I say unto you , no prophet is accepted in his own country .
KJ21	Luke	4	25	But I tell you in truth , many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land .
KJ21	Luke	4	26	But unto none of them was Elijah sent , save unto Zarephath , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
KJ21	Luke	4	27	And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , and none of them was cleansed , except Naaman the Syrian. ”
KJ21	Luke	4	28	Then all those in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
KJ21	Luke	4	29	and rose up and thrust Him out of the city ; and they led Him unto the brow of a hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast Him down headlong .
KJ21	Luke	4	30	But He , passing through the midst of them , went His way .
KJ21	Luke	4	31	And He came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the Sabbath days .
KJ21	Luke	4	32	And they were astonished at His doctrine , for His word was with power .
KJ21	Luke	4	33	And in the synagogue there was a man , who had a spirit of an unclean devil , and cried out with a loud voice ,
KJ21	Luke	4	34	saying , “ Let us alone ! What have we to do with Thee , Thou Jesus of Nazareth ? Art Thou come to destroy us ? I know Thee and who Thou art — the Holy One of God ! ”
KJ21	Luke	4	35	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Hold thy peace , and come out of him ! ” And when the devil had thrown him in their midst , he came out of him and hurt him not .
KJ21	Luke	4	36	And they were all amazed , and spoke among themselves , saying , “ What a word is this ! For with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out. ”
KJ21	Luke	4	37	And His fame went out into every place in the country round about .
KJ21	Luke	4	38	And He arose out of the synagogue and entered into Simon ’ s house . And Simon ’ s wife ’ s mother was taken with a great fever , and they besought Him for her .
KJ21	Luke	4	39	And He stood over her and rebuked the fever , and it left her . And immediately she arose and ministered unto them .
KJ21	Luke	4	40	Now when the sun was setting , all those who had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto Him ; and He laid His hands on every one of them , and healed them .
KJ21	Luke	4	41	And devils also came out of many , crying out and saying , “ Thou art Christ , the Son of God ! ” And He , rebuking them , suffered them not to speak ; for they knew that He was Christ .
KJ21	Luke	4	42	And when it was day , He departed and went into a desert place . And the people sought Him and came unto Him and would have stayed Him , that He should not depart from them .
KJ21	Luke	4	43	But He said unto them , “ I must preach the Kingdom of God to other cities also , for therefore am I sent. ”
KJ21	Luke	4	44	And He preached in the synagogues of Galilee .
KJ21	Luke	5	5	And Simon answering said unto Him , “ Master , we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing . Nevertheless , at Thy word I will let down the net. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	2	and saw two boats standing by the lake , but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets .
KJ21	Luke	5	3	And He entered into one of the boats , which was Simon ’ s , and asked him to put out a little from the land . And He sat down and taught the people from the boat .
KJ21	Luke	5	4	Now when He was through speaking , He said unto Simon , “ Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draft. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	6	And when they had done this , they enclosed a great multitude of fishes , and their net began to break .
KJ21	Luke	5	7	And they beckoned unto their partners , who were in the other boat , that they should come and help them . And they came and filled both the boats , so that they began to sink .
KJ21	Luke	5	8	When Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ’ knees , saying , “ Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , O Lord. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	9	For he was astonished , and all those who were with him , at the draft of the fishes which they had taken ;
KJ21	Luke	5	10	and so also were James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said unto Simon , “ Fear not . From henceforth thou shalt catch men. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	11	And when they had brought their boats to land , they forsook all and followed Him .
KJ21	Luke	5	12	And it came to pass when He was in a certain city , behold , a man full of leprosy , seeing Jesus , fell on his face and besought Him , saying , “ Lord , if Thou wilt , Thou canst make me clean. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	13	And He put forth His hand and touched him , saying , “ I will ; be thou clean. ” And immediately the leprosy departed from him .
KJ21	Luke	5	14	And He charged him to tell no man , but , “ Go and show thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded , as a testimony unto them. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	15	But so much the more His fame spread abroad , and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by Him of their infirmities .
KJ21	Luke	5	16	And He withdrew Himself into the wilderness and prayed .
KJ21	Luke	5	17	And it came to pass on a certain day , as He was teaching , that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , who had come from every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem . And the power of the Lord was present to heal them .
KJ21	Luke	5	18	And behold , men brought in on a bed a man who was taken with a palsy , and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before Him .
KJ21	Luke	5	19	And when they could not find a way to bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down on his couch through the tiling into the midst before Jesus .
KJ21	Luke	5	20	And when He saw their faith , He said unto him , “ Man , thy sins are forgiven thee. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , “ Who is this who speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ? ”
KJ21	Luke	5	22	But when Jesus perceived their thoughts , He answering said unto them , “ What reason ye in your hearts :
KJ21	Luke	5	23	whether it is easier to say , ‘ Thy sins be forgiven thee , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise up and walk ’ ?
KJ21	Luke	5	24	But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , ” He said unto the one sick with the palsy , “ I say unto thee , arise and take up thy couch and go into thine house. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	25	And immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying God .
KJ21	Luke	5	26	And they were all amazed , and they glorified God and were filled with fear , saying , “ We have seen strange things today. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	27	And after these things He went forth and saw a publican named Levi , sitting in the customhouse , and He said unto him , “ Follow Me. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	28	And he left all , rose up , and followed Him .
KJ21	Luke	5	29	And Levi made Him a great feast in his own house , and there was a great company of publicans and of others who sat down with them .
KJ21	Luke	5	30	But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against His disciples , saying , “ Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ? ”
KJ21	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answering said unto them , “ They that are whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
KJ21	Luke	5	32	I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	33	And they said unto Him , “ Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees , but thine eat and drink ? ”
KJ21	Luke	5	34	And He said unto them , “ Can ye make the attendants of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them ?
KJ21	Luke	5	35	But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days. ”
KJ21	Luke	5	36	And He spoke also a parable unto them : “ No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; otherwise , both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old .
KJ21	Luke	5	37	And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins ; else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled , and the wineskins shall perish .
KJ21	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into new wineskins , and both are preserved .
KJ21	Luke	5	39	No man also , having drunk old wine , straightway desireth new ; for he saith , ‘ The old is better . ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	6	6	And it came to pass also on another Sabbath , that He entered into the synagogue and taught . And there was a man whose right hand was withered .
KJ21	Luke	6	2	And certain of the Pharisees said unto them , “ Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath days ? ”
KJ21	Luke	6	3	And Jesus answering them said , “ Have ye not read so much as this , what David did when he himself hungered and they that were with him :
KJ21	Luke	6	4	how he went into the house of God , and took and ate the showbread and gave also to them that were with him , which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone ? ”
KJ21	Luke	6	5	And He said unto them , “ The Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath. ”
KJ21	Luke	6	7	And the scribes and Pharisees watched Him to see whether He would heal on the Sabbath day , that they might find an accusation against Him .
KJ21	Luke	6	8	But He knew their thoughts , and said to the man who had the withered hand , “ Rise up and stand forth in the midst. ” And he arose and stood forth .
KJ21	Luke	6	9	Then said Jesus unto them , “ I will ask you one thing : Is it lawful on the Sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ? To save life , or to destroy it ? ”
KJ21	Luke	6	10	And looking round about upon them all , He said unto the man , “ Stretch forth thy hand. ” And he did so , and his hand was restored whole as the other .
KJ21	Luke	6	11	And they were filled with madness , and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus .
KJ21	Luke	6	12	And it came to pass in those days that He went out onto a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God .
KJ21	Luke	6	13	And when it was day , He called unto Him His disciples , and from them He chose twelve , whom also He named apostles :
KJ21	Luke	6	14	Simon ( whom He also named Peter ) , and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
KJ21	Luke	6	15	Matthew and Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon called the Zealot ,
KJ21	Luke	6	16	and Judas the brother of James , and Judas Iscariot who also was the traitor .
KJ21	Luke	6	17	And He came down with them and stood on the plain with the company of His disciples and a great multitude of people out of all Judea and Jerusalem , and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases ,
KJ21	Luke	6	18	and those who were vexed with unclean spirits ; and they were healed .
KJ21	Luke	6	19	And the whole multitude sought to touch Him , for there went virtue out of Him and healed them all .
KJ21	Luke	6	20	And He lifted up His eyes on His disciples and said , “ Blessed be ye poor , for yours is the Kingdom of God .
KJ21	Luke	6	21	Blessed are ye that hunger now , for ye shall be filled . Blessed are ye that weep now , for ye shall laugh .
KJ21	Luke	6	22	Blessed are ye when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of Man ’ s sake .
KJ21	Luke	6	23	Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in Heaven ; for in like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
KJ21	Luke	6	24	“ But woe unto you that are rich , for ye have received your consolation .
KJ21	Luke	6	25	Woe unto you that are full , for ye shall hunger . Woe unto you that laugh now , for ye shall mourn and weep .
KJ21	Luke	6	26	Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you , for so did their fathers to the false prophets .
KJ21	Luke	6	27	“ But I say unto you that hear : Love your enemies , do good to them that hate you .
KJ21	Luke	6	28	Bless them that curse you , and pray for them that despitefully use you .
KJ21	Luke	6	29	And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek , offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy cloak , forbid not to take thy coat also .
KJ21	Luke	6	30	Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods , ask them not back .
KJ21	Luke	6	31	And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
KJ21	Luke	6	32	For if ye love them that love you , what thanks have ye ? For sinners also love those that love them .
KJ21	Luke	6	33	And if ye do good to them that do good to you , what thanks have ye ? For sinners also do even the same .
KJ21	Luke	6	34	And if ye lend to them from whom ye hope to receive , what thanks have ye ? For sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again .
KJ21	Luke	6	35	But love ye your enemies , and do good and lend , hoping for nothing in return ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the Highest ; for He is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil .
KJ21	Luke	6	36	Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father also is merciful .
KJ21	Luke	6	37	“ Judge not , and ye shall not be judged . Condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned . Forgive , and ye shall be forgiven .
KJ21	Luke	6	38	Give , and it shall be given unto you : good measure , pressed down and shaken together and running over , shall men give into your bosom . For with the same measure that ye mete , therewith it shall be measured to you again. ”
KJ21	Luke	6	39	And He spoke a parable unto them : “ Can the blind lead the blind ? Shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
KJ21	Luke	6	40	The disciple is not above his master , but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
KJ21	Luke	6	41	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
KJ21	Luke	6	42	Or how canst thou say to thy brother , ‘ Brother , let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye , ’ when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? Thou hypocrite ! Cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye .
KJ21	Luke	6	43	“ For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
KJ21	Luke	6	44	For every tree is known by his own fruit . For from thorns men do not gather figs , nor from a bramble bush gather they grapes .
KJ21	Luke	6	45	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil ; for of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaketh .
KJ21	Luke	6	46	“ And why call ye Me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ and do not the things which I say ?
KJ21	Luke	6	47	Whosoever cometh to Me , and heareth My sayings and doeth them , I will show you to whom he is like :
KJ21	Luke	6	48	He is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock ; and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it , for it was founded upon a rock .
KJ21	Luke	6	49	But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that built a house without a foundation upon the earth , against which the stream beat vehemently , and immediately it fell . And the ruin of that house was great . ”
KJ21	Luke	7	7	Therefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto Thee . But say the word , and my servant shall be healed .
KJ21	Luke	7	2	And a certain centurion ’ s servant , who was dear unto him , was sick and ready to die .
KJ21	Luke	7	3	And when he heard of Jesus , he sent the elders of the Jews unto Him , beseeching Him that He would come and heal his servant .
KJ21	Luke	7	4	And when they came to Jesus they besought Him earnestly , saying that the one for whom He should do this was worthy ,
KJ21	Luke	7	5	“ for he loveth our nation , and he hath built us a synagogue. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	6	And Jesus went with them . And when He was not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to Him , saying unto Him , “ Lord , trouble not Thyself , for I am not worthy that Thou shouldest enter under my roof .
KJ21	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man set under authority , having under me soldiers . And I say unto one , ‘ Go ’ , and he goeth ; and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he cometh ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he doeth it. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard these things , He marveled at him , and turned about and said unto the people who followed Him , “ I say unto you , I have not found so great a faith , no , not in Israel. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	10	And those who were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole who had been sick .
KJ21	Luke	7	11	And it came to pass the day after , that He went into a city called Nain ; and many of His disciples went with Him , and many people .
KJ21	Luke	7	12	Now when He came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man being carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . And many people of the city were with her .
KJ21	Luke	7	13	And when the Lord saw her , He had compassion on her and said unto her , “ Weep not. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	14	And He came and touched the bier , and those who bore him stood still . And He said , “ Young man , I say unto thee , arise. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	15	And he that was dead sat up and began to speak . And He delivered him to his mother .
KJ21	Luke	7	16	And there came a fear on all , and they glorified God , saying , “ A great prophet is risen up among us ” ; and , “ God hath visited His people. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	17	And this report of Him went forth throughout all Judea and throughout all the region round about .
KJ21	Luke	7	18	And the disciples of John told him of all these things .
KJ21	Luke	7	19	And John , calling unto him two of his disciples , sent them to Jesus asking , “ Art thou He that should come , or look we for another ? ”
KJ21	Luke	7	20	When the men had come unto Him , they said , “ John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee , asking , ‘ Art thou He that should come , or look we for another ? ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	7	21	And in that same hour He cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits , and unto many who were blind He gave sight .
KJ21	Luke	7	22	Then Jesus answering said unto them , “ Go your way , and tell John what things ye have seen and heard : how the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , to the poor the Gospel is preached .
KJ21	Luke	7	23	And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in Me. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	24	And when the messengers of John had departed , He began to speak unto the people concerning John : “ What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
KJ21	Luke	7	25	But what went ye out to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they that are gorgeously appareled and live luxuriously are in kings ’ courts .
KJ21	Luke	7	26	But what went ye out to see ? A prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
KJ21	Luke	7	27	This is he , of whom it is written : ‘ Behold , I send My messenger before Thy face , who shall prepare Thy way before Thee. ’
KJ21	Luke	7	28	For I say unto you , among those that are born of women , there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist ; but he that is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	29	And all the people that heard Him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
KJ21	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves , being not baptized by him .
KJ21	Luke	7	31	And the Lord said , “ Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ? And to what are they like ?
KJ21	Luke	7	32	They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another and saying , ‘ We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept. ’
KJ21	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and ye say , ‘ He hath a devil. ’
KJ21	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man is come eating and drinking , and ye say , ‘ Behold , a gluttonous man and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners ! ’
KJ21	Luke	7	35	But wisdom is justified by all her children. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	36	And one of the Pharisees desired Him that He would eat with him . And He went into the Pharisee ’ s house and sat down to meat .
KJ21	Luke	7	37	And behold , a woman in the city , who was a sinner , when she learned that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee ’ s house , brought an alabaster box of ointment ,
KJ21	Luke	7	38	and stood at His feet behind Him weeping ; and began to wash His feet with tears and wiped them with the hair of her head , and kissed His feet and anointed them with the ointment .
KJ21	Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee who had bidden Him saw it , he spoke within himself , saying , “ This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is who toucheth him , for she is a sinner. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answering said unto him , “ Simon , I have something to say unto thee. ” And he said , “ Master , say on. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	41	“ There was a certain creditor that had two debtors . The one owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty .
KJ21	Luke	7	42	And when they had nothing to pay , he freely forgave them both . Tell me therefore , which of them will love him most ? ”
KJ21	Luke	7	43	Simon answered and said , “ I suppose that he to whom he forgave most . And He said unto him , “ Thou hast rightly judged. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	44	And He turned to the woman and said unto Simon , “ Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thine house : Thou gavest Me no water for My feet , but she hath washed My feet with tears and wiped them with the hair of her head .
KJ21	Luke	7	45	Thou gavest Me no kiss , but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss My feet .
KJ21	Luke	7	46	My head with oil thou didst not anoint , but this woman hath anointed My feet with ointment .
KJ21	Luke	7	47	Therefore I say unto thee , her sins , which are many , are forgiven , for she loved much . But to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	48	And He said unto her , “ Thy sins are forgiven. ”
KJ21	Luke	7	49	And those who sat at meat with Him began to say within themselves , “ Who is this that forgiveth sins also ? ”
KJ21	Luke	7	50	And He said to the woman , “ Thy faith hath saved thee . Go in peace . ”
KJ21	Luke	8	8	And other fell on good ground , and sprang up and bore fruit a hundredfold. ” And when He had said these things , He cried , “ He that hath ears to hear , let him hear ! ”
KJ21	Luke	8	2	and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities : Mary called Magdalene , out of whom went seven devils ,
KJ21	Luke	8	3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza , Herod ’ s steward , and Susanna , and many others who ministered unto Him from their substance .
KJ21	Luke	8	4	And when many people had gathered together and had come to Him out of every city , He spoke by a parable :
KJ21	Luke	8	5	“ A sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some fell by the wayside , and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
KJ21	Luke	8	6	And some fell upon a rock , and as soon as it had sprung up , it withered away because it lacked moisture .
KJ21	Luke	8	7	And some fell among thorns , and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it .
KJ21	Luke	8	9	And His disciples asked Him , saying , “ What might this parable mean ? ”
KJ21	Luke	8	10	And He said , “ Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God ; but to others in parables , that ‘ seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand. ’
KJ21	Luke	8	11	Now the parable is this : The seed is the Word of God .
KJ21	Luke	8	12	Those by the wayside are they that hear ; then cometh the devil and taketh away the Word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved .
KJ21	Luke	8	13	The seed on the rock are they that , when they hear , receive the Word with joy , but they have no root : they for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away .
KJ21	Luke	8	14	And that which fell among thorns are they that , when they have heard , go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
KJ21	Luke	8	15	But that on the good ground are they that , in an honest and good heart , having heard the Word , keep it and bring forth fruit with patience .
KJ21	Luke	8	16	“ No man , when he hath lighted a candle , covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed , but setteth it on a candlestick , that they that enter in may see the light .
KJ21	Luke	8	17	For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad .
KJ21	Luke	8	18	Take heed therefore how ye hear , for whosoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have. ”
KJ21	Luke	8	19	Then came to Him His mother and His brethren , and could not come near Him because of the crowd .
KJ21	Luke	8	20	And it was told to Him by certain ones , who said , “ Thy mother and thy brethren stand outside , desiring to see thee. ”
KJ21	Luke	8	21	And He answered and said unto them , “ My mother and My brethren are these who hear the Word of God , and do it. ”
KJ21	Luke	8	22	Now it came to pass on a certain day , that He went into a boat with His disciples . And He said unto them , “ Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. ” And they launched forth .
KJ21	Luke	8	23	But as they sailed , He fell asleep . And there came down a storm of wind on the lake , and they were filling with water and were in jeopardy .
KJ21	Luke	8	24	And they came to Him and awoke Him , saying , “ Master , Master , we perish ! ” Then He arose , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water ; and they ceased , and there was a calm .
KJ21	Luke	8	25	And He said unto them , “ Where is your faith ? ” And they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , “ What manner of man is this ? For He commandeth even the winds and the water , and they obey Him ! ”
KJ21	Luke	8	26	And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is opposite Galilee .
KJ21	Luke	8	27	And when He went forth to land , there met Him from the city a certain man who had had devils a long time , and wore no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
KJ21	Luke	8	28	When he saw Jesus , he cried out and fell down before Him , and with a loud voice said , “ What have I to do with Thee , Jesus , Thou Son of God Most High ? I beseech Thee , torment me not ! ”
KJ21	Luke	8	29	( For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For oftentimes it had caught him , and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters ; and he broke the bands and was driven by the devil into the wilderness . )
KJ21	Luke	8	30	And Jesus asked him , saying , “ What is thy name ? ” And he said , “ Legion , ” because many devils had entered into him .
KJ21	Luke	8	31	And they besought Him that He would not command them to go out into the deep .
KJ21	Luke	8	32	And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain . And they besought Him that He would suffer them to enter into them . And He suffered them .
KJ21	Luke	8	33	Then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine , and the herd ran violently down a steep slope into the lake and were choked .
KJ21	Luke	8	34	When those who fed them saw what was done , they fled and went and told it in the city and in the country .
KJ21	Luke	8	35	Then they went out to see what was done . And they came to Jesus , and found the man out of whom the devils had departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed , and in his right mind . And they were afraid .
KJ21	Luke	8	36	Those also who had seen it told them by what means he that had been possessed by the devils was healed .
KJ21	Luke	8	37	Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes and round about besought Him to depart from them , for they were taken with great fear . And He went up into the boat , and returned back again .
KJ21	Luke	8	38	Now the man out of whom the devils had departed besought Him that he might be with Him . But Jesus sent him away , saying ,
KJ21	Luke	8	39	“ Return to thine own house , and show what great things God hath done unto thee. ” And he went his way , and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done unto him .
KJ21	Luke	8	40	And it came to pass that when Jesus had returned , the people gladly received Him , for they were all waiting for Him .
KJ21	Luke	8	41	And behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue . And he fell down at Jesus ’ feet and besought Him that He would come into his house ,
KJ21	Luke	8	42	for he had one daughter only , about twelve years of age , and she lay dying . But as He went , the people thronged Him .
KJ21	Luke	8	43	And a woman having an issue of blood for twelve years , who had spent all her living upon physicians but could not be healed by any ,
KJ21	Luke	8	44	came behind Him and touched the border of His garment ; and immediately her issue of blood was stanched .
KJ21	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , “ Who touched Me ? ” When all denied it , Peter and those who were with him said , “ Master , the multitudes throng Thee and press Thee , and sayest Thou , ‘ Who touched Me ? ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	8	46	And Jesus said , “ Somebody hath touched Me , for I perceive that virtue is gone out of Me. ”
KJ21	Luke	8	47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before Him , she declared unto Him before all the people for what cause she had touched Him , and how she was healed immediately .
KJ21	Luke	8	48	And He said unto her , “ Daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . Go in peace. ”
KJ21	Luke	8	49	While He yet spoke , there came one from the ruler of the synagogue ’ s house , saying to him , “ Thy daughter is dead . Trouble not the Master. ”
KJ21	Luke	8	50	But when Jesus heard it , He answered him , saying , “ Fear not ; believe only , and she shall be made whole. ”
KJ21	Luke	8	51	And when He came into the house , He suffered no man to go in save Peter and James and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
KJ21	Luke	8	52	And all wept and bewailed her , but He said , “ Weep not ; she is not dead , but sleepeth. ”
KJ21	Luke	8	53	And they laughed Him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
KJ21	Luke	8	54	And He put them all out , and took her by the hand and called , saying , “ Maid , arise. ”
KJ21	Luke	8	55	And her spirit came again , and she arose straightway , and He commanded to give her meat .
KJ21	Luke	8	56	And her parents were astonished , but He charged them that they should tell no man what was done .
KJ21	Luke	9	9	And Herod said , “ John have I beheaded , but who is this of whom I hear such things ? ” And he desired to see Him .
KJ21	Luke	9	2	And He sent them to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick .
KJ21	Luke	9	3	And He said unto them , “ Take nothing for your journey , neither staves , nor pack , neither bread , neither money ; neither have two coats apiece .
KJ21	Luke	9	4	And whatsoever house ye enter into , there abide and thence depart .
KJ21	Luke	9	5	And whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	6	And they departed and went through the towns , preaching the Gospel and healing everywhere .
KJ21	Luke	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that had been done by Him . And he was perplexed , because it was said by some that John was risen from the dead ;
KJ21	Luke	9	8	and by some that Elijah had appeared , and by others that one of the old prophets was risen again .
KJ21	Luke	9	10	And the apostles , when they had returned , told Him all that they had done . And He took them and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
KJ21	Luke	9	11	And the people , when they learned of it , followed Him . And He received them and spoke unto them of the Kingdom of God , and healed those who had need of healing .
KJ21	Luke	9	12	And when the day began to wear away , then came the twelve and said unto Him , “ Send the multitude away , that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals , for we are here in a desert place .
KJ21	Luke	9	13	But He said unto them , “ Give ye them to eat. ” And they said , “ We have no more than five loaves and two fishes , unless we should go and buy meat for all these people. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	14	For they were about five thousand men . And He said to His disciples , “ Make them sit down by fifties in a company. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	15	And they did so , and made them all sit down .
KJ21	Luke	9	16	Then He took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to Heaven , He blessed them and broke , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
KJ21	Luke	9	17	And they ate and were all filled , and there were taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
KJ21	Luke	9	18	And it came to pass as He was alone praying , His disciples were with Him , and He asked them , saying , “ Who say the people that I am ? ”
KJ21	Luke	9	19	They answering said , “ John the Baptist ; but some say Elijah , and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	20	He said to them , “ But who say ye that I am ? ” Peter answering said , “ The Christ of God ! ”
KJ21	Luke	9	21	And He strictly charged them and commanded them to tell no man this thing ,
KJ21	Luke	9	22	saying , “ The Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and scribes , and be slain and be raised the third day. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	23	And He said to them all , “ If any man will come after Me , let him deny himself and take up his cross daily , and follow Me .
KJ21	Luke	9	24	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever will lose his life for My sake , the same shall save it .
KJ21	Luke	9	25	For what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world , and lose himself or be cast away ?
KJ21	Luke	9	26	For whosoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words , of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He shall come in His own glory and in His Father ’ s and of the holy angels .
KJ21	Luke	9	27	But I tell you in truth , there are some standing here that shall not taste of death till they see the Kingdom of God. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	28	And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings , He took Peter and John and James , and went up onto a mountain to pray .
KJ21	Luke	9	29	And as He prayed , the appearance of His countenance was altered , and His raiment was white and glistening .
KJ21	Luke	9	30	And behold , there talked with Him two men , who were Moses and Elijah ,
KJ21	Luke	9	31	who appeared in glory and spoke of His decease which He should accomplish at Jerusalem .
KJ21	Luke	9	32	But Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep . And when they were awake , they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him .
KJ21	Luke	9	33	And it came to pass as they departed from Him , Peter said unto Jesus , “ Master , it is good for us to be here ; and let us make three tabernacles : one for Thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah ” — not knowing what he was saying .
KJ21	Luke	9	34	While he thus spoke , there came a cloud and overshadowed them , and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud .
KJ21	Luke	9	35	And there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , “ This Is My Beloved Son . Hear Him ! ”
KJ21	Luke	9	36	And when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . And they kept silent , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
KJ21	Luke	9	37	And it came to pass that on the next day , when they had come down from the hill , many people met Him .
KJ21	Luke	9	38	And behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , “ Master , I beseech Thee , look upon my son , for he is mine only child .
KJ21	Luke	9	39	And lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him so that he foameth again , and bruising him , hardly departeth from him .
KJ21	Luke	9	40	And I besought Thy disciples to cast him out , and they could not. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	41	And Jesus answering said , “ O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	42	And as he was yet coming , the devil threw him down and tore him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
KJ21	Luke	9	43	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they wondered every one at all the things which Jesus did , He said unto His disciples ,
KJ21	Luke	9	44	“ Let these sayings sink down into your ears , for the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	45	But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not ; and they were afraid to ask Him about that saying .
KJ21	Luke	9	46	Then there arose a reasoning among them as to which of them should be greatest .
KJ21	Luke	9	47	And Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child and set him by Him ,
KJ21	Luke	9	48	and said unto them , “ Whosoever shall receive this child in My name receiveth Me ; and whosoever shall receive Me receiveth Him that sent Me . For he that is least among you all , the same shall be great. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	49	And John answered and said , “ Master , we saw one casting out devils in Thy name , and we forbad him , because he followeth not with us. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	50	And Jesus said unto him , “ Forbid him not ; for he that is not against us , is for us. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	51	And it came to pass , when the time had come that He should be received up , He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem ,
KJ21	Luke	9	52	and He sent messengers before His face . And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for Him .
KJ21	Luke	9	53	But they did not receive Him , because His face was set as though He would go to Jerusalem .
KJ21	Luke	9	54	And when His disciples James and John saw this , they said , “ Lord , wilt Thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them , even as Elijah did ? ”
KJ21	Luke	9	55	But He turned and rebuked them and said , “ Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
KJ21	Luke	9	56	For the Son of Man is not come to destroy men ’ s lives , but to save them. ” And they went to another village .
KJ21	Luke	9	57	And it came to pass that , as they went along the way , a certain man said unto Him , “ Lord , I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	58	And Jesus said unto him , “ Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man hath nowhere to lay His head. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	59	And He said unto another , “ Follow Me. ” But he said , “ Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	60	Jesus said unto him , “ Let the dead bury their dead , but go thou and preach the Kingdom of God. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	61	And another also said , “ Lord , I will follow Thee , but let me first go bid those farewell who are at home at my house. ”
KJ21	Luke	9	62	And Jesus said unto him , “ No man , having put his hand to the plow and looking back , is fit for the Kingdom of God . ”
KJ21	Luke	10	10	But into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same and say ,
KJ21	Luke	10	2	Therefore He said unto them , “ The harvest truly is great , but the laborers are few ; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that He would send forth laborers into His harvest .
KJ21	Luke	10	3	Go your ways ; behold , I send you forth as lambs among wolves ,
KJ21	Luke	10	4	carrying neither purse , nor pack , nor shoes ; and salute no man by the way .
KJ21	Luke	10	5	And into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , ‘ Peace be to this house. ’
KJ21	Luke	10	6	And if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it ; if not , it shall return to you again .
KJ21	Luke	10	7	And in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give , for the laborer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house .
KJ21	Luke	10	8	And into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you .
KJ21	Luke	10	9	And heal the sick that are therein and say unto them , ‘ The Kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. ’
KJ21	Luke	10	11	‘ Even the very dust of your city , which cleaveth on us , we do wipe off against you . Notwithstanding , be ye sure of this : that the Kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. ’
KJ21	Luke	10	12	But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city .
KJ21	Luke	10	13	“ Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! Woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which have been done in you , they would have a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
KJ21	Luke	10	14	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment than for you .
KJ21	Luke	10	15	And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shall be thrust down to hell .
KJ21	Luke	10	16	He that heareth you heareth Me , and he that despiseth you despiseth Me , and he that despiseth Me despiseth Him that sent Me. ”
KJ21	Luke	10	17	And the seventy returned again with joy , saying , “ Lord , even the devils are subject unto us through Thy name. ”
KJ21	Luke	10	18	And He said unto them , “ I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven .
KJ21	Luke	10	19	Behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy , and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
KJ21	Luke	10	20	Notwithstanding , in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rather rejoice because your names are written in Heaven. ”
KJ21	Luke	10	21	In that hour Jesus rejoiced in Spirit and said , “ I thank Thee , O Father , Lord of Heaven and earth , that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes . Even so , Father , for so it seemed good in Thy sight .
KJ21	Luke	10	22	All things are delivered to Me by My Father , and no man knoweth who the Son is , but the Father ; and who the Father is , but the Son and he to whom the Son will reveal Him. ”
KJ21	Luke	10	23	And He turned unto His disciples and said privately , “ Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see .
KJ21	Luke	10	24	For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them. ”
KJ21	Luke	10	25	And behold , a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him , saying , “ Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
KJ21	Luke	10	26	He said unto him , “ What is written in the law ? How readest thou ? ”
KJ21	Luke	10	27	And he answering said , “ ‘ Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind , and thy neighbor as thyself. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	10	28	And He said unto him , “ Thou hast answered right ; this do , and thou shalt live. ”
KJ21	Luke	10	29	But he , wanting to justify himself , said unto Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
KJ21	Luke	10	30	And Jesus answering said , “ A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves , who stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed , leaving him half dead .
KJ21	Luke	10	31	And by chance there came down a certain priest that way . And when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
KJ21	Luke	10	32	And likewise a Levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him and passed by on the other side .
KJ21	Luke	10	33	But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came to where he was . And when he saw him he had compassion on him ,
KJ21	Luke	10	34	and went to him and bound up his wounds , pouring on oil and wine ; and he set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn and took care of him .
KJ21	Luke	10	35	And on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host and said unto him , ‘ Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when I come again I will repay thee. ’
KJ21	Luke	10	36	Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves ? ”
KJ21	Luke	10	37	And he said , “ He that showed mercy on him. ” Then said Jesus unto him , “ Go and do thou likewise. ”
KJ21	Luke	10	38	Now it came to pass , as they went , that He entered into a certain village ; and a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house .
KJ21	Luke	10	39	And she had a sister called Mary , who also sat at Jesus ’ feet and heard His Word .
KJ21	Luke	10	40	But Martha was encumbered with much serving , and came to Him and said , “ Lord , dost Thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? Bid her therefore that she help me. ”
KJ21	Luke	10	41	And Jesus answered and said unto her , “ Martha , Martha , thou art anxious and troubled about many things .
KJ21	Luke	10	42	But one thing is needful , and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her . ”
KJ21	Luke	11	11	“ If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? Or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
KJ21	Luke	11	2	And He said unto them , “ When ye pray , say : Our Father who art in Heaven , hallowed be Thy name . Thy Kingdom come . Thy will be done , as in Heaven , so on earth .
KJ21	Luke	11	3	Give us day by day our daily bread .
KJ21	Luke	11	4	And forgive us our sins , for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil. ”
KJ21	Luke	11	5	And He said unto them , “ Which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves ,
KJ21	Luke	11	6	for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ’ ;
KJ21	Luke	11	7	and he from within shall answer and say , ‘ Trouble me not ; the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed , and I can not rise and give to thee ’ ?
KJ21	Luke	11	8	I say unto you , though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
KJ21	Luke	11	9	And I say unto you : ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
KJ21	Luke	11	10	For every one that asketh receiveth , and he that seeketh findeth , and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
KJ21	Luke	11	12	Or if he shall ask for an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ?
KJ21	Luke	11	13	If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask Him ? ”
KJ21	Luke	11	14	And He was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . And it came to pass when the devil had gone out , the dumb one spoke ; and the people wondered .
KJ21	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , “ He casteth out devils through Beelzebub , the chief of the devils. ”
KJ21	Luke	11	16	And others , testing Him , sought from Him a sign from Heaven .
KJ21	Luke	11	17	But He , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
KJ21	Luke	11	18	If Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand — because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub ?
KJ21	Luke	11	19	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore shall they be your judges .
KJ21	Luke	11	20	But if I with the finger of God cast out devils , doubt not the Kingdom of God is come upon you .
KJ21	Luke	11	21	When a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace .
KJ21	Luke	11	22	But when one stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
KJ21	Luke	11	23	He that is not with Me , is against Me ; and he that gathereth not with Me , scattereth .
KJ21	Luke	11	24	“ When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , ‘ I will return unto my house whence I came out. ’
KJ21	Luke	11	25	And when he cometh , he findeth it swept and garnished .
KJ21	Luke	11	26	Then he goeth and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there ; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. ”
KJ21	Luke	11	27	And it came to pass , as He spoke these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto Him , “ Blessed is the womb that bore Thee and the breasts which Thou hast sucked. ”
KJ21	Luke	11	28	But He said , “ Yea rather , blessed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it. ”
KJ21	Luke	11	29	And when the people were gathered thick together , He began to say , “ This is an evil generation . They seek a sign , and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of Jonah the prophet .
KJ21	Luke	11	30	For as Jonah was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of Man be to this generation .
KJ21	Luke	11	31	The queen of the south shall rise up in the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them , for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
KJ21	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , a greater than Jonah is here .
KJ21	Luke	11	33	“ No man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they that come in may see the light .
KJ21	Luke	11	34	The light of the body is the eye . Therefore , when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light . But when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
KJ21	Luke	11	35	Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
KJ21	Luke	11	36	If thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light. ”
KJ21	Luke	11	37	And as He spoke , a certain Pharisee besought Him to dine with him . And He went in and sat down to meat .
KJ21	Luke	11	38	And when the Pharisee saw it , he marveled that He had not first washed before dinner .
KJ21	Luke	11	39	And the Lord said unto him , “ Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter , but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
KJ21	Luke	11	40	Ye fools ! Did not He that made that which is without , make that which is within also ?
KJ21	Luke	11	41	But rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and behold , all things are clean unto you .
KJ21	Luke	11	42	“ But woe unto you , Pharisees ! For ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God . These ought ye to have done , and not left the other undone .
KJ21	Luke	11	43	Woe unto you , Pharisees ! For ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets .
KJ21	Luke	11	44	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them. ”
KJ21	Luke	11	45	Then answered one of the lawyers and said unto Him , “ Master , thus saying , thou reproachest us also. ”
KJ21	Luke	11	46	And He said , “ Woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! For ye laden men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
KJ21	Luke	11	47	Woe unto you ! For ye build the sepulchers of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
KJ21	Luke	11	48	Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers ; for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchers .
KJ21	Luke	11	49	“ Therefore also said the wisdom of God : ‘ I will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they shall slay and persecute , ’
KJ21	Luke	11	50	that the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ,
KJ21	Luke	11	51	from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zechariah , who perished between the altar and the temple . Verily I say unto you , it shall be required of this generation .
KJ21	Luke	11	52	Woe unto you , lawyers ! For ye have taken away the key of knowledge . Ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in , ye hindered. ”
KJ21	Luke	11	53	And as He said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to press Him vehemently and to provoke Him to speak of many things ,
KJ21	Luke	11	54	lying in wait for Him and seeking to catch something out of His mouth , that they might accuse Him .
KJ21	Luke	12	12	For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say. ”
KJ21	Luke	12	2	For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed , neither hid that shall not be known .
KJ21	Luke	12	3	Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
KJ21	Luke	12	4	“ And I say unto you , My friends , be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
KJ21	Luke	12	5	But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : Fear Him that , after He hath killed , hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , fear Him !
KJ21	Luke	12	6	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings , and not one of them is forgotten before God ?
KJ21	Luke	12	7	But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
KJ21	Luke	12	8	“ Also I say unto you , whosoever shall confess Me before men , him shall the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God .
KJ21	Luke	12	9	But he that denieth Me before men shall be denied before the angels of God .
KJ21	Luke	12	10	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man , it shall be forgiven him ; but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven .
KJ21	Luke	12	11	“ And when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say .
KJ21	Luke	12	13	And one of the company said unto Him , “ Master , speak to my brother , that he divide the inheritance with me. ”
KJ21	Luke	12	14	And He said unto him , “ Man , who made Me a judge or a divider over you ? ”
KJ21	Luke	12	15	And He said unto them , “ Take heed and beware of covetousness , for a man ’ s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. ”
KJ21	Luke	12	16	And He spoke a parable unto them , saying , “ The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully .
KJ21	Luke	12	17	And he thought within himself , saying , ‘ What shall I do , because I have no room to store my fruits ? ’
KJ21	Luke	12	18	And he said , ‘ This will I do . I will pull down my barns and build greater , and there will I store all my fruits and my goods .
KJ21	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years . Take thine ease ; eat , drink , and be merry. ’
KJ21	Luke	12	20	But God said unto him , ‘ Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee . Then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ? ’
KJ21	Luke	12	21	So is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God. ”
KJ21	Luke	12	22	And He said unto His disciples , “ Therefore I say unto you , take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on .
KJ21	Luke	12	23	The life is more than meat , and the body is more than raiment .
KJ21	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap , they neither have storehouse nor barn , and God feedeth them . How much more are ye better than the fowls ?
KJ21	Luke	12	25	And which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one cubit ?
KJ21	Luke	12	26	If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
KJ21	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies , how they grow : they toil not , they spin not ; and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
KJ21	Luke	12	28	If then God so clothe the grass , which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven , how much more will He clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
KJ21	Luke	12	29	“ And seek ye not what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubting mind .
KJ21	Luke	12	30	For all these things do the nations of the world seek after , and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
KJ21	Luke	12	31	But rather seek ye the Kingdom of God , and all these things shall be added unto you .
KJ21	Luke	12	32	“ Fear not , little flock , for it is your Father ’ s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom .
KJ21	Luke	12	33	Sell what ye have , and give alms . Provide yourselves purses which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
KJ21	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
KJ21	Luke	12	35	“ Let your loins be girded about and your lights burning ;
KJ21	Luke	12	36	and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding , that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
KJ21	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those servants whom the lord , when he cometh , shall find watching . Verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
KJ21	Luke	12	38	And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch and find them so , blessed are those servants .
KJ21	Luke	12	39	And this know , that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken into .
KJ21	Luke	12	40	Be ye therefore ready also , for the Son of Man cometh at an hour when ye think not. ”
KJ21	Luke	12	41	Then Peter said unto Him , “ Lord , speakest Thou this parable unto us , or even to all ? ”
KJ21	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , “ Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
KJ21	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that servant whom his lord , when he cometh , shall find so doing .
KJ21	Luke	12	44	In truth I say unto you , that he will make him ruler over all that he hath .
KJ21	Luke	12	45	But if that servant say in his heart , ‘ My lord delayeth his coming , ’ and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink and be drunken ,
KJ21	Luke	12	46	the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him asunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers .
KJ21	Luke	12	47	And that servant , who knew his lord ’ s will and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
KJ21	Luke	12	48	But he that knew not and committed things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . For unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall much be required ; and to whom men have committed much , of him they will ask the more .
KJ21	Luke	12	49	“ I am come to send fire on the earth , and what will I , if it be already kindled ?
KJ21	Luke	12	50	But I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how I am straitened till it be accomplished !
KJ21	Luke	12	51	Suppose ye that I have come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , nay , but rather division .
KJ21	Luke	12	52	For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided : three against two , and two against three .
KJ21	Luke	12	53	The father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother ; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. ”
KJ21	Luke	12	54	And He said also to the people , “ When ye see a cloud rise out of the west , straightway ye say , ‘ There cometh a shower ’ ; and so it is .
KJ21	Luke	12	55	And when ye see the south wind blow , ye say , ‘ There will be heat ’ ; and it cometh to pass .
KJ21	Luke	12	56	Ye hypocrites ! Ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth , but how is it that ye do not discern this time ?
KJ21	Luke	12	57	“ Yea , and why even for yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
KJ21	Luke	12	58	When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate , as thou art on the way , be diligent that thou mayest be delivered from him , lest he hale thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison .
KJ21	Luke	12	59	I tell thee , thou shall not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite . ”
KJ21	Luke	13	13	And He laid His hands on her , and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God .
KJ21	Luke	13	2	And Jesus answering said unto them , “ Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the other Galileans , because they suffered such things ?
KJ21	Luke	13	3	I tell you , nay ; but unless ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
KJ21	Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen upon whom the tower of Siloam fell and slew them , think ye that they were sinners above all other men that dwelt in Jerusalem ?
KJ21	Luke	13	5	I tell you , nay ; but unless ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish. ”
KJ21	Luke	13	6	He spoke also this parable : “ A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came and sought fruit thereon , and found none .
KJ21	Luke	13	7	Then said he unto the keeper of his vineyard , ‘ Behold , these three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none . Cut it down . Why cumbereth it the ground ? ’
KJ21	Luke	13	8	And he answering said unto him , ‘ Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig around it and dung it .
KJ21	Luke	13	9	And if it bear fruit , well ; and if not , then after that thou shalt cut it down. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	13	10	And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
KJ21	Luke	13	11	And behold , there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years , and was bowed down and could in no way lift herself up .
KJ21	Luke	13	12	And when Jesus saw her , He called her to Him and said unto her , “ Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity. ”
KJ21	Luke	13	14	But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath day , and said unto the people , “ There are six days in which men ought to work ; in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the Sabbath day. ”
KJ21	Luke	13	15	The Lord then answered him and said , “ Thou hypocrite ! Doth not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering ?
KJ21	Luke	13	16	And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day ? ”
KJ21	Luke	13	17	And when He had said these things , all His adversaries were ashamed ; and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him .
KJ21	Luke	13	18	Then said He , “ Unto what is the Kingdom of God like ? And unto what shall I compare it ?
KJ21	Luke	13	19	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and cast into his garden ; and it grew and waxed a great tree , and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. ”
KJ21	Luke	13	20	And again He said , “ Unto what shall I liken the Kingdom of God ?
KJ21	Luke	13	21	It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened. ”
KJ21	Luke	13	22	And He went through the cities and villages , teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem .
KJ21	Luke	13	23	Then said one unto Him , “ Lord , are there few who are saved ? ” And He said unto them ,
KJ21	Luke	13	24	“ Strive to enter in at the strait gate , for many , I say unto you , will seek to enter in and shall not be able .
KJ21	Luke	13	25	When once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut the door , and ye begin to stand outside and to knock at the door , saying , ‘ Lord , Lord , open unto us , ’ and He shall answer and say unto you , ‘ I know you not from whence ye are , ’
KJ21	Luke	13	26	then shall ye begin to say , ‘ We have eaten and drunk in Thy presence , and Thou hast taught in our streets. ’
KJ21	Luke	13	27	But He shall say , ‘ I tell you , I know you not from whence ye are . Depart from Me , all ye workers of iniquity. ’
KJ21	Luke	13	28	There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God , and you yourselves thrust out .
KJ21	Luke	13	29	And they shall come from the east and from the west , and from the north and from the south , and shall sit down in the Kingdom of God .
KJ21	Luke	13	30	And behold , there are last which shall be first , and there are first which shall be last. ”
KJ21	Luke	13	31	The same day there came certain of the Pharisees , saying unto Him , “ Get thee out and depart hence , for Herod will kill thee. ”
KJ21	Luke	13	32	And He said unto them , “ Go ye and tell that fox , ‘ Behold , I cast out devils and I do cures today and tomorrow , and the third day I shall be perfected. ’
KJ21	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following , for it can not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem .
KJ21	Luke	13	34	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings , and ye would not !
KJ21	Luke	13	35	Behold , your house is left unto you desolate ; and verily I say unto you , ye shall not see Me until the time come when ye shall say , ‘ Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord . ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	14	14	and thou shalt be blessed , for they can not recompense thee . For thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. ”
KJ21	Luke	14	2	And behold , there was a certain man before Him who had the dropsy .
KJ21	Luke	14	3	And Jesus answering , spoke unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day ? ”
KJ21	Luke	14	4	But they held their peace . And He took him and healed him , and let him go .
KJ21	Luke	14	5	And He answered them , saying , “ Which of you shall have an ox or an ass fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day ? ”
KJ21	Luke	14	6	And again they could not answer Him concerning these things .
KJ21	Luke	14	7	And He put forth a parable to those who were bidden , when He marked how they chose out the chief places , saying unto them ,
KJ21	Luke	14	8	“ When thou art bidden by any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest place , lest a more honorable man than thou be bidden by him ,
KJ21	Luke	14	9	and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee , ‘ Give this man thy place , ’ and thou begin with shame to take the lowest place .
KJ21	Luke	14	10	But when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest place , that when he that bade thee cometh , he may say unto thee , ‘ Friend , go up higher. ’ Then shalt thou have honor in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee .
KJ21	Luke	14	11	For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased , and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. ”
KJ21	Luke	14	12	Then said He also to him who bade Him , “ When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbors , lest they also bid thee again and a recompense be made to thee .
KJ21	Luke	14	13	But when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind ,
KJ21	Luke	14	15	And when one of those who sat at meat with Him heard these things , he said unto Him , “ Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God. ”
KJ21	Luke	14	16	Then Jesus said unto him , “ A certain man made a great supper and bade many .
KJ21	Luke	14	17	And he sent his servant at suppertime to say to them that were bidden , ‘ Come , for all things are now ready. ’
KJ21	Luke	14	18	And they all with one accord began to make excuses . The first said unto him , ‘ I have bought a piece of ground , and I need to go and see it . I pray thee have me excused. ’
KJ21	Luke	14	19	And another said , ‘ I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to test them . I pray thee have me excused. ’
KJ21	Luke	14	20	And another said , ‘ I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come. ’
KJ21	Luke	14	21	So that servant came and showed his lord these things . Then the master of the house , being angry , said to his servant , ‘ Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind. ’
KJ21	Luke	14	22	And the servant said , ‘ Lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room. ’
KJ21	Luke	14	23	And the lord said unto the servant , ‘ Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
KJ21	Luke	14	24	For I say unto you that none of those men who were bidden shall taste of my supper. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	14	25	And there went great multitudes with Him , and He turned and said unto them ,
KJ21	Luke	14	26	“ If any man come to Me and hate not his father and mother , and wife and children , and brethren and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he can not be My disciple .
KJ21	Luke	14	27	And whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after Me can not be My disciple .
KJ21	Luke	14	28	For which of you , intending to build a tower , sitteth not down first and counteth the cost , whether he have sufficient to finish it ?
KJ21	Luke	14	29	Lest it may happen , after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it , all who behold it begin to mock him ,
KJ21	Luke	14	30	saying , ‘ This man began to build and was not able to finish. ’
KJ21	Luke	14	31	Or what king , going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ?
KJ21	Luke	14	32	Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an envoy and desireth conditions of peace .
KJ21	Luke	14	33	So likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he can not be My disciple .
KJ21	Luke	14	34	“ Salt is good ; but if the salt have lost his savor , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
KJ21	Luke	14	35	It is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . ”
KJ21	Luke	15	15	And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country , who sent him into his fields to feed swine .
KJ21	Luke	15	2	And the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , “ This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them. ”
KJ21	Luke	15	3	And He spoke this parable unto them , saying ,
KJ21	Luke	15	4	“ What man of you , having a hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost until he find it ?
KJ21	Luke	15	5	And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
KJ21	Luke	15	6	And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbors , saying unto them , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost ! ’
KJ21	Luke	15	7	I say unto you that likewise more joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth , than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance .
KJ21	Luke	15	8	“ Or what woman , having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it ?
KJ21	Luke	15	9	And when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbors together , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found the piece which I had lost ! ’
KJ21	Luke	15	10	Likewise I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. ”
KJ21	Luke	15	11	And He said , “ A certain man had two sons .
KJ21	Luke	15	12	And the younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. ’ And he divided unto them his estate .
KJ21	Luke	15	13	And not many days after , the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
KJ21	Luke	15	14	And when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land , and he began to be in want .
KJ21	Luke	15	16	And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine ate , and no man gave unto him .
KJ21	Luke	15	17	And when he came to himself , he said , ‘ How many hired servants of my father ’ s have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
KJ21	Luke	15	18	I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him , “ Father , I have sinned against Heaven and before thee ,
KJ21	Luke	15	19	and am no more worthy to be called thy son . Make me as one of thy hired servants. ” ’
KJ21	Luke	15	20	And he arose and came to his father . But when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him and had compassion , and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him .
KJ21	Luke	15	21	And the son said unto him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against Heaven and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son. ’
KJ21	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his servants , ‘ Bring forth the best robe and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet .
KJ21	Luke	15	23	And bring hither the fatted calf and kill it , and let us eat and be merry ;
KJ21	Luke	15	24	for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found. ’ And they began to be merry .
KJ21	Luke	15	25	“ Now his elder son was in the field ; and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing .
KJ21	Luke	15	26	And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant .
KJ21	Luke	15	27	And he said unto him , ‘ Thy brother is come , and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound. ’
KJ21	Luke	15	28	And he was angry and would not go in ; therefore came his father out and entreated him .
KJ21	Luke	15	29	And he answering said to his father , ‘ Lo , these many years have I served thee , neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment ; and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends .
KJ21	Luke	15	30	But as soon as this thy son was come who hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. ’
KJ21	Luke	15	31	And he said unto him , ‘ Son , thou art ever with me , and all that I have is thine .
KJ21	Luke	15	32	It was meet that we should make merry and be glad ; for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found . ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	16	16	“ The Law and the Prophets were until John . Since that time the Kingdom of God is preached , and every man presseth into it .
KJ21	Luke	16	2	And he called him and said unto him , ‘ How is it that I hear this of thee ? Give an account of thy stewardship , for thou mayest be no longer steward. ’
KJ21	Luke	16	3	Then the steward said within himself , ‘ What shall I do ? For my lord taketh away from me the stewardship . I can not dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
KJ21	Luke	16	4	I am resolved what to do , that when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses. ’
KJ21	Luke	16	5	So he called every one of his lord ’ s debtors unto him , and said unto the first , ‘ How much owest thou unto my lord ? ’
KJ21	Luke	16	6	And he said , ‘ A hundred measures of oil. ’ And he said to him , ‘ Take thy bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty. ’
KJ21	Luke	16	7	Then said he to another , ‘ And how much owest thou ? ’ And he said , ‘ A hundred measures of wheat. ’ And he said unto him , ‘ Take thy bill and write fourscore. ’
KJ21	Luke	16	8	And the lord commended the unjust steward , because he had done wisely ; for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light .
KJ21	Luke	16	9	And I say unto you , make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness , that when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations .
KJ21	Luke	16	10	He that is faithful in that which is least , is faithful also in much ; and he that is unjust in the least , is unjust also in much .
KJ21	Luke	16	11	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
KJ21	Luke	16	12	And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man ’ s , who shall give you that which is your own ?
KJ21	Luke	16	13	No servant can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or else he will hold to the one and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon. ”
KJ21	Luke	16	14	And the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things , and they derided Him .
KJ21	Luke	16	15	And He said unto them , “ Ye are they who justify yourselves before men , but God knoweth your hearts . For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God .
KJ21	Luke	16	17	And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than one tittle of the law to fail .
KJ21	Luke	16	18	“ Whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery ; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery .
KJ21	Luke	16	19	“ There was a certain rich man , who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day .
KJ21	Luke	16	20	And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , who was laid at his gate , full of sores
KJ21	Luke	16	21	and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man ’ s table . Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
KJ21	Luke	16	22	And it came to pass that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels into Abraham ’ s bosom . The rich man also died , and was buried .
KJ21	Luke	16	23	And in hell , being in torment , he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom .
KJ21	Luke	16	24	And he cried and said , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame. ’
KJ21	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , ‘ Son , remember that thou in thy lifetime received thy good things , and likewise Lazarus evil things ; but now he is comforted and thou art tormented .
KJ21	Luke	16	26	And besides all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed , so that they who would pass from here to you can not ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from there. ’
KJ21	Luke	16	27	Then he said , ‘ I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father ’ s house ,
KJ21	Luke	16	28	for I have five brethren , that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment. ’
KJ21	Luke	16	29	Abraham said unto him , ‘ They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them. ’
KJ21	Luke	16	30	And he said , ‘ Nay , father Abraham ; but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent. ’
KJ21	Luke	16	31	And Abraham said unto him , ‘ If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead . ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	17	17	And Jesus answering said , “ Were there not ten cleansed ? But where are the nine ?
KJ21	Luke	17	2	It were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck and he cast into the sea , than that he should cause one of these little ones to fall .
KJ21	Luke	17	3	“ Take heed to yourselves . If thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
KJ21	Luke	17	4	And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , ‘ I repent , ’ thou shalt forgive him. ”
KJ21	Luke	17	5	And the apostles said unto the Lord , “ Increase our faith. ”
KJ21	Luke	17	6	And the Lord said , “ If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye might say unto this sycamine tree , ‘ Be thou plucked up by the root , and be thou planted in the sea , ’ and it should obey you .
KJ21	Luke	17	7	But which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field , ‘ Go and sit down to meat ’ ?
KJ21	Luke	17	8	But will you not rather say unto him , ‘ Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself and serve me until I have eaten and drunk , and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ’ ?
KJ21	Luke	17	9	Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ? I think not !
KJ21	Luke	17	10	So likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , ‘ We are unprofitable servants . We have done that which was our duty to do. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	17	11	And it came to pass as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
KJ21	Luke	17	12	And as He entered into a certain village , there met Him ten men who were lepers , who stood afar off .
KJ21	Luke	17	13	And they lifted up their voices and said , “ Jesus , Master , have mercy on us ! ”
KJ21	Luke	17	14	And when He saw them , He said unto them , “ Go , show yourselves unto the priests. ” And it came to pass that as they went , they were cleansed .
KJ21	Luke	17	15	And one of them when he saw that he was healed , turned back and with a loud voice glorified God ,
KJ21	Luke	17	16	and fell down on his face at His feet , giving Him thanks ; and he was a Samaritan .
KJ21	Luke	17	18	There are none found that returned to give glory to God , save this stranger. ”
KJ21	Luke	17	19	And He said unto him , “ Arise ; go thy way . Thy faith hath made thee whole. ”
KJ21	Luke	17	20	And when the Pharisees had demanded of Him when the Kingdom of God should come , He answered them and said , “ The Kingdom of God cometh not with outward show .
KJ21	Luke	17	21	Neither shall they say , ‘ Lo , it is here ! ’ or ‘ Lo , it is there ! ’ For behold , the Kingdom of God is within you. ”
KJ21	Luke	17	22	And He said unto the disciples , “ The days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and ye shall not see it .
KJ21	Luke	17	23	And they shall say to you , ‘ See , here ! ’ or ‘ See , there ! ’ Go not after them , nor follow them .
KJ21	Luke	17	24	For as the lightning that lighteneth one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven , so shall also the Son of Man be in His day .
KJ21	Luke	17	25	But first must He suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
KJ21	Luke	17	26	And as it was in the days of Noah , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man :
KJ21	Luke	17	27	They ate , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
KJ21	Luke	17	28	“ Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot : They ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ;
KJ21	Luke	17	29	but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom , it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all .
KJ21	Luke	17	30	“ Even thus shall it be in the Day when the Son of Man is revealed .
KJ21	Luke	17	31	In that Day , he that shall be upon the housetop , and his goods in the house , let him not come down to take them away . And he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
KJ21	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot ’ s wife .
KJ21	Luke	17	33	Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it , and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
KJ21	Luke	17	34	I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
KJ21	Luke	17	35	Two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
KJ21	Luke	17	36	Two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left. ”
KJ21	Luke	17	37	And they answered and said unto Him , “ Where , Lord ? ” And He said unto them , “ Wheresoever the body is , thither will the eagles be gathered together . ”
KJ21	Luke	18	18	And a certain ruler asked Him , saying , “ Good Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
KJ21	Luke	18	2	saying , “ There was in a city a judge who feared not God , neither regarded man .
KJ21	Luke	18	3	And there was a widow in that city , and she came unto him , saying , ‘ Avenge me on mine adversary. ’
KJ21	Luke	18	4	And for a while he would not , but afterward he said within himself , ‘ Though I fear not God nor regard man ,
KJ21	Luke	18	5	yet because this widow troubleth me I will avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said , “ Hear what the unjust judge saith .
KJ21	Luke	18	7	And shall not God avenge His own elect , who cry day and night unto Him , though He bear long with them ?
KJ21	Luke	18	8	I tell you that He will avenge them speedily . Nevertheless when the Son of Man cometh , shall He find faith on the earth ? ”
KJ21	Luke	18	9	And He spoke this parable unto certain ones who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
KJ21	Luke	18	10	“ Two men went up into the temple to pray , the one a Pharisee and the other a publican .
KJ21	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , ‘ God , I thank Thee that I am not as other men are : extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
KJ21	Luke	18	12	I fast twice in the week ; I give tithes of all that I possess. ’
KJ21	Luke	18	13	And the publican , standing afar off , would not so much as lift up his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , ‘ God , be merciful to me a sinner ! ’
KJ21	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went down to his house justified , rather than the other ; for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased , and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	15	And they brought unto Him also infants , that He would touch them ; but when His disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
KJ21	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called them unto Him and said , “ Suffer little children to come unto Me , and forbid them not , for of such is the Kingdom of God .
KJ21	Luke	18	17	Verily I say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said unto him , “ Why callest thou Me good ? None is good save One , that is , God .
KJ21	Luke	18	20	Thou knowest the commandments : ‘ Do not commit adultery. ’ ‘ Do not kill. ’ ‘ Do not steal. ’ ‘ Do not bear false witness. ’ ‘ Honor thy father and thy mother. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	18	21	And he said , “ All these have I kept from my youth up. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	22	Now when Jesus heard these things , He said unto him , “ Yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven ; and come , follow Me. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	23	And when he heard this he was very sorrowful , for he was very rich .
KJ21	Luke	18	24	And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , He said , “ How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God !
KJ21	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle ’ s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	26	And those who heard it said , “ Who then can be saved ? ”
KJ21	Luke	18	27	And He said , “ The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	28	Then Peter said , “ Lo , we have left all and followed Thee. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	29	And He said unto them , “ Verily I say unto you , there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the Kingdom of God ’ s sake ,
KJ21	Luke	18	30	who shall not receive manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	31	Then He took unto Him the twelve and said unto them , “ Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man shall be accomplished .
KJ21	Luke	18	32	For He shall be delivered unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked and spitefully treated and spit upon ;
KJ21	Luke	18	33	and they shall scourge Him and put Him to death , and the third day He shall rise again. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	34	And they understood none of these things ; and this saying was hidden from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken .
KJ21	Luke	18	35	And it came to pass that as He was coming nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging .
KJ21	Luke	18	36	And hearing the multitude pass by , he asked what it meant .
KJ21	Luke	18	37	And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by .
KJ21	Luke	18	38	And he cried , saying , “ Jesus , Thou Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
KJ21	Luke	18	39	And those who went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace , but he cried out all the more , “ Thou Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
KJ21	Luke	18	40	And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto Him . And when he had come near , He asked him ,
KJ21	Luke	18	41	saying , “ What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee ? ” And he said , “ Lord , that I may receive my sight. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said unto him , “ Receive thy sight ; thy faith hath saved thee. ”
KJ21	Luke	18	43	And immediately he received his sight and followed Him , glorifying God . And all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God .
KJ21	Luke	19	19	And he said likewise to him , ‘ Be thou also over five cities. ’
KJ21	Luke	19	2	And behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus who was the chief among the publicans , and he was rich .
KJ21	Luke	19	3	And he sought to see Jesus , who He was , but could not for the press of the crowd , because he was short in stature .
KJ21	Luke	19	4	And he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him , for He was to pass that way .
KJ21	Luke	19	5	And when Jesus came to the place , He looked up and saw him , and said unto him , “ Zacchaeus , make haste and come down , for today I must abide at thy house. ”
KJ21	Luke	19	6	And he made haste and came down , and received Him joyfully .
KJ21	Luke	19	7	And when they saw it , they all murmured , saying that He had gone to be the guest of a man who was a sinner .
KJ21	Luke	19	8	And Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord , “ Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation , I restore to him fourfold. ”
KJ21	Luke	19	9	And Jesus said unto him , “ This day is salvation come to this house , in that he also is a son of Abraham .
KJ21	Luke	19	10	For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. ”
KJ21	Luke	19	11	And as they heard these things , He added and spoke a parable , because He was nigh to Jerusalem and because they thought that the Kingdom of God should immediately appear .
KJ21	Luke	19	12	He said therefore , “ A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
KJ21	Luke	19	13	And he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , ‘ Make use of it till I come. ’
KJ21	Luke	19	14	But his citizens hated him and sent a message after him , saying , ‘ We will not have this man to reign over us. ’
KJ21	Luke	19	15	And it came to pass that when he had returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
KJ21	Luke	19	16	Then came the first , saying , ‘ Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds. ’
KJ21	Luke	19	17	And he said unto him , ‘ Well done , thou good servant ; because thou hast been faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities. ’
KJ21	Luke	19	18	And the second came , saying , ‘ Lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds. ’
KJ21	Luke	19	20	And another came , saying , ‘ Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid away in a napkin .
KJ21	Luke	19	21	For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up what thou layest not down , and reapest what thou did not sow. ’
KJ21	Luke	19	22	And he said unto him , ‘ Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . Thou knewest that I was an austere man , taking up what I laid not down and reaping what I did not sow .
KJ21	Luke	19	23	Why then gavest not thou my money unto the bank , that at my coming I might have required mine own with interest ? ’
KJ21	Luke	19	24	And he said unto them that stood by , ‘ Take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds. ’
KJ21	Luke	19	25	( And they said unto him , ‘ Lord , he hath ten pounds ! ’ )
KJ21	Luke	19	26	‘ For I say unto you , that unto every one that hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that which he hath shall be taken away from him .
KJ21	Luke	19	27	But those mine enemies , who would not that I should reign over them , bring them hither and slay them before me. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	19	28	And when Jesus had thus spoken , He went ahead , ascending up to Jerusalem .
KJ21	Luke	19	29	And it came to pass , when He had come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount called the Mount of Olives , He sent two of His disciples ,
KJ21	Luke	19	30	saying , “ Go ye into the village opposite you , in which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied , whereon yet never man sat . Loose him and bring him hither .
KJ21	Luke	19	31	And if any man ask you , ‘ Why do ye loose him ? ’ thus shall ye say unto him , ‘ Because the Lord hath need of him. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	19	32	And those who were sent went their way and found even as He had said unto them .
KJ21	Luke	19	33	And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , “ Why loose ye the colt ? ”
KJ21	Luke	19	34	And they said , “ The Lord hath need of him. ”
KJ21	Luke	19	35	And they brought him to Jesus , and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set Jesus thereon .
KJ21	Luke	19	36	And as He went , they spread their clothes along the way .
KJ21	Luke	19	37	And when He had come nigh , even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ,
KJ21	Luke	19	38	saying , “ Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest ! ”
KJ21	Luke	19	39	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto Him , “ Master , rebuke thy disciples. ”
KJ21	Luke	19	40	And He answered and said unto them , “ I tell you that if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out. ”
KJ21	Luke	19	41	And when He had come near , He beheld the city and wept over it ,
KJ21	Luke	19	42	saying , “ If thou had known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which must be for thy peace ! But now they are hid from thine eyes .
KJ21	Luke	19	43	For the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee around , and keep thee in on every side .
KJ21	Luke	19	44	And they shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee ; and they shalt not leave in thee one stone upon another , because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. ”
KJ21	Luke	19	45	And He went into the temple and began to cast out those who sold therein and those who bought ,
KJ21	Luke	19	46	saying unto them , “ It is written , ‘ My house is the house of prayer , ’ but ye have made it a den of thieves. ”
KJ21	Luke	19	47	And He taught daily in the temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy Him ;
KJ21	Luke	19	48	and they could not find what they might do , for all the people were very attentive to hear Him .
KJ21	Luke	20	20	And they watched Him and sent forth spies , who should feign themselves to be just men , that they might take hold of His words and so they might deliver Him unto the power and authority of the governor .
KJ21	Luke	20	2	and spoke unto Him , saying , “ Tell us by what authority doest thou these things ? Or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
KJ21	Luke	20	3	And He answered and said unto them , “ I will also ask you one thing , and answer Me :
KJ21	Luke	20	4	The baptism of John — was it from Heaven , or of men ? ”
KJ21	Luke	20	5	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we shall say ‘ From Heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Why then have ye not believed him ? ’
KJ21	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ Of men , ’ all the people will stone us , for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. ”
KJ21	Luke	20	7	And they answered that they could not tell from whence it was .
KJ21	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said unto them , “ Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. ”
KJ21	Luke	20	9	Then He began to speak to the people this parable : “ A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
KJ21	Luke	20	10	And at the season , he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard ; but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty .
KJ21	Luke	20	11	And again he sent another servant ; and they beat him also , and treated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
KJ21	Luke	20	12	And again he sent a third ; and they wounded him also and cast him out .
KJ21	Luke	20	13	Then said the lord of the vineyard , ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son ; it may be they will reverence him when they see him. ’
KJ21	Luke	20	14	But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ‘ This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours. ’
KJ21	Luke	20	15	So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
KJ21	Luke	20	16	He shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others. ” And when they heard it they said , “ God forbid ! ”
KJ21	Luke	20	17	And He beheld them and said , “ What is this then that is written : ‘ The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ’ ?
KJ21	Luke	20	18	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder. ”
KJ21	Luke	20	19	And the chief priests and the scribes that same hour sought to lay hands on Him , but they feared the people ; for they perceived that He had spoken this parable against them .
KJ21	Luke	20	21	And they asked Him , saying , “ Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truly .
KJ21	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar or no ? ”
KJ21	Luke	20	23	But He perceived their craftiness and said unto them , “ Why tempt ye Me ?
KJ21	Luke	20	24	Show Me a penny . Whose image and superscription hath it ? ” They answered and said , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
KJ21	Luke	20	25	And He said unto them , “ Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar ’ s , and unto God the things which are God ’ s. ”
KJ21	Luke	20	26	And they could not take hold of His words before the people . And they marveled at His answer and held their peace .
KJ21	Luke	20	27	Then came to Him certain of the Sadducees , who deny that there is any resurrection , and they asked Him ,
KJ21	Luke	20	28	saying , “ Master , Moses wrote unto us that if any man ’ s brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother .
KJ21	Luke	20	29	There were therefore seven brethren , and the first took a wife and died without children .
KJ21	Luke	20	30	And the second took her as wife , and he died childless .
KJ21	Luke	20	31	And the third took her , and in like manner the seven also ; and they left no children , and died .
KJ21	Luke	20	32	Last of all the woman died also .
KJ21	Luke	20	33	Therefore , in the resurrection whose wife is she , for seven had her as wife ? ”
KJ21	Luke	20	34	And Jesus answering said unto them , “ The children of this world marry and are given in marriage .
KJ21	Luke	20	35	But they that shall be accounted worthy to obtain that World and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry nor are given in marriage ,
KJ21	Luke	20	36	neither can they die any more ; for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection .
KJ21	Luke	20	37	Now that the dead are raised , even Moses showed at the bush when he called the Lord ‘ the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. ’
KJ21	Luke	20	38	For He is not a God of the dead , but of the living , for all live unto Him. ”
KJ21	Luke	20	39	Then certain of the scribes answering said , “ Master , thou hast said well. ”
KJ21	Luke	20	40	And after that they dared not ask Him any question at all .
KJ21	Luke	20	41	And He said unto them , “ How say they that Christ is David ’ s son ?
KJ21	Luke	20	42	For David himself saith in the book of Psalms : ‘ The Lord said unto my Lord , “ Sit Thou on My right hand ,
KJ21	Luke	20	43	until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. ” ’
KJ21	Luke	20	44	If David therefore calleth Him ‘ Lord , ’ how is He then his son ? ”
KJ21	Luke	20	45	Then in the audience of all the people , He said unto His disciples ,
KJ21	Luke	20	46	“ Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ;
KJ21	Luke	20	47	who devour widows ’ houses , and for a show make long prayers . The same shall receive greater damnation . ”
KJ21	Luke	21	21	Then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains , and let them that are in the midst of it depart out , and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
KJ21	Luke	21	2	and He saw also a certain poor widow casting therein two mites .
KJ21	Luke	21	3	And He said , “ In truth I say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all .
KJ21	Luke	21	4	For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God , but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had. ”
KJ21	Luke	21	5	And when some spoke of the temple and how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts , He said ,
KJ21	Luke	21	6	“ As for these things which ye behold , the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. ”
KJ21	Luke	21	7	And they asked Him , saying , “ Master , but when shall these things be ? And what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ? ”
KJ21	Luke	21	8	And He said , “ Take heed that ye be not deceived , for many shall come in My name , saying , ‘ I am Christ , ’ and , ‘ the time draweth near. ’ Go ye not therefore after them .
KJ21	Luke	21	9	But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified , for these things must first come to pass . But the end is not at once. ”
KJ21	Luke	21	10	Then said He unto them , “ Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ,
KJ21	Luke	21	11	and great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines and pestilences . And fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
KJ21	Luke	21	12	But before all these , they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons , and you will be brought before kings and rulers for My name ’ s sake .
KJ21	Luke	21	13	And it shall turn to you to bear testimony .
KJ21	Luke	21	14	Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand what ye shall answer .
KJ21	Luke	21	15	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist .
KJ21	Luke	21	16	And ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolk and friends , and some of you they shall cause to be put to death .
KJ21	Luke	21	17	And ye shall be hated by all men for My name ’ s sake .
KJ21	Luke	21	18	But there shall not a hair of your head perish .
KJ21	Luke	21	19	In your patience possess ye your souls .
KJ21	Luke	21	20	“ And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh .
KJ21	Luke	21	22	For these are the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
KJ21	Luke	21	23	But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days ! For there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people .
KJ21	Luke	21	24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations . And Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
KJ21	Luke	21	25	“ And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress among nations , with perplexity , the sea and the waves roaring .
KJ21	Luke	21	26	Men ’ s hearts will fail them for fear and for looking upon those things which are coming on the earth ; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
KJ21	Luke	21	27	And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
KJ21	Luke	21	28	And when these things begin to come to pass , then look up and lift up your heads , for your redemption draweth nigh. ”
KJ21	Luke	21	29	And He spoke to them a parable : “ Behold the fig tree and all the trees .
KJ21	Luke	21	30	When they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand .
KJ21	Luke	21	31	So likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand .
KJ21	Luke	21	32	Verily I say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled .
KJ21	Luke	21	33	Heaven and earth shall pass away , but My words shall not pass away .
KJ21	Luke	21	34	“ And take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life , and so that Day come upon you unawares .
KJ21	Luke	21	35	For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth .
KJ21	Luke	21	36	Watch ye therefore , and pray always , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of Man. ”
KJ21	Luke	21	37	And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple ; and at night He went out and stayed on the mount that is called the Mount of Olives .
KJ21	Luke	21	38	And all the people came early in the morning to Him in the temple to hear Him .
KJ21	Luke	22	22	And truly the Son of Man goeth as it was determined ; but woe unto that man by whom He is betrayed ! ”
KJ21	Luke	22	2	And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill Him , for they feared the people .
KJ21	Luke	22	3	Then entered Satan into Judas , surnamed Iscariot , being one of the twelve .
KJ21	Luke	22	4	And he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray Him unto them .
KJ21	Luke	22	5	And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
KJ21	Luke	22	6	And he promised , and sought opportunity to betray Him unto them in the absence of the multitude .
KJ21	Luke	22	7	Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread when the Passover lamb must be killed .
KJ21	Luke	22	8	And He sent Peter and John , saying , “ Go and prepare us the Passover , that we may eat. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	9	And they said unto Him , “ Where wilt Thou have us prepare ? ”
KJ21	Luke	22	10	And He said unto them , “ Behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water . Follow him into the house where he entereth in .
KJ21	Luke	22	11	And ye shall say unto the master of the house , ‘ The Master saith unto thee , “ Where is the guestchamber where I shall eat the Passover with My disciples ? ” ’
KJ21	Luke	22	12	And he shall show you a large upper room furnished . There make ready. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	13	And they went and found as He had said unto them . And they made ready the Passover .
KJ21	Luke	22	14	And when the hour had come , He sat down and the twelve apostles with Him .
KJ21	Luke	22	15	And He said unto them , “ With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer ;
KJ21	Luke	22	16	for I say unto you , I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	17	And He took the cup , and gave thanks and said , “ Take this , and divide it among yourselves ;
KJ21	Luke	22	18	for I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the Kingdom of God shall come. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	19	And He took bread , and gave thanks and broke it and gave it unto them , saying , “ This is My body which is given for you . This do in remembrance of Me. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	20	Likewise also He took the cup after supper , saying , “ This cup is the new testament in My blood , which is shed for you .
KJ21	Luke	22	21	But behold , the hand of him that betrayeth Me is with Me on the table .
KJ21	Luke	22	23	And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing .
KJ21	Luke	22	24	And there was also a contention among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
KJ21	Luke	22	25	And He said unto them , “ The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them , and they that exercise authority over them are called ‘ benefactors. ’
KJ21	Luke	22	26	But ye shall not be so ; but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger , and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
KJ21	Luke	22	27	For who is greater , he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth ? Is it not he that sitteth at meat ? But I am among you as He that serveth .
KJ21	Luke	22	28	“ Ye are they that have continued with Me in My temptations .
KJ21	Luke	22	29	And I appoint unto you a Kingdom , as My Father hath appointed unto Me ,
KJ21	Luke	22	30	that ye may eat and drink at My table in My Kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	31	And the Lord said , “ Simon , Simon ! Behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat .
KJ21	Luke	22	32	But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not ; and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	33	And Peter said unto Him , “ Lord , I am ready to go with Thee , both into prison and to death. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	34	And He said , “ I tell thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day before thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest Me. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	35	And He said unto them , “ When I sent you without purse and pack and shoes , lacked ye anything ? ” And they said , “ Nothing. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	36	Then said He unto them , “ But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it and likewise his pack ; and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment and buy one .
KJ21	Luke	22	37	For I say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in Me : ‘ And He was reckoned among the transgressors. ’ For the things concerning Me have an end. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	38	And they said , “ Lord , behold , here are two swords. ” And He said unto them , “ It is enough. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	39	And He came out and went , as He was wont , to the Mount of Olives ; and His disciples also followed Him .
KJ21	Luke	22	40	And when He was at the place , He said unto them , “ Pray that ye enter not into temptation. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	41	And He was withdrawn from them about a stone ’ s cast , and kneeled down and prayed ,
KJ21	Luke	22	42	saying , “ Father , if Thou be willing , remove this cup from Me ; nevertheless not My will , but Thine be done. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	43	And there appeared an angel unto Him from Heaven , strengthening Him .
KJ21	Luke	22	44	And being in agony , He prayed more earnestly , and His sweat was , as it were , great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
KJ21	Luke	22	45	And when He rose up from prayer and had come to His disciples , He found them sleeping for sorrow .
KJ21	Luke	22	46	And He said unto them , “ Why sleep ye ? Rise and pray , lest ye enter into temptation. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	47	And while He yet spoke , behold , a multitude ; and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them and drew near unto Jesus to kiss Him .
KJ21	Luke	22	48	But Jesus said unto him , “ Judas , betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
KJ21	Luke	22	49	When those who were about Him saw what would follow , they said unto Him , “ Lord , shall we smite with the sword ? ”
KJ21	Luke	22	50	And one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
KJ21	Luke	22	51	And Jesus answered and said , “ Suffer ye thus far. ” And He touched his ear and healed him .
KJ21	Luke	22	52	Then Jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temple and the elders , who had come to Him , “ Have ye come out as against a thief , with swords and staves ?
KJ21	Luke	22	53	When I was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched forth no hands against Me ; but this is your hour , and the power of darkness. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	54	Then they took Him and led Him , and brought Him into the high priest ’ s house . And Peter followed afar off .
KJ21	Luke	22	55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and had sat down together , Peter sat down among them .
KJ21	Luke	22	56	But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him and said , “ This man was also with him. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	57	And he denied Him , saying , “ Woman , I know Him not. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	58	And after a little while another saw him and said , “ Thou art also of them. ” And Peter said , “ Man , I am not ! ”
KJ21	Luke	22	59	And after the space of about an hour , another confidently affirmed , saying , “ In truth this fellow also was with him , for he is a Galilean. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	60	And Peter said , “ Man , I know not what thou sayest ! ” And immediately , while he yet spoke , the cock crowed .
KJ21	Luke	22	61	And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how He had said unto him , “ Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny Me thrice. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	62	And Peter went out and wept bitterly .
KJ21	Luke	22	63	And the men who held Jesus mocked Him and smote Him .
KJ21	Luke	22	64	And when they had blindfolded Him , they struck Him on the face and asked Him , saying , “ Prophesy ! Who is it that smote thee ? ”
KJ21	Luke	22	65	And many other things they spoke blasphemously against Him .
KJ21	Luke	22	66	And as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led Him into their council , saying ,
KJ21	Luke	22	67	“ Art thou the Christ ? Tell us. ” And He said unto them , “ If I tell you , ye will not believe .
KJ21	Luke	22	68	And if I also ask you , ye will not answer Me nor let Me go .
KJ21	Luke	22	69	Hereafter shall the Son of Man sit on the right hand of the power of God. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	70	Then said they all , “ Art thou then the Son of God ? ” And He said unto them , “ Ye say that I am. ”
KJ21	Luke	22	71	And they said , “ What need we any further witness ? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth . ”
KJ21	Luke	23	23	But they were instant with loud voices , requiring that He might be crucified . And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed .
KJ21	Luke	23	2	And they began to accuse Him , saying , “ We found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ , a king. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	3	And Pilate asked Him , saying , “ Art thou the king of the Jews ? ” And He answered him and said , “ Thou sayest it. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	4	Then said Pilate to the chief priests and the people , “ I find no fault in this man. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	5	And they became the more fierce , saying , “ He stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee to this place. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	6	When Pilate heard of Galilee , he asked whether the Man were a Galilean .
KJ21	Luke	23	7	And as soon as he learned that He belonged unto Herod ’ s jurisdiction , he sent Him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
KJ21	Luke	23	8	And when Herod saw Jesus he was exceedingly glad , for he had been desirous to see Him for a long time , because he had heard many things about Him , and he hoped to see some miracle done by Him .
KJ21	Luke	23	9	Then he questioned Him with many words , but He answered him nothing .
KJ21	Luke	23	10	And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him .
KJ21	Luke	23	11	And Herod , with his men of war , treated Him with contempt and mocked Him , and arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him again to Pilate .
KJ21	Luke	23	12	And on the same day , Pilate and Herod were made friends together , for before that there was enmity between them .
KJ21	Luke	23	13	And Pilate , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
KJ21	Luke	23	14	said unto them , “ Ye have brought this man unto me as one who perverteth the people . And behold , I , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man concerning those things whereof ye accuse him .
KJ21	Luke	23	15	No , nor yet Herod ; for I sent you to him , and lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
KJ21	Luke	23	16	I will therefore chastise him and release him. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	17	( For of necessity he must release one unto them at the Feast . )
KJ21	Luke	23	18	And they all cried out at once , saying , “ Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas ”
KJ21	Luke	23	19	( who had been cast into prison for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder ) .
KJ21	Luke	23	20	Pilate therefore , desiring to release Jesus , spoke again to them .
KJ21	Luke	23	21	But they cried , saying , “ Crucify him , crucify him ! ”
KJ21	Luke	23	22	And he said unto them the third time , “ Why ? What evil hath he done ? I have found no cause for death in him . I will therefore chastise him and let him go. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	24	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required .
KJ21	Luke	23	25	And he released unto them the one who for sedition and murder had been cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will .
KJ21	Luke	23	26	And as they led Him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after Jesus .
KJ21	Luke	23	27	And there followed Him a great company of people , and of women who also bewailed and lamented Him .
KJ21	Luke	23	28	But Jesus , turning unto them , said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for Me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
KJ21	Luke	23	29	For behold , the days are coming in which they shall say , ‘ Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bore and the breasts which never gave suck. ’
KJ21	Luke	23	30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us ! ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us ! ’
KJ21	Luke	23	31	For if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the dry ? ”
KJ21	Luke	23	32	And there were also two others , malefactors , led with Him to be put to death .
KJ21	Luke	23	33	And when they had come to the place which is called Calvary , there they crucified Him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand and the other on the left .
KJ21	Luke	23	34	Then Jesus said , “ Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do. ” And they parted His raiment and cast lots .
KJ21	Luke	23	35	And the people stood beholding . And the rulers who were also with them derided Him , saying , “ He saved others ; let him save himself if he be Christ , the chosen of God. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	36	And the soldiers also mocked Him , coming to Him and offering Him vinegar
KJ21	Luke	23	37	and saying , “ If thou art the king of the Jews , save thyself. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	38	And a superscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew : This Is The King Of The Jews .
KJ21	Luke	23	39	And one of the malefactors who was hanged railed against Him , saying , “ If thou be Christ , save thyself and us ! ”
KJ21	Luke	23	40	But the other answering rebuked him , saying , “ Dost not thou fear God , seeing thou art under the same condemnation ?
KJ21	Luke	23	41	And we indeed justly , for we receive the due reward of our deeds . But this Man hath done nothing amiss. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	42	And he said unto Jesus , “ Lord , remember me when Thou comest into Thy Kingdom. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	43	And Jesus said unto him , “ Verily I say unto thee , today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise. ”
KJ21	Luke	23	44	And it was about the sixth hour , and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour .
KJ21	Luke	23	45	And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
KJ21	Luke	23	46	And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice , He said , “ Father , into Thy hands I commend My spirit. ” And having said thus , He gave up the ghost .
KJ21	Luke	23	47	Now when the centurion saw what was done , he glorifed God , saying , “ Certainly this was a righteous man ! ”
KJ21	Luke	23	48	And all the people who came together to that sight , beholding the things which had been done , smote their breasts and returned .
KJ21	Luke	23	49	And all His acquaintances and the women who had followed Him from Galilee stood afar off , beholding these things .
KJ21	Luke	23	50	And behold , there was a man named Joseph , a council member , and he was a good man and a just .
KJ21	Luke	23	51	( The same had not consented to their counsel and deed . ) He was of Arimathea , a city of the Jews , who himself also waited for the Kingdom of God .
KJ21	Luke	23	52	This man went unto Pilate and begged the body of Jesus .
KJ21	Luke	23	53	And he took it down and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
KJ21	Luke	23	54	And that day was the Preparation , and the Sabbath drew near .
KJ21	Luke	23	55	And the women also , who came with Him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulcher and how His body was laid .
KJ21	Luke	23	56	And they returned and prepared spices and ointments , and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment .
KJ21	Luke	24	24	And certain of those who were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said , but Him they saw not. ”
KJ21	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher .
KJ21	Luke	24	3	And they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus .
KJ21	Luke	24	4	And it came to pass , as they were much perplexed about this , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments .
KJ21	Luke	24	5	And as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , “ Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
KJ21	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but is risen ! Remember how He spoke unto you when He was yet in Galilee ,
KJ21	Luke	24	7	saying , ‘ The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified , and the third day rise again. ’ ”
KJ21	Luke	24	8	And they remembered His words ,
KJ21	Luke	24	9	and returned from the sepulcher and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest .
KJ21	Luke	24	10	It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James , and other women who were with them , who told these things unto the apostles .
KJ21	Luke	24	11	And their words seemed to them as idle tales , and they believed them not .
KJ21	Luke	24	12	Then arose Peter and ran unto the sepulcher ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen cloths laid by themselves . And he departed , wondering to himself at that which had come to pass .
KJ21	Luke	24	13	And behold , two of them were going that same day to a village called Emmaus , which was from Jerusalem about seven miles .
KJ21	Luke	24	14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened .
KJ21	Luke	24	15	And it came to pass that while they communed and reasoned together , Jesus Himself drew near and went with them .
KJ21	Luke	24	16	But their eyes were held , that they should not know Him .
KJ21	Luke	24	17	And He said unto them , “ What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad ? ”
KJ21	Luke	24	18	And one of them , whose name was Cleopas , answering said unto Him , “ Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which have come to pass there in these days ? ”
KJ21	Luke	24	19	And He said unto them , “ What things ? ” And they said unto Him , “ Concerning Jesus of Nazareth , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ;
KJ21	Luke	24	20	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death and have crucified Him .
KJ21	Luke	24	21	But we trusted that it had been He who should have redeemed Israel . And besides all this , today is the third day since these things were done .
KJ21	Luke	24	22	Yea , and certain women also of our company , who were early at the sepulcher , made us astonished .
KJ21	Luke	24	23	And when they found not His body , they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels , who said that He was alive .
KJ21	Luke	24	25	Then He said unto them , “ O fools , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken !
KJ21	Luke	24	26	Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory ? ”
KJ21	Luke	24	27	And beginning with Moses and all the prophets , He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself .
KJ21	Luke	24	28	And they drew nigh unto the village whither they were going , and He made as though He would have gone further .
KJ21	Luke	24	29	But they constrained Him , saying , “ Abide with us , for it is toward evening and the day is far spent. ” And He went in to tarry with them .
KJ21	Luke	24	30	And it came to pass , as He sat at meat with them , He took bread and blessed it , and broke and gave it to them .
KJ21	Luke	24	31	And their eyes were opened and they knew Him . And He vanished out of their sight .
KJ21	Luke	24	32	And they said to one another , “ Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked with us on the way and while He opened to us the Scriptures ? ”
KJ21	Luke	24	33	And they rose up that same hour and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them ,
KJ21	Luke	24	34	saying , “ The Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon ! ”
KJ21	Luke	24	35	And they told what things were done on the way , and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread .
KJ21	Luke	24	36	And as they thus spoke , Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them , “ Peace be unto you. ”
KJ21	Luke	24	37	But they were terrified and afraid , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
KJ21	Luke	24	38	And He said unto them , “ Why are ye troubled , and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ?
KJ21	Luke	24	39	Behold My hands and My feet , that it is I Myself . Handle Me and see , for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see Me to have. ”
KJ21	Luke	24	40	And when He had thus spoken , He showed them His hands and His feet .
KJ21	Luke	24	41	And while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , He said unto them , “ Have ye here any meat ? ”
KJ21	Luke	24	42	And they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb .
KJ21	Luke	24	43	And He took it and ate before them .
KJ21	Luke	24	44	And He said unto them , “ These are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and in the Psalms concerning Me. ”
KJ21	Luke	24	45	Then opened He their understanding , that they might understand the Scriptures ,
KJ21	Luke	24	46	and said unto them , “ Thus it is written , and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day ,
KJ21	Luke	24	47	and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
KJ21	Luke	24	48	And ye are witnesses of these things .
KJ21	Luke	24	49	And behold , I send the promise of My Father upon you ; but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high. ”
KJ21	Luke	24	50	And He led them out as far as to Bethany , and He lifted up His hands and blessed them .
KJ21	Luke	24	51	And it came to pass , while He blessed them , He was parted from them and carried up into Heaven .
KJ21	Luke	24	52	And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
KJ21	Luke	24	53	and were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen .
KJ21	John	1	1	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
KJ21	John	1	2	The same was in the beginning with God .
KJ21	John	1	3	All things were made by Him , and without Him was not anything made that was made .
KJ21	John	1	4	In Him was life , and that life was the Light of men .
KJ21	John	1	5	And the Light shineth in darkness , and the darkness comprehended it not .
KJ21	John	1	6	There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
KJ21	John	1	7	The same came as a witness to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
KJ21	John	1	8	He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light .
KJ21	John	1	9	That was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
KJ21	John	1	10	He was in the world , and the world was made by Him , and the world knew Him not .
KJ21	John	1	11	He came unto His own , and His own received Him not .
KJ21	John	1	12	But as many as received Him , to them gave He power to become the sons of God , even to those who believe in His name ,
KJ21	John	1	13	who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
KJ21	John	1	14	And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us ( and we beheld His glory , the glory as of the only Begotten of the Father ) , full of grace and truth .
KJ21	John	1	15	John bore witness of Him and cried , saying , “ This was He of whom I spoke , ‘ He that cometh after me is preferred before me , for He was before me. ’ ”
KJ21	John	1	16	And of His fullness have we all received , and grace for grace .
KJ21	John	1	17	For the law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ .
KJ21	John	1	18	No man hath seen God at any time ; the only begotten Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , He hath declared Him .
KJ21	John	1	19	And this is the record of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , “ Who art thou ? ”
KJ21	John	1	20	And he confessed and denied not , but confessed , “ I am not the Christ. ”
KJ21	John	1	21	And they asked him , “ What then ? Art thou Elijah ? ” And he said , “ I am not. ” “ Art thou that Prophet ? ” And he answered , “ No. ”
KJ21	John	1	22	Then said they unto him , “ Who art thou , that we may give an answer to those who sent us ? What sayest thou of thyself ? ”
KJ21	John	1	23	He said , “ I am ‘ the voice of one crying in the wilderness , “ Make straight the way of the Lord , ” ’ as said the prophet Isaiah. ”
KJ21	John	1	24	And those who were sent were of the Pharisees .
KJ21	John	1	25	And they asked him , and said unto him , “ Why dost thou baptize then if thou art not that Christ , nor Elijah , neither that Prophet ? ”
KJ21	John	1	26	John answered them , saying , “ I baptize with water , but there standeth One among you whom ye know not .
KJ21	John	1	27	He it is who , coming after me , is preferred before me , whose shoe ’ s strap I am not worthy to unloose. ”
KJ21	John	1	28	These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
KJ21	John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming unto him , and said , “ Behold , the Lamb of God , who taketh away the sin of the world !
KJ21	John	1	30	This is He of whom I said , ‘ After me cometh a Man who is preferred before me , for He was before me. ’
KJ21	John	1	31	And I knew Him not ; but that He should be made manifest to Israel , therefore have I come baptizing with water. ”
KJ21	John	1	32	And John bore record , saying , “ I saw the Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove , and It abode upon Him .
KJ21	John	1	33	And I knew Him not . But He that sent me to baptize with water , the Same said unto me , ‘ Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him , the Same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. ’
KJ21	John	1	34	And I saw and bore record that this is the Son of God. ”
KJ21	John	1	35	Again the next day John stood with two of his disciples ,
KJ21	John	1	36	and looking upon Jesus as He walked , he said , “ Behold the Lamb of God ! ”
KJ21	John	1	37	And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
KJ21	John	1	38	Then Jesus turned and saw them following , and said unto them , “ What seek ye ? ” They said unto Him , “ Rabbi ” ( which is to say , being interpreted , “ Master ” ) , “ where dwellest Thou ? ”
KJ21	John	1	39	He said unto them , “ Come and see. ” They came and saw where He dwelt and stayed with Him that day , for it was about the tenth hour .
KJ21	John	1	40	One of the two who heard John speak , and followed Him , was Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother .
KJ21	John	1	41	He first found his own brother Simon and said unto him , “ We have found the Messiah ” ( which is , being interpreted , “ the Christ ” ) .
KJ21	John	1	42	And he brought him to Jesus . And when Jesus beheld him , He said , “ Thou art Simon , the son of Jonah . Thou shalt be called Cephas ” ( which is by interpretation , “ a stone ” ) .
KJ21	John	1	43	The day following , Jesus would go forth into Galilee , and found Philip and said unto him , “ Follow Me. ”
KJ21	John	1	44	Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
KJ21	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and said unto him , “ We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote : Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph. ”
KJ21	John	1	46	And Nathanael said unto him , “ Can any good thing come out of Nazareth ? ” Philip said unto him , “ Come and see. ”
KJ21	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him , and said of him , “ Behold , an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile ! ”
KJ21	John	1	48	Nathanael said unto Him , “ How knowest Thou me ? ” Jesus answered and said unto him , “ Before Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee. ”
KJ21	John	1	49	Nathanael answered and said unto Him , “ Rabbi , Thou art the Son of God ; Thou art the King of Israel. ”
KJ21	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said unto him , “ Because I said unto thee , ‘ I saw thee under the fig tree , ’ believest thou ? Thou shalt see greater things than these. ”
KJ21	John	1	51	And He said unto him , “ Verily , verily I say unto you , hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man . ”
KJ21	John	2	2	and both Jesus and His disciples were called to the marriage .
KJ21	John	2	3	And when they lacked wine , the mother of Jesus said unto Him , “ They have no wine. ”
KJ21	John	2	4	Jesus said unto her , “ Woman , what have I to do with thee ? Mine hour is not yet come. ”
KJ21	John	2	5	His mother said unto the servants , “ Whatsoever He saith unto you , do it. ”
KJ21	John	2	6	And there were set there six waterpots of stone , according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews , holding twenty to thirty gallons apiece .
KJ21	John	2	7	Jesus said unto them , “ Fill the waterpots with water. ” And they filled them up to the brim .
KJ21	John	2	8	And He said unto them , “ Draw some out now , and bear it unto the governor of the feast. ” And they took it .
KJ21	John	2	9	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , not knowing from whence it had come ( but the servants who drew the water knew ) , the governor of the feast called the bridegroom
KJ21	John	2	10	and said unto him , “ Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine , and when men have drunk well , then that which is worse ; but thou hast kept the good wine until now. ”
KJ21	John	2	11	This beginning of miracles Jesus did in Cana of Galilee , and manifested forth His glory ; and His disciples believed in Him .
KJ21	John	2	12	After this He went down to Capernaum , He and His mother and His brethren and His disciples ; and they continued there a few days .
KJ21	John	2	13	And the Jews ’ Passover was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
KJ21	John	2	14	and found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves , and also the changers of money , sitting there .
KJ21	John	2	15	And when He had made a scourge of small cords , He drove them all out of the temple , with the sheep and the oxen , and poured out the changers ’ money and overthrew the tables .
KJ21	John	2	16	And He said unto those who sold doves , “ Take these things hence ! Make not My Father ’ s house a house of merchandise ! ”
KJ21	John	2	17	And His disciples remembered that it was written : “ The zeal of Thine house hath eaten me up. ”
KJ21	John	2	18	Then the Jews answered and said unto Him , “ What sign showest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ? ”
KJ21	John	2	19	Jesus answered and said unto them , “ Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up. ”
KJ21	John	2	20	Then said the Jews , “ Forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou raise it up in three days ? ”
KJ21	John	2	21	But He spoke of the temple of His body .
KJ21	John	2	22	When therefore He was risen from the dead , His disciples remembered that He had said this unto them . And they believed the Scripture and the Word which Jesus had said .
KJ21	John	2	23	Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover on the feast day , many believed in His name when they saw the miracles which He did .
KJ21	John	2	24	But Jesus did not commit Himself unto them , because He knew all men ,
KJ21	John	2	25	and needed not that any should testify of man , for He knew what was in man .
KJ21	John	3	3	Jesus answered and said unto him , “ Verily , verily I say unto thee , unless a man be born again , he can not see the Kingdom of God. ”
KJ21	John	3	2	The same came to Jesus by night and said unto Him , “ Rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from God ; for no man can do these miracles that thou doest , unless God be with him. ”
KJ21	John	3	4	Nicodemus said unto Him , “ How can a man be born when he is old ? Can he enter a second time into his mother ’ s womb and be born ? ”
KJ21	John	3	5	Jesus answered , “ Verily , verily I say unto thee , unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he can not enter into the Kingdom of God .
KJ21	John	3	6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
KJ21	John	3	7	Marvel not that I said unto thee , ‘ Ye must be born again. ’
KJ21	John	3	8	The wind bloweth where it will , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit. ”
KJ21	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered and said unto Him , “ How can these things be ? ”
KJ21	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said unto him , “ Art thou a master of Israel , and knowest not these things ?
KJ21	John	3	11	Verily , verily I say unto thee , we speak what we know and testify what we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
KJ21	John	3	12	If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not , how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things ?
KJ21	John	3	13	And no man hath ascended up to Heaven , but He that came down from Heaven , even the Son of Man who is in Heaven .
KJ21	John	3	14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
KJ21	John	3	15	that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish , but have eternal life .
KJ21	John	3	16	“ For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish , but have everlasting life .
KJ21	John	3	17	For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world , but that the world through Him might be saved .
KJ21	John	3	18	“ He that believeth in Him is not condemned ; but He that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
KJ21	John	3	19	And this is the condemnation : that Light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
KJ21	John	3	20	For every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
KJ21	John	3	21	But he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in God. ”
KJ21	John	3	22	After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea , and there He tarried with them , and baptized .
KJ21	John	3	23	And John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim , because there was much water there . And they came and were baptized ,
KJ21	John	3	24	for John had not yet been cast into prison .
KJ21	John	3	25	Then there arose a question between some of John ’ s disciples and the Jews about purifying .
KJ21	John	3	26	And they came unto John and said unto him , “ Rabbi , He that was with thee beyond the Jordan , to whom thou bearest witness — behold , the same baptizeth and all men come to Him. ”
KJ21	John	3	27	John answered and said , “ A man can receive nothing , unless it be given him from Heaven .
KJ21	John	3	28	Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said , ‘ I am not the Christ , ’ but that ‘ I am sent before Him. ’
KJ21	John	3	29	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom ’ s voice . This my joy , therefore , is fulfilled .
KJ21	John	3	30	He must increase , but I must decrease .
KJ21	John	3	31	“ He that cometh from above is above all ; he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth . He that cometh from Heaven is above all .
KJ21	John	3	32	And what He hath seen and heard , to that He testifieth , and no man receiveth His testimony .
KJ21	John	3	33	He that hath received His testimony hath set his seal to this : that God is true .
KJ21	John	3	34	For He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God , for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him .
KJ21	John	3	35	The Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into His hand .
KJ21	John	3	36	He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life ; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life , but the wrath of God abideth on him . ”
KJ21	John	4	4	and He needed to go through Samaria .
KJ21	John	4	2	( though Jesus Himself baptized not , but His disciples ) ,
KJ21	John	4	3	He left Judea and departed again into Galilee ,
KJ21	John	4	5	Then came He to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
KJ21	John	4	6	Now Jacob ’ s well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with His journey , sat thus by the well ; and it was about the sixth hour .
KJ21	John	4	7	There came a woman of Samaria to draw water . Jesus said unto her , “ Give Me to drink. ”
KJ21	John	4	8	( For His disciples had gone away unto the city to buy meat . )
KJ21	John	4	9	Then said the woman of Samaria unto Him , “ How is it that thou , being a Jew , askest a drink of me , who am a woman of Samaria ? ” For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans .
KJ21	John	4	10	Jesus answered and said unto her , “ If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee , ‘ Give Me to drink , ’ thou wouldest have asked of Him , and He would have given thee living water. ”
KJ21	John	4	11	The woman said unto Him , “ Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep . From whence then hast thou that living water ?
KJ21	John	4	12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well and drank thereof himself , and his children and his cattle ? ”
KJ21	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said unto her , “ Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again ,
KJ21	John	4	14	but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. ”
KJ21	John	4	15	The woman said unto Him , “ Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come hither to draw. ”
KJ21	John	4	16	Jesus said unto her , “ Go , call thy husband , and come hither. ”
KJ21	John	4	17	The woman answered and said , “ I have no husband. ” Jesus said unto her , “ Thou hast well said , ‘ I have no husband ’ ;
KJ21	John	4	18	for thou hast had five husbands , and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband . In that thou saidst truly. ”
KJ21	John	4	19	The woman said unto Him , “ Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet .
KJ21	John	4	20	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain , and ye say that Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. ”
KJ21	John	4	21	Jesus said unto her , “ Woman , believe Me , the hour cometh when ye shall neither on this mountain , nor yet at Jerusalem , worship the Father .
KJ21	John	4	22	Ye worship ye know not what ; we know what we worship , for salvation is of the Jews .
KJ21	John	4	23	But the hour cometh and now is , when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth ; for the Father seeketh such to worship Him .
KJ21	John	4	24	God is a Spirit , and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth. ”
KJ21	John	4	25	The woman said unto Him , “ I know that Messiah cometh , who is called Christ . When He has come , He will tell us all things. ”
KJ21	John	4	26	Jesus said unto her , “ I that speak unto thee am He. ”
KJ21	John	4	27	And upon this came His disciples and marveled that He talked with the woman ; yet no man said , “ What seekest Thou ? ” or , “ Why talkest Thou with her ? ”
KJ21	John	4	28	The woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city and said to the men ,
KJ21	John	4	29	“ Come , see a man who told me all things that ever I did . Is not this the Christ ? ”
KJ21	John	4	30	Then they went out of the city and came unto Him .
KJ21	John	4	31	Meanwhile His disciples entreated Him , saying , “ Master , eat. ”
KJ21	John	4	32	But He said unto them , “ I have meat to eat that ye know not of. ”
KJ21	John	4	33	Therefore the disciples said one to another , “ Hath any man brought Him aught to eat ? ”
KJ21	John	4	34	Jesus said unto them , “ My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me , and to finish His work .
KJ21	John	4	35	Say not ye , ‘ There are yet four months and then cometh the harvest ’ ? Behold , I say unto you , lift up your eyes and look on the fields , for they are white already to harvest .
KJ21	John	4	36	And he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal , that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
KJ21	John	4	37	And herein is that saying true , ‘ One soweth and another reapeth. ’
KJ21	John	4	38	I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor ; other men labored , and ye have entered into their labors. ”
KJ21	John	4	39	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the saying of the woman who testified , “ He told me all that ever I did. ”
KJ21	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans had come unto Him , they besought Him that He would tarry with them ; and He abode there two days .
KJ21	John	4	41	And many more believed because of His own word ,
KJ21	John	4	42	and said unto the woman , “ Now we believe , not because of thy saying , for we have heard Him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Savior of the world. ”
KJ21	John	4	43	Now after two days He departed thence and went into Galilee .
KJ21	John	4	44	For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own country .
KJ21	John	4	45	Then when He had come into Galilee , the Galileans received Him , having seen all the things that He did at Jerusalem at the feast ; for they also had gone to the feast .
KJ21	John	4	46	So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
KJ21	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee , he went unto Him and besought Him that He would come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
KJ21	John	4	48	Then Jesus said unto him , “ Unless ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe. ”
KJ21	John	4	49	The nobleman said unto Him , “ Sir , come down ere my child die ! ”
KJ21	John	4	50	Jesus said unto him , “ Go thy way ; thy son liveth. ” And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
KJ21	John	4	51	And as he was going down , his servants met him and told him , saying , “ Thy son liveth ! ”
KJ21	John	4	52	Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to be healed . And they said unto him , “ Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. ”
KJ21	John	4	53	So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus had said unto him , “ Thy son liveth. ” And he himself believed , and his whole house .
KJ21	John	4	54	This is again the second miracle that Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee .
KJ21	John	5	5	And a certain man was there who had an infirmity for thirty and eight years .
KJ21	John	5	2	Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , having five porches .
KJ21	John	5	3	In these lay a great multitude of invalid folk — blind , halt , withered — waiting for the moving of the water .
KJ21	John	5	4	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water . Whosoever then first stepped in , after the troubling of the water , was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
KJ21	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying there , and knew that he had been in that state a long time , He said unto him , “ Wilt thou be made whole ? ”
KJ21	John	5	7	The infirm man answered Him , “ Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool ; but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me. ”
KJ21	John	5	8	Jesus said unto him , “ Rise , take up thy bed , and walk. ”
KJ21	John	5	9	And immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed and walked . Now it was the Sabbath on that day .
KJ21	John	5	10	The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured , “ It is the Sabbath day ; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. ”
KJ21	John	5	11	He answered them , “ He that made me whole said unto me , ‘ Take up thy bed and walk. ’ ”
KJ21	John	5	12	Then they asked him , “ What man is that who said unto thee , ‘ Take up thy bed and walk ’ ? ”
KJ21	John	5	13	And he that was healed knew not who it was , for Jesus had removed Himself away , a multitude being in that place .
KJ21	John	5	14	Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said unto him , “ Behold , thou art made whole . Sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee. ”
KJ21	John	5	15	The man departed , and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole .
KJ21	John	5	16	And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought to slay Him , because He had done these things on the Sabbath day .
KJ21	John	5	17	But Jesus answered them , “ My Father worketh hitherto , and I work. ”
KJ21	John	5	18	Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill Him , because He not only had broken the Sabbath , but said also that God was His Father , making Himself equal with God .
KJ21	John	5	19	Then answered Jesus and said unto them , “ Verily , verily I say unto you , the Son can do nothing of Himself , but what He seeth the Father do ; for what things soever He doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise .
KJ21	John	5	20	For the Father loveth the Son and showeth Him all things that He Himself doeth ; and He will show Him greater works than these , that ye may marvel .
KJ21	John	5	21	For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them , even so the Son quickeneth whom He will .
KJ21	John	5	22	For the Father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the Son ,
KJ21	John	5	23	that all men should honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father who hath sent Him .
KJ21	John	5	24	Verily , verily I say unto you , he that heareth My Word and believeth in Him that sent Me , hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation , but is passed from death unto life .
KJ21	John	5	25	“ Verily , verily I say unto you , the hour is coming and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God ; and they that hear shall live .
KJ21	John	5	26	For as the Father hath life in Himself , so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself ,
KJ21	John	5	27	and hath given Him authority to execute judgment also , because He is the Son of Man .
KJ21	John	5	28	Marvel not at this ; for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice
KJ21	John	5	29	and shall come forth — they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life , and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation .
KJ21	John	5	30	“ I can of Mine own self do nothing . As I hear , I judge ; and My judgment is just , because I seek not Mine own will , but the will of the Father who hath sent Me .
KJ21	John	5	31	If I bear witness of Myself , My witness is not true .
KJ21	John	5	32	There is Another that beareth witness of Me , and I know that the witness which He witnesseth of Me is true .
KJ21	John	5	33	“ Ye sent unto John , and he bore witness unto the truth .
KJ21	John	5	34	But I receive not testimony from man , but these things I say , that ye might be saved .
KJ21	John	5	35	He was a burning and a shining light , and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light .
KJ21	John	5	36	But I have greater witness than that of John ; for the works which the Father hath given Me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of Me that the Father hath sent Me .
KJ21	John	5	37	And the Father Himself , who hath sent Me , hath borne witness of Me . Ye have neither heard His voice at any time , nor seen His shape .
KJ21	John	5	38	And ye have not His Word abiding in you ; for Whom He hath sent , Him ye believe not .
KJ21	John	5	39	“ Search the Scriptures , for in them ye think ye have eternal life ; and it is they which testify of Me .
KJ21	John	5	40	And ye will not come to Me , that ye might have life !
KJ21	John	5	41	I receive not honor from men .
KJ21	John	5	42	But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
KJ21	John	5	43	I have come in My Father ’ s name , and ye receive Me not ; if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
KJ21	John	5	44	How can ye believe , who receive honor one from another , and seek not the honor that cometh from God only ?
KJ21	John	5	45	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father . There is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust .
KJ21	John	5	46	For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed Me , for he wrote of Me .
KJ21	John	5	47	But if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe My words ? ”
KJ21	John	6	6	And this He said to test him , for He Himself knew what He would do .
KJ21	John	6	2	And a great multitude followed Him , because they saw His miracles which He did on those who were diseased .
KJ21	John	6	3	And Jesus went up onto a mountain , and there He sat with His disciples .
KJ21	John	6	4	Now the Passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh .
KJ21	John	6	5	And when Jesus lifted up His eyes and saw a great company coming unto Him , He said unto Philip , “ Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ? ”
KJ21	John	6	7	Philip answered Him , “ Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little. ”
KJ21	John	6	8	One of His disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , said unto Him ,
KJ21	John	6	9	“ There is a lad here who hath five barley loaves and two small fishes , but what are they among so many ? ”
KJ21	John	6	10	And Jesus said , “ Make the men sit down. ” Now there was much grass in the place ; so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
KJ21	John	6	11	And Jesus took the loaves , and when He had given thanks , He distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to those who were sitting down ; and likewise of the fishes , as much as they wanted .
KJ21	John	6	12	When they were filled , He said unto His disciples , “ Gather up the fragments that remain , that nothing be lost. ”
KJ21	John	6	13	Therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above , unto them that had eaten .
KJ21	John	6	14	Then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus had done , said , “ This is in truth that Prophet who is coming into the world ! ”
KJ21	John	6	15	When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take Him by force to make Him a king , He departed again onto a mountain alone .
KJ21	John	6	16	And as evening had now come , His disciples went down unto the sea ,
KJ21	John	6	17	and entered into a boat and went over the sea toward Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus had not come to them .
KJ21	John	6	18	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
KJ21	John	6	19	So when they had rowed about three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the boat ; and they were afraid .
KJ21	John	6	20	But He said unto them , “ It is I ; be not afraid. ”
KJ21	John	6	21	Then they willingly received Him into the boat , and immediately the boat was at the land whither they were going .
KJ21	John	6	22	The day following , when the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , save the one into which His disciples had entered , and that Jesus had not gone with His disciples into the boat , but that His disciples had gone away alone
KJ21	John	6	23	( however there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they had eaten bread after the Lord had given thanks ) ”
KJ21	John	6	24	when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither His disciples , they also took boats and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
KJ21	John	6	25	And when they had found Him on the other side of the sea , they said unto Him , “ Rabbi , when camest thou hither ? ”
KJ21	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said , “ Verily , verily I say unto you , ye seek Me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled .
KJ21	John	6	27	Labor not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life , which the Son of Man shall give unto you ; for on Him hath God the Father set His seal. ”
KJ21	John	6	28	Then said they unto Him , “ What shall we do , that we might work the works of God ? ”
KJ21	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said unto them , “ This is the work of God : that ye believe in Him whom He hath sent. ”
KJ21	John	6	30	They said therefore unto Him , “ What sign showest thou then , that we may see and believe thee ? What works dost thou do ?
KJ21	John	6	31	Our fathers ate manna in the desert ; as it is written : ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ’ ”
KJ21	John	6	32	Then Jesus said unto them , “ Verily , verily I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from Heaven , but My Father giveth you the true bread from Heaven .
KJ21	John	6	33	For the bread of God is He that cometh down from Heaven , and giveth life unto the world. ”
KJ21	John	6	34	Then they said unto Him , “ Lord , evermore give us this bread. ”
KJ21	John	6	35	And Jesus said unto them , “ I am the Bread of Life . He that cometh to Me shall never hunger , and he that believeth in Me shall never thirst .
KJ21	John	6	36	But I said unto you that ye also have seen Me , and believe not .
KJ21	John	6	37	All that the Father giveth Me shall come to Me , and him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out .
KJ21	John	6	38	For I came down from Heaven , not to do Mine own will , but the will of Him that sent Me .
KJ21	John	6	39	And this is the Father ’ s will who hath sent Me , that of all which He hath given Me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the Last Day .
KJ21	John	6	40	And this is the will of Him that sent Me : that every one who seeth the Son and believeth in Him may have everlasting life , and I will raise him up at the Last Day. ”
KJ21	John	6	41	The Jews then murmured at Him , because He said , “ I am the Bread which came down from Heaven. ”
KJ21	John	6	42	And they said , “ Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How is it then that he saith , ‘ I came down from Heaven ’ ? ”
KJ21	John	6	43	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , “ Murmur not among yourselves .
KJ21	John	6	44	No man can come to Me unless the Father who hath sent Me draw him ; and I will raise him up at the Last Day .
KJ21	John	6	45	It is written in the Prophets : ‘ And they shall all be taught by God. ’ Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned from the Father cometh unto Me .
KJ21	John	6	46	Not that any man hath seen the Father , save He that is of God ; He hath seen the Father .
KJ21	John	6	47	Verily , verily I say unto you , He that believeth in Me hath everlasting life .
KJ21	John	6	48	I am that Bread of Life .
KJ21	John	6	49	Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
KJ21	John	6	50	This is the Bread which cometh down from Heaven , that a man may eat thereof and not die .
KJ21	John	6	51	I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven . If any man eat of this Bread , he shall live for ever ; and the Bread that I will give is My flesh , which I will give for the life of the world. ”
KJ21	John	6	52	The Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
KJ21	John	6	53	Then Jesus said unto them , “ Verily , verily I say unto you , unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood , ye have no life in you .
KJ21	John	6	54	Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath eternal life , and I will raise him up at the Last Day .
KJ21	John	6	55	For My flesh is meat indeed , and My blood is drink indeed .
KJ21	John	6	56	He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood dwelleth in Me , and I in him .
KJ21	John	6	57	As the living Father hath sent Me , and I live by the Father , so he that eateth Me , even he shall live by Me .
KJ21	John	6	58	This is that Bread which came down from Heaven , not as your fathers ate manna and are dead ; he that eateth of this Bread shall live for ever. ”
KJ21	John	6	59	These things said He in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum .
KJ21	John	6	60	Many of His disciples therefore , when they had heard this , said , “ This is a hard saying ; who can hear it ? ”
KJ21	John	6	61	When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples murmured at it , He said unto them , “ Doth this offend you ?
KJ21	John	6	62	What if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before ?
KJ21	John	6	63	It is the Spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing . The words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
KJ21	John	6	64	But there are some of you that believe not. ” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who believed not and who should betray Him .
KJ21	John	6	65	And He said , “ Therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto Me , unless it were given unto him by My Father. ”
KJ21	John	6	66	From that time many of His disciples went back and walked no more with Him .
KJ21	John	6	67	Then Jesus said unto the twelve , “ Will ye also go away ? ”
KJ21	John	6	68	Then Simon Peter answered Him , “ Lord , to whom shall we go ? Thou hast the words of eternal life ,
KJ21	John	6	69	and we believe and are sure that Thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God. ”
KJ21	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , “ Have not I chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ? ”
KJ21	John	6	71	He spoke of Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , for he it was who should betray Him , being one of the twelve .
KJ21	John	7	7	The world can not hate you , but Me it hateth , because I testify of it that the works thereof are evil .
KJ21	John	7	2	Now the Jews ’ Feast of Tabernacles was at hand .
KJ21	John	7	3	His brethren therefore said unto Him , “ Depart hence and go into Judea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest .
KJ21	John	7	4	For no man doeth anything in secret if he himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou do these things , show thyself to the world. ”
KJ21	John	7	5	For neither did His brethren believe in Him .
KJ21	John	7	6	Then Jesus said unto them , “ My time is not yet come , but your time is always ready .
KJ21	John	7	8	Go ye up unto this feast . I go not up yet unto this feast , for My time is not yet fully come. ”
KJ21	John	7	9	When He had said these words unto them , He remained still in Galilee .
KJ21	John	7	10	But when His brethren had gone up , then He also went up unto the feast , not openly but , as it were , in secret .
KJ21	John	7	11	Then the Jews sought Him at the feast and said , “ Where is he ? ”
KJ21	John	7	12	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning Him . For some said , “ He is a good man , ” and others said , “ Nay , for he deceiveth the people. ”
KJ21	John	7	13	Yet no man spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews .
KJ21	John	7	14	Now about the midst of the feast , Jesus went up into the temple and taught .
KJ21	John	7	15	And the Jews marveled , saying , “ How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ? ”
KJ21	John	7	16	Jesus answered them , “ My doctrine is not Mine , but His that sent Me .
KJ21	John	7	17	If any man will do His will , he shall know of the doctrine whether it be from God , or whether I speak from Myself .
KJ21	John	7	18	He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory ; but He that seeketh the glory of Him that sent Him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in Him .
KJ21	John	7	19	Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill Me ? ”
KJ21	John	7	20	The people answered and said , “ Thou hast a devil . Who goeth about to kill thee ? ”
KJ21	John	7	21	Jesus answered and said unto them , “ I have done one work , and ye all marvel .
KJ21	John	7	22	Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ) , and ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man .
KJ21	John	7	23	If a man receive circumcision on the Sabbath day , that the Law of Moses should not be broken , are ye angry at Me because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day ?
KJ21	John	7	24	Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment. ”
KJ21	John	7	25	Then said some of them from Jerusalem , “ Is not this he whom they seek to kill ?
KJ21	John	7	26	But lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ?
KJ21	John	7	27	Yet we know from whence this man comes ; but when Christ cometh , no man will know from whence He comes. ”
KJ21	John	7	28	Then Jesus cried out in the temple as He taught , saying , “ Ye both know Me , and ye know from whence I am . And I am not come of Myself , but He that sent Me is true , whom ye know not .
KJ21	John	7	29	But I know Him , for I am from Him , and He hath sent Me. ”
KJ21	John	7	30	Then they sought to take Him ; but no man laid hands on Him , because His hour had not yet come .
KJ21	John	7	31	And many of the people believed in Him and said , “ When Christ cometh , will He do more miracles than these which this man hath done ? ”
KJ21	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning Him , and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him .
KJ21	John	7	33	Then said Jesus unto them , “ Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go unto Him that sent Me .
KJ21	John	7	34	Ye shall seek Me , and shall not find Me ; and where I am , thither ye can not come. ”
KJ21	John	7	35	Then the Jews said among themselves , “ Whither will he go that we shall not find him ? Will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ?
KJ21	John	7	36	What manner of saying is this that he said , ‘ Ye shall seek me and shall not find me ; and where I am , thither ye can not come ’ ? ”
KJ21	John	7	37	On the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , saying , “ If any man thirst , let him come unto Me , and drink .
KJ21	John	7	38	He that believeth in Me , as the Scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. ”
KJ21	John	7	39	( But this He spoke of the Spirit , whom those who believe in Him should receive ; for the Holy Ghost was not yet given , because Jesus was not yet glorified . )
KJ21	John	7	40	Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , “ In truth this is the Prophet. ”
KJ21	John	7	41	Others said , “ This is the Christ. ” But some said , “ Shall Christ come out of Galilee ?
KJ21	John	7	42	Hath not the Scripture said that Christ cometh out of the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem where David was ? ”
KJ21	John	7	43	So there was a division among the people because of Him .
KJ21	John	7	44	And some of them would have taken Him , but no man laid hands on Him .
KJ21	John	7	45	Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees , who said unto them , “ Why have ye not brought him ? ”
KJ21	John	7	46	The officers answered , “ Never did man speak like this man ! ”
KJ21	John	7	47	Then the Pharisees answered them , “ Are ye also deceived ?
KJ21	John	7	48	Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him ?
KJ21	John	7	49	But this people , who knoweth not the law , are cursed. ”
KJ21	John	7	50	Nicodemus said unto them ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them ) ,
KJ21	John	7	51	“ Doth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth ? ”
KJ21	John	7	52	They answered and said unto him , “ Art thou also from Galilee ? Search and look , for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. ”
KJ21	John	7	53	And every man went unto his own house .
KJ21	John	8	8	And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground .
KJ21	John	8	2	And early in the morning He came again into the temple , and all the people came unto Him ; and He sat down and taught them .
KJ21	John	8	3	And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto Him a woman taken in adultery . And when they had set her in the midst ,
KJ21	John	8	4	they said unto Him , “ Master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
KJ21	John	8	5	Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou ? ”
KJ21	John	8	6	This they said testing Him , that they might have cause to accuse Him . But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground , as though He heard them not .
KJ21	John	8	7	So when they continued asking Him , He lifted Himself up and said unto them , “ He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her. ”
KJ21	John	8	9	And they who heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning with the eldest even unto the last , and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing in the midst .
KJ21	John	8	10	When Jesus had lifted Himself up and saw none but the woman , He said unto her , “ Woman , where are those thine accusers ? Hath no man condemned thee ? ”
KJ21	John	8	11	She said , “ No man , Lord. ” And Jesus said unto her , “ Neither do I condemn thee ; go , and sin no more. ”
KJ21	John	8	12	Then spoke Jesus again unto them , saying , “ I am the Light of the world . He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life. ”
KJ21	John	8	13	The Pharisees therefore said unto Him , “ Thou bearest record of thyself ; thy record is not true. ”
KJ21	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said unto them , “ Though I bear record of Myself , yet My record is true , for I know whence I came and whither I go ; but ye can not tell whence I come and whither I go .
KJ21	John	8	15	Ye judge according to the flesh ; I judge no man .
KJ21	John	8	16	And yet if I judge , My judgment is true ; for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent Me .
KJ21	John	8	17	It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true .
KJ21	John	8	18	I am One that bear witness of Myself , and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me. ”
KJ21	John	8	19	Then they said unto Him , “ Where is thy father ? ” Jesus answered , “ Ye neither know Me , nor My Father . If ye had known Me , ye should have known My Father also. ”
KJ21	John	8	20	These words spoke Jesus in the treasury as He taught in the temple , and no man laid hands on Him , for His hour was not yet come .
KJ21	John	8	21	Then Jesus said again unto them , “ I go My way , and ye shall seek Me , and shall die in your sins . Whither I go , ye can not come. ”
KJ21	John	8	22	Then said the Jews , “ Will he kill himself , because he saith , ‘ Whither I go ye can not come ’ ? ”
KJ21	John	8	23	And He said unto them , “ Ye are from beneath ; I am from above . Ye are of this world ; I am not of this world .
KJ21	John	8	24	I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins ; for if ye believe not that I am He , ye shall die in your sins. ”
KJ21	John	8	25	Then they said unto Him , “ Who art thou ? ” And Jesus said unto them , “ Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning .
KJ21	John	8	26	I have many things to say and to judge of you , but He that sent Me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of Him. ”
KJ21	John	8	27	They understood not that He spoke to them of the Father .
KJ21	John	8	28	Then said Jesus unto them , “ When ye have lifted up the Son of Man , then shall ye know that I am He , and that I do nothing of Myself ; but as My Father hath taught Me , I speak these things .
KJ21	John	8	29	And He that sent Me is with Me . The Father hath not left Me alone , for I do always those things that please Him. ”
KJ21	John	8	30	As He spoke those words , many believed in Him .
KJ21	John	8	31	Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed in Him , “ If ye continue in My Word , then are ye My disciples indeed .
KJ21	John	8	32	And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free. ”
KJ21	John	8	33	They answered Him , “ We are Abraham ’ s seed , and were never in bondage to any man . How sayest thou , ‘ Ye shall be made free ’ ? ”
KJ21	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , “ Verily , verily I say unto you , whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin .
KJ21	John	8	35	And the servant abideth not in the house for ever , but the Son abideth ever .
KJ21	John	8	36	If the Son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
KJ21	John	8	37	I know that ye are Abraham ’ s seed , but ye seek to kill Me , because My Word hath no place in you .
KJ21	John	8	38	I speak that which I have seen with My Father , and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. ”
KJ21	John	8	39	They answered and said unto Him , “ Abraham is our father. ” Jesus said unto them , “ If ye were Abraham ’ s children , ye would do the works of Abraham .
KJ21	John	8	40	But now ye seek to kill Me , a Man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard from God : this did not Abraham .
KJ21	John	8	41	Ye do the deeds of your father. ” Then they said to Him , “ We are not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God. ”
KJ21	John	8	42	Jesus said unto them , “ If God were your Father , ye would love Me , for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of Myself , but He sent Me .
KJ21	John	8	43	Why do ye not understand My speech ? Even because ye can not hear My Word !
KJ21	John	8	44	Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own , for he is a liar and the father of it .
KJ21	John	8	45	And because I tell you the truth , ye believe Me not .
KJ21	John	8	46	Which of you convicteth Me of sin ? And if I say the truth , why do ye not believe Me ?
KJ21	John	8	47	He that is of God heareth God ’ s words ; ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of God. ”
KJ21	John	8	48	Then the Jews answered and said unto Him , “ Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a devil ? ”
KJ21	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I have not a devil , but I honor My Father , and ye do dishonor Me .
KJ21	John	8	50	And I seek not Mine own glory ; there is One that seeketh and judgeth .
KJ21	John	8	51	Verily , verily I say unto you , if a man keep My saying , he shall never see death. ”
KJ21	John	8	52	Then said the Jews unto Him , “ Now we know that thou hast a devil ! Abraham is dead and the prophets ; and thou sayest , ‘ If a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death. ’
KJ21	John	8	53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham , who is dead ? And the prophets are dead . Whom makest thou thyself ? ”
KJ21	John	8	54	Jesus answered , “ If I honor Myself , My honor is nothing . It is My Father that honoreth Me , of whom ye say that He is your God .
KJ21	John	8	55	Yet ye have not known Him , but I know Him . And if I should say , ‘ I know Him not , ’ I shall be a liar like unto you . But I know Him and keep His saying .
KJ21	John	8	56	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day ; and He saw it and was glad. ”
KJ21	John	8	57	Then said the Jews unto Him , “ Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ? ”
KJ21	John	8	58	Jesus said unto them , “ Verily , verily I say unto you , before Abraham was , I am ! ”
KJ21	John	8	59	Then they took up stones to cast at Him ; but Jesus hid Himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
KJ21	John	9	9	Some said , “ This is he. ” Others said , “ He is like him. ” But he said , “ I am he ! ”
KJ21	John	9	2	And His disciples asked Him , saying , “ Master , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? ”
KJ21	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ Neither hath this man sinned nor his parents , but that the works of God should be made manifest in him .
KJ21	John	9	4	I must work the works of Him that sent Me while it is day ; the night cometh when no man can work .
KJ21	John	9	5	As long as I am in the world , I am the Light of the world. ”
KJ21	John	9	6	When He had thus spoken , He spat on the ground and made clay with the spittle ; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay
KJ21	John	9	7	and said unto him , “ Go , wash in the pool of Siloam ” ( which interpreted means , “ Sent ” ) . He went his way therefore and washed , and came back seeing .
KJ21	John	9	8	The neighbors therefore , and those who before had seen that he was blind , said , “ Is not this he that sat and begged ? ”
KJ21	John	9	10	Therefore they said unto him , “ How were thine eyes opened ? ”
KJ21	John	9	11	He answered and said , “ A man who is called Jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , ‘ Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. ’ And I went and washed , and I received sight. ”
KJ21	John	9	12	Then they said unto him , “ Where is he ? ” He said , “ I know not. ”
KJ21	John	9	13	They brought to the Pharisees him that beforehand was blind .
KJ21	John	9	14	And it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes .
KJ21	John	9	15	Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . He said unto them , “ He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed and do see. ”
KJ21	John	9	16	Therefore some of the Pharisees said , “ This man is not of God , because he keepeth not the Sabbath day. ” Others said , “ How can a man who is a sinner do such miracles ? ” And there was a division among them .
KJ21	John	9	17	They said unto the blind man again , “ What sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ? ” He said , “ He is a prophet. ”
KJ21	John	9	18	But the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
KJ21	John	9	19	And they asked them , saying , “ Is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? How then doth he now see ? ”
KJ21	John	9	20	His parents answered them and said , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind ;
KJ21	John	9	21	but by what means he now seeth we know not , or who hath opened his eyes we know not . He is of age ; ask him . He shall speak for himself. ”
KJ21	John	9	22	These words spoke his parents , because they feared the Jews ; for the Jews had agreed already that if any man confessed that He was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
KJ21	John	9	23	Therefore said his parents , “ He is of age ; ask him. ”
KJ21	John	9	24	Then they again called the man who was blind and said unto him , “ Give God the praise ! We know that this man is a sinner. ”
KJ21	John	9	25	He answered and said , “ Whether he be a sinner or not , I know not . One thing I know , that whereas I was blind , now I see. ”
KJ21	John	9	26	Then said they to him again , “ What did he do to thee ? How opened he thine eyes ? ”
KJ21	John	9	27	He answered them , “ I have told you already , and ye did not hear . Why would ye hear it again ? Will ye also be his disciples ? ”
KJ21	John	9	28	Then they reviled him and said , “ Thou art his disciple , but we are Moses ’ disciples .
KJ21	John	9	29	We know that God spoke unto Moses . As for this fellow , we know not from whence he is. ”
KJ21	John	9	30	The man answered and said unto them , “ Why , herein is a marvelous thing : that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
KJ21	John	9	31	Now we know that God heareth not sinners , but if any man be a worshiper of God and doeth His will , him He heareth .
KJ21	John	9	32	Since the world began it was not heard that any man opened the eyes of one who was born blind .
KJ21	John	9	33	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing. ”
KJ21	John	9	34	They answered and said unto him , “ Thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? ” And they cast him out .
KJ21	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out . And when He had found him , He said unto him , “ Dost thou believe in the Son of God ? ”
KJ21	John	9	36	He answered and said , “ Who is he , Lord , that I might believe in him ? ”
KJ21	John	9	37	And Jesus said unto him , “ Thou hast both seen Him , and it is He that talketh with thee. ”
KJ21	John	9	38	And he said , “ Lord , I believe ! ” And he worshiped Him .
KJ21	John	9	39	And Jesus said , “ For judgment I am come into this world , that they that see not might see , and that they that see might be made blind. ”
KJ21	John	9	40	And some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words , and said unto Him , “ Are we blind also ? ”
KJ21	John	9	41	Jesus said unto them , “ If ye were blind , ye should have no sin ; but now ye say , ‘ We see. ’ Therefore your sin remaineth .
KJ21	John	10	10	The thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and to destroy . I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
KJ21	John	10	2	But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
KJ21	John	10	3	To him the doorkeeper openeth , and the sheep hear his voice ; and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out .
KJ21	John	10	4	And when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them and the sheep follow him , for they know his voice .
KJ21	John	10	5	And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him , for they know not the voice of strangers. ”
KJ21	John	10	6	This parable Jesus spoke unto them , but they understood not what things they were which He spoke unto them .
KJ21	John	10	7	Then said Jesus unto them again , “ Verily , verily I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep .
KJ21	John	10	8	All that ever came before Me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them .
KJ21	John	10	9	I am the door ; by Me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
KJ21	John	10	11	I am the Good Shepherd ; the Good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep .
KJ21	John	10	12	But he that is a hireling and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth ; and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep .
KJ21	John	10	13	The hireling fleeth because he is a hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
KJ21	John	10	14	I am the Good Shepherd , and know My sheep and am known by Mine .
KJ21	John	10	15	As the Father knoweth Me , even so know I the Father ; and I lay down My life for the sheep .
KJ21	John	10	16	And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold . Them also I must bring , and they shall hear My voice ; and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd .
KJ21	John	10	17	Therefore doth My Father love Me , because I lay down My life , that I might take it again .
KJ21	John	10	18	No man taketh it from Me , but I lay it down of Myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This commandment have I received from My Father. ”
KJ21	John	10	19	There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings .
KJ21	John	10	20	And many of them said , “ He hath a devil and is mad . Why hear ye him ? ”
KJ21	John	10	21	Others said , “ These are not the words of him that hath a devil . Can a devil open the eyes of the blind ? ”
KJ21	John	10	22	And it was at Jerusalem the Feast of the Dedication , and it was winter .
KJ21	John	10	23	And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon ’ s Porch .
KJ21	John	10	24	Then came the Jews round about Him and said unto Him , “ How long dost thou make us to doubt ? If thou be the Christ , tell us plainly. ”
KJ21	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , “ I told you , and ye believed not . The works that I do in My Father ’ s name , they bear witness of Me .
KJ21	John	10	26	But ye believe not , because ye are not of My sheep , as I said unto you .
KJ21	John	10	27	My sheep hear My voice , and I know them and they follow Me .
KJ21	John	10	28	And I give unto them eternal life , and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand .
KJ21	John	10	29	My Father , who gave them to Me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of My Father ’ s hand .
KJ21	John	10	30	I and My Father are one. ”
KJ21	John	10	31	Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him .
KJ21	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , “ Many good works have I shown you from My Father . For which of those works do ye stone Me ? ”
KJ21	John	10	33	The Jews answered Him , saying , “ For a good work we stone thee not , but for blasphemy and because thou , being a man , makest thyself God. ”
KJ21	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , “ Is it not written in your law , ‘ I said “ Ye are gods ” ’ ?
KJ21	John	10	35	If He called them gods unto whom the Word of God came ( and the Scripture can not be broken ) ,
KJ21	John	10	36	do ye say of Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world , ‘ Thou blasphemest , ’ because I said , ‘ I am the Son of God ’ ?
KJ21	John	10	37	If I do not the works of My Father , believe Me not .
KJ21	John	10	38	But if I do , though ye believe not Me , believe the works , that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me , and I in Him. ”
KJ21	John	10	39	Therefore they sought again to take Him , but He escaped out of their hand ,
KJ21	John	10	40	and went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John had first baptized ; and there He abode .
KJ21	John	10	41	And many resorted unto Him and said that John did no miracle , but all things that John spoke of this Man were true .
KJ21	John	10	42	And many believed in Him there .
KJ21	John	11	11	These things said He , and after that He said unto them , “ Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go , that I may awaken him out of sleep. ”
KJ21	John	11	2	( It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . )
KJ21	John	11	3	Therefore his sisters sent unto Him , saying , “ Lord , behold , he whom Thou lovest is sick. ”
KJ21	John	11	4	When Jesus heard that , He said , “ This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. ”
KJ21	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
KJ21	John	11	6	When He heard therefore that Lazarus was sick , He stayed two days still in the same place where He was .
KJ21	John	11	7	Then after that He said to His disciples , “ Let us go into Judea again. ”
KJ21	John	11	8	His disciples said unto Him , “ Master , the Jews of late sought to stone Thee , and goest Thou thither again ? ”
KJ21	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any man walk in the day he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
KJ21	John	11	10	But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth because there is no light in him. ”
KJ21	John	11	12	Then said His disciples , “ Lord , if he sleep he shall do well. ”
KJ21	John	11	13	However Jesus spoke of his death , but they thought that He had spoken of the taking of rest in sleep .
KJ21	John	11	14	Then Jesus said unto them plainly , “ Lazarus is dead .
KJ21	John	11	15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent that ye may believe . Nevertheless let us go unto him. ”
KJ21	John	11	16	Then Thomas , who was called Didymus , said unto his fellow disciples , “ Let us also go , that we may die with Him. ”
KJ21	John	11	17	Then when Jesus came , He found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
KJ21	John	11	18	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about two miles away ,
KJ21	John	11	19	and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother .
KJ21	John	11	20	Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met Him ; but Mary sat still in the house .
KJ21	John	11	21	Then Martha said unto Jesus , “ Lord , if Thou hadst been here , my brother would not have died .
KJ21	John	11	22	But I know that even now , whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God , God will give it Thee. ”
KJ21	John	11	23	Jesus said unto her , “ Thy brother shall rise again. ”
KJ21	John	11	24	Martha said unto Him , “ I know that he shall rise again at the resurrection on the Last Day. ”
KJ21	John	11	25	Jesus said unto her , “ I am the resurrection and the Life . He that believeth in Me , though he were dead , yet shall he live ;
KJ21	John	11	26	and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die . Believest thou this ? ”
KJ21	John	11	27	She said unto Him , “ Yea , Lord , I believe that Thou art the Christ , the Son of God , who should come into the world. ”
KJ21	John	11	28	And when she had so said , she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , “ The Master has come , and calleth for thee. ”
KJ21	John	11	29	As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly and came unto Him .
KJ21	John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Martha met Him .
KJ21	John	11	31	The Jews then , who were with her in the house and comforting her , when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , “ She goeth unto the grave to weep there. ”
KJ21	John	11	32	Then when Mary had come where Jesus was and saw Him , she fell down at His feet , saying unto Him , “ Lord , if Thou hadst been here , my brother would not have died. ”
KJ21	John	11	33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping who came with her , He groaned in the spirit and was troubled ,
KJ21	John	11	34	and said , “ Where have ye laid him ? ” They said unto Him , “ Lord , come and see. ”
KJ21	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
KJ21	John	11	36	Then said the Jews , “ Behold , how he loved him ! ”
KJ21	John	11	37	And some of them said , “ Could not this man , who opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ? ”
KJ21	John	11	38	Jesus therefore again , groaning in Himself , came to the grave . It was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
KJ21	John	11	39	Jesus said , “ Take ye away the stone. ” Martha , the sister of him that was dead , said unto Him , “ Lord , by this time there is a stench , for he hath been dead four days. ”
KJ21	John	11	40	Jesus said unto her , “ Said I not unto thee that if thou would believe , thou should see the glory of God ? ”
KJ21	John	11	41	Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said , “ Father , I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me .
KJ21	John	11	42	And I knew that Thou hearest Me always , but because of the people who stand by I said it , that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me. ”
KJ21	John	11	43	And when He thus had spoken , He cried with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come forth ! ”
KJ21	John	11	44	And he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes , and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus said unto them , “ Loose him , and let him go. ”
KJ21	John	11	45	Then many of the Jews who came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did , believed in Him .
KJ21	John	11	46	But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees , and told them what things Jesus had done .
KJ21	John	11	47	Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council and said , “ What shall we do ? For this man doeth many miracles .
KJ21	John	11	48	If we let him thus alone , all men will believe in him , and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. ”
KJ21	John	11	49	And one of them named Caiaphas , being the high priest that same year , said unto them , “ Ye know nothing at all ,
KJ21	John	11	50	nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not. ”
KJ21	John	11	51	And he spoke this not of himself , but , being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation ;
KJ21	John	11	52	and not for that nation only , but that also He should gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad .
KJ21	John	11	53	So from that day forth , they took counsel together to put Him to death .
KJ21	John	11	54	Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews , but went thence unto a region near the wilderness into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with His disciples .
KJ21	John	11	55	And the Jews ’ Passover was nigh at hand , and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves .
KJ21	John	11	56	Then they sought for Jesus and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple , saying , “ What think ye — that he will not come to the feast ? ”
KJ21	John	11	57	Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command that if any man knew where He was , he should report it , that they might take Him .
KJ21	John	12	12	On the next day many people who had come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
KJ21	John	12	2	There they made Him a supper ; and Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him .
KJ21	John	12	3	Then Mary took a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair ; and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment .
KJ21	John	12	4	Then one of His disciples , Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son who was to betray Him , said ,
KJ21	John	12	5	“ Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor ? ”
KJ21	John	12	6	This he said , not that he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and had the money bag and took what was put therein .
KJ21	John	12	7	Then Jesus said , “ Let her alone ; against the day of My burying hath she kept this .
KJ21	John	12	8	For the poor always ye have with you , but Me ye have not always. ”
KJ21	John	12	9	Many people of the Jews therefore knew that He was there . And they came not for Jesus ’ sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom He had raised from the dead .
KJ21	John	12	10	But the chief priests consulted , that they might put Lazarus also to death ,
KJ21	John	12	11	because by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus .
KJ21	John	12	13	took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet Him and cried , “ Hosanna ! Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord ! ”
KJ21	John	12	14	And Jesus , when He had found a young ass , sat thereon , as it is written :
KJ21	John	12	15	“ Fear not , daughter of Zion ; behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass ’ s colt. ”
KJ21	John	12	16	These things His disciples understood not at first ; but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written of Him , and that they had done these things unto Him .
KJ21	John	12	17	The people therefore who were with Him , when He called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead , bore record .
KJ21	John	12	18	For this cause the people also met Him , for they heard that He had done this miracle .
KJ21	John	12	19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , “ Perceive ye how ye prevail not at all ? Behold , the world has gone after him ! ”
KJ21	John	12	20	And there were certain Greeks among them , who came up to worship at the feast .
KJ21	John	12	21	They came therefore to Philip , who was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and asked him , saying , “ Sir , we would see Jesus. ”
KJ21	John	12	22	Philip went and told Andrew , and again Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
KJ21	John	12	23	And Jesus answered them , saying , “ The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified .
KJ21	John	12	24	Verily , verily I say unto you , unless a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone ; but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
KJ21	John	12	25	He that loveth his life shall lose it , and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
KJ21	John	12	26	If any man serve Me , let him follow Me ; and where I am , there shall also My servant be . If any man serve Me , him will My Father honor .
KJ21	John	12	27	“ Now is My soul troubled , and what shall I say ? ‘ Father , save Me from this hour ’ ? But for this cause came I unto this hour .
KJ21	John	12	28	Father , glorify Thy name. ” Then there came a voice from Heaven , saying , “ I Have Both Glorified It , And Will Glorify It Again. ”
KJ21	John	12	29	The people therefore who stood by and heard it said that it thundered . Others said , “ An angel spoke to him. ”
KJ21	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said , “ This voice came not because of Me , but for your sakes .
KJ21	John	12	31	Now is the judgment of this world ; now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
KJ21	John	12	32	And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto Me. ”
KJ21	John	12	33	This He said , signifying what death He should die .
KJ21	John	12	34	The people answered Him , “ We have heard from the law that Christ abideth for ever ; and how sayest thou , ‘ The Son of Man must be lifted up ’ ? Who is this son of man ? ”
KJ21	John	12	35	Then Jesus said unto them , “ Yet a little while is the Light with you . Walk while ye have the Light , lest darkness come upon you ; for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
KJ21	John	12	36	While ye have Light , believe in the Light , that ye may be the children of Light. ” These things spoke Jesus , and departed and hid Himself from them .
KJ21	John	12	37	But though He had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not in Him ,
KJ21	John	12	38	that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spoke : “ Lord , who hath believed our report ? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ”
KJ21	John	12	39	Therefore they could not believe , because as Isaiah said again :
KJ21	John	12	40	“ He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart , that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them. ”
KJ21	John	12	41	These things said Isaiah when he saw His glory and spoke of Him .
KJ21	John	12	42	Nevertheless , among the chief rulers also , many believed in Him , but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue ;
KJ21	John	12	43	for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
KJ21	John	12	44	Jesus cried out and said , “ He that believeth in Me , believeth not in Me , but in Him that sent Me .
KJ21	John	12	45	And he that seeth Me , seeth Him that sent Me .
KJ21	John	12	46	I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth in Me should not abide in darkness .
KJ21	John	12	47	And if any man hear My words and believe not , I judge him not ; for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
KJ21	John	12	48	He that rejecteth Me and receiveth not My words , hath One that judgeth him ; the Word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the Last Day .
KJ21	John	12	49	For I have not spoken of Myself ; but the Father who sent Me , He gave Me a commandment , what I should say and what I should speak .
KJ21	John	12	50	And I know that His commandment is life everlasting . Whatsoever I speak therefore , even as the Father said unto Me , so I speak . ”
KJ21	John	13	13	Ye call Me Master and Lord ; and ye say well , for so I am .
KJ21	John	13	2	And supper being ended , and the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son , to betray Him ,
KJ21	John	13	3	Jesus , knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands and that He had come from God and was going to God ,
KJ21	John	13	4	rose from supper and laid aside His garments , and took a towel and girded Himself .
KJ21	John	13	5	After that He poured water into a basin , and began to wash the disciples ’ feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded .
KJ21	John	13	6	Then came He to Simon Peter , and Peter said unto Him , “ Lord , dost Thou wash my feet ? ”
KJ21	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said unto him , “ What I do thou knowest not now , but thou shalt know hereafter. ”
KJ21	John	13	8	Peter said unto Him , “ Thou shalt never wash my feet. ” Jesus answered him , “ If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with Me. ”
KJ21	John	13	9	Simon Peter said unto Him , “ Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head. ”
KJ21	John	13	10	Jesus said to him , “ He that is washed needeth not but to wash his feet , but is clean every whit . And ye are clean , but not all. ”
KJ21	John	13	11	( For He knew who would betray Him ; therefore He said , “ Ye are not all clean. ” )
KJ21	John	13	12	So after He had washed their feet and had taken His garments and had sat down again , He said unto them , “ Know ye what I have done to you ?
KJ21	John	13	14	If I then , your Lord and Master , have washed your feet , ye also ought to wash one another ’ s feet .
KJ21	John	13	15	For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you .
KJ21	John	13	16	Verily , verily I say unto you , the servant is not greater than his lord , neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
KJ21	John	13	17	If ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
KJ21	John	13	18	“ I speak not of you all . I know whom I have chosen ; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled , ‘ He that eateth bread with Me hath lifted up his heel against Me. ’
KJ21	John	13	19	Now I tell you before it come that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am He .
KJ21	John	13	20	Verily , verily I say unto you , he that receiveth whomsoever I send , receiveth Me ; and he that receiveth Me , receiveth Him that sentMe. ”
KJ21	John	13	21	When Jesus had thus said , He was troubled in spirit , and testified and said , “ Verily , verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray Me. ”
KJ21	John	13	22	Then the disciples looked at one another , not knowing of whom He spoke .
KJ21	John	13	23	Now there was leaning on Jesus ’ bosom one of His disciples , whom Jesus loved .
KJ21	John	13	24	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom He spoke .
KJ21	John	13	25	He then , leaning on Jesus ’ breast , said unto Him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
KJ21	John	13	26	Jesus answered , “ He it is to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it. ” And when He had dipped the sop , He gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
KJ21	John	13	27	And after the sop , Satan entered into him . Then Jesus said unto him , “ What thou doest , do quickly. ”
KJ21	John	13	28	Now no man at the table knew with what intent He spoke this unto him .
KJ21	John	13	29	For some of them thought , because Judas had the money bag , that Jesus had said unto him , “ Buy those things that we have need of for the feast , ” or that he should give something to the poor .
KJ21	John	13	30	Judas then , having received the sop , went immediately out . And it was night .
KJ21	John	13	31	Therefore when he had gone out , Jesus said , “ Now is the Son of Man glorified , and God is glorified in Him .
KJ21	John	13	32	If God be glorified in Him , God shall also glorify Him in Himself , and shall straightway glorify Him .
KJ21	John	13	33	Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek Me ; and as I said unto the Jews , ‘ Whither I go ye can not come , ’ so now say I to you .
KJ21	John	13	34	A new commandment I give unto you : that ye love one another , as I have loved you , that ye also love one another .
KJ21	John	13	35	By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples : if ye have love one for another. ”
KJ21	John	13	36	Simon Peter said unto Him , “ Lord , whither goest Thou ? ” Jesus answered him , “ Whither I go thou canst not follow Me now , but thou shalt follow Me afterwards. ”
KJ21	John	13	37	Peter said unto Him , “ Lord , why can not I follow Thee now ? I will lay down my life for Thy sake. ”
KJ21	John	13	38	Jesus answered him , “ Wilt thou lay down thy life for My sake ? Verily , verily I say unto thee , the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied Me thrice .
KJ21	John	14	14	If ye shall ask anything in My name , I will do it .
KJ21	John	14	2	In My Father ’ s house are many mansions ; if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
KJ21	John	14	3	And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again and receive you unto Myself , that where I am , there ye may be also .
KJ21	John	14	4	And whither I go ye know , and the way ye know. ”
KJ21	John	14	5	Thomas said unto Him , “ Lord , we know not whither Thou goest ; and how can we know the way ? ”
KJ21	John	14	6	Jesus said unto him , “ I am the Way , the Truth , and the Life ; no man cometh unto the Father , but by Me .
KJ21	John	14	7	If ye had known Me , ye should have known My Father also ; and from henceforth ye know Him , and have seen Him. ”
KJ21	John	14	8	Philip said unto Him , “ Lord , show us the Father , and it sufficeth us. ”
KJ21	John	14	9	Jesus said unto him , “ Have I been so long a time with you , and yet hast thou not known Me , Philip ? He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father ; and how sayest thou then , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
KJ21	John	14	10	Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in Me ? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself ; but the Father that dwelleth in Me , He doeth the works .
KJ21	John	14	11	Believe Me that I am in the Father , and the Father in Me ; or else believe Me for the very works ’ sake .
KJ21	John	14	12	Verily , verily I say unto you , he that believeth in Me , the works that I do he shall do also ; and greater works than these shall he do , because I go unto My Father .
KJ21	John	14	13	And whatsoever ye shall ask in My name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
KJ21	John	14	15	“ If ye love Me , keep My commandments .
KJ21	John	14	16	And I will pray the Father , and He shall give you another Comforter , that He may abide with you for ever ”
KJ21	John	14	17	even the Spirit of Truth , whom the world can not receive , because it seeth Him not , neither knoweth Him . But ye know Him , for He dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
KJ21	John	14	18	“ I will not leave you comfortless ; I will come to you .
KJ21	John	14	19	Yet a little while and the world seeth Me no more , but ye see Me . Because I live , ye shall live also .
KJ21	John	14	20	At that day ye shall know that I am in My Father , and you in Me , and I in you .
KJ21	John	14	21	He that hath My commandments and keepeth them , he it is that loveth Me ; and he that loveth Me shall be loved by My Father , and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him. ”
KJ21	John	14	22	Judas ( not Iscariot ) said unto Him , “ Lord , how is it that Thou wilt manifest Thyself unto us , and not unto the world ? ”
KJ21	John	14	23	Jesus answered and said unto him , “ If a man love Me , he will keep My words ; and My Father will love him , and We will come unto him and make Our abode with him .
KJ21	John	14	24	He that loveth Me not , keepeth not My sayings . And the Word which you hear is not Mine , but the Father ’ s who sent Me .
KJ21	John	14	25	“ These things have I spoken unto you , being yet present with you .
KJ21	John	14	26	But the Comforter , who is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in My name , He shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said unto you .
KJ21	John	14	27	“ Peace I leave with you ; My peace I give unto you , not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
KJ21	John	14	28	Ye have heard how I said unto you , ‘ I go away and come again unto you. ’ If ye loved Me , ye would rejoice because I said , ‘ I go unto the Father , ’ for My Father is greater than I .
KJ21	John	14	29	And now I have told you before it come to pass , that when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
KJ21	John	14	30	“ Hereafter I will not talk much with you , for the prince of this world cometh , and hath nothing in Me .
KJ21	John	14	31	But that the world may know that I love the Father , as the Father gave Me commandment , even so I do . Arise , let us go hence .
KJ21	John	15	15	Henceforth I call you not servants , for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth ; but I have called you friends , for all things that I have heard of My Father , I have made known unto you .
KJ21	John	15	2	Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away ; and every branch that beareth fruit , He purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
KJ21	John	15	3	Now ye are clean through the Word which I have spoken unto you .
KJ21	John	15	4	“ Abide in Me , and I in you . As the branch can not bear fruit of itself , unless it abide in the vine , no more can ye , unless ye abide in Me .
KJ21	John	15	5	“ I am the vine , ye are the branches . He that abideth in Me and I in Him , the same bringeth forth much fruit , for without Me ye can do nothing .
KJ21	John	15	6	If a man abide not in Me , he is cast forth as a branch and is withered ; and men gather them and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
KJ21	John	15	7	If ye abide in Me , and My words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
KJ21	John	15	8	Herein is My Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be My disciples .
KJ21	John	15	9	“ As the Father hath loved Me , so have I loved you . Continue ye in My love .
KJ21	John	15	10	If ye keep My commandments , ye shall abide in My love , even as I have kept My Father ’ s commandments , and abide in His love .
KJ21	John	15	11	These things have I spoken unto you , that My joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
KJ21	John	15	12	“ This is My commandment : that ye love one another , as I have loved you .
KJ21	John	15	13	Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
KJ21	John	15	14	Ye are My friends if ye do whatsoever I command you .
KJ21	John	15	16	Ye have not chosen Me , but I have chosen you and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain , that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My name , He may give it to you .
KJ21	John	15	17	These things I command you , that ye love one another .
KJ21	John	15	18	“ If the world hate you , ye know that it hated Me before it hated you .
KJ21	John	15	19	If ye were of the world , the world would love his own ; but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
KJ21	John	15	20	Remember the word that I said unto you : ‘ The servant is not greater than his lord. ’ If they have persecuted Me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept My saying , they will keep yours also .
KJ21	John	15	21	But all these things will they do unto you for My name ’ s sake , because they know not Him that sent Me .
KJ21	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken unto them , they would not have sin , but now they have no cloak for their sin .
KJ21	John	15	23	He that hateth Me hateth My Father also .
KJ21	John	15	24	If I had not done among them the works which no other man did , they would not have had sin ; but now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father .
KJ21	John	15	25	But this cometh to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law : ‘ They hated Me without a cause. ’
KJ21	John	15	26	“ But when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of Truth who proceedeth from the Father , He shall testify of Me .
KJ21	John	15	27	And ye also shall bear witness , because ye have been with Me from the beginning .
KJ21	John	16	16	A little while , and ye shall not see Me ; and again a little while , and ye shall see Me , because I go to the Father. ”
KJ21	John	16	2	They shall put you out of the synagogues ; yea , the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service .
KJ21	John	16	3	And these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the Father , nor Me .
KJ21	John	16	4	But these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . “ And these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
KJ21	John	16	5	But now I go My way to Him that sent Me , and none of you asketh Me , ‘ Whither goest Thou ? ’
KJ21	John	16	6	But because I have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
KJ21	John	16	7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth . It is expedient for you that I go away , for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send Him unto you .
KJ21	John	16	8	And when He is come , He will reprove the world concerning sin , and concerning righteousness , and concerning judgment :
KJ21	John	16	9	concerning sin , because they believe not in Me ;
KJ21	John	16	10	concerning righteousness , because I go to My Father and ye see Me no more ;
KJ21	John	16	11	concerning judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
KJ21	John	16	12	“ I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now .
KJ21	John	16	13	However when He , the Spirit of Truth , is come , He will guide you into all truth ; for He shall not speak from Himself , but whatsoever He shall hear , that shall He speak ; and He will show you things to come .
KJ21	John	16	14	He shall glorify Me , for He shall receive of Mine , and shall show it unto you .
KJ21	John	16	15	All things that the Father hath are Mine ; therefore I said that He shall take of Mine , and shall show it unto you .
KJ21	John	16	17	Then said some of His disciples among themselves , “ What is this that He saith unto us , ‘ A little while , and ye shall not see Me ; and again a little while , and ye shall see Me , ’ and , ‘ because I go to the Father ’ ? ”
KJ21	John	16	18	They said therefore , “ What is this that He saith , ‘ A little while ’ ? We can not tell what He saith. ”
KJ21	John	16	19	Now Jesus knew that they were desirous of asking Him , and said unto them , “ Do ye inquire among yourselves of what I said , ‘ A little while , and ye shall not see Me ; and again a little while , and ye shall see Me ’ ?
KJ21	John	16	20	Verily , verily I say unto you that ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice ; and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
KJ21	John	16	21	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come ; but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for the joy that a man is born into the world .
KJ21	John	16	22	And ye now therefore have sorrow ; but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
KJ21	John	16	23	And in that day ye shall ask Me nothing . Verily , verily I say unto you , whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name , He will give it to you .
KJ21	John	16	24	Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My name . Ask and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
KJ21	John	16	25	“ These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs ; but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but I shall show you plainly of the Father .
KJ21	John	16	26	In that day ye shall ask in My name , and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you ;
KJ21	John	16	27	for the Father Himself loveth you , because ye have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God .
KJ21	John	16	28	I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world . Again , I leave the world and go to the Father. ”
KJ21	John	16	29	His disciples said unto Him , “ Lo , now speakest Thou plainly and speakest no proverb .
KJ21	John	16	30	Now are we sure that Thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask Thee . By this we believe that Thou camest forth from God. ”
KJ21	John	16	31	Jesus answered them , “ Do ye now believe ?
KJ21	John	16	32	Behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave Me alone . And yet I am not alone , because the Father is with Me .
KJ21	John	16	33	These things I have spoken unto you , that in Me ye might have peace . In the world ye shall have tribulation , but be of good cheer : I have overcome the world . ”
KJ21	John	17	17	Sanctify them through Thy truth : Thy Word is truth .
KJ21	John	17	2	as Thou hast given Him power over all flesh , that He should give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him .
KJ21	John	17	3	And this is life eternal : that they might know Thee , the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent .
KJ21	John	17	4	I have glorified Thee on the earth ; I have finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do .
KJ21	John	17	5	And now , O Father , glorify Thou Me with Thine own Self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was .
KJ21	John	17	6	“ I have manifested Thy name unto the men whom Thou gavest Me out of the world . Thine they were , and Thou gavest them to Me , and they have kept Thy Word .
KJ21	John	17	7	Now they have known that all things whatsoever Thou hast given Me are of Thee .
KJ21	John	17	8	For I have given unto them the Words which Thou gavest Me ; and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from Thee , and they have believed that Thou didst send Me .
KJ21	John	17	9	I pray for them ; I pray not for the world , but for them whom Thou hast given Me , for they are Thine .
KJ21	John	17	10	And all Mine are Thine , and Thine are Mine , and I am glorified in them .
KJ21	John	17	11	And now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to Thee . Holy Father , keep through Thine own name those whom Thou hast given Me , that they may be one , as We are .
KJ21	John	17	12	While I was with them in the world , I kept them in Thy name . Those that Thou gavest Me I have kept , and none of them is lost , but the son of perdition , that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
KJ21	John	17	13	“ And now come I to Thee , and these things I speak in the world , that they might have My joy fulfilled in themselves .
KJ21	John	17	14	I have given them Thy Word , and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
KJ21	John	17	15	I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
KJ21	John	17	16	They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
KJ21	John	17	18	As Thou hast sent Me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world .
KJ21	John	17	19	And for their sakes I sanctify Myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth .
KJ21	John	17	20	“ Neither pray I for these alone , but for them also who shall believe in Me through their word ,
KJ21	John	17	21	that they all may be one , as Thou , Father , art in Me and I in Thee , that they also may be one in Us , that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me .
KJ21	John	17	22	And the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given them , that they may be one , even as We are one :
KJ21	John	17	23	I in them and Thou in Me , that they may be made perfect in one , and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me and hast loved them , as Thou hast loved Me .
KJ21	John	17	24	“ Father , I will that they also , whom Thou hast given Me , be with Me where I am , that they may behold My glory which Thou hast given Me ; for Thou loved Me before the foundation of the world .
KJ21	John	17	25	“ O righteous Father , the world hath not known Thee , but I have known Thee , and these have known that Thou hast sent Me .
KJ21	John	17	26	And I have declared unto them Thy name , and will declare it , that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them , and I in them . ”
KJ21	John	18	18	And the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals , for it was cold and they warmed themselves . And Peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
KJ21	John	18	2	And Judas also , who betrayed Him , knew the place , for Jesus oftentimes resorted thither with His disciples .
KJ21	John	18	3	Judas then , having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees , came thither with lanterns and torches and weapons .
KJ21	John	18	4	Jesus therefore , knowing all things that should come upon Him , went forth and said unto them , “ Whom seek ye ? ”
KJ21	John	18	5	They answered Him , “ Jesus of Nazareth. ” Jesus said unto them , “ I am He. ” And Judas also , who betrayed Him , stood with them .
KJ21	John	18	6	As soon then as He had said unto them , “ I am He , ” they went backward and fell to the ground .
KJ21	John	18	7	Then asked He them again , “ Whom seek ye ? ” And they said , “ Jesus of Nazareth. ”
KJ21	John	18	8	Jesus answered , “ I have told you that I am He . If therefore ye seek Me , let these go their way , ”
KJ21	John	18	9	that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke , “ Of those that Thou gavest Me , have I lost none. ”
KJ21	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , having a sword , drew it and smote the high priest ’ s servant and cut off his right ear . The servant ’ s name was Malchus .
KJ21	John	18	11	Then said Jesus unto Peter , “ Put up thy sword into the sheath . The cup which My Father hath given Me , shall I not drink it ? ”
KJ21	John	18	12	Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound Him ,
KJ21	John	18	13	and led Him away to Annas first , for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was the high priest that same year .
KJ21	John	18	14	Now it was Caiaphas who gave counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
KJ21	John	18	15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple . That disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
KJ21	John	18	16	But Peter stood at the door outside . Then the other disciple , who was known unto the high priest , went out and spoke unto her who kept the door , and brought in Peter .
KJ21	John	18	17	Then the damsel who kept the door said unto Peter , “ Art not thou also one of this man ’ s disciples ? ” He said , “ I am not. ”
KJ21	John	18	19	The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and about His doctrine .
KJ21	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , “ I spoke openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the Jews always resort , and in secret have I said nothing .
KJ21	John	18	21	Why askest thou Me ? Ask them that heard Me what I have said unto them . Behold , they know what I said. ”
KJ21	John	18	22	And when He had thus spoken , one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , “ Answerest thou the high priest so ? ”
KJ21	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , “ If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil ; but if well , why smitest thou Me ? ”
KJ21	John	18	24	Now Annas had sent Him bound unto Caiaphas , the high priest .
KJ21	John	18	25	And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself . They said therefore unto him , “ Art not thou also one of his disciples ? ” He denied it and said , “ I am not. ”
KJ21	John	18	26	One of the servants of the high priest , being kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off , said , “ Did not I see thee in the garden with him ? ”
KJ21	John	18	27	Peter then denied again ; and immediately the cock crowed .
KJ21	John	18	28	Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment . And it was early , and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled , but that they might eat the Passover .
KJ21	John	18	29	Pilate then went out unto them and said , “ What accusation bring ye against this man ? ”
KJ21	John	18	30	They answered and said unto him , “ If he were not a malefactor , we would not have delivered him up unto thee. ”
KJ21	John	18	31	Then said Pilate unto them , “ Take ye him and judge him according to your law. ” The Jews therefore said unto him , “ It is not lawful for us to put any man to death , ”
KJ21	John	18	32	that the saying which Jesus had spoken , signifying what death He should die , might be fulfilled .
KJ21	John	18	33	Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again , and called Jesus and said unto Him , “ Art thou the King of the Jews ? ”
KJ21	John	18	34	Jesus answered him , “ Sayest thou this thing of thyself , or did others tell it thee of Me ? ”
KJ21	John	18	35	Pilate answered , “ Am I a Jew ? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me . What hast thou done ? ”
KJ21	John	18	36	Jesus answered , “ My Kingdom is not of this world . If My Kingdom were of this world , then would My servants fight , that I should not be delivered to the Jews . But now is My Kingdom not from hence. ”
KJ21	John	18	37	Pilate therefore said unto Him , “ Art thou a king then ? ” Jesus answered , “ Thou sayest that I am a king . To this end was I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth . Every one that is of the truth heareth My voice. ”
KJ21	John	18	38	Pilate said unto Him , “ What is truth ? ” And when he said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and said unto them , “ I find in him no fault at all .
KJ21	John	18	39	But ye have a custom that I should release unto you one at the Passover . Will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ? ”
KJ21	John	18	40	Then cried they all again , saying , “ Not this man , but Barabbas ! ” Now Barabbas was a robber .
KJ21	John	19	19	And Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross . And the writing was : Jesus Of Nazareth The King Of The Jews .
KJ21	John	19	2	And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns and put it on His head , and they put on Him a purple robe
KJ21	John	19	3	and said , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ” And they smote Him with their hands .
KJ21	John	19	4	Pilate therefore went forth again and said unto them , “ Behold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know that I find no fault in him. ”
KJ21	John	19	5	Then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . And Pilate said unto them , “ Behold the man ! ”
KJ21	John	19	6	When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw Him , they cried out , saying , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate said unto them , “ Ye take him and crucify him , for I find no fault in him. ”
KJ21	John	19	7	The Jews answered him , “ We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God. ”
KJ21	John	19	8	When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid .
KJ21	John	19	9	And he went again into the judgment hall and said unto Jesus , “ From whence art thou ? ” But Jesus gave him no answer .
KJ21	John	19	10	Then said Pilate unto Him , “ Speakest thou not unto me ? Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ? ”
KJ21	John	19	11	Jesus answered , “ Thou couldest have no power at all against Me , unless it were given thee from above . Therefore he that delivered Me unto thee hath the greater sin. ”
KJ21	John	19	12	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release Him , but the Jews cried out , saying , “ If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar ’ s friend . Whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. ”
KJ21	John	19	13	When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement , but in Hebrew , Gabbatha .
KJ21	John	19	14	And it was the Preparation of the Passover and about the sixth hour , and Pilate said unto the Jews , “ Behold your king ! ”
KJ21	John	19	15	But they cried out , “ Away with him , away with him ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate said unto them , “ Shall I crucify your king ? ” The chief priests answered , “ We have no king but Caesar ! ”
KJ21	John	19	16	Then he delivered Him therefore unto them to be crucified . And they took Jesus and led Him away .
KJ21	John	19	17	And He , bearing His cross , went forth into a place called the Place of a Skull ( which is called in the Hebrew , Golgotha )
KJ21	John	19	18	where they crucified Him and two others with Him , one on either side and Jesus in the midst .
KJ21	John	19	20	Then many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city , and it was written in Hebrew and Greek and Latin .
KJ21	John	19	21	Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate , “ Write not ‘ The King of the Jews , ’ but , ‘ He said , I am King of the Jews. ’ ”
KJ21	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ What I have written , I have written. ”
KJ21	John	19	23	Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took His garments and made four parts , to every soldier a part , and also His coat . Now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
KJ21	John	19	24	They said therefore among themselves , “ Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be , ” that the Scripture might be fulfilled which saith , “ They parted My raiment among them , and for My vesture did they cast lots. ” These things therefore the soldiers did .
KJ21	John	19	25	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother and His mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
KJ21	John	19	26	When Jesus therefore saw His mother and the disciple standing by whom He loved , He said unto His mother , “ Woman , behold thy son ! ”
KJ21	John	19	27	Then said He to the disciple , “ Behold thy mother ! ” And from that hour , that disciple took her unto his own home .
KJ21	John	19	28	After this Jesus , knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the Scripture might be fulfilled , said , “ I thirst. ”
KJ21	John	19	29	Now there was set there a vessel full of vinegar ; and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop , and put it to His mouth .
KJ21	John	19	30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , He said , “ It is finished. ” And He bowed His head and gave up the ghost .
KJ21	John	19	31	The Jews therefore , because it was the Preparation , and so that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day ( for that Sabbath day was a high day ) , besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away .
KJ21	John	19	32	Then came the soldiers and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him .
KJ21	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was dead already , they broke not His legs ,
KJ21	John	19	34	but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced His side , and forthwith there came out blood and water .
KJ21	John	19	35	And he that saw it bore record , and his record is true , and he knoweth that he saith truly , that ye might believe .
KJ21	John	19	36	For these things were done , that the Scripture should be fulfilled : “ A bone of Him shall not be broken. ”
KJ21	John	19	37	And again another Scripture saith , “ They shall look on Him whom they pierced. ”
KJ21	John	19	38	And after this , Joseph of Arimathea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus ; and Pilate gave him leave . He came therefore and took the body of Jesus .
KJ21	John	19	39	And there came also Nicodemus , who at first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds in weight .
KJ21	John	19	40	Then took they the body of Jesus and wound it in linen cloths with the spices , as is the manner of the Jews for burial .
KJ21	John	19	41	Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden , and in the garden a new sepulcher wherein was never man yet laid .
KJ21	John	19	42	There they laid Jesus therefore because of the Jews ’ Preparation Day , for the sepulcher was nigh at hand .
KJ21	John	20	20	And when He had so said , He showed unto them His hands and His side . Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord .
KJ21	John	20	2	Then she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and said unto them , “ They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher , and we know not where they have laid Him ! ”
KJ21	John	20	3	Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulcher .
KJ21	John	20	4	And they both ran together , and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the sepulcher .
KJ21	John	20	5	And stooping down and looking in , he saw the linen cloths lying , yet he went not in .
KJ21	John	20	6	Then came Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulcher and saw the linen cloths as they lay
KJ21	John	20	7	and the napkin that had been about His head , not lying with the linen cloths , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
KJ21	John	20	8	Then the other disciple , who came first to the sepulcher , went in also ; and he saw , and believed .
KJ21	John	20	9	For as yet they knew not the Scripture , that He must rise again from the dead .
KJ21	John	20	10	Then the disciples went away again unto their own home .
KJ21	John	20	11	But Mary stood outside at the sepulcher weeping , and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulcher ,
KJ21	John	20	12	and saw two angels in white , sitting one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain .
KJ21	John	20	13	And they said unto her , “ Woman , why weepest thou ? ” She said unto them , “ Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid Him. ”
KJ21	John	20	14	And when she had thus said , she turned around and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
KJ21	John	20	15	Jesus said unto her , “ Woman , why weepest thou ? Whom seekest thou ? ” She , supposing Him to be the gardener , said unto Him , “ Sir , if thou have borne Him hence , tell me where thou hast laid Him , and I will take Him away. ”
KJ21	John	20	16	Jesus said unto her , “ Mary ! ” She turned herself and said unto Him , “ Rabboni ! ” ( which is to say , “ Master ” ) .
KJ21	John	20	17	Jesus said unto her , “ Touch Me not , for I am not yet ascended to My Father ; but go to My brethren and say unto them , ‘ I ascend unto My Father and your Father , and to My God and your God. ’ ”
KJ21	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and that He had spoken these things unto her .
KJ21	John	20	19	Then the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews , came Jesus and stood in their midst and said unto them , “ Peace be unto you. ”
KJ21	John	20	21	Then said Jesus to them again , “ Peace be unto you . As My Father hath sent Me , even so send I you. ”
KJ21	John	20	22	And when He had said this , He breathed on them and said unto them , “ Receive ye the Holy Ghost .
KJ21	John	20	23	Whosoever sins ye remit , they are remitted unto them ; and whosoever sins ye retain , they are retained. ”
KJ21	John	20	24	But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
KJ21	John	20	25	The other disciples therefore said unto him , “ We have seen the Lord. ” But he said unto them , “ Unless I shall see in His hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into His side , I will not believe. ”
KJ21	John	20	26	And after eight days the disciples were again within , and Thomas was with them . Then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in their midst and said , “ Peace be unto you. ”
KJ21	John	20	27	Then said He to Thomas , “ Reach hither thy finger and behold My hands , and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into My side : and be not faithless , but believing. ”
KJ21	John	20	28	And Thomas answered and said unto Him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
KJ21	John	20	29	Jesus said unto him , “ Thomas , because thou hast seen Me , thou hast believed . Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed. ”
KJ21	John	20	30	And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His disciples , which are not written in this book .
KJ21	John	20	31	But these are written , that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing , ye might have life through His name .
KJ21	John	21	21	Peter , seeing him , said to Jesus , “ Lord , and what shall this man do ? ”
KJ21	John	21	2	There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two other of His disciples .
KJ21	John	21	3	Simon Peter said unto them , “ I am going fishing. ” They said unto him , “ We also go with thee. ” They went forth and entered into a boat immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
KJ21	John	21	4	But when the morning had now come , Jesus stood on the shore , but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
KJ21	John	21	5	Then Jesus said unto them , “ Children , have ye any meat ? ” And they answered Him , “ No. ”
KJ21	John	21	6	And He said unto them , “ Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and ye shall find. ” They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it in for the multitude of fishes .
KJ21	John	21	7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said unto Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girded his fisher ’ s coat unto him ( for he was naked ) and cast himself into the sea .
KJ21	John	21	8	And the other disciples came in a little boat ( for they were not far from land , but , as it were , two hundred cubits ) , dragging the net with fishes .
KJ21	John	21	9	As soon then as they had come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon and bread .
KJ21	John	21	10	Jesus said unto them , “ Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. ”
KJ21	John	21	11	Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land , full of great fishes , a hundred and fifty three ; and though there were so many , yet the net was not broken .
KJ21	John	21	12	Jesus said unto them , “ Come and dine. ” And none of the disciples dared ask Him , “ Who art Thou ? ” knowing that it was the Lord .
KJ21	John	21	13	Jesus then came and took bread and gave it to them , and fish likewise .
KJ21	John	21	14	This is now the third time that Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was risen from the dead .
KJ21	John	21	15	So when they had dined , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of Jonah , lovest thou Me more than these ? ” He said unto Him , “ Yea , Lord ; Thou knowest that I love Thee. ” He said unto him , “ Feed My lambs. ”
KJ21	John	21	16	He said to him again the second time , “ Simon , son of Jonah , lovest thou Me ? ” He said unto Him , “ Yea , Lord ; Thou knowest that I love Thee. ” He said unto him , “ Feed My sheep. ”
KJ21	John	21	17	He said unto him the third time , “ Simon , son of Jonah , lovest thou Me ? ” Peter was grieved because He said unto him the third time , “ Lovest thou Me ? ” And he said unto Him , “ Lord , Thou knowest all things . Thou knowest that I love Thee. ” Jesus said unto him , “ Feed My sheep .
KJ21	John	21	18	Verily , verily I say unto thee , when thou wast young , thou girded thyself and walked whither thou wouldest ; but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. ”
KJ21	John	21	19	This spoke He , signifying by what death he should glorify God . And when He had spoken this , He said unto him , “ Follow Me. ”
KJ21	John	21	20	Then Peter , turning about , saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following , who also had leaned on His breast at supper , and said , “ Lord , who is he that betrayeth Thee ? ”
KJ21	John	21	22	Jesus said unto him , “ If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ? Follow thou Me. ”
KJ21	John	21	23	Then this saying went abroad among the brethren , that that disciple should not die . Yet Jesus had not said unto him , “ He shall not die , ” but , “ If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ? ”
KJ21	John	21	24	This is the disciple who testifieth of these things and wrote these things , and we know that his testimony is true .
KJ21	John	21	25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did , which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . Amen .
KJ21	Romans	1	1	Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle and separated unto the Gospel of God ,
KJ21	Romans	1	2	which He had promised before by His prophets in the Holy Scriptures ,
KJ21	Romans	1	3	concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord , who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh ,
KJ21	Romans	1	4	and was declared to be the Son of God with power , according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead ,
KJ21	Romans	1	5	by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for His name ,
KJ21	Romans	1	6	among whom ye also are the called of Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Romans	1	7	To all who are in Rome , beloved of God and called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Romans	1	8	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
KJ21	Romans	1	9	For God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the Gospel of His Son , that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers ,
KJ21	Romans	1	10	making request that now at length and by any means I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
KJ21	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end that ye may be established :
KJ21	Romans	1	12	that is , that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith of both you and me .
KJ21	Romans	1	13	Now I would not have you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes I have purposed to come unto you ( but was prevented hitherto ) , that I might have some fruit among you also , even as among other Gentiles .
KJ21	Romans	1	14	I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians , both to the wise and to the unwise ;
KJ21	Romans	1	15	so , as much as is in me , I am ready to preach the Gospel to you also who are at Rome .
KJ21	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ , for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believeth , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
KJ21	Romans	1	17	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith ; as it is written : “ The just shall live by faith. ”
KJ21	Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ,
KJ21	Romans	1	19	because that which may be known of God is manifest in them , for God hath shown it unto them .
KJ21	Romans	1	20	For from the creation of the world the invisible things of Him are clearly seen , being understood through the things that are made , even His eternal power and Godhead , so that they are without excuse .
KJ21	Romans	1	21	For when they knew God , they neither glorified Him as God , nor were thankful , but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
KJ21	Romans	1	22	Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
KJ21	Romans	1	23	and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man , and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things .
KJ21	Romans	1	24	Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonor their own bodies among themselves .
KJ21	Romans	1	25	They changed the truth of God into a lie , and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator , who is blessed for ever . Amen .
KJ21	Romans	1	26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature .
KJ21	Romans	1	27	And likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another , men with men , working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompense for their error which was meet .
KJ21	Romans	1	28	And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not fitting ,
KJ21	Romans	1	29	being filled with all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness , full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , malignity . They are whisperers ,
KJ21	Romans	1	30	backbiters , haters of God , spiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
KJ21	Romans	1	31	without understanding , covenantbreakers , without natural affections , implacable , unmerciful .
KJ21	Romans	1	32	And knowing the judgment of God , that those who commit such things are worthy of death , they not only do the same , but have pleasure in those who do them .
KJ21	Romans	2	2	But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who commit such things .
KJ21	Romans	2	3	And thinkest thou this , O man , who judgest those who do such things and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
KJ21	Romans	2	4	Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering , not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
KJ21	Romans	2	5	But because of thy hardness and impenitence of heart , thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the Day of Wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ,
KJ21	Romans	2	6	who will render to every man according to his deeds :
KJ21	Romans	2	7	to those who by patient continuance in welldoing seek for glory and honor and immortality , eternal life ;
KJ21	Romans	2	8	but unto those who are contentious , and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness , indignation and wrath ,
KJ21	Romans	2	9	tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who doeth evil , upon the Jew first and also upon the Gentile ;
KJ21	Romans	2	10	but glory , honor and peace to every man who worketh good , to the Jew first and also to the Gentile .
KJ21	Romans	2	11	For there is no respect of persons with God .
KJ21	Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law , and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law .
KJ21	Romans	2	13	( For it is not the hearers of the law who are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
KJ21	Romans	2	14	For when the Gentiles , who have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , they , not having the law , are a law unto themselves ,
KJ21	Romans	2	15	which shows the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts between accusing and excusing one another . )
KJ21	Romans	2	16	Thus will it be on the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ , according to my Gospel .
KJ21	Romans	2	17	Behold , thou art called a Jew and rest in the law and make thy boast of God ,
KJ21	Romans	2	18	and knowest His will and approvest the things that are more excellent , being instructed from the law ,
KJ21	Romans	2	19	and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
KJ21	Romans	2	20	an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of babes , having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth .
KJ21	Romans	2	21	Thou therefore who teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? Thou that preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ?
KJ21	Romans	2	22	Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? Thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ?
KJ21	Romans	2	23	Thou that makest thy boast in the law , dost thou dishonor God through breaking the law ?
KJ21	Romans	2	24	For , “ The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you , ” as it is written .
KJ21	Romans	2	25	For circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law ; but if thou be a breaker of the law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .
KJ21	Romans	2	26	Therefore if the Uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law , shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
KJ21	Romans	2	27	And shall not uncircumcision , which is by nature , if it fulfill the law , judge thee , who having the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law ?
KJ21	Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly , neither is that circumcision , which is outward in the flesh .
KJ21	Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew who is one inwardly , and whose circumcision is that of the heart , in the spirit and not in the letter , and whose praise is not from men , but from God .
KJ21	Romans	3	3	For what if some did not believe ? Shall their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect ?
KJ21	Romans	3	2	Much in every way ; chiefly because unto them were committed the oracles of God .
KJ21	Romans	3	4	God forbid ! Yea , let God be true , but every man a liar . As it is written : “ That Thou mightest be justified in Thy sayings , and mightest overcome when Thou art judged. ”
KJ21	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance ? ( I speak as a man . )
KJ21	Romans	3	6	God forbid ! For then how shall God judge the world ?
KJ21	Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God through my lie hath abounded more unto His glory , why am I also yet judged as a sinner ?
KJ21	Romans	3	8	And why not say rather ( as we are slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ) , “ Let us do evil , that good may come ” ? Their damnation is just !
KJ21	Romans	3	9	What then ? Are we better than they ? No , in no wise ! For we have before proved that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin .
KJ21	Romans	3	10	As it is written : “ There is none righteous , no , not one ;
KJ21	Romans	3	11	there is none that understandeth ; there is none that seeketh after God .
KJ21	Romans	3	12	They have all gone from the way ; they have together become unprofitable ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one. ”
KJ21	Romans	3	13	“ Their throat is an open sepulcher ; with their tongues they have used deceit. ” “ The poison of asps is under their lips , ”
KJ21	Romans	3	14	“ whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. ”
KJ21	Romans	3	15	“ Their feet are swift to shed blood ;
KJ21	Romans	3	16	destruction and misery are in their ways ,
KJ21	Romans	3	17	and the way of peace have they not known. ”
KJ21	Romans	3	18	“ There is no fear of God before their eyes. ”
KJ21	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatsoever things the law saith , it saith to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God .
KJ21	Romans	3	20	Therefore by the deeds of the law , no flesh shall be justified in His sight , for by the law is the knowledge of sin .
KJ21	Romans	3	21	But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is manifested , being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets ,
KJ21	Romans	3	22	even the righteousness of God , which is by faith of Jesus Christ , unto all and upon all those who believe . For there is no difference ,
KJ21	Romans	3	23	for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God ,
KJ21	Romans	3	24	being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus .
KJ21	Romans	3	25	Him God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood , to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God ;
KJ21	Romans	3	26	to declare , I say , at this time , His righteousness : that He might be just , and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus .
KJ21	Romans	3	27	Where is boasting then ? It is excluded . By what law ? Of works ? Nay , but by the law of faith .
KJ21	Romans	3	28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law .
KJ21	Romans	3	29	Is He the God of the Jews only ? Is He not also of the Gentiles ? Yes , of the Gentiles also ,
KJ21	Romans	3	30	seeing it is one God who shall justify the Circumcision by faith , and Uncircumcision through faith .
KJ21	Romans	3	31	Do we then make void the law through faith ? God forbid ! Yea , we establish the law .
KJ21	Romans	4	4	Now to him that worketh , his reward is reckoned not according to grace , but according to debt .
KJ21	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham were justified by works , he hath reason to glory , but not before God .
KJ21	Romans	4	3	For what saith the Scripture ? “ Abraham believed God , and it was counted unto him for righteousness. ”
KJ21	Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not , but believeth in Him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is counted for righteousness ,
KJ21	Romans	4	6	even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works , saying ,
KJ21	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered .
KJ21	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. ”
KJ21	Romans	4	9	Cometh this blessedness then upon the Circumcision only , or upon the Uncircumcision also ? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness .
KJ21	Romans	4	10	How was it then reckoned ? When he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision !
KJ21	Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had , yet being uncircumcised , that he might be the father of all those who believe , though they are not circumcised , that righteousness might be imputed unto them also ,
KJ21	Romans	4	12	and the father of circumcision to those who are not of the Circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had , being yet uncircumcised .
KJ21	Romans	4	13	For the promise that he should be the heir of the world came not to Abraham or to his seed through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
KJ21	Romans	4	14	For if those who are of the law be heirs , faith is made void and the promise made of no effect ,
KJ21	Romans	4	15	because the law worketh wrath ; for where there is no law , there is no transgression .
KJ21	Romans	4	16	Therefore it is of faith , that it might be given by grace to the end that the promise might be made sure to all the seed , not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all
KJ21	Romans	4	17	( as it is written : “ I have made thee a father of many nations ” ) , in the presence of Him whom he believed , even God , who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which are not , as though they were .
KJ21	Romans	4	18	Abraham , against all hope , believed in hope , that he might become the father of many nations , according to that which had been spoken , “ So shall thy seed be. ”
KJ21	Romans	4	19	And being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about a hundred years old , nor yet the deadness of Sarah ’ s womb .
KJ21	Romans	4	20	He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief , but was strong in faith , giving glory to God ,
KJ21	Romans	4	21	and being fully persuaded that what He had promised , He was able also to perform .
KJ21	Romans	4	22	And therefore “ it was imputed to him for righteousness. ”
KJ21	Romans	4	23	Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him ,
KJ21	Romans	4	24	but for us also , to whom it shall be imputed if we believe in Him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead ,
KJ21	Romans	4	25	who was delivered for our offenses , and was raised again for our justification .
KJ21	Romans	5	5	and hope maketh not ashamed , because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given unto us .
KJ21	Romans	5	2	by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
KJ21	Romans	5	3	And not only so , but we glory in tribulations also , knowing that tribulation worketh patience ;
KJ21	Romans	5	4	and patience , experience ; and experience , hope ;
KJ21	Romans	5	6	For when we were yet without strength , in due time Christ died for the ungodly .
KJ21	Romans	5	7	For scarcely will one die for a righteous man , yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die .
KJ21	Romans	5	8	But God commendeth His love toward us in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
KJ21	Romans	5	9	Much more then , being now justified by His blood , we shall be saved from wrath through Him .
KJ21	Romans	5	10	For if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by His life .
KJ21	Romans	5	11	And not only that , but we shall also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom we have now received the atonement .
KJ21	Romans	5	12	Therefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin , so death passed onto all men , for all have sinned .
KJ21	Romans	5	13	For until the law , sin was in the world , but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
KJ21	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over those who had not sinned in the similitude of Adam ’ s transgression , he being the figure of Him that was to come .
KJ21	Romans	5	15	But not as the offense , so also is the free gift . For if through the offense of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one Man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto many .
KJ21	Romans	5	16	And not as it was by one who sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is for many offenses unto justification .
KJ21	Romans	5	17	For if by one man ’ s offense death reigned by one , much more those who receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by One , Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Romans	5	18	Therefore as by the offense of one , judgment to condemnation came upon all men , even so by the righteousness of One , the free gift unto justification of life came upon all men .
KJ21	Romans	5	19	For as by one man ’ s disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous .
KJ21	Romans	5	20	Moreover the law entered , that the offense might abound . But where sin abounded , grace did much more abound ,
KJ21	Romans	5	21	that , as sin hath reigned unto death , even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord .
KJ21	Romans	6	6	knowing this : that our old man is crucified with Him , that the body of sin might be destroyed , that henceforth we should not serve sin .
KJ21	Romans	6	2	God forbid ! How shall we , who are dead to sin , live any longer therein ?
KJ21	Romans	6	3	Know ye not that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death ?
KJ21	Romans	6	4	Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death , that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
KJ21	Romans	6	5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death , so we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection ,
KJ21	Romans	6	7	For he that is dead is freed from sin .
KJ21	Romans	6	8	Now if we be dead with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with Him ,
KJ21	Romans	6	9	knowing that Christ , being raised from the dead , dieth no more ; death no more hath dominion over Him .
KJ21	Romans	6	10	For in that He died , He died unto sin once ; but in that He liveth , He liveth unto God .
KJ21	Romans	6	11	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin , but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord .
KJ21	Romans	6	12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body , that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof .
KJ21	Romans	6	13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin , but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
KJ21	Romans	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over you , for ye are not under the law , but under grace .
KJ21	Romans	6	15	What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under the law , but under grace ? God forbid !
KJ21	Romans	6	16	Know ye not that to whomever ye yield yourselves as servants to obey , his servants ye become whom ye obey , whether of sin which leads unto death , or of obedience unto righteousness ?
KJ21	Romans	6	17	But God be thanked that though ye were the servants of sin , now ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you .
KJ21	Romans	6	18	Being then made free from sin , ye became the servants of righteousness .
KJ21	Romans	6	19	I speak in the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh . For as ye have yielded your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity , even so now yield your members as servants to righteousness unto holiness .
KJ21	Romans	6	20	For when ye were the servants of sin , ye were free from righteousness .
KJ21	Romans	6	21	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed ? For the end of those things is death .
KJ21	Romans	6	22	But now , being made free from sin and having become servants of God , ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end , everlasting life .
KJ21	Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death , but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
KJ21	Romans	7	7	What shall we say then ? Is the law sin ? God forbid ! Nay , I would not have known sin , but through the law ; for I would not have known lust , except that the law had said , “ Thou shalt not covet. ”
KJ21	Romans	7	2	For the woman who hath a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth ; but if the husband be dead , she is loosed from the law of the husband .
KJ21	Romans	7	3	So then , if while her husband liveth she be married to another man , she shall be called an adulteress ; but if her husband be dead , she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress , though she be married to another man .
KJ21	Romans	7	4	Therefore , my brethren , ye also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ , that ye should be married to another , even to Him who is raised from the dead , that we should bring forth fruit unto God .
KJ21	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh , the passions of sins , which were by the law , worked in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
KJ21	Romans	7	6	But now we are delivered from the law , that being dead wherein we were held ; that we should serve in newness of spirit , and not in the oldness of the letter .
KJ21	Romans	7	8	But sin , taking occasion through the commandment , wrought in me all manner of concupiscence ; for without the law sin was dead .
KJ21	Romans	7	9	For I was alive apart from the law once , but when the commandment came , sin revived and I died ;
KJ21	Romans	7	10	and the commandment , which was ordained to bring life , I found to be unto death .
KJ21	Romans	7	11	For sin , taking occasion by the commandment , deceived me and by it slew me .
KJ21	Romans	7	12	Therefore the law is holy , and the commandment holy and just and good .
KJ21	Romans	7	13	Was then that which is good made death unto me ? God forbid ! But sin , that it might appear as sin , was working death in me by that which is good , that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .
KJ21	Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual ; but I am carnal , sold under sin .
KJ21	Romans	7	15	For that which I do , I know not . For what I would do , that do I not ; but what I hate , that I do .
KJ21	Romans	7	16	If then I do that which I would not , I consent unto the law , that it is good .
KJ21	Romans	7	17	Now then it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
KJ21	Romans	7	18	For I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh ) dwelleth no good thing ; for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good , I find not .
KJ21	Romans	7	19	For the good that I would do , I do not ; but the evil which I would not do , that I do .
KJ21	Romans	7	20	Now if I do that which I would not do , it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
KJ21	Romans	7	21	I find then a law that , when I would do good , evil is present with me .
KJ21	Romans	7	22	For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man .
KJ21	Romans	7	23	But I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
KJ21	Romans	7	24	O wretched man that I am ! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death ?
KJ21	Romans	7	25	I thank God — through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , with the mind I myself serve the law of God , but with the flesh the law of sin .
KJ21	Romans	8	8	So then , those who are in the flesh can not please God .
KJ21	Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death .
KJ21	Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God , sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh ,
KJ21	Romans	8	4	that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
KJ21	Romans	8	5	For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh ; but those who are according to the Spirit , the things of the Spirit .
KJ21	Romans	8	6	For to be carnally minded is death , but to be spiritually minded is life and peace ,
KJ21	Romans	8	7	because the carnal mind is enmity against God , for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
KJ21	Romans	8	9	But ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so it be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of His .
KJ21	Romans	8	10	And if Christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin , but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
KJ21	Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you .
KJ21	Romans	8	12	Therefore , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh to live according to the flesh ;
KJ21	Romans	8	13	for if ye live according to the flesh ye shall die , but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live .
KJ21	Romans	8	14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .
KJ21	Romans	8	15	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear , but ye have received the Spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , “ Abba ! Father ! ”
KJ21	Romans	8	16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God ;
KJ21	Romans	8	17	and if children , then heirs — heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ , if so it be that we suffer with Him , that we may be also glorified together .
KJ21	Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us .
KJ21	Romans	8	19	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God .
KJ21	Romans	8	20	For the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of Him who hath subjected the same in hope ,
KJ21	Romans	8	21	because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
KJ21	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now .
KJ21	Romans	8	23	And not only they , but ourselves also , who have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
KJ21	Romans	8	24	For we are saved by hope ; but hope that is seen is not hope , for what a man seeth , why doth he yet hope for it ?
KJ21	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that which we see not , then do we with patience wait for it .
KJ21	Romans	8	26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities ; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought , but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered .
KJ21	Romans	8	27	And He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit , because He maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God .
KJ21	Romans	8	28	And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God , to those who are the called according to His purpose .
KJ21	Romans	8	29	For whom He foreknew , He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son , that He might be the firstborn among many brethren .
KJ21	Romans	8	30	Moreover , whom He predestined , those He also called ; and whom He called , those He also justified ; and whom He justified , those He also glorified .
KJ21	Romans	8	31	What then shall we say of these things ? If God be for us , who can be against us ?
KJ21	Romans	8	32	He that spared not His own Son , but delivered Him up for us all , how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things ?
KJ21	Romans	8	33	Who shall lay anything to the charge against God ’ s elect ? It is God who justifieth .
KJ21	Romans	8	34	Who is he that condemneth ? It is Christ who died , yea rather , who is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
KJ21	Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
KJ21	Romans	8	36	As it is written : “ For Thy sake we are killed all the day long ; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. ”
KJ21	Romans	8	37	Nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us .
KJ21	Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come ,
KJ21	Romans	8	39	nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
KJ21	Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise : “ At this time will I come , and Sarah shall have a son. ”
KJ21	Romans	9	2	that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart .
KJ21	Romans	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for the sake of my brethren , my kinsmen according to the flesh ,
KJ21	Romans	9	4	who are Israelites and to whom pertaineth the adoption , and the glory , and the covenants , and the giving of the law , and the service of God , and the promises ;
KJ21	Romans	9	5	of whom are the fathers , and from whom , according to the flesh , Christ came , who is over all , God blessed for ever . Amen .
KJ21	Romans	9	6	It is not as though the Word of God hath taken no effect . For they are not all Israel , who are of Israel ;
KJ21	Romans	9	7	neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children ; but , “ In Isaac shall thy seed be called. ”
KJ21	Romans	9	8	That is , they who are the children of the flesh , these are not the children of God ; rather , the children of the promise are counted as the seed .
KJ21	Romans	9	10	And not only this , but when Rebecca also had conceived by one , even by our father Isaac
KJ21	Romans	9	11	( for the children being not yet born , neither having done any good or evil , in order that the purpose of God according to election might stand , not by works , but by Him that calleth ) ,
KJ21	Romans	9	12	it was said unto her , “ The elder shall serve the younger. ”
KJ21	Romans	9	13	As it is written : “ Jacob have I loved , but Esau have I hated. ”
KJ21	Romans	9	14	What shall we say then ? Is there unrighteousness with God ? God forbid !
KJ21	Romans	9	15	For He saith to Moses , “ I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. ”
KJ21	Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of God who showeth mercy .
KJ21	Romans	9	17	For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh , “ Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up , that I might show My power in thee , and that My name might be declared throughout all the earth. ”
KJ21	Romans	9	18	Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy , and whom He will , He hardeneth .
KJ21	Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say then unto me , “ Why doth He yet find fault , for who hath resisted His will ? ”
KJ21	Romans	9	20	But nay , O man , who art thou that repliest against God ? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , “ Why hast thou made me thus ? ”
KJ21	Romans	9	21	Hath not the potter power over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor ?
KJ21	Romans	9	22	What if God , choosing to show His wrath and to make His power known , endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction ;
KJ21	Romans	9	23	and this , that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy , whom He had prepared before unto glory ,
KJ21	Romans	9	24	even us whom He hath called , not of the Jews only , but also of the Gentiles ?
KJ21	Romans	9	25	As He saith also in Hosea : “ I will call them ‘ My people , ’ who were not My people , and ‘ her beloved ’ who was not beloved. ”
KJ21	Romans	9	26	And , “ It shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them , ‘ Ye are not My people , ’ there shall they be called the children of the living God. ”
KJ21	Romans	9	27	Isaiah also crieth concerning Israel : “ Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved .
KJ21	Romans	9	28	For He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness , because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. ”
KJ21	Romans	9	29	And as Isaiah said before : “ Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed , we would have been as Sodom and been made like unto Gomorrah. ”
KJ21	Romans	9	30	What shall we say then ? That the Gentiles , who followed not after righteousness , have attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is by faith ;
KJ21	Romans	9	31	but Israel , who followed after the law of righteousness , hath not attained to the law of righteousness .
KJ21	Romans	9	32	Why so ? Because they sought it not by faith but , as it were , by the works of the law . For they stumbled at that stumbling stone .
KJ21	Romans	9	33	As it is written : “ Behold , I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense , and whosoever believeth in Him shall not be ashamed . ”
KJ21	Romans	10	10	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness , and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
KJ21	Romans	10	2	For I bear them record that they have a zeal for God , but not according to knowledge .
KJ21	Romans	10	3	For they , being ignorant of God ’ s righteousness , and going about to establish their own righteousness , have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God .
KJ21	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth .
KJ21	Romans	10	5	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law : that “ the man who doeth those things shall live by them. ”
KJ21	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh in this manner : “ Say not in thine heart , ‘ Who shall ascend into Heaven ? ’ ” ( that is , to bring Christ down from above )
KJ21	Romans	10	7	or , “ ‘ Who shall descend into the deep ? ’ ” ( that is , to bring up Christ again from the dead ) .
KJ21	Romans	10	8	But what saith it ? “ The Word is nigh thee , even in thy mouth and in thy heart , ” that is , the word of faith which we preach :
KJ21	Romans	10	9	that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
KJ21	Romans	10	11	For the Scripture saith , “ Whosoever believeth in Him shall not be ashamed. ”
KJ21	Romans	10	12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek , for the same Lord over all is rich unto all who call upon Him .
KJ21	Romans	10	13	For “ whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. ”
KJ21	Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed ? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard ? And how shall they hear without a preacher ?
KJ21	Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach unless they are sent ? As it is written : “ How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things ! ”
KJ21	Romans	10	16	But they have not all obeyed the Gospel . For Isaiah saith , “ Lord , who hath believed our report ? ”
KJ21	Romans	10	17	So then faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the Word of God .
KJ21	Romans	10	18	But I ask , have they not heard ? Yes , verily : “ Their sound went out into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the world. ”
KJ21	Romans	10	19	But I ask , did not Israel know ? First Moses saith , “ I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people , and by a foolish nation I will anger you. ”
KJ21	Romans	10	20	But Isaiah is very bold and saith , “ I was found by them that sought Me not ; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after Me. ”
KJ21	Romans	10	21	But to Israel he saith , “ All day long I have stretched forth My hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people . ”
KJ21	Romans	11	11	I say then : Have they stumbled that they should fall ? God forbid ! But rather , through their fall salvation has come unto the Gentiles to provoke them to jealousy .
KJ21	Romans	11	2	God hath not cast away His people whom He foreknew . Know ye not what the Scripture saith of Elijah , how he maketh intercession to God against Israel , saying ,
KJ21	Romans	11	3	“ Lord , they have killed Thy prophets and torn down Thine altars , and I am left alone and they seek my life ” ?
KJ21	Romans	11	4	But what saith the answer of God unto him ? “ I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. ”
KJ21	Romans	11	5	Even so then , at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
KJ21	Romans	11	6	And if by grace , then it is no longer by works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . But if it be by works , then it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
KJ21	Romans	11	7	What then ? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for ; but the election hath obtained it , and the rest were blinded ,
KJ21	Romans	11	8	according as it is written : “ God hath given them the spirit of slumber , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear , unto this day. ”
KJ21	Romans	11	9	And David saith , “ Let their table be made a snare and a trap , a stumbling block and a recompense unto them .
KJ21	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see , and bow down their backs alway. ”
KJ21	Romans	11	12	Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles , how much more their fullness ?
KJ21	Romans	11	13	For I speak to you Gentiles . Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles , I magnify my office ,
KJ21	Romans	11	14	that by any means I may provoke to emulation those who are my flesh , and might save some of them .
KJ21	Romans	11	15	For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
KJ21	Romans	11	16	For if the firstfruit be holy , the whole lump is also holy ; and if the root be holy , so are the branches .
KJ21	Romans	11	17	And if some of the branches be broken off , and thou , being a wild olive tree , wert grafted in among them , and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree ,
KJ21	Romans	11	18	boast not against the branches . But if thou boast , thou bearest not the root , but the root thee .
KJ21	Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then , “ The branches were broken off , that I might be grafted in. ”
KJ21	Romans	11	20	Thou sayest well ! Because of unbelief they were broken off , and thou standest by faith . Be not highminded , but fear ;
KJ21	Romans	11	21	for if God spared not the natural branches , take heed lest He also spare not thee .
KJ21	Romans	11	22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on those who fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in His goodness . Otherwise , thou also shalt be cut off .
KJ21	Romans	11	23	And they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
KJ21	Romans	11	24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree , how much more shall these , which are the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
KJ21	Romans	11	25	For I , brethren , would not have you be ignorant of this mystery , lest ye should be wise in your own conceits : that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in .
KJ21	Romans	11	26	And so all Israel shall be saved , as it is written : “ There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer , and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob .
KJ21	Romans	11	27	For this is My covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins. ”
KJ21	Romans	11	28	Concerning the Gospel , they are enemies for your sake ; but concerning the election , they are beloved for the fathers ’ sakes .
KJ21	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance .
KJ21	Romans	11	30	For as in times past ye have not believed God , yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief ,
KJ21	Romans	11	31	even so have these also now not believed , that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy .
KJ21	Romans	11	32	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief , that He might have mercy upon all .
KJ21	Romans	11	33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are His judgments , and His ways past finding out !
KJ21	Romans	11	34	“ For who hath known the mind of the Lord ? Or who hath been His counselor ? ”
KJ21	Romans	11	35	Or , “ who hath first given to Him , and it shall be recompensed unto him again ? ”
KJ21	Romans	11	36	For of Him , and through Him , and to Him , are all things , to whom be glory for ever . Amen .
KJ21	Romans	12	12	rejoicing in hope , patient in tribulation , continuing instant in prayer ;
KJ21	Romans	12	2	And be not conformed to this world , but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God .
KJ21	Romans	12	3	For I say to every man that is among you , through the grace given unto me , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think , but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith .
KJ21	Romans	12	4	For as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office ,
KJ21	Romans	12	5	so we , being many , are one body in Christ , and every one members one of another .
KJ21	Romans	12	6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us : if prophecy , let us prophesy according to our portion of faith ;
KJ21	Romans	12	7	or ministry , let us wait on our ministering ; or he that teacheth , on teaching ;
KJ21	Romans	12	8	or he that exhorteth , on exhortation ; he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that showeth mercy , with cheerfulness .
KJ21	Romans	12	9	Let love be without dissimulation . Abhor that which is evil ; cleave to that which is good .
KJ21	Romans	12	10	Have kindly affection one for another with brotherly love , in honor preferring one another ;
KJ21	Romans	12	11	not slothful in business ; fervent in spirit , serving the Lord ;
KJ21	Romans	12	13	distributing to the necessity of saints , given to hospitality .
KJ21	Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute you ; bless and curse not .
KJ21	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice , and weep with those who weep .
KJ21	Romans	12	16	Be of the same mind one toward another . Set not your mind on high things , but condescend to men of low estate . Be not wise in your own conceits .
KJ21	Romans	12	17	Recompense no man evil for evil . Provide things honest in the sight of all men .
KJ21	Romans	12	18	If it be possible , as much as lieth in you , live peaceably with all men .
KJ21	Romans	12	19	Dearly beloved , avenge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath ; for it is written : “ Vengeance is Mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord. ”
KJ21	Romans	12	20	Therefore : “ If thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink . For in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. ”
KJ21	Romans	12	21	Be not overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
KJ21	Romans	13	13	Let us walk honestly as in the day , not in rioting and drunkenness , not in lewdness and wantonness , not in strife and envying .
KJ21	Romans	13	2	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God , and those who resist shall receive for themselves damnation .
KJ21	Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ? Do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same ,
KJ21	Romans	13	4	for he is the minister of God to thee for good . But if thou do that which is evil , be afraid , for he beareth not the sword in vain ; for he is the minister of God , an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil .
KJ21	Romans	13	5	Therefore ye must be subject not only for wrath , but also for conscience ’ sake .
KJ21	Romans	13	6	For , for this cause pay ye tribute also , for they are God ’ s ministers , attending continually upon this very thing .
KJ21	Romans	13	7	Render therefore to all their dues : tribute to whom tribute is due , custom to whom custom , fear to whom fear , honor to whom honor .
KJ21	Romans	13	8	Owe no man anything , but to love one another , for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law .
KJ21	Romans	13	9	For this , “ Thou shalt not commit adultery , ” “ Thou shalt not kill , ” “ Thou shalt not steal , ” “ Thou shalt not bear false witness , ” “ Thou shalt not covet , ” and if there be any other commandment , all are briefly comprehended in this saying , namely : “ Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. ”
KJ21	Romans	13	10	Love worketh no ill to his neighbor ; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law .
KJ21	Romans	13	11	And that , knowing the time , that now it is high time to awaken out of sleep ; for now is our salvation nearer than when we first believed .
KJ21	Romans	13	12	The night is far spent ; the day is at hand . Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armor of light .
KJ21	Romans	13	14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof .
KJ21	Romans	14	14	I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself ; but to him that regardeth anything to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
KJ21	Romans	14	2	For one believeth that he may eat all things , while another who is weak eateth herbs .
KJ21	Romans	14	3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not ; and let not him that eateth not , judge him that eateth ; for God hath received him .
KJ21	Romans	14	4	Who art thou who judgest another man ’ s servant ? To his own master he standeth or falleth ; yea , he shall be held up , for God is able to make him stand .
KJ21	Romans	14	5	One man esteemeth one day above another ; another esteemeth every day alike . Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind .
KJ21	Romans	14	6	He that regardeth one day , regardeth it unto the Lord ; and he that regardeth not that day , to the Lord doth he not regard it . He that eateth , eateth to the Lord , for he giveth God thanks ; and he that eateth not , to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God thanks .
KJ21	Romans	14	7	For none of us liveth to himself , and no man dieth to himself .
KJ21	Romans	14	8	For whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the Lord . Whether we live therefore or die , we are the Lord ’ s .
KJ21	Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ both died , and arose , and revived , that he might be Lord both of the dead and living .
KJ21	Romans	14	10	But why dost thou judge thy brother ? Or why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
KJ21	Romans	14	11	For it is written : “ ‘ As I live , ’ saith the Lord , ‘ every knee shall bow to Me , and every tongue shall confess to God. ’ ”
KJ21	Romans	14	12	So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God .
KJ21	Romans	14	13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more , but judge this rather : that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother ’ s way .
KJ21	Romans	14	15	But if thy brother be grieved because of thy meat , thou walkest no longer charitably . Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died .
KJ21	Romans	14	16	Let not your good be spoken of as evil ;
KJ21	Romans	14	17	for the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink , but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost .
KJ21	Romans	14	18	For he that in these things serveth Christ , is acceptable to God and approved by men .
KJ21	Romans	14	19	Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and the things wherewith one may edify another .
KJ21	Romans	14	20	Destroy not the work of God for the sake of meat . All things indeed are pure , but it is evil for that man to eat what causeth offense .
KJ21	Romans	14	21	It is good neither to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth , or is offended , or is made weak .
KJ21	Romans	14	22	Hast thou faith ? Have it to thyself before God . Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth .
KJ21	Romans	14	23	And he that doubteth is damned if he eat , because he eateth not from faith ; for whatsoever is not from faith is sin .
KJ21	Romans	15	15	Nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some measure to remind you , because of the grace that is given to me from God ,
KJ21	Romans	15	2	Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification .
KJ21	Romans	15	3	For even Christ pleased not Himself , but as it is written : “ The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on Me. ”
KJ21	Romans	15	4	For whatsoever things were written in times past , were written for our learning , that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope .
KJ21	Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another , according to Christ Jesus ,
KJ21	Romans	15	6	that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Romans	15	7	Therefore receive ye one another as Christ also received us , to the glory of God .
KJ21	Romans	15	8	Now I say , that Jesus Christ was a minister of the Circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers ,
KJ21	Romans	15	9	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy ; as it is written : “ For this cause I will confess to Thee among the Gentiles , and sing unto Thy name. ”
KJ21	Romans	15	10	And again he saith , “ Rejoice , ye Gentiles , with His people. ”
KJ21	Romans	15	11	And again , “ Praise the Lord , all ye Gentiles , and laud Him , all ye people. ”
KJ21	Romans	15	12	And again Isaiah saith , “ There shall be a Root of Jesse , and He that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles , in Him shall the Gentiles trust. ”
KJ21	Romans	15	13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost .
KJ21	Romans	15	14	And I myself also am persuaded about you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
KJ21	Romans	15	16	that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministering the Gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Ghost .
KJ21	Romans	15	17	I have therefore cause that I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God .
KJ21	Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed ,
KJ21	Romans	15	19	through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit of God ; so that from Jerusalem and round about into Illyricum , I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ .
KJ21	Romans	15	20	Yea , so have I striven to preach the Gospel not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man ’ s foundation ;
KJ21	Romans	15	21	but as it is written : “ To whom He was not spoken of , they shall see ; and they that have not heard shall understand. ”
KJ21	Romans	15	22	For this cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you .
KJ21	Romans	15	23	But now having no more place in these parts , and having a great desire these many years to come unto you ,
KJ21	Romans	15	24	whensoever I make my journey into Spain I will come to you . For I trust to see you on my journey , and to be brought on my way thither by you , if first I be somewhat filled with your company .
KJ21	Romans	15	25	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints .
KJ21	Romans	15	26	For it hath pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints who are at Jerusalem .
KJ21	Romans	15	27	It hath pleased them verily , and their debtors they are . For if the Gentiles have been made partakers in their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
KJ21	Romans	15	28	When therefore I have performed this , and have secured to them this fruit , I will come to you on my way to Spain .
KJ21	Romans	15	29	And I am sure that when I come unto you , I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ .
KJ21	Romans	15	30	Now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Jesus Christ ’ s sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
KJ21	Romans	15	31	that I may be delivered from those who do not believe in Judea , and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted by the saints ,
KJ21	Romans	15	32	and that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God , and may with you be refreshed .
KJ21	Romans	15	33	Now the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
KJ21	Romans	16	16	Salute one another with a holy kiss . The churches of Christ salute you .
KJ21	Romans	16	2	that ye receive her in the Lord as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you . For she hath been a succorer of many , and of myself also .
KJ21	Romans	16	3	Greet Priscilla and Aquila , my helpers in Christ Jesus ,
KJ21	Romans	16	4	who have for my life laid down their own necks , unto whom not only I give thanks , but also all the churches of the Gentiles .
KJ21	Romans	16	5	Likewise greet the church that is in their house . Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus , who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ .
KJ21	Romans	16	6	Greet Mary , who bestowed much labor on us .
KJ21	Romans	16	7	Salute Andronicus and Junia , my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners , who are of note among the apostles and who also were in Christ before me .
KJ21	Romans	16	8	Greet Amplias , my beloved in the Lord .
KJ21	Romans	16	9	Salute Urbanus , our helper in Christ , and my beloved Stachys .
KJ21	Romans	16	10	Salute Apelles , approved in Christ . Salute those who are of the household of Aristobulus .
KJ21	Romans	16	11	Salute Herodion , my kinsman . Greet those who are of the household of Narcissus , who are in the Lord .
KJ21	Romans	16	12	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa , who labor in the Lord . Salute the beloved Persis , who labored much in the Lord .
KJ21	Romans	16	13	Salute Rufus , chosen in the Lord , and his mother and mine .
KJ21	Romans	16	14	Salute Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brethren who are with them .
KJ21	Romans	16	15	Salute Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
KJ21	Romans	16	17	Now I beseech you , brethren , mark those who cause divisions and offenses , contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned , and avoid them .
KJ21	Romans	16	18	For such as they serve not our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own belly , and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
KJ21	Romans	16	19	For your obedience has become known abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf ; but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
KJ21	Romans	16	20	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
KJ21	Romans	16	21	Timothy , my fellow worker , and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater , my kinsmen , salute you .
KJ21	Romans	16	22	( I , Tertius , who wrote down this epistle , salute you in the Lord . )
KJ21	Romans	16	23	Gaius , my host and host of the whole church , saluteth you . Erastus , the treasurer of the city , saluteth you , and Quartus , a brother .
KJ21	Romans	16	24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
KJ21	Romans	16	25	Now to Him who has the power to establish you according to my Gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began
KJ21	Romans	16	26	but now is made manifest , and by the Scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith ,
KJ21	Romans	16	27	to God alone wise , be glory through Jesus Christ for ever . Amen .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , and Sosthenes our brother ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	2	Unto the church of God which is at Corinth , to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all who in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord , both theirs and ours :
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	5	that in every thing ye are enriched by Him , in all utterance and in all knowledge ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	6	even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that ye fall behind in no gift , waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	8	He shall also confirm you unto the end , that ye may be blameless in the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful , by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you , but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For it hath been reported unto me about you , my brethren , by those who are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now this I say , when every one of you saith , “ I am of Paul , ” and “ I of Apollos , ” and “ I of Cephas , ” and “ I of Christ ” :
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	15	lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas . Besides , I know not whether I baptized any other .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the Gospel , and not with the wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the preaching of the cross is foolishness to those who perish ; but unto us who are saved , it is the power of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written : “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the disputer of this world ? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For since , in the wisdom of God , the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For the Jews require a sign , and the Greeks seek after wisdom ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we preach Christ crucified , unto the Jews a stumbling block , and unto the Greeks foolishness ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but unto those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ , the power of God and the wisdom of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For ye see in your calling , brethren , how not many wise men according to the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble , are called .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise , and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	28	and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen , yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things which are ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	29	that no flesh should glory in His presence .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But because of Him are ye in Christ Jesus , who from God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness , and sanctification and redemption ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	1	31	that according as it is written : “ He that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord . ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know anything among you , save Jesus Christ and Him crucified .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	3	And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of man ’ s wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	5	that your faith should not stand on the wisdom of man , but on the power of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	6	However , we speak wisdom among those who are perfect , yet not the wisdom of this world , nor of the princes of this world , who are coming to nought .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world for our glory —
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	8	wisdom which none of the princes of this world knew ; for had they known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written : “ Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	10	But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit . For the Spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? Even so no man knoweth the things of God , but the Spirit of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is of God , that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	13	These things also we speak , not in the words which man ’ s wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy Ghost teacheth , comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishness unto him ; neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things , yet he himself is judged by no man .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	3	for ye are yet carnal . For if there is among you envying and strife and divisions , are ye not carnal and walk as men ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I have fed you with milk and not with meat ; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it , neither yet now are ye able ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For while one saith , “ I am of Paul , ” and another , “ I am of Apollos , ” are ye not carnal ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	5	Who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ministers by whom ye came to believe , even as the Lord gave to every man ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I have planted , Apollos watered , but God gave the increase .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So then , neither is he that planteth anything , nor he that watereth , but God who giveth the increase .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one , and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are laborers together with God ; ye are God ’ s husbandry ; ye are God ’ s building .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me , as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon . But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no man can lay another foundation than that which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if any man build upon this foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , stubble ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	13	every man ’ s work shall be made manifest ; for the Day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire , and the fire shall test every man ’ s work of what sort it is .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If any man ’ s work abide which he hath built thereon , he shall receive a reward .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If any man ’ s work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss ; but he himself shall be saved , yet so as fire .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If any man defile the temple of God , him shall God destroy . For the temple of God is holy , and ye are that temple .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself . If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . For it is written : “ He taketh the wise in their own craftiness ” ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , “ The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise , that they are vain. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no man glory in men . For all things are yours ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas , or the world or life or death , or things present or things to come — all are yours ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	3	23	and ye are Christ ’ s , and Christ is God ’ s .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	4	For I know nothing by myself , yet am I not hereby justified ; but He that judgeth me is the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man ’ s judgment . Yea , I judge not mine own self .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	5	Therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts ; and then shall every man have praise of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	6	And these things , brethren , I have in a sense transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes , that ye may learn through us not to regard men above that which is written , that no one of you be puffed up for one against another .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who maketh thee to differ from another ? And what hast thou that thou did not receive ? Now if thou did receive it , why dost thou glory as if thou had not been given it ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	8	Now ye are full , now ye are rich ! Ye have reigned as kings without us ! And I would to God ye did reign , that we also might reign with you !
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God hath set forth us , the apostles , last , as it were approved to death ; for we are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ ’ s sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honorable , but we are despised .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst , and are naked and are buffeted , and have no certain dwelling place ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	12	and we labor , working with our own hands . Being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer it ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	13	being defamed , we entreat . We are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I write these things not to shame you , but to warn you as my beloved sons .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet ye have not many fathers ; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I beseech you , be ye followers of me .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this cause I have sent unto you Timothy , who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord , who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ , as I teach them everywhere in every church .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Now some are puffed up as though I would not come to you .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly , if the Lord wills , and will know , not the speech of those who are puffed up , but the power .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the Kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	4	21	What will ye have ? Shall I come unto you with a rod , or in love and in the spirit of meekness ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	5	deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord Jesus .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And ye are puffed up , and have not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	3	For I verily , though absent in body but present in spirit , have judged already as though I were present concerning him who hath so done this deed :
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , when ye are gathered together , I being there in spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your glorying is not good . Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Purge out therefore the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , as ye are unleavened . For even Christ , our Passover , is sacrificed for us .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators—
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	10	yet not meaning altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters , for to do so ye would need to go out of the world .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But I now have written unto you not to keep company with any man who is called a brother if he is a fornicator , or covetous , or an idolater , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner . With such a one you are not even to eat .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside ? Do not ye judge those who are within ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	5	13	But those who are outside , God judgeth . Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	6	But brother goeth to law with brother , and that before the unbelievers !
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? And if the world shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels ? How much more , things that pertain to this life ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	4	If then ye have judgments to make on things pertaining to this life , set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church !
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I speak to shame you ! Is it so , that there is not a wise man among you , no , not one , who shall be able to judge between his brethren ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Now therefore , there is utterly a fault among you , because ye go to law one against another . Why do ye not rather accept wrong ? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	8	Nay , ye do wrong and defraud , and that your own brethren !
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God ? Be not deceived : Neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor the effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with mankind ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves , nor the covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor extortioners shall inherit the Kingdom of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And such were some of you . But ye are washed , ye are sanctified , ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	12	“ All things are lawful unto me , ” but all things are not expedient . “ All things are lawful for me , ” but I will not be brought under the power of any .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	13	“ Meats for the belly , and the belly for meats , ” but God shall destroy both it and them . Now the body is not for fornication , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	14	And God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise up us by His own power .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot ? God forbid !
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	16	What ? Know ye not that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with her ? “ For two , ” saith He , “ shall be one flesh. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Flee fornication . Every other sin which a man doeth is outside the body , but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	19	What ? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you and which ye have from God , and that ye are not your own ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	6	20	For ye are bought with a price . Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit , which are God ’ s .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	7	For I would that all men were even as I myself am . But every man hath his proper gift of God , one in this manner and another in that .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	2	Nevertheless to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence , and likewise also the wife unto the husband .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife hath not power over her own body , but the husband ; and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body , but the wife .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Defraud ye not one the other , unless it be with consent for a time only , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan tempt you not through your lack of selfrestraint .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But I speak this by permission , and not by commandment .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows : It is good for them if they remain even as I .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they can not contain themselves , let them marry ; for it is better to marry than to burn .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	10	And unto the married I command ( yet not I , but the Lord ) : let not the wife depart from her husband .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But if she depart , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband . And let not the husband put away his wife .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest I speak ( not the Lord ) : if any brother hath a wife who believeth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And the woman who hath a husband who believeth not , and if he be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leave him .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband . Else your children would be unclean , but now they are holy .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbelieving spouse depart , let him depart . A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases , for God hath called us to peace .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? Or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	17	But as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk . And so I ordain in all churches .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Is any man called , being circumcised ? Let him not become uncircumcised . Is any called , being uncircumcised ? Let him not be circumcised .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but what matters is the keeping of the commandments of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Let every man abide in the same calling as when he was called .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Art thou a servant when called ? Be not concerned ; but if thou mayest be made free , then make use of it .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For he that is called in the Lord , being a servant , is the Lord ’ s freeman ; likewise also he that is called , being free , is Christ ’ s servant .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	23	Ye are bought with a price ; be ye not the servants of men .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brethren , let every man , wherein he is called , therein abide with God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins : I have no commandment from the Lord , yet I give my judgment as one who hath obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I suppose therefore that in this present distress , I say , it is good for a man so to be .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound unto a wife ? Seek not to be loosed . Art thou loosed from a wife ? Seek not a wife .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if thou marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if a virgin marry , she hath not sinned . Nevertheless , such shall have trouble in the flesh , but I would spare you .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	29	But this I say , brethren : the time is short . It remaineth that those who have wives should be as though they had none ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and those who weep , as though they wept not ; and those who rejoice , as though they rejoiced not ; and those who buy , as though they possessed not ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and those who use this world , as not abusing it . For the fashion of this world passeth away .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I would have you be without cares . He that is unmarried careth for the things which belong to the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	33	but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	34	There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin . The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit ; but she that is married careth for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	35	And this I speak for your own profit , not that I may cast a snare upon you , but for that which is comely , and so that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age and need so require , let him do what he will—he sinneth not : let them marry .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	37	Nevertheless , he that standeth steadfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well , but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth . But if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will , but only in the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she so remain , in my judgment ; and I think also that I have the Spirit of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But meat commendeth us not to God , for neither are we the better if we eat , nor are we the worse if we eat not .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	2	And if any man think that he knoweth anything , he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if any man love God , the same is known by Him .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	4	Concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is no other God but One .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For though there be what are called “ gods , ” whether in heaven or on earth ( as there are many “ gods ” and many “ lords ” ) ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	6	yet to us there is but one God , the Father , from whom are all things , and we in Him , and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things , and we by Him .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	7	However , there is not in every man that knowledge ; for some , with conscience of the idol until this hour , eat it as a thing offered unto an idol , and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if any man see thee , who hast knowledge , sitting at meat in the idol ’ s temple , shall not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	11	and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish , for whom Christ died ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	12	For when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience , ye sin against Christ .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Therefore , if meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world standeth , lest I make my brother to offend .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the Law of Moses : “ Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. ” Doth God take care for oxen ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If I am not an apostle unto others , yet doubtless I am to you . For ye are the seal of mine apostleship in the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	3	Mine answer to those who examine me is this :
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Have we not power to eat and to drink ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as do other apostles and as the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or is it I only and Barnabas who have not power to forbear working ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who goeth to war at any time at his own expense ? Who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? Or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	8	Say I these things as a man , or saith not the law the same also ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	10	or doth He say it altogether for our sakes ? For our sakes , no doubt , this is written : that he that ploweth should plow in hope , and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it so great a thing if we should reap your worldly things ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others are partakers of this power over you , are we not even more ? Nevertheless we have not used this power , but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the Gospel of Christ .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Do ye not know that those who minister concerning holy things live of the things of the temple , and those who wait upon the altar are partakers with the altar ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	14	Even so hath the Lord ordained that those who preach the Gospel should live from the Gospel .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things ; neither have I written , that these things should be so done unto me . For it would be better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For though I preach the Gospel , I have nothing to glory about , for necessity is laid upon me . Yea , woe is unto me if I preach not the Gospel !
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward ; but if against my will , a dispensing of the Gospel is committed unto me .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward then ? Verily that , when I preach the Gospel , I may make the Gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the Gospel .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For though I am free from all men , yet have I made myself servant unto all , that I might gain the more .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain the Jews ; to those who are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain those who are under the law ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	21	to those who are outside the law , as outside the law ( though not outside the law of God , but under the law of Christ ) , that I might gain those who are outside the law .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	23	And this I do for the Gospel ’ s sake , that I might be partaker thereof with you .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Know ye not that those who run in a race all run , but one receiveth the prize ? So run , that ye may obtain it .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	25	And every man that striveth for mastery is temperate in all things . Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown , but we an incorruptible .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run , but not with uncertainty ; I so fight , but not as one that beateth the air .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	9	27	But I keep control of my body , and bring it into subjection , lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	10	Neither should ye murmur , as some of them also murmured — and were destroyed by the destroyer .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	2	and all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	3	And all ate the same spiritual meat ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same spiritual drink ; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them , and that Rock was Christ .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	5	But with many of them God was not well pleased , for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were our examples , to the intent that we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Neither be ye idolaters , as were some of them ; as it is written : “ The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed — and three and twenty thousand fell in one day .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt Christ , as some of them also tempted — and were destroyed by serpents .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened unto them by way of example , and are written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Therefore let him that thinketh he standeth , take heed lest he fall .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	13	There hath no temptation taken hold of you but such as is common to man . But God is faithful ; He will not suffer you to be tempted beyond that which ye are able to bear , but with the temptation will also make a way to escape , that ye may be able to bear it .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Therefore , my dearly beloved , flee from idolatry .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men ; judge ye what I say .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless : is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break : is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	17	For we , being many , are one bread and one body , for we are all partakers of that one Bread .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel according to the flesh : are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What say I then ? That the idol is anything , or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	20	But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils and not to God ; and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	21	Ye can not drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils ; ye can not be partakers of the Lord ’ s table and of the table of devils .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than He ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient . All things are lawful for me , but all things do not edify .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Let no man seek his own , but every man another ’ s wellbeing .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the meat market , that eat , asking no question for conscience ’ sake ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	26	for , “ The earth is the Lord ’ s , and the fullness thereof. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If any of those who do not believe bid you to a feast , and ye are disposed to go , whatsoever is set before you eat , asking no question for conscience ’ sake .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if any man say unto you , “ This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , ” then eat it not for his sake who showed it , and for conscience ’ sake ; for , “ The earth is the Lord ’ s , and the fullness thereof. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	29	I do not mean thine own conscience , but the other ’ s . For why is my liberty judged by another man ’ s conscience ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	30	For if I by grace be a partaker , why is evil spoken of me for that for which I give thanks ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore ye eat or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all to the glory of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Give no offense , neither to the Jews , nor to the Gentiles , nor to the church of God ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	10	33	even as I please all men in all things , not seeking mine own profit , but the profit of many , that they may be saved .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless , neither is the man without the woman , nor the woman without the man , in the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I have delivered them to you .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man who prayeth or prophesieth , having his head covered , dishonoreth his head .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman who prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoreth her head , for that is one and the same as if she were shaven .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn . But if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head , inasmuch as he is the image and glory of God ; but the woman is the glory of the man .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For the man is not of the woman , but the woman of the man .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	9	Neither was the man created for the woman , but the woman for the man .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head , because of the angels .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man , even so is the man also by the woman ; but all things are of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Judge for yourselves : Is it comely that a woman should pray unto God uncovered ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her , for her hair is given her for a covering .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seem to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the churches of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	17	Now in this I declare unto you that I praise you not : that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there are divisions among you , and I partly believe it .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For there must be also heresies among you , that those who are approved may be made manifest among you .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When ye therefore come together into one place , this is not to eat the Lord ’ s Supper .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	21	For in eating , every one taketh his own supper ahead of another , and one is hungry and another is drunken .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	22	What ? Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? Or despise ye the church of God , and shame those who have not ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you in this ? I praise you not !
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For I have received from the Lord that which also I delivered unto you : that the Lord Jesus , the same night in which He was betrayed , took bread ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and when He had given thanks , He broke it and said , “ Take , eat ; this is My body which is broken for you : this do in remembrance of Me. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same manner also He took the cup when He had supped , saying , “ This cup is the new testament in My blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in remembrance of Me. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup , ye do show the Lord ’ s death until He come .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But let a man examine himself , and then let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himself , not discerning the Lord ’ s body .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	30	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you , and many sleep .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	31	For if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged , we are chastened by the Lord , that we should not be condemned with the world .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	33	Therefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	11	34	And if any man hunger , let him eat at home , that ye come not together unto condemnation . And the rest will I set in order when I come .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the members of that one body , being many , are one body , so also is Christ .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles , carried away unto these dumb idols , even as ye were led .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I give you to understand , that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed , and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord , except by the Holy Ghost .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now there are diversities of gifts , but the same Spirit .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	5	And there are differences of administrations , but the same Lord .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of operations , but it is the same God who worketh all in all .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit thereby :
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom ; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	9	to another faith by the same Spirit ; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	10	to another the working of miracles ; to another prophecy ; to another discerning of spirits ; to another divers kinds of tongues ; to another the interpretation of tongues .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But all of these that one and the selfsame Spirit worketh , apportioning to every man individually as He will .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body , whether we are Jews or Gentiles , whether we are bond or free , and have been all made to drink into one Spirit .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member , but many .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot shall say , “ Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body , ” is it therefore not of the body ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear shall say , “ Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body , ” is it therefore not of the body ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where would be the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where would be the smelling ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now hath God set the members , every one of them , in the body as it hath pleased Him .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	19	And if they were all one member , where would be the body ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now there are many members , yet but one body .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	21	And the eye can not say unto the hand , “ I have no need of thee ” ; nor again the head to the feet , “ I have no need of you. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	22	Nay , much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	23	And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable , upon these we bestow more abundant honor ; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	24	For our comely parts have no need , but God hath tempered the body together , having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	25	that there should be no schism in the body , but that the members should have the same care one for another .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And whenever one member suffer , all the members suffer with it ; or when one member is honored , all the members rejoice with it .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now ye are the body of Christ , and members in particular .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And God hath set some in the church : first apostles , secondarily prophets , thirdly teachers , after that miracle workers , then those with gifts of healing , helpers , administrators , and those with diversity of tongues .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Are all workers of miracles ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Have all the gifts of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	12	31	But covet earnestly the best gifts , and yet show I unto you a more excellent way .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	13	And now abideth faith , hope , charity , these three ; but the greatest of these is charity .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries and all knowledge , and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains , but have not charity , I am nothing .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , but have not charity , it profiteth me nothing .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Charity suffereth long , and is kind ; charity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	5	doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not her own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	6	rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth in the truth ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	7	beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Charity never faileth . But whether there be prophecies , they shall fail ; whether there be tongues , they shall cease ; whether there be knowledge , it shall vanish away .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part , and we prophesy in part .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	10	But when that which is perfect is come , then that which is in part shall be done away .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I spoke as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child ; but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For now we see through a glass , darkly , but then face to face . Now I know in part ; but then shall I know , even as also I am known .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in an unknown tongue , my spirit prayeth , but my understanding is unfruitful .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men , but unto God , for no man understandeth him , however it may be that in the spirit he speaketh mysteries .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth , speaketh unto men for edification and exhortation and comfort .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself , but he that prophesieth edifieth the church .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I would that ye all spoke with tongues , but rather that ye prophesied ; for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , unless he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	6	Now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , unless I shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	7	And even things without life , making sounds , whether pipe or harp , unless they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So likewise you , unless ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken , for ye shall be speaking into the air ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signification .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	11	Therefore , if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	12	Even so ye , inasmuch as ye are zealous to possess spiritual gifts , seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also ; I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Else , when thou shalt bless with the spirit , how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say “ Amen ” at thy giving of thanks , seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For thou verily givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God that I speak with tongues more than ye all .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	19	Yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brethren , be not children in understanding . Nonetheless , in malice be ye children , but in understanding be men .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written : “ With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people ; and yet for all that they will not hear Me , ” saith the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Therefore tongues are for a sign , not to those who believe , but to those who believe not ; but prophesying serveth not those who believe not , but those who believe .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole church come together into one place and all speak with tongues , and there come in those who are unlearned or unbelievers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy , and there come in one that believeth not or is unlearned , he is convinced by all and is judged by all ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	25	and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you in truth .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	26	How is it then , brethren ? When ye come together every one of you hath a psalm , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation . Let all things be done for edification .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two or at the most by three , and then in turn , and let one interpret .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there be no interpreter , let him keep silence in the church , and let him speak to himself and to God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Let two or three prophets speak , and let the others judge .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	30	If anything be revealed to another who sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For ye may all prophesy one by one , that all may learn and all may be comforted .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	32	The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	33	for God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as it is in all churches of the saints .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	34	Let your women keep silence in the churches , for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	35	And if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home , for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	36	What ? Did the Word of God come out from you ? Or did it come unto you only ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But if any man be ignorant , let him be ignorant .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	39	Therefore , brethren , covet to prophesy , and forbid not to speak in tongues .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	14	40	Let all things be done decently and in order .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	15	Yea , and we are found to be false witnesses of God , because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ , whom He did not raise up , if so it be that the dead rise not .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	2	by which ye also are saved if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you— unless ye have believed in vain .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received : how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	4	and that He was buried , and that He arose again the third day according to the Scriptures ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that He was seen by Cephas , then by the twelve ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	6	and that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once , of whom the greater part remain unto this present , but some have fallen asleep .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	7	After that He was seen by James , then by all the apostles .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	8	And last of all He was seen by me also , as by one born out of due time .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles , not meet to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but I labored more abundantly than they all — yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Therefore whether it were I or they , so we preach , and so ye believed .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached , that He rose from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead , then is Christ not risen :
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	14	and if Christ be not risen , then our preaching is vain , and your faith is also vain .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead rise not , then is Christ not raised ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	17	and if Christ be not raised , your faith is vain ; ye are yet in your sins .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men most miserable .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But now Christ is risen from the dead , and become the firstfruits of those who slept .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since by man came death , by Man came also the resurrection of the dead .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die , even so in Christ shall all be made alive ;
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	23	but every man in his own order : Christ the firstfruits ; afterward those who are Christ ’ s at His coming .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then cometh the end when He shall have delivered up the Kingdom to God , even the Father , when He shall have put down all rule , and all authority and power .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For He must reign until He hath put all enemies under His feet .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	27	for “ He hath put all things under His feet. ” But when He saith “ all things ” are put under Him , it is manifest that He is excepted , who did put all things under Him .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto Him , then shall the Son Himself also be subject unto Him who put all things under Him , that God may be all in all .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Else , what shall they do who are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ? Why are they then baptized for the dead ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And why stand we in jeopardy every hour ?
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I declare by my rejoicing in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord : I die daily .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus , what advantage is there to me , if the dead rise not ? “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die ! ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Be not deceived : “ Evil associations corrupt good manners. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Awake to righteousness , and sin not ; for some have not the knowledge of God . I speak this to your shame .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But some man will say , “ How are the dead raised up ? And with what body do they come ? ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Thou fool , that which thou sowest is not quickened , unless it die .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And that which thou sowest is not that body which shall be , but bare grain , by chance of wheat or of some other grain .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him , and to every seed his own body .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh ; but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial ; but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory of the terrestrial is another .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differeth from another star in glory .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead : It is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . There is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	45	And so it is written : “ The first man Adam was made a living soul. ” The last Adam was made a quickening Spirit .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	46	However that which is spiritual was not first , but that which is natural , and afterward that which is spiritual .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man is of the earth , earthy ; the second Man is the Lord from Heaven .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As is the earthy , such are they also that are earthy ; and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood can not inherit the Kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I show you a mystery : We shall not all sleep ; but we shall all be changed
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written : “ Death is swallowed up in victory. ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	55	“ O death , where is thy sting ? O grave , where is thy victory ? ”
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin , and the strength of sin is the law .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God , who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ !
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	15	58	Therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye steadfast , unmovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , for ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	1	Corinthians
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	16	that ye submit yourselves unto such and to everyone that helpeth with us and laboreth .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	2	Upon the first day of the week , let every one of you lay aside in store as God hath prospered him , so that there need be no gatherings when I come .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	3	And when I come , whomever ye shall approve by your letters I will send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	4	And if it be meet that I go also , they shall go with me .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	5	Now I will come unto you when I shall pass through Macedonia ( for I am passing through Macedonia ) .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	6	And it may be that I will abide , yea , and winter with you , that ye may send me on my journey whithersoever I go .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I will not see you now on my way , but I trust to tarry a while with you , if the Lord permit .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	9	For a great door , and effectual , has opened unto me , and there are many adversaries .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timothy come , see that he may be with you without fear , for he worketh the work of the Lord , as I also do .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	11	Let no man therefore despise him , but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come unto me ; for I look for him with the brethren .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	12	Now concerning our brother Apollos : I greatly desired that he should come unto you with the brethren , but it was not at all his will to come at this time ; but he will come when it shall be convenient .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Watch ye ; stand fast in the faith ; acquit yourselves like men ; be strong .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Let all your things be done with charity .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	15	I beseech you , brethren ( ye know the household of Stephanas and that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints ) ,
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	17	I am glad about the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus , for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours ; therefore acknowledge ye those who are such .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	20	All the brethren greet you . Greet ye one another with a holy kiss .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	21	The salutation of me , Paul , with mine own hand .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	22	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ , let him be anathema . Maranatha !
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
KJ21	1%20Corinthians	16	24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , Unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints who are in all Achaia :
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	4	who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted by God .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	6	And whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer ; or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	7	And our hope for you is steadfast , knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so shall ye be also of the consolation .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we would not have you ignorant , brethren , of our trouble which came to us in Asia : that we were pressed beyond measure , beyond strength , insomuch that we despaired even of life .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raiseth the dead ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	10	who delivered us from so great a death , and doth deliver us , in whom we trust that He will yet deliver us .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	11	Ye also helped by praying together for us , so that for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many persons , thanks may be given by many on our behalf .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience : that we have had our discourse in the world , and more abundantly toward you , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God in simplicity and godly sincerity .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write no other things unto you than what ye read or acknowledge ; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	14	as ye also have acknowledged us in part , that we are your rejoicing , even as ye also are ours in the Day of the Lord Jesus .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence , I was minded to come unto you before this , that ye might have a second benefit :
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	16	to visit you on my way to Macedonia , and to come again to you on my way out of Macedonia , and be sent by you on my way toward Judea .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	17	When therefore I was thus minded , did I decide lightly ? Or the things which I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be “ yea , yea ” and “ nay , nay ” ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But as God is true , our word toward you was not “ yea ” and “ nay. ”
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us , even by me and Silvanus and Timothy , was not “ yea ” and “ nay , ” but in Him was “ yea. ”
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For all the promises of God in Him are “ yea ” ; and in Him “ amen ” unto the glory of God by us .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now He who establisheth us with you in Christ , and hath anointed us , is God ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	22	who hath also put His seal upon us , and given us the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul , that it was to spare you that I came not as yet unto Corinth ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	1	24	not that we have dominion over your faith , but are helpers for your joy . For by faith ye stand .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorrowful , who is he then who maketh me glad , but the same who is made sorrowful by me ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote as I did unto you lest , when I came , I should have sorrow from those of whom I ought to rejoice , having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears , not that ye should be grieved , but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly for you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But if any have caused grief , he hath not grieved me , but in part ” that I may not overburden you all .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a man is this censure , which was inflicted by many ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	7	so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Therefore I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also did I write , that I might have proof from you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	10	To whom ye forgive anything , I forgive also ; for if I forgave anything , to whom I forgave it , I forgave it for your sakes in the person of Christ ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	11	lest Satan should get an advantage over us . For we are not ignorant of his devices .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Furthermore , when I came to Troas to preach Christ ’ s Gospel , and a door was opened unto me by the Lord ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit because I found not Titus my brother ; but taking my leave of them , I went from thence into Macedonia .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be unto God , who always causeth us to triumph in Christ and who maketh manifest through us the savor of His knowledge in every place .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ , in those who are saved and in those who perish :
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	16	to the one we are the savor of death unto death , and to the other the savor of life unto life . And who is sufficient for these things ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as many who corrupt the Word of God ; but as out of sincerity , but as from God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts , known and read by all men ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	3	for ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but in fleshy tablets of the heart .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	4	And such is the trust we have through Christ to Godward .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as coming from ourselves , but our sufficiency is from God ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	6	who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament — not of the letter , but of the Spirit ; for the letter killeth , but the Spirit giveth life .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	7	But if the ministration of death , written and engraved in stones was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance , which glory was to be done away with ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	8	how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be more glorious ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministration of condemnation is glory , much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory !
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that which is done away with was glorious , much more that which remaineth is glorious .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Seeing then that we have such hope , we use great plainness of speech—
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	13	and not as Moses , who put a veil over his face , so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which was being abolished .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were blinded ; for until this day the same veil remaineth untaken away in the reading of the old testament , which veil is done away with in Christ .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But even unto this day , when Moses is read , the veil is upon their hearts .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	16	Nevertheless , when they shall turn to the Lord , the veil shall be taken away .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is that Spirit ; and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	3	18	But we all , with uncovered face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image , from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	2	but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the Word of God deceitfully ; but by manifesting the truth we commend ourselves to every man ’ s conscience in the sight of God .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	4	whose unbelieving minds the god of this world hath blinded , lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	3	But if our Gospel be hid , it is hid to those who are lost ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For we preach not ourselves , but Christ Jesus the Lord , and ourselves your servants for Jesus ’ sake .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God , who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are troubled on every side , yet not distressed ; we are perplexed , but not in despair ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	9	persecuted , but not forsaken ; cast down , but not destroyed ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	10	always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus ’ sake , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So then death worketh in us , but life in you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	13	We , having the same spirit of faith , according as it is written : “ I believed and therefore have I spoken ” — we also believe and therefore speak ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	14	knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus , and shall present us with you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes , that , through the thanksgiving of many , the abundant grace might redound to the glory of God .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	16	For this cause we faint not , but though our outward man perish , yet the inward man is renewed day by day .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our light affliction , which is but for a moment , worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	4	18	while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . For the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	2	For in this we groan , earnestly desiring to be clothed about with our house which is from Heaven ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now He that hath wrought us for this selfsame thing is God , who also hath given unto us the pledge of the Spirit .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	3	that , being so clothed , we shall not be found naked .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For we that are in this tabernacle do groan , being burdened , not because we would be unclothed , but clothed about , that mortality might be swallowed up by life .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Therefore we are always confident , knowing that , whilst we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	7	for we walk by faith , not by sight .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	8	We are confident , I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Therefore we labor , that , whether present or absent , we may be accepted by Him .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to what he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God , and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have something to answer those who glory in appearance and not in heart .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For if we be beside ourselves , it is for God ; if we be soberminded , it is for your cause .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ constraineth us , because we thus judge that if One died for all , then all were dead ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	15	and that He died for all , that those who live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto Him who died for them and rose again .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	16	Therefore , henceforth know we no man according to the flesh ; yea , though we have known Christ according to the flesh , yet now henceforth we know Him so no more .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if any man be in Christ , he is a new creature : old things are passed away ; behold , all things have become new .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	18	And all things are of God , who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	19	to wit , that God was in Christ , reconciling the world unto Himself , not imputing their trespasses unto them , and hath committed unto us the Word of reconciliation .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God were beseeching you by us : we pray you on Christ ’ s stead , be ye reconciled to God .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	5	21	For He hath made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us , that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	2	( For He saith , “ I have heard thee at an accepted time , and in the day of salvation have I succored thee. ” Behold , now is the accepted time ! Behold , now is the day of salvation ! )
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	6	by pureness , by knowledge , by longsuffering , by kindness , by the Holy Ghost , by love unfeigned ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	3	Give no offense in anything , that the ministry be not blamed ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	4	but in all things commending ourselves as the ministers of God in much patience : in afflictions , in necessities , in distresses ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	5	in stripes , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labors , in sleeplessness , in fastings ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	7	by the word of truth , by the power of God , by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	8	through honor and dishonor , through evil report and good report ; though counted as deceivers and yet true ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	9	as unknown and yet well known , as dying and yet behold we live , as chastened and not killed ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	10	as sorrowful yet always rejoicing ; as poor yet making many rich , as having nothing and yet possessing all things .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	11	O ye Corinthians , our mouth is opened unto you , and our heart is enlarged .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	12	Ye are not straitened in us , but ye are straitened in your own affections .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	13	Now as a recompense for this ( I speak as unto my children ) , be ye also enlarged .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers , for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ? And what communion hath light with darkness ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial ? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? For ye are the temple of the living God . As God hath said : “ I will dwell in them and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be My people. ”
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	17	Therefore , “ Come out from among them , and be ye separate , ” saith the Lord . “ And touch not the unclean thing , and I will receive you ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	6	18	and will be a Father unto you , and ye shall be My sons and daughters , ” saith the Lord Almighty .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Receive us : we have wronged no man , we have corrupted no man , we have defrauded no man .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	7	and not by his coming only , but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us of your earnest desire , your mourning , your fervent mind toward me , so that I rejoiced the more .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I speak this not to condemn you , for I have said before that ye are in our hearts , to die and live with you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you ; great is my glorying of you . I am filled with comfort ; I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For when we had come into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were troubled on every side : without were fightings , within were fears .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless God , who comforteth those that are cast down , comforted us by the coming of Titus ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For though I caused you sorrow with a letter , I do not now repent , though I did repent ; for I perceive that the same epistle hath caused you sorrow , though it were but for a season .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I rejoice , not that ye were made sorrowful , but that your sorrow led to repentance . For ye were made sorrowful in a godly manner , that ye might receive injury from us in nothing .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For godly sorrow is not to be repented of , but worketh repentance unto salvation ; but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For behold this selfsame thing , when ye sorrowed in a godly manner : what earnest concern it wrought in you , yea , what clearing of yourselves , yea , what indignation , yea , what fear , yea , what vehement desire , yea , what zeal , yea , what requital ! In all these things ye have proved yourselves to be clear in this matter .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	12	Therefore , though I wrote unto you , I did not do so for the sake of him who had done the wrong , nor for his sake who suffered wrong , but that our concern for you in the sight of God might appear unto you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort . Yea , we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if I have boasted anything to him of you , I am not ashamed , but as we spoke all things to you in truth , even so our boasting , which I made before Titus , is found to be true .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye received him .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	2	how in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I speak not by commandment , but by occasion of the forthcoming of others , and to prove the sincerity of your love .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For to their power , I bear record , yea , and beyond their power they were willing to give of themselves ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	4	praying us with earnest entreaty that we would receive the gift , and take upon us the fellowship of ministering to the saints .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And this they did , not as we had hoped , but first they gave themselves to the Lord and unto us by the will of God ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	6	insomuch that we urged Titus that , as he had begun , so he would finish in you the same grace also .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	7	Therefore as ye abound in everything — in faith , and utterance , and knowledge , in all diligence , and in your love for us — see that ye abound in this grace also .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though He was rich , yet for your sakes He became poor , that ye through His poverty might be rich .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	10	And herein I give my advice , for this is expedient for you , who began earlier not only to do , but also to be in the forefront a year ago .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	11	Now therefore perform the doing of it , that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to what a man hath , and not according to what he hath not .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For I do not mean that other men should be eased and ye burdened ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	14	but that there be an equality : that now at this time your abundance may supply their want , that their abundance may also supply your want , that there may be equality .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	15	As it is written : “ He that had gathered much had nothing left over , and he that had gathered little had no lack. ”
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation , but being even more zealous , of his own accord he went unto you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the churches .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	19	And not that only , but he was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this grace , which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord , and to declare your ready mind .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	20	For we are avoiding having any man blame us in this abundance which is administered by us ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	21	providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved to be diligent in many things , but now much more diligent because of the great confidence which I have in you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	23	If any should inquire about Titus , he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you . Or if our brethren be inquired about , they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of Christ .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Therefore show ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	2	For I know the forwardness of your thinking , for which I boast of you to those of Macedonia that Achaia was ready a year ago ; and your zeal hath called forth very many .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	9	As it is written : “ He hath dispersed abroad , he hath given to the poor ; his righteousness remaineth for ever. ”
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	3	Yet I have sent the brethren , lest our boasting of you on this account should be in vain , that , as I said , ye may be ready ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	4	lest it might happen , if those of Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared , that we ( that we say not “ ye ” ) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go ahead unto you and make up your bounty beforehand ( whereof ye had notice beforehand ) , that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty , and not as of covetousness .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	6	But this I say : He who soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly , and he who soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	7	As every man purposeth in his heart , so let him give , not grudgingly or out of compulsion ; for God loveth the cheerful giver .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you , that ye , always having all sufficiency in all things , may abound in every good work .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Now may He that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food , and multiply your seed sown , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	11	ye being enriched in everything to all bountifulness , which causeth through us thanksgiving to God .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints , but is abundant also in much thanksgiving unto God ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	13	while by the experience of this ministration they glorify God for your freely declared subjection unto the Gospel of Christ , and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	14	and by their prayer for you , they who long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift !
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	2	I beseech you that when I am present I need not be bold with that confidence with which I have in mind to be bold against some , who think of us as though we walked according to the flesh .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	10	“ For his letters , ” say they , “ are weighty and powerful , but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech contemptible. ”
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh , we do not war according to the flesh .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	4	For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal , but mighty through God for the pulling down of strongholds ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	5	casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	6	and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	7	Do ye look on things according to the outward appearance ? If any man trust himself that he is Christ ’ s , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Christ ’ s , even so are we Christ ’ s .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority ( which the Lord hath given us for edification , and not for your destruction ) , I should not be ashamed ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	9	that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such a one think this : that as we are in word by letters when we are absent , so will we be also in deed when we are present .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	12	For we dare not number ourselves , or compare ourselves , with some who commend themselves . For in measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , they are not wise .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast of things beyond our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we reached not unto you . For we have come as far as to you also in preaching the Gospel of Christ ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	15	not boasting of things beyond our own measure , that is , of other men ’ s labors ; but having hope that , when your faith has increased , we shall be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	16	to preach the Gospel in the regions beyond you , and not to boast in another man ’ s rule , which he made ready for our hand .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But “ he that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord. ”
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	10	18	For it is not he that commendeth himself who is approved , but whom the Lord commendeth .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy ; for I have espoused you to one Husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Why so ? Because I love you not ? God knoweth !
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I fear lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached , or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received , or another gospel which ye have not accepted , ye might well bear with him .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I consider myself not a whit lower than the very chiefest apostles .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	6	Though I am rude in speech , yet I am not in knowledge ; for we have been made thoroughly manifest among you in all things .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that ye might be exalted , because I have preached to you the Gospel of God without charge ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches , taking wages from them to do you service .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And when I was present with you and was in want , I was burdensome to no man , for that which I lacked the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied ; and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you , and so will I keep myself .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me , no man shall stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I do , that I will continue to do , that I may cut off occasion from those who desire occasion , that wherein they glory they may be found even as we .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such are false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no marvel , for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness , whose end shall be according to their works .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I say again , let no man think me a fool . But if otherwise , yet as a fool receive me , that I may boast of myself a little .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	17	( That which I now speak , I speak it not from the Lord , but as it were foolishly , in this confidence as boasting .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Since many glory in the flesh , I will glory also . )
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For ye suffer fools gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise !
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage , or if a man devour you , if a man take from you , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I speak as reproached , as though we had been weak . However it be , whereinsoever anyone is bold ( I speak foolishly ) , I am bold also .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? So am I .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they ministers of Christ ? ( I speak as a fool ) I am more — in labors more abundant , in stripes beyond measure , in prisons more frequent , in deaths often .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	24	From the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned ; thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day adrift in the deep ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	26	in journeyings often , in perils from waters , in perils from robbers , in perils from mine own countrymen , in perils from the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	27	in weariness and painfulness , in sleeplessness often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Besides those things which are external , there is that which cometh upon me daily : the care for all the churches !
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is offended , and I burn not ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I must glory , I will glory in the things which concern mine infirmities .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who is blessed for evermore , knoweth that I lie not .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus , the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes with a garrison , desirous to apprehend me ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	11	33	but I was let down by the wall in a basket through a window , and escaped his hands .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I knew a man in Christ more than fourteen years ago ( whether in the body I can not tell , or whether out of the body I can not tell — God knoweth ) . Such a one was caught up to the third Heaven .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience , in signs and wonders and mighty deeds .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I knew such a man ( whether in the body or out of the body I can not tell — God knoweth ) ,
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	4	and how he was caught up into Paradise , and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	5	Of such a one will I glory , yet of myself I will not glory , except in mine infirmities .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool , for I will say the truth . But now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or than he heareth of me .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , the messenger of Satan to buffet me , lest I should be exalted above measure .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	8	For this thing , I besought the Lord thrice , that it might depart from me .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And He said unto me , “ My grace is sufficent for thee , for My strength is made perfect in weakness. ” Most gladly therefore will I glory rather in my infirmities , that the power of Christ may rest upon me .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in privations , in persecutions , in distresses for Christ ’ s sake ; for when I am weak , then am I strong .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have become a fool in glorying . Ye have compelled me , for I ought to have been commended by you . For in nothing am I inferior to the very chiefest apostles , though I am nothing .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For in what are ye inferior to other churches , unless it be that I myself was not burdensome to you ? Forgive me this wrong !
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Behold , for the third time I am ready to come to you , and I will not be burdensome to you , for I seek not yours , but you . For the children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you , though the more abundantly I love you , the less I am loved .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But be it so , I did not burden you . Nevertheless , being crafty , I caught you with guile .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I gain from you by any of those whom I sent unto you ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I desired Titus to go , and with him I sent a brother . Did Titus make any gain from you ? Walked we not in the same spirit ? Walked we not in the same steps ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Again , think you that we excuse ourselves to you ? We speak before God in Christ ; but we do all things , dearly beloved , for your edifying .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I fear lest , when I come , I shall not find you such as I would , and that I shall be found by you as ye would not , lest there be debates , envyings , wrath , strifes , backbitings , whisperings , boastings , tumults ;
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	12	21	and lest , when I come again , my God will humble me among you , and that I shall bewail many who have sinned already , and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	2	I told you before , and fortell you as if I were present the second time and , being absent , now I write to those who heretofore have sinned , and to all others , that , if I come again , I will not spare —
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	13	All the saints salute you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	3	since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me , which toward you is not weak , but is mighty in you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	4	For though He was crucified through weakness , yet He liveth by the power of God . For we also are weak in Him , but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith . Test your own selves . Know ye not yourselves how Jesus Christ is in you , unless ye be reprobates ?
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	6	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil , not that we should appear to be approved , but that ye should do that which is honest , though we be as reprobates .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth , but only for the truth .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	9	For we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong . And this also we wish : even your perfection .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	10	Therefore I write these things being absent , lest , were I present , I should use sharpness , according to the power which the Lord hath given me for edification , and not for destruction .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	11	Finally , brethren , farewell . Be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace shall be with you .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with a holy kiss .
KJ21	2%20Corinthians	13	14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the communion of the Holy Ghost , be with you all . Amen .
KJ21	Galatians	1	1	Paul , an apostle ( not of men , neither by man , but by Jesus Christ and God the Father , who raised Him from the dead ) ,
KJ21	Galatians	1	2	and all the brethren who are with me , Unto the churches of Galatia :
KJ21	Galatians	1	3	Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	Galatians	1	4	who gave Himself for our sins , that He might deliver us from this present evil world , according to the will of God and our Father ,
KJ21	Galatians	1	5	to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
KJ21	Galatians	1	6	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him , that called you into the grace of Christ , for another gospel .
KJ21	Galatians	1	7	For this is not another ; but there are some who trouble you and would pervert the Gospel of Christ .
KJ21	Galatians	1	8	But should we , or an angel from Heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached to you , let him be accursed .
KJ21	Galatians	1	9	As we said before , so say I now again : If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that which ye have received , let him be accursed !
KJ21	Galatians	1	10	For do I now persuade men , or God ? Or do I seek to please men ? For if I yet sought to please men , I should not be the servant of Christ .
KJ21	Galatians	1	11	But I certify to you , brethren , that the Gospel which was preached by me is not according to man ;
KJ21	Galatians	1	12	for I neither received it from man , neither was I taught it , but by the revelation of Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Galatians	1	13	For ye have heard of my participation in times past in the Jews ’ religion , how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and wasted it .
KJ21	Galatians	1	14	I profited in the Jews ’ religion beyond many of my equals in mine own nation , being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers .
KJ21	Galatians	1	15	But when it pleased God , who separated me from my mother ’ s womb and called me by His grace ,
KJ21	Galatians	1	16	to reveal His Son in me , that I might preach Him among the heathen , I conferred not immediately with flesh and blood ,
KJ21	Galatians	1	17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me , but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus .
KJ21	Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter , and abode with him fifteen days .
KJ21	Galatians	1	19	But I saw none of the other apostles save James , the Lord ’ s brother .
KJ21	Galatians	1	20	( Now the things which I write unto you , behold , before God , I lie not . )
KJ21	Galatians	1	21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia ,
KJ21	Galatians	1	22	and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ ;
KJ21	Galatians	1	23	but they had heard only that , “ He who persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. ”
KJ21	Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me .
KJ21	Galatians	2	2	And I went up by revelation , and communicated unto them that Gospel which I preach among the Gentiles , but privately to those who were of reputation , lest by any means I should run , or had run , in vain .
KJ21	Galatians	2	3	But neither was Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , compelled to be circumcised ;
KJ21	Galatians	2	4	and that because false brethren were brought in by stealth , who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might bring us into bondage .
KJ21	Galatians	2	5	To them we gave place by submission not even for an hour , that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you .
KJ21	Galatians	2	6	But of those who seemed to be something ( whosoever they were , it maketh no difference to me : God accepteth no man ’ s person ) — those who seemed to be somewhat in consultation added nothing to me ;
KJ21	Galatians	2	7	but contrariwise , when they saw that the Gospel to the Uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the Gospel to the Circumcision was unto Peter
KJ21	Galatians	2	8	( for He that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the Circumcision , that Same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles ) ,
KJ21	Galatians	2	9	and when James , Cephas and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship , that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the Circumcision .
KJ21	Galatians	2	10	Only they would that we should remember the poor , the same as I also was eager to do .
KJ21	Galatians	2	11	But when Peter came to Antioch , I withstood him to his face , because he was to be blamed .
KJ21	Galatians	2	12	For before certain ones came from James , he ate with the Gentiles ; but when they had come , he withdrew and separated himself from them , fearing those who were of the Circumcision .
KJ21	Galatians	2	13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him , so much that Barnabas also was carried away by their dissimulation .
KJ21	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel , I said unto Peter before them all , “ If thou , being a Jew , livest after the manner of Gentiles and not as do the Jews , why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews ?
KJ21	Galatians	2	15	We who are Jews by nature , and not sinners of the Gentiles ,
KJ21	Galatians	2	16	knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law , but by the faith of Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Jesus Christ , that we might be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the law ; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified .
KJ21	Galatians	2	17	But if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is Christ therefore the minister of sin ? God forbid !
KJ21	Galatians	2	18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed , I make myself a transgressor .
KJ21	Galatians	2	19	For I through the law am dead to the law , that I might live unto God .
KJ21	Galatians	2	20	I am crucified with Christ , nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me . And the life which I now live in the flesh , I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me and gave Himself for me .
KJ21	Galatians	2	21	I do not frustrate the grace of God ; for if righteousness come by the law , then Christ is dead in vain . ”
KJ21	Galatians	3	3	Are ye so foolish ? Having begun in the Spirit , are ye now made perfect by the flesh ?
KJ21	Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn of you : Did ye receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
KJ21	Galatians	3	4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain — if it be yet in vain ?
KJ21	Galatians	3	5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you , doeth He it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
KJ21	Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham “ believed God , and it was accounted to him as righteousness. ”
KJ21	Galatians	3	7	Know ye therefore that those who are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham .
KJ21	Galatians	3	8	And the Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith , preached beforehand the Gospel unto Abraham , saying , “ In thee shall all nations be blessed. ”
KJ21	Galatians	3	9	So then , those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham .
KJ21	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse ; for it is written : “ Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. ”
KJ21	Galatians	3	11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident , for “ the just shall live by faith. ”
KJ21	Galatians	3	12	And the law is not of faith , but “ The man who doeth them shall live in them. ”
KJ21	Galatians	3	13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us ( for it is written , “ Cursed is every one who hangeth on a tree ” ) ,
KJ21	Galatians	3	14	that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ , that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
KJ21	Galatians	3	15	Brethren , I speak after the manner of men : A covenant , though it be but a man ’ s covenant , yet if it is confirmed , no man annulleth or addeth thereto .
KJ21	Galatians	3	16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made . He saith not , “ and to seeds , ” as though many ; but as though one : “ and to thy Seed , ” who is Christ .
KJ21	Galatians	3	17	And this I say , that the Covenant which was confirmed earlier by God in Christ can not be annulled by the law , which came four hundred and thirty years after , so as to make the promise of no effect .
KJ21	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance be of the law , it is no more by promise ; but God gave it to Abraham by promise .
KJ21	Galatians	3	19	For what then serveth the law ? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and itwas ordained by angels through the hand of a mediator .
KJ21	Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one , but God is one .
KJ21	Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid ! For if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should then have come by the law .
KJ21	Galatians	3	22	But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
KJ21	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came , we were kept under the law , being shut apart from the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
KJ21	Galatians	3	24	Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
KJ21	Galatians	3	25	But after faith has come , we are no longer under a schoolmaster .
KJ21	Galatians	3	26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus .
KJ21	Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ , have put on Christ .
KJ21	Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female ; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus .
KJ21	Galatians	3	29	And if ye be Christ ’ s , then are ye Abraham ’ s seed and heirs according to the promise .
KJ21	Galatians	4	4	But when the fullness of the time had come , God sent forth His Son , made of a woman , made under the law ,
KJ21	Galatians	4	2	But he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father .
KJ21	Galatians	4	3	Even so we , when we were children , were in bondage under the elements of the world .
KJ21	Galatians	4	5	to redeem those who were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
KJ21	Galatians	4	6	And because ye are sons , God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts , crying , “ Abba , Father. ”
KJ21	Galatians	4	7	Therefore thou art no more a servant but a son , and if a son , then an heir of God through Christ .
KJ21	Galatians	4	8	However that be , then when ye knew not God , ye did service unto those which by nature are not gods .
KJ21	Galatians	4	9	But now after ye have known God , or rather are known by God , how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements unto which ye desire again to be in bondage ?
KJ21	Galatians	4	10	Ye observe days and months and times and years .
KJ21	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid for you , lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain .
KJ21	Galatians	4	12	Brethren , I beseech you , be as I am , for I am as ye are . Ye have not injured me at all .
KJ21	Galatians	4	13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the Gospel unto you at the first .
KJ21	Galatians	4	14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not , nor rejected , but received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
KJ21	Galatians	4	15	Where is then the blessedness ye spoke of ? For I bear you record that , if it had been possible , ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me .
KJ21	Galatians	4	16	Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth ?
KJ21	Galatians	4	17	They zealously seek after you , but for no good ; yea , they would exclude you , that ye might seek after them .
KJ21	Galatians	4	18	But it is good to be zealously sought after , always in a good thing , and not only when I am present with you .
KJ21	Galatians	4	19	My little children , over whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you ,
KJ21	Galatians	4	20	I desire to be present with you now and to change my tone ; for I stand in doubt of you .
KJ21	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , ye who desire to be under the law , do ye not hear the law ?
KJ21	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , the one by a bondmaid , the other by a freewoman .
KJ21	Galatians	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh , but he of the freewoman was by promise .
KJ21	Galatians	4	24	These things are an allegory , for these are the two covenants : The one is from Mount Sinai , which engendereth bondage ; this is Hagar .
KJ21	Galatians	4	25	For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to Jerusalem as it is now , and is in bondage with her children .
KJ21	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem which is above is free , and is the mother of us all .
KJ21	Galatians	4	27	For it is written : “ Rejoice , thou barren that bearest not ; break forth and cry , thou that travailest not ; for the desolate hath many more children than she who hath a husband. ”
KJ21	Galatians	4	28	Now we , brethren , as Isaac was , are the children of promise .
KJ21	Galatians	4	29	But as then , he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was born according to the Spirit , even so it is now .
KJ21	Galatians	4	30	Nevertheless what saith the Scripture ? “ Cast out the bondwoman and her son , for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. ”
KJ21	Galatians	4	31	So then , brethren , we are not children of the bondwoman , but of the free .
KJ21	Galatians	5	5	For we , through the Spirit , wait for the hope of righteousness by faith .
KJ21	Galatians	5	2	Behold , I , Paul , say unto you that if ye be circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing .
KJ21	Galatians	5	3	For I testify again to every man who is circumcised , that he is a debtor to keep the whole law .
KJ21	Galatians	5	4	Christ then becomes of no effect unto you , whosoever of you claim justification by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
KJ21	Galatians	5	6	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision , but faith which worketh by love .
KJ21	Galatians	5	7	Ye were running well ; who hindered you , that ye should not obey the truth ?
KJ21	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion cometh not from Him that calleth you .
KJ21	Galatians	5	9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump .
KJ21	Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you through the Lord that ye will be not otherwise minded ; but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment , whosoever he be .
KJ21	Galatians	5	11	And I , brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why then do I yet suffer persecution ? Then would the offense of the cross cease .
KJ21	Galatians	5	12	I would that they were even cut off which trouble you !
KJ21	Galatians	5	13	For , brethren , ye have been called unto liberty ; only use not liberty for an occasion of the flesh , but by love serve one another .
KJ21	Galatians	5	14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this : “ Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. ”
KJ21	Galatians	5	15	But if ye bite and devour one another , take heed that ye not be consumed one by another .
KJ21	Galatians	5	16	This I say then : Walk in the Spirit , and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh .
KJ21	Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; and these are contrary the one to the other , so that ye can not do the things that ye would .
KJ21	Galatians	5	18	But if ye are led by the Spirit , ye are not under the law .
KJ21	Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest , and they are these : adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness ,
KJ21	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , quarreling , rivalry , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies ,
KJ21	Galatians	5	21	envying , murders , drunkenness , revelings , and such like . About these things I tell you again , as I have also told you in times past , that those who do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God .
KJ21	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith ,
KJ21	Galatians	5	23	meekness , temperance : against such there is no law .
KJ21	Galatians	5	24	And those who are Christ ’ s have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts .
KJ21	Galatians	5	25	If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit .
KJ21	Galatians	5	26	Let us not be desirous of vainglory , provoking one another and envying one another .
KJ21	Galatians	6	6	Let him that is taught in the Word share with him that teacheth , in all good things .
KJ21	Galatians	6	2	Bear ye one another ’ s burdens , and so fulfill the law of Christ .
KJ21	Galatians	6	3	For if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
KJ21	Galatians	6	4	But let every man put to the proof his own work , and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone , and not in another .
KJ21	Galatians	6	5	For every man shall bear his own burden .
KJ21	Galatians	6	7	Be not deceived , God is not mocked ; for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .
KJ21	Galatians	6	8	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting .
KJ21	Galatians	6	9	And let us not be weary in welldoing , for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
KJ21	Galatians	6	10	As we therefore have opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto those who are of the household of faith .
KJ21	Galatians	6	11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand .
KJ21	Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to make a fair showing in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised , only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
KJ21	Galatians	6	13	For not even they themselves who are circumcised keep the law , but they desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
KJ21	Galatians	6	14	But God forbid that I should glory , save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom the world is crucified unto me , and I unto the world .
KJ21	Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
KJ21	Galatians	6	16	And as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
KJ21	Galatians	6	17	From henceforth let no man trouble me , for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus .
KJ21	Galatians	6	18	Brethren , the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
KJ21	Ephesians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , To the saints who are at Ephesus , and to the faithful in Christ Jesus :
KJ21	Ephesians	1	2	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Ephesians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ , even as
KJ21	Ephesians	1	4	He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	5	having predestined us to be His own adopted children by Jesus Christ , according to the good pleasure of His will ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	6	to the praise of the glory of His grace , wherein He hath made us accepted in His Beloved :
KJ21	Ephesians	1	7	in Whom we have redemption through His blood , the forgiveness of sins , according to the riches of His grace ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	8	wherein He hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence .
KJ21	Ephesians	1	9	He hath made known unto us the mystery of His will , according to His good pleasure which He hath purposed in Himself ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	10	that in the dispensation of the fullness of times He might gather together in one all things in Christ , both which are in heaven and which are on earth , even in Him .
KJ21	Ephesians	1	11	In Christ also we have obtained an inheritance , being predestined according to the purpose of Him who worketh all things after the counsel of His own will ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	12	that we , who first trusted in Christ , should be to the praise of His glory .
KJ21	Ephesians	1	13	In Christ ye also trusted after ye heard the word of truth , the Gospel of your salvation , in Whom also after ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	14	which is the pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession , unto the praise of His glory .
KJ21	Ephesians	1	15	Therefore I also , after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	16	cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers .
KJ21	Ephesians	1	17	I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	18	the eyes of your understanding being enlightened , that ye may know what is the hope of His calling , and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	19	and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe , according to the working of His mighty power ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	20	which He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and set Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	21	far above all principality and power and might and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come .
KJ21	Ephesians	1	22	And God hath put all things under His feet , and hath given Him to be the head over all things to the church ,
KJ21	Ephesians	1	23	which is His body , the fullness of Him that filleth all in all .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	2	wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	3	Among these also we all had our manner of living in times past in the lusts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind , and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	4	But God , who is rich in mercy , because of His great love wherewith He loved us ,
KJ21	Ephesians	2	5	even when we were dead in sins , hath quickened us together with Christ ( by grace ye are saved ) ,
KJ21	Ephesians	2	6	and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus ,
KJ21	Ephesians	2	7	that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	8	For by grace are ye saved through faith , and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God—
KJ21	Ephesians	2	9	not by works , lest any man should boast .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	10	For we are His workmanship , created in Christ Jesus unto good works , which God hath beforehand ordained , that we should walk in them .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore , remember that ye , being in times past Gentiles in the flesh , who are called Uncircumcision by those who are called the Circumcision in the flesh so made by hands—
KJ21	Ephesians	2	12	remember that at that time ye were without Christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus , ye who once were far off have been brought nigh by the blood of Christ .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	14	For He is our peace , who hath made both one , and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us ,
KJ21	Ephesians	2	15	having abolished in His flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordinances , that He might make in Himself one new man out of the two , so making peace ,
KJ21	Ephesians	2	16	and that He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross , having slain the enmity thereby .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	17	He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were nigh ;
KJ21	Ephesians	2	18	for through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	19	Now therefore , ye are strangers and foreigners no more , but fellow citizens with the saints , and of the household of God .
KJ21	Ephesians	2	20	Ye are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone ,
KJ21	Ephesians	2	21	in whom all the building , fitly framed together , groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord ,
KJ21	Ephesians	2	22	in Whom ye also are built together for a habitation of God through the Spirit .
KJ21	Ephesians	3	3	how by revelation He made known unto me the mystery ( as I wrote before in a few words ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	2	if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me toward you ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	4	whereby when ye read this , ye may understand my knowledge of the mystery of Christ ) ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	5	which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men , as it is now revealed unto His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit :
KJ21	Ephesians	3	6	that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs , and of the same body , and partakers of His promise in Christ by the Gospel ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	7	for which I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of His power .
KJ21	Ephesians	3	8	Unto me , who am less than the least of all saints , is this grace given , that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	9	and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery , which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God , who created all things by Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	10	with the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known through the church the manifold wisdom of God ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	11	according to the eternal purpose which He hath purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	12	in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him .
KJ21	Ephesians	3	13	Therefore , I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you , which are your glory .
KJ21	Ephesians	3	14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	15	from whom the whole family in Heaven and earth is named ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	16	that He would grant you , according to the riches of His glory , to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man ;
KJ21	Ephesians	3	17	that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith ; that ye , being rooted and grounded in love ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	18	may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	19	and to know the love of Christ , which surpasseth knowledge , that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God .
KJ21	Ephesians	3	20	Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that worketh in us ,
KJ21	Ephesians	3	21	unto Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages , world without end . Amen .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	4	There is one body and one Spirit , even as ye are called in one hope of your calling ;
KJ21	Ephesians	4	2	with all lowliness and meekness , with longsuffering , forbearing one another in love ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	3	endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	5	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	7	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	8	Therefore He saith , “ When He ascended up on high , He led captivity captive , and gave gifts unto men. ”
KJ21	Ephesians	4	9	( Now the saying , “ He ascended ” — what does it mean but that He also descended first into the lower parts of the earth ?
KJ21	Ephesians	4	10	He that descended is the same who also ascended up far above all heavens , that He might fill all things . )
KJ21	Ephesians	4	11	And He gave some to be apostles , and some prophets , and some evangelists , and some pastors and teachers ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	12	for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry , and for the edifying of the body of Christ ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	13	until we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ;
KJ21	Ephesians	4	14	that we henceforth be no longer children , tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and their cunning and craftiness , whereby they lie in wait to deceive ;
KJ21	Ephesians	4	15	but speaking the truth in love , may grow up into Him in all things , who is the Head , even Christ ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	16	from whom the whole body , fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	17	This I say , therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	18	having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	19	who , being past feeling , have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	20	But ye have not so learned Christ ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	21	if so it be that ye have heard Him and have been taught by Him as the truth is in Jesus :
KJ21	Ephesians	4	22	that ye put off , concerning your former manner of living , the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	23	and be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	24	and that ye put on that new man , which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	25	Therefore , putting away lying , let every man speak truth with his neighbor , for we are members one of another .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	26	Be ye angry , and sin not : let not the sun go down on your wrath ,
KJ21	Ephesians	4	27	neither give place to the devil .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	28	Let him that stole steal no more , but rather let him labor , working with his hands the thing which is good , that he may have to give to him that needeth .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	29	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to use in edifying , that it may minister grace unto the hearers .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
KJ21	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you , with all malice ;
KJ21	Ephesians	4	32	and be ye kind one to another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , even as God for Christ ’ s sake hath forgiven you .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	5	For this ye know : that no whoremonger , nor unclean person , nor covetous man who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	2	and walk in love , as Christ also hath loved us , and hath given Himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savor .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	3	But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness , let them not once be named among you , as becometh saints ;
KJ21	Ephesians	5	4	neither filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor jesting , which are not befitting , but rather giving of thanks .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	6	Let no man deceive you with vain words , for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	7	Be ye not therefore partakers with them .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	8	For ye were sometimes darkness , but now ye are light in the Lord . Walk as children of light
KJ21	Ephesians	5	9	( for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ) ,
KJ21	Ephesians	5	10	proving what is acceptable unto the Lord .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them ,
KJ21	Ephesians	5	12	for it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light , for whatsoever doth make manifest is light .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	14	Therefore He saith : “ Awake , thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall give thee light. ”
KJ21	Ephesians	5	15	See then that ye walk circumspectly , not as fools , but as wise ,
KJ21	Ephesians	5	16	redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	17	Therefore , be ye not unwise , but understand what the will of the Lord is .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	18	And be not drunk with wine , wherein is excess ; but be filled with the Spirit ,
KJ21	Ephesians	5	19	speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ,
KJ21	Ephesians	5	20	giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	Ephesians	5	21	submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the Lord ;
KJ21	Ephesians	5	23	for the husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church , and He is the savior of the body .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for it ,
KJ21	Ephesians	5	26	that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word ,
KJ21	Ephesians	5	27	that He might present it to Himself a glorious church , not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing , but that it should be holy and without blemish .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . He hat loveth his wife loveth himself .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh , but nourisheth and cherisheth it , even as the Lord the church .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	30	For we are members of His body , of His flesh , and of His bones .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	31	“ For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh. ”
KJ21	Ephesians	5	32	This is a great mystery , but I speak concerning Christ and the church .
KJ21	Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless , let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself , and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	6	not with eyeservice as menpleasers , but as the servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart ,
KJ21	Ephesians	6	2	“ Honor thy father and mother , ” which is the first commandment with promise :
KJ21	Ephesians	6	3	“ that it may be well with thee , and thou mayest live long on the earth. ”
KJ21	Ephesians	6	4	And ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath , but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	5	Servants , be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ,
KJ21	Ephesians	6	7	with good will doing service , as to the Lord and not to men ,
KJ21	Ephesians	6	8	knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth , the same shall he receive from the Lord , whether he be bond or free .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	9	And ye masters , do the same things unto them , forbearing threatening , knowing that your Master also is in Heaven ; neither is there respect of persons with Him .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	10	Finally , my brethren , be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the whole armor of God , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore , take unto you the whole armor of God , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and , having done all , to stand .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore , having your loins girded about with truth , and having on the breastplate of righteousness ,
KJ21	Ephesians	6	15	and your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	16	Above all , take the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit , which is the Word of God ,
KJ21	Ephesians	6	18	praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	19	And pray for me , that utterance may be given unto me , that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the Gospel ,
KJ21	Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ambassador in bonds , that therein I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	21	But that ye also may know my affairs and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	22	I have sent him unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	23	Peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Ephesians	6	24	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity .
KJ21	Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timothy , the servants of Jesus Christ , To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi , with the bishops and deacons :
KJ21	Philippians	1	2	Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you ,
KJ21	Philippians	1	4	always in my every prayer for you all making request with joy ,
KJ21	Philippians	1	5	for your fellowship in the Gospel from the first day until now ,
KJ21	Philippians	1	6	being confident of this very thing , that He who hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the Day of Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Philippians	1	7	It is meet for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart , inasmuch as , both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel , ye are all partakers of my grace .
KJ21	Philippians	1	8	For God is my record how greatly I long for you all in the compassion of Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray , that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment ,
KJ21	Philippians	1	10	that ye may approve things that are excellent , and that ye may be sincere and without offense until the Day of Christ ,
KJ21	Philippians	1	11	being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ , unto the glory and praise of God .
KJ21	Philippians	1	12	But I would ye should understand , brethren , that the things which have happened unto me have turned out unto the furtherance of the Gospel ,
KJ21	Philippians	1	13	so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places ;
KJ21	Philippians	1	14	and many of the brethren in the Lord , waxing confident by my bonds , are much bolder to speak the Word without fear .
KJ21	Philippians	1	15	Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife , and some also out of good will .
KJ21	Philippians	1	16	The one preaches Christ out of contention and not sincerely , supposing to add affliction to my bonds ;
KJ21	Philippians	1	17	but the other out of love , knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel .
KJ21	Philippians	1	18	What then ? Notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
KJ21	Philippians	1	19	For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation through your prayer and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	Philippians	1	20	according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing shall I be ashamed , but that with all boldness , as always so now also , Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether it be by life or by death .
KJ21	Philippians	1	21	For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
KJ21	Philippians	1	22	But if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labor ; yet what I shall choose , I know not .
KJ21	Philippians	1	23	For I am in a strait between the two , having a desire to depart and to be with Christ , which is far better ;
KJ21	Philippians	1	24	nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you .
KJ21	Philippians	1	25	And having this confidence , I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy in faith ,
KJ21	Philippians	1	26	that your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again .
KJ21	Philippians	1	27	Only let your manner of living be as becometh the Gospel of Christ , that whether I come and see you or else am absent , I may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind , striving together for the faith of the Gospel ,
KJ21	Philippians	1	28	and terrified in nothing by your adversaries , which is to them an evident token of perdition , but to you of salvation , and that from God .
KJ21	Philippians	1	29	For unto you it is given on behalf of Christ , not only to believe in Him , but also to suffer for His sake ,
KJ21	Philippians	1	30	having the same conflict which ye saw in me , and now hear to be in me .
KJ21	Philippians	2	2	fulfill ye my joy , that ye be likeminded , having the same love , being of one accord and of one mind .
KJ21	Philippians	2	3	Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory , but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than himself .
KJ21	Philippians	2	4	Look not every man to his own things , but every man also to the things of others .
KJ21	Philippians	2	5	Let this mind be in you , which was also in Christ Jesus ,
KJ21	Philippians	2	6	who , being in the form of God , thought it not robbery to be equal with God ,
KJ21	Philippians	2	7	but made Himself of no reputation , and took upon Him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of men .
KJ21	Philippians	2	8	And being found in the fashion of a man , He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death—even the death of the cross .
KJ21	Philippians	2	9	Therefore God also hath highly exalted Him , and given Him a name which is above every name ,
KJ21	Philippians	2	10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in Heaven and things on earth and things under the earth ,
KJ21	Philippians	2	11	and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
KJ21	Philippians	2	12	Therefore , my beloved , as ye have always obeyed , not only in my presence , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
KJ21	Philippians	2	13	For it is God who worketh in you , both to will and to do of His good pleasure .
KJ21	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without murmuring and disputing ,
KJ21	Philippians	2	15	that ye may be blameless and unoffending , the sons of God , without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ,
KJ21	Philippians	2	16	holding forth the Word of Life , that I may rejoice in the Day of Christ that I have not run in vain , neither labored in vain .
KJ21	Philippians	2	17	Yea , and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I am joyful and rejoice with you all .
KJ21	Philippians	2	18	For the same cause also be ye joyful , and rejoice with me .
KJ21	Philippians	2	19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you , that I also may be comforted when I know of your state ;
KJ21	Philippians	2	20	for I have no man likeminded , who will naturally care for your state .
KJ21	Philippians	2	21	For all seek their own , not the things which are Jesus Christ ’ s .
KJ21	Philippians	2	22	But ye know the proof of him , how as a son with a father he hath served with me in the Gospel .
KJ21	Philippians	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send presently , as soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
KJ21	Philippians	2	24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly .
KJ21	Philippians	2	25	Yet I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother and companion in labor and fellow soldier , but your messenger and he that ministered to my wants .
KJ21	Philippians	2	26	For he longed after you all and was full of heaviness , because ye had heard that he had been sick .
KJ21	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death , but God had mercy on him , and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
KJ21	Philippians	2	28	I sent him therefore the more carefully , that when ye see him again ye may rejoice , and I may be the less sorrowful .
KJ21	Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness , and hold such in high honor ,
KJ21	Philippians	2	30	because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death , not having regard for his own life , to supply what was lacking in your service toward me .
KJ21	Philippians	3	3	For we are the Circumcision who worship God in the spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh—
KJ21	Philippians	3	2	Beware of dogs , beware of evil workers , beware of the Concision .
KJ21	Philippians	3	4	though I might also have confidence in the flesh . If any other man thinketh that he hath grounds to trust in the flesh , I have more :
KJ21	Philippians	3	5	circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of the Hebrews ; according to the law , a Pharisee ;
KJ21	Philippians	3	6	concerning zeal , persecuting the church ; as to the righteousness before the law , blameless .
KJ21	Philippians	3	7	But what things were gain to me , those I counted as loss for Christ .
KJ21	Philippians	3	8	Yea doubtless , and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord , for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but dung , that I may win Christ
KJ21	Philippians	3	9	and be found in Him , not having mine own righteousness which is of the law , but that which is through the faith of Christ , the righteousness which is of God by faith ,
KJ21	Philippians	3	10	that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings , being made conformable unto His death ,
KJ21	Philippians	3	11	that if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead .
KJ21	Philippians	3	12	It is not as though I had already attained it , nor were already perfect ; but I follow after , that I may apprehend that for which Christ Jesus also apprehended me .
KJ21	Philippians	3	13	Brethren , I count not myself to have apprehended it , but this one thing I do : forgetting those things which are behind , and reaching forth unto those things which are before ,
KJ21	Philippians	3	14	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus .
KJ21	Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore , as many as would be perfect , be thus minded ; and if in anything ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even this unto you .
KJ21	Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless , however much we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
KJ21	Philippians	3	17	Brethren , be followers together of me , and mark those who so walk , as ye have us for an example .
KJ21	Philippians	3	18	( For many walk , of whom I have told you often and now tell you even with weeping , as the enemies of the cross of Christ .
KJ21	Philippians	3	19	Their end is destruction , their God is their belly , and their glory is in their shame , who mind earthly things . )
KJ21	Philippians	3	20	For our abiding is in Heaven , from whence also we look for the Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	Philippians	3	21	who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body , according to the working whereby He is able even to subdue all things unto Himself .
KJ21	Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always ; and again I say , “ Rejoice ! ”
KJ21	Philippians	4	2	I beseech Euodias and beseech Syntyche , that they be of the same mind in the Lord .
KJ21	Philippians	4	3	And I entreat thee also , true yokefellow , help those women who labored with me in the Gospel , with Clement also and with my other fellow laborers , whose names are in the Book of Life .
KJ21	Philippians	4	5	Let your moderation be known to all men . The Lord is at hand .
KJ21	Philippians	4	6	Fret not about anything , but in everything , by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known unto God .
KJ21	Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God , which passeth all understanding , shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus .
KJ21	Philippians	4	8	Finally , brethren , whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report , if there be any virtue and if there be any praise , think on these things .
KJ21	Philippians	4	9	Those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me , do ; and the God of peace shall be with you .
KJ21	Philippians	4	10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last your care for me hath flourished again ; though ye always cared , ye lacked opportunity .
KJ21	Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak in respect to want , for I have learned in whatsoever state I am , therewith to be content .
KJ21	Philippians	4	12	I know both how to be abased , and I know how to abound . Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
KJ21	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me .
KJ21	Philippians	4	14	Notwithstanding , ye have done well that ye participated in my affliction .
KJ21	Philippians	4	15	Now ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the Gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , no church communicated with me concerning giving and receiving , but ye only .
KJ21	Philippians	4	16	For even in Thessalonica , ye sent time and again unto my needs .
KJ21	Philippians	4	17	Not that I desire a gift , but I desire the fruit that may abound to your account .
KJ21	Philippians	4	18	But I have all , and abound ; I am full , having received from Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you , a sweet fragrance , a sacrifice acceptable , well-pleasing to God .
KJ21	Philippians	4	19	But my God shall supply all your need , according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus .
KJ21	Philippians	4	20	Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
KJ21	Philippians	4	21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus . The brethren who are with me greet you .
KJ21	Philippians	4	22	All the saints salute you , chiefly those who are of Caesar ’ s household .
KJ21	Philippians	4	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
KJ21	Colossians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
KJ21	Colossians	1	2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ , who are at Colossae : Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
KJ21	Colossians	1	4	since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which ye have for all the saints ,
KJ21	Colossians	1	5	for the hope which is laid up for you in Heaven , of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the Gospel ,
KJ21	Colossians	1	6	which has come unto you , as it has in all the world , and bringeth forth fruit , as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the grace of God in truth .
KJ21	Colossians	1	7	Ye also learned of it from Epaphras , our dear fellow servant , who is for you a faithful minister of Christ ,
KJ21	Colossians	1	8	who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit .
KJ21	Colossians	1	9	For this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ;
KJ21	Colossians	1	10	that ye might walk worthy of the Lord , in all pleasing Him , being fruitful in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
KJ21	Colossians	1	11	strengthened with all might according to His glorious power , unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness ;
KJ21	Colossians	1	12	giving thanks unto the Father , who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light .
KJ21	Colossians	1	13	He hath delivered us from the power of darkness , and hath translated us into the Kingdom of His dear Son ,
KJ21	Colossians	1	14	in whom we have redemption through His blood , even the forgiveness of sins .
KJ21	Colossians	1	15	He is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of every creature .
KJ21	Colossians	1	16	For by Him were all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers : all things were created by Him and for Him .
KJ21	Colossians	1	17	And He is before all things , and by Him all things consist .
KJ21	Colossians	1	18	And He is the head of the body , the church . He is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead , that in all things He might have the preeminence .
KJ21	Colossians	1	19	For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell ,
KJ21	Colossians	1	20	and having made peace through the blood of His cross , by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself — by Him , I say , whether they be things on earth or things in heaven .
KJ21	Colossians	1	21	And you , who were once alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works , even now hath He reconciled
KJ21	Colossians	1	22	in the body of His flesh through death , to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in His sight ,
KJ21	Colossians	1	23	if ye continue grounded and settled in the faith , and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel , which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature under heaven , of which I , Paul , am made a minister .
KJ21	Colossians	1	24	I now rejoice in my sufferings for you , and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh , for His body ’ s sake , which is the church ,
KJ21	Colossians	1	25	of which I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God , which is given to me for you , to fulfill the Word of God—
KJ21	Colossians	1	26	even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations , but now is made manifest to His saints .
KJ21	Colossians	1	27	To them God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory .
KJ21	Colossians	1	28	Him we preach , warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus ,
KJ21	Colossians	1	29	for which I also labor , striving according to His working , which worketh in me mightily .
KJ21	Colossians	2	2	that their hearts might be comforted , being knit together in love unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding , that they may acknowledge the mystery of God , and of the Father , and of Christ ,
KJ21	Colossians	2	3	in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
KJ21	Colossians	2	4	And this I say , lest any man should beguile you with enticing words ;
KJ21	Colossians	2	5	for though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejoicing and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ .
KJ21	Colossians	2	6	As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk ye in Him ,
KJ21	Colossians	2	7	rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith as ye have been taught , abounding therein with thanksgiving .
KJ21	Colossians	2	8	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit , following the tradition of men according to the rudiments of the world , and not in accordance with Christ .
KJ21	Colossians	2	9	For in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily .
KJ21	Colossians	2	10	And ye are complete in Him , who is the head of all principality and power ,
KJ21	Colossians	2	11	and in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands , in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ .
KJ21	Colossians	2	12	Ye are buried with Him in baptism , wherein ye also are risen with Him through the faith wrought by the operation of God , who hath raised Him from the dead .
KJ21	Colossians	2	13	And you , being dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh , hath He quickened together with Him , having forgiven you all trespasses ,
KJ21	Colossians	2	14	blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us . He took it out of the way , nailing it to His cross ;
KJ21	Colossians	2	15	and having despoiled principalities and powers , He made a show of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
KJ21	Colossians	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat or drink , or in respect to a holy day or the new moon or the Sabbath days ,
KJ21	Colossians	2	17	which are a shadow of things to come , but the body is of Christ .
KJ21	Colossians	2	18	Let no man beguile you of your reward by feigned humility and worshiping of angels , intruding into those things which he hath not seen , being vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
KJ21	Colossians	2	19	and not holding to the Head , from whom all the body , having nourishment ministered and knit together by joints and bands , increaseth with the increase from God .
KJ21	Colossians	2	20	Therefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world , why , as though living in the world , are ye subject to its ordinances
KJ21	Colossians	2	21	( “ Touch not , taste not , handle not , ”
KJ21	Colossians	2	22	which all are to perish with the using ) , according to the commandments and doctrines of men ?
KJ21	Colossians	2	23	These things have indeed a show of wisdom in willworship and humility and neglecting of the body , but are not in any honor against the satisfying of the flesh .
KJ21	Colossians	3	3	For ye are dead , and your life is hid with Christ in God .
KJ21	Colossians	3	2	Set your affection on things above , not on things on the earth .
KJ21	Colossians	3	4	When Christ , who is our life , shall appear , then shall ye also appear with Him in glory .
KJ21	Colossians	3	5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth : fornication , uncleanness , inordinate affection , evil concupiscence , and covetousness which is idolatry .
KJ21	Colossians	3	6	Because of these , the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience ,
KJ21	Colossians	3	7	in which ye also once walked , when ye lived in them .
KJ21	Colossians	3	8	But now ye also put off all these : anger , wrath , malice , blasphemy , filthy communication out of your mouth .
KJ21	Colossians	3	9	Do not lie one to another , seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds ,
KJ21	Colossians	3	10	and have put on the new man , which is renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created him ,
KJ21	Colossians	3	11	where there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , barbarian , Scythian , bond nor free , but Christ is all and in all .
KJ21	Colossians	3	12	Therefore , holy and beloved , as the elect of God , put on hearts of mercies , kindness , humbleness of mind , meekness , longsuffering ,
KJ21	Colossians	3	13	forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against another : even as Christ forgave you , so also do ye .
KJ21	Colossians	3	14	And above all these things put on charity , which is the bond of perfectness .
KJ21	Colossians	3	15	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to which also ye are called in one body , and be ye thankful .
KJ21	Colossians	3	16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom , teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord .
KJ21	Colossians	3	17	And whatsoever ye do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father by Him .
KJ21	Colossians	3	18	Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as it is fit in the Lord .
KJ21	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives and be not bitter against them .
KJ21	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in all things , for this is well pleasing unto the Lord .
KJ21	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , provoke not your children to anger , lest they be discouraged .
KJ21	Colossians	3	22	Servants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh , not with eyeservice as menpleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing God .
KJ21	Colossians	3	23	And whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord and not unto men ,
KJ21	Colossians	3	24	knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance , for ye serve the Lord Christ .
KJ21	Colossians	3	25	But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done , and there is no respect of persons .
KJ21	Colossians	4	4	that I may make it manifest , as I ought to speak .
KJ21	Colossians	4	2	Continue in prayer and watch therein with thanksgiving ,
KJ21	Colossians	4	3	besides praying also for us that God would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds ,
KJ21	Colossians	4	5	Walk in wisdom toward those who are outsiders , redeeming the time .
KJ21	Colossians	4	6	Let your speech be always with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man .
KJ21	Colossians	4	7	Tychicus , who is a beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord , shall declare unto you all my circumstances .
KJ21	Colossians	4	8	I have sent him unto you for the same purpose , that he might know your state and comfort your hearts ,
KJ21	Colossians	4	9	and with him Onesimus , a faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . They shall make known unto you all things which are done here .
KJ21	Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you , and also Mark , Barnabas ’ sister ’ s son ( concerning whom ye received instructions that if he come unto you , receive him ) ,
KJ21	Colossians	4	11	and Jesus who is called Justus , who are of the Circumcision . These only are my fellow workers for the Kingdom of God , who have been a comfort unto me .
KJ21	Colossians	4	12	Epaphras , a servant of Christ who is one of you , saluteth you , always laboring fervently for you in prayers , that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
KJ21	Colossians	4	13	For I bear him record that he hath a great zeal for you and for those who are in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis .
KJ21	Colossians	4	14	Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas greet you .
KJ21	Colossians	4	15	Salute the brethren who are in Laodicea , and Nymphas and the church which is in his house .
KJ21	Colossians	4	16	And when this epistle is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans , and likewise read the epistle from Laodicea .
KJ21	Colossians	4	17	And say to Archippus , “ Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord , that thou fulfill it. ”
KJ21	Colossians	4	18	The salutation by the hand of me , Paul . Remember my bonds . Grace be with you . Amen .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul , and Silvanus , and Timothy , Unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	1	2	We give thanks to God always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	1	3	remembering without ceasing your work of faith , and labor of love , and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , in the sight of God and our Father ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	knowing , brethren beloved , of your election by God .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	For our Gospel came unto you not in word only , but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance , as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	And ye became followers of us and of the Lord , having received the Word in much affliction , with the joy of the Holy Ghost ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	so that ye were examples to all who believe in Macedonia and Achaia .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	For from you sounded forth the Word of the Lord , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to Godward is spread abroad , so that we need not speak anything .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you , and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	1	10	and to wait for His Son from Heaven , whom He raised from the dead , even Jesus , who delivered us from the wrath to come .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	1	Thessalonians
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	But even after we had suffered before and were shamefully treated at Philippi , as ye know , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the Gospel of God amidst much contention .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation was not from deceit , nor from uncleanness , nor from guile ;
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	but as we were allowed by God to be entrusted with the Gospel , even so we speak not as pleasing men , but God , who trieth our hearts .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	For neither at any time used we flattering words , as ye know , nor a cloak of covetousness ( God is our witness ) ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	nor sought we glory from men , neither from you nor yet from others , when we might have been burdensome , as the apostles of Christ .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	But we were gentle among you , even as a nurse cherisheth her children .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	So being affectionately desirous for you , we were willing to have imparted unto you not the Gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were dear unto us .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	For ye remember , brethren , our labor and travail ; for laboring night and day , because we would not be a burden unto any of you , we preached unto you the Gospel of God .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	Ye are witnesses , and God also , how holily and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	Ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you , as a father doth his children ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	that ye would walk worthy of God , who hath called you unto His Kingdom and glory .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For ye , brethren , became followers of the churches of God in Judea which are in Christ Jesus ; for ye also have suffered like things from your own countrymen , even as they have from the Jews ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets , and have persecuted us . They please not God and are contrary to all men ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles , that they might be saved , thus heaping up their sins always . But the wrath has come upon them to the uttermost !
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	But we , brethren , being taken away from you for a short time ( in presence , but not in heart ) , endeavored the more abundantly and with great desire to see your face .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	Therefore we would have come unto you — even I , Paul , time and again — but Satan hindered us .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming ?
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	2	20	For ye are our glory and joy .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	1	Thessalonians
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	that no man should be moved by these afflictions ; for you yourselves know that thereunto we are appointed .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	and sent Timothy , our brother and minister of God and our fellow laborer in the Gospel of Christ , to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	For verily , when we were with you , we told you beforehand that we should suffer tribulation , even as it came to pass , as ye know .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause , when I could no longer forbear it , I sent to know your faith , lest by some means the tempter might have tempted you , and our labor be in vain .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But now when Timothy came from you unto us , and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity , and that ye have a good remembrance of us always and desire greatly to see us ( as we also desire to see you ) ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	therefore brethren , we were comforted concerning you in all our affliction and distress by your faith ;
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	for now we live , if ye stand fast in the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sakes before our God ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	10	as we pray earnestly night and day that we might see your face , and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	Now may God Himself and our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	12	And may the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men , even as we do toward you ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	3	13	to the end that He may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God , even our Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	1	Thessalonians
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	4	that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God , even your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication :
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	not in the lust of concupiscence , even as the Gentiles who know not God ;
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter , because the Lord is the avenger of all such , as we also have forewarned you and testified .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness , but unto holiness .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	He therefore that despiseth this , despiseth not man but God , who hath also given unto us His holy Spirit .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	But concerning brotherly love , ye have no need that I write unto you , for ye yourselves are taught by God to love one another ;
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia . But we beseech you , brethren , that ye increase more and more ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	and that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	that ye may walk honestly toward those who are outsiders , and that ye may have need of nothing .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	But I would not have you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning those who are asleep , that ye sorrow not , even as others who have no hope .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so will God bring with Him those also who sleep in Jesus .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	For this we say unto you by the Word of the Lord : that we who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord , shall not precede those who are asleep .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord Himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God ; and the dead in Christ shall rise first ;
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And so shall we ever be with the Lord .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	4	18	Therefore comfort one another with these words .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	1	Thessalonians
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	5	Ye are all the children of light and the children of the day ; we are not of the night , nor of darkness .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	For you yourselves know perfectly that the Day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	For when they are saying , “ Peace and safety , ” then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child , and they shall not escape .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	But ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that that Day should overtake you as a thief .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	Therefore let us not sleep , as do others , but let us watch and be sober .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	For those who sleep , sleep in the night ; and those who are drunken are drunken in the night .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	But let us who are of the day be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love , and for a helmet , the hope of salvation .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath , but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	10	who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with Him .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	11	Therefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another , even as also ye do .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	12	And we beseech you , brethren , that you come to know those who labor among you , and are over you in the Lord and admonish you ,
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	13	and to esteem them very highly in love for their work ’ s sake . And be at peace among yourselves .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	14	Now we exhort you , brethren , warn those who are unruly , comfort the feebleminded , support the weak , be patient toward all men .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	15	See that none render evil for evil unto any man , but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves and with all men .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	16	Rejoice evermore .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	18	In every thing give thanks , for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	19	Quench not the Spirit .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	20	Despise not prophesyings .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	21	Test all things ; hold fast to that which is good .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	22	Abstain from all appearance of evil .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly ; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	24	Faithful is He that calleth you ; He also will do it .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	25	Brethren , pray for us .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren .
KJ21	1%20Thessalonians	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	2	Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul , and Silvanus , and Timothy , Unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all persecutions and tribulations that ye endure ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	For it is a righteous thing with God to recompense with tribulation those who trouble you ;
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	and to you who are troubled , rest with us , when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with His mighty angels ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God , and who obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	when He shall come on that Day to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all those who believe , because our testimony among you was believed .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	Therefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you , and ye in Him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	2	that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by letter as if from us that the Day of Christ is at hand .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	Let no man deceive you by any means , for that Day shall not come , unless there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of perdition ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped , so that he sitteth as God in the temple of God , showing himself to be God .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Remember ye not that , when I was yet with you , I told you these things ?
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And now ye know what withholdeth , that he might be revealed in his time .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of iniquity doth already work : only he who now holdeth back will hold him back , until he is taken out of the way .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	And then shall that wicked one be revealed , whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth , and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming—
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	even him , whose coming is according to the working of Satan , with all power and signs and lying wonders ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	and with all the deceit of unrighteousness in those who perish , because they received not the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion , that they should believe a lie ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	that they all might be damned who believed not the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you , brethren , beloved of the Lord , because God hath from the beginning chosen you for salvation , through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	whereunto He called you by our Gospel , for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	Therefore , brethren , stand fast and hold to the traditions which ye have been taught , whether by word or our epistle .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself , and God even our Father , who hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	2	17	comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	2	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men ; for not all men have faith .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is faithful , who shall establish you and keep you from evil .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that ye both do , and will do , the things which we command you .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patient waiting for Christ .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother who walketh disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received from us .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For you yourselves know how ye ought to follow us , for we did not behave disorderly among you ;
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	neither did we eat any man ’ s bread for naught , but wrought with labor and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you ,
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	not because we have not power , but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you , this we commanded you : that if any would not work , neither should he eat .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear that there are some among you who walk disorderly , working not at all , but are busybodies .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Now those who are such , we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that they work with quietness and eat their own bread .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	But ye , brethren , be not weary in well-doing .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	And if any man obey not our word in this epistle , note that man and have no company with him , that he may be ashamed .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	Yet count him not as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	Now the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always by all means . The Lord be with you all .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	17	This salutation of Paul is with mine own hand , which is the token in every epistle : so I write .
KJ21	2%20Thessalonians	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior , and Lord Jesus Christ , who is our hope ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	2	Unto Timothy , my own son in the faith : Grace , mercy , and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I besought thee when I went into Macedonia to abide still at Ephesus , that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	4	neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which promote questions rather than godly edifying in the faith , so do !
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	5	Now the aim of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart , with a good conscience and with faith unfeigned ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	6	from which some have swerved and have turned aside unto vain jangling ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	7	desiring to be teachers of the law , understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	9	knowing this : that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners , for the unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	10	for whoremongers , for those who defile themselves with mankind , for menstealers , for liars , for perjurers , and for whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	11	according to the glorious Gospel of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who hath enabled me , that He counted me faithful , putting me into the ministry—
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	13	I , who was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious . But I obtained mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief ;
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	14	and the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love , which are in Christ Jesus .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	15	This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance : that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , of whom I am chief .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	16	Nonetheless , for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering as a pattern for those who should hereafter believe in Him to life everlasting .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now unto the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only wise God , be honor and glory for ever and ever . Amen .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	18	This charge I commit unto thee , son Timothy , according to the prophecies which went before concerning thee , that thou by them mightest wage a good warfare ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	19	holding faith and a good conscience which some , having put aside , have suffered shipwreck concerning faith .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	1	20	Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	1	Timothy
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	2	for kings and for all who are in authority , that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	4	who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	5	For there is one God and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	6	who gave Himself a ransom for all , to be testified in due time ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	7	for which I am ordained a preacher and an apostle ( I speak the truth in Christ and lie not ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	8	It is my will therefore that men pray everywhere , lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	9	In like manner also , that women should adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefacedness and sobermindedness , not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly array ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	10	but , as becometh women professing godliness , with good works .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	12	But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	13	For Adam was first formed , then Eve .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	14	And Adam was not deceived ; but the woman , being deceived , was in the transgression .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	2	15	Notwithstanding , she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobermindedness .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	1	Timothy
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	3	not given to wine , not violent , not greedy for filthy lucre , but patient , not a brawler , not covetous ;
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	2	A bishop then must be blameless , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behavior , given to hospitality , apt at teaching ;
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	4	one who ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all dignity .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	5	( For if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	6	He must not be a novice in the faith , lest being lifted up with pride , he fall into the condemnation of the devil .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	7	Moreover he must have a good reputation with those who are outsiders , lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	8	Likewise must the deacons be serious , not doubletongued , not given to much wine , not greedy for filthy lucre ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	9	holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	10	And let these also first be proved ; then , being found blameless , let them make use of the office of a deacon .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	11	So also must their wives be serious , not slanderers , sober , faithful in all things .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	12	Let each deacon be the husband of one wife , ruling his children and his own house well .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	13	For those who have ministered the office of deacon well purchase for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith , which is in Christ Jesus .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	14	These things I write unto thee , hoping to come unto thee shortly ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	15	but if I tarry long , that thou mayest know how thou ought to behave thyself in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	3	16	And beyond controversy , great is the mystery of godliness : God was manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , seen by angels , preached unto the Gentiles , believed on in the world , received up into glory .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	1	Timothy
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good , and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving ;
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	2	speaking lies in hypocrisy , having their conscience seared with a hot iron ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	3	forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	5	for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	6	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ , nourished in the words of faith and of good doctrine unto which thou hast attained .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	7	But reject profane and old wives ’ fables , and exercise thyself rather unto godliness .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	8	For bodily exercise profiteth little , but godliness is profitable unto all things , having promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	9	This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	10	For therefor we both labor and suffer reproach , because we trust in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	11	These things command and teach .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	12	Let no man despise thy youth , but be thou an example of the believers , in word , in manner of living , in charity , in spirit , in faith , in purity .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	13	Until I come , give attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of hands by the presbytery .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	15	Meditate upon these things ; give thyself wholly to them , that thy profiting may appear to all .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	4	16	Take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine . Continue in them , for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and those who hear thee .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	5	Now she that is indeed a widow , and desolate , trusteth in God and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	2	the elder women as mothers , the younger as sisters , in all purity .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	3	Honor widows who are truly widows .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them learn first to show piety at home and to requite their parents , for that is good and acceptable before God .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	6	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	7	And these things charge them , that they may be blameless .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	8	But if any provide not for his own , and especially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	9	Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old , having been the wife of one man ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	10	well reported of for good works : if she has brought up children , if she has lodged strangers , if she has washed the saints ’ feet , if she has relieved the afflicted , if she has diligently followed every good work .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	11	But the younger widows refuse , for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ , they will marry ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	12	having damnation because they have cast off their first faith .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	13	And besides they learn to be idle , wandering about from house to house ; and not only idle , but tattlers also and busybodies , speaking things which they ought not .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	14	It is my will therefore that the younger women marry , bear children , guide the house , give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	15	For some have already turned aside after Satan .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any man or woman who believeth have widows , let them relieve them and let not the church be burdened , that it may assist those who are widows indeed .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the Word and doctrine .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	18	For the Scripture saith , “ Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn , ” and , “ The laborer is worthy of his reward. ”
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	19	Against an elder receive not an accusation , except before two or three witnesses .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	20	Those who sin rebuke before all , that others also may fear .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	21	I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	22	Lay hands hastily on no man , neither be partaker of other men ’ s sins . Keep thyself pure .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	23	Drink no longer water , but use a little wine for thy stomach ’ s sake and thy frequent infirmities .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	24	Some men ’ s sins are open beforehand , going on to judgment ; and in some men they follow after .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	5	25	Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand , but they that are otherwise can not be hid .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	2	And those who have believing masters must not despise them because they are brethren , but rather do them service , because they are faithful and beloved , partakers of the benefit . These things teach and exhort .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	3	If any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words , even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	4	he is proud , knowing nothing , but doting about questions and strifes over words , from which cometh envy , strife , railings , evil suspicions ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	5	perverse disputings by men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth , supposing that gain is godliness . From such withdraw thyself .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into this world , and it is certain we can carry nothing out .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	8	And having food and raiment , let us be therewith content .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	9	But those who would be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts , which drown men in destruction and perdition .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is the root of all evil ; and while some have coveted after it , they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	11	But thou , O man of God , flee these things and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , meekness .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith . Lay hold on eternal life , whereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	13	In the sight of God , who quickeneth all things , and before Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession , I give thee this charge :
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	14	that thou keep this commandment without spot , unrebukable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	15	which He in His times shall show — He who is the blessed and only Potentate , the King of kings and Lord of lords ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	16	who only hath immortality , dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto , whom no man hath seen nor can see , to whom be honor and power everlasting . Amen .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	17	Charge those who are rich in this world that they be not haughty , nor trust in uncertain riches , but in the living God , who giveth us richly all things to enjoy ;
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	18	that they do good , that they be rich in good works , ready to distribute , willing to communicate ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	19	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on eternal life .
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	20	O Timothy , keep that which is committed to thy trust , avoiding profane and vain babblings , and oppositions of science , falsely so called ,
KJ21	1%20Timothy	6	21	which some professing have erred concerning the faith . Grace be with thee . Amen .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , my dearly beloved son : Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	3	I thank God , whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience , that I have thee in remembrance in my prayers night and day without ceasing .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	4	I greatly desire to see thee , being mindful of thy tears , that I may be filled with joy
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	5	when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and thy mother Eunice and , I am persuaded , is in thee also .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	6	Therefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee through the putting on of my hands .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear , but of power and of love and of a sound mind .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	8	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me His prisoner ; but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	9	who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling , not according to our works , but in accordance with His own purpose and grace , which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	10	but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ , who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	11	For this I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	12	for which cause I also suffer these things ; nevertheless I am not ashamed . For I know whom I have believed , and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that Day .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	13	Hold fast to the form of sound words , which thou hast heard from me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	14	That good thing which was committed unto thee , keep , by the Holy Ghost who dwelleth in us .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	15	This thou knowest , that all those who are in Asia have turned away from me , among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	16	The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus , for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains ;
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	17	but when he was in Rome , he sought me out very diligently and found me .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	1	18	The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that Day ! And in how many things he ministered unto me in Ephesus , thou knowest very well .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	2	And the things that thou hast heard from me among many witnesses , commit thou the same to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	3	Endure thou therefore hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	4	No man who warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life , that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	5	And if also a man strive for masteries , yet he is not crowned unless he strive lawfully .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	6	The husbandman who laboreth must be the first partaker of the fruits .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	7	Consider what I say , and the Lord give thee understanding in all things .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my Gospel ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	9	wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer , even unto bonds . But the Word of God is not bound .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	10	Therefore I endure all things for the elect ’ s sake , that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus , with eternal glory .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	11	It is a faithful saying : For if we be dead with Him , we shall also live with Him ;
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	12	if we suffer , we shall also reign with Him . If we deny Him , He also will deny us ;
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	13	if we believe not , yet He abideth faithful ; He can not deny Himself .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	14	Of these things put them in remembrance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	15	Study to show thyself approved unto God , a workman who needeth not to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	16	But shun profane and vain babblings , for they will increase unto more ungodliness ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	17	and their word will eat as doth a canker — among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	18	who concerning the truth have erred , saying that the resurrection is past already , and overthrowing the faith of some .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	19	Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure , having this seal : “ The Lord knoweth those who are His , ” and , “ Let every one who nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. ”
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of earth , and some to honor and some to dishonor .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	21	If a man therefore purge himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honor , sanctified and meet for the Master ’ s use , and prepared for every good work .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	22	Flee also youthful lusts ; but follow righteousness , faith , charity , and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	23	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid , knowing that they engender strifes .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	24	And the servant of the Lord must not engender strife , but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	25	in meekness instructing those in opposition . Perhaps God will give them repentance , that they may acknowledge the truth ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	2	26	and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , who are taken captive by him at his will .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	2	For men shall be lovers of their own selves , covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	3	without natural affection , trucebreakers , false accusers , without selfcontrol , fierce , despisers of those who are good ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	4	traitors , headstrong , haughty , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	5	having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof . From such turn away .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	6	For of this sort are those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins , led away with divers lusts ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	7	ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	8	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses , so do these also resist the truth — men of corrupt minds , reprobate concerning the faith .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they shall proceed no further , for their folly shall be manifest unto all men , as theirs also was .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine , manner of life , purpose , faith , longsuffering , charity , patience ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	11	persecutions , afflictions which came unto me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra — what persecutions I endured . But out of them all , the Lord delivered me .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	12	Yea , and all who will live a godly life in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	13	But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse , deceiving and being deceived .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	14	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of , knowing from whom thou hast learned them ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	15	and that from childhood thou hast known the Holy Scriptures , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	16	All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	3	17	that the man of God may be perfect , thoroughly equipped for all good works .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	2	preach the Word ; be instant in season and out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	4	And they shall turn away their ears from the truth , and shall be turned toward fables .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine ; but having itching ears , they shall heap to themselves teachers in accordance with their own lusts .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	5	But watch thou in all things , endure afflictions , do the work of an evangelist , fulfill thy ministry .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	6	For I am now ready to be offered , and the time of my departure is at hand .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	7	I have fought a good fight ; I have finished my course ; I have kept the faith .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	8	Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord , the righteous Judge , shall give me on that Day — and not to me only , but unto all those also who love His appearing .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	9	Use diligence to come shortly unto me ,
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	10	for Demas hath forsaken me , having loved this present world , and has departed unto Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , Titus unto Dalmatia .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	11	Only Luke is with me . Take Mark and bring him with thee , for he is profitable to me for the ministry .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	12	And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	13	The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the parchments .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil ; the Lord reward him according to his works .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	15	Beware thou also of him , for he hath greatly withstood our words .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	16	At my first answer no man stood with me , but all men forsook me . I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	17	Notwithstanding , the Lord stood with me and strengthened me , that by me the preaching might be fully known , and that all the Gentiles might hear . And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	18	And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto His heavenly Kingdom , to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	19	Salute Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	20	Erastus remained at Corinth , but Trophimus I have left sick at Miletus .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	21	Try with diligence to come before winter . Eubulus greeteth thee , and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren .
KJ21	2%20Timothy	4	22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit . Grace be with you . Amen .
KJ21	Titus	1	1	Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to the faith of God ’ s elect , and the acknowledging of the truth which is according to godliness ,
KJ21	Titus	1	2	in hope of eternal life , which God , who can not lie , promised before the world began ,
KJ21	Titus	1	3	but hath in due times manifested His Word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Savior ,
KJ21	Titus	1	4	To Titus , my own son in the common faith : Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior .
KJ21	Titus	1	5	For this cause I left thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
KJ21	Titus	1	6	if any be blameless , the husband of one wife , having faithful children , not accused of riot or unruly .
KJ21	Titus	1	7	For a bishop must be blameless , as the steward of God , not selfwilled , not quick to anger , not given to wine , not violent , not given to filthy lucre ;
KJ21	Titus	1	8	but a lover of hospitality , a lover of good men , sober , just , holy , temperate ,
KJ21	Titus	1	9	holding fast the faithful Word as he hath been taught , that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers .
KJ21	Titus	1	10	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers , especially those of the Circumcision ,
KJ21	Titus	1	11	whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not for the sake of filthy lucre .
KJ21	Titus	1	12	One among themselves , even a prophet of their own , said , “ The Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , slothful gluttons. ”
KJ21	Titus	1	13	This witness is true . Therefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ,
KJ21	Titus	1	14	not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth .
KJ21	Titus	1	15	Unto the pure , all things are pure ; but unto those who are defiled and unbelieving , nothing is pure , but even their mind and conscience is defiled .
KJ21	Titus	1	16	They profess that they know God , but in their works they deny Him , being abominable and disobedient , and unto every good work reprobate .
KJ21	Titus	2	2	that the older men be sober , serious , temperate , sound in faith , in charity , in patience ;
KJ21	Titus	2	3	the older women likewise , that they be in behavior as becometh holiness , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teachers of good things ,
KJ21	Titus	2	4	that they may teach the young women to be sober , to love their husbands , to love their children ,
KJ21	Titus	2	5	to be discreet , chaste , keepers at home , good , obedient to their own husbands , that the Word of God be not blasphemed .
KJ21	Titus	2	6	Likewise exhort the young men to be soberminded ,
KJ21	Titus	2	7	in all things showing thyself to be a pattern of good works ; in doctrine showing uncorruptness , seriousness , sincerity ,
KJ21	Titus	2	8	sound speech which can not be condemned , that he that is of a contrary mind may be ashamed , having no evil thing to say of you .
KJ21	Titus	2	9	Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters , and to please them well in all things , not gainsaying ,
KJ21	Titus	2	10	not purloining , but showing all good fidelity , that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things .
KJ21	Titus	2	11	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men ,
KJ21	Titus	2	12	teaching us that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we should live soberly , righteously , and godly in this present world ,
KJ21	Titus	2	13	looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	Titus	2	15	These things speak and exhort , and rebuke with all authority . Let no man despise thee .
KJ21	Titus	3	3	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish , disobedient , deceived , serving divers lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful and hating one another .
KJ21	Titus	3	2	to speak evil of no man , not to be brawlers , but gentle , showing all meekness unto all men .
KJ21	Titus	3	4	But after the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared ,
KJ21	Titus	3	5	He saved us not by works of righteousness which we had done , but according to His mercy , by the washing of regeneration , and by the renewing of the Holy Ghost ,
KJ21	Titus	3	6	which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
KJ21	Titus	3	7	that , being justified by His grace , we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
KJ21	Titus	3	8	This is a faithful saying , and these things I enjoin that thou affirm constantly , that those who have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works . These things are good and profitable unto men .
KJ21	Titus	3	9	But avoid foolish questions , and genealogies , and contentions , and strivings about the law , for they are unprofitable and vain .
KJ21	Titus	3	10	If a man is a heretic , after the first and second admonition reject him ,
KJ21	Titus	3	11	knowing that such as he is subverted and sinneth , being condemned by himself .
KJ21	Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas unto thee or Tychicus , be diligent to come unto me in Nicopolis , for I have determined to winter there .
KJ21	Titus	3	13	Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently , that nothing be wanting unto them .
KJ21	Titus	3	14	And let our own also learn to perform good works for necessary uses , that they be not unfruitful .
KJ21	Titus	3	15	All that are with me salute thee . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all . Amen .
KJ21	Philemon	1	1	Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and Timothy our brother , Unto Philemon our dearly beloved , and fellow laborer ,
KJ21	Philemon	1	2	and to our beloved Apphia , and Archippus our fellow soldier , and to the church in thy house :
KJ21	Philemon	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Philemon	1	4	I thank my God , making mention of thee always in my prayers ,
KJ21	Philemon	1	5	having heard of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus and toward all saints ,
KJ21	Philemon	1	6	that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
KJ21	Philemon	1	7	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love , because the hearts of the saints are refreshed by thee , brother .
KJ21	Philemon	1	8	Therefore , though I might be bold enough in Christ to enjoin thee to do that which is befitting ,
KJ21	Philemon	1	9	yet for love ’ s sake rather I beseech thee , being such a one as Paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Philemon	1	10	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my bonds .
KJ21	Philemon	1	11	In time past he was to thee unprofitable , but now profitable to thee and to me .
KJ21	Philemon	1	12	I am sending him back . Thou therefore receive him , who is mine own heart .
KJ21	Philemon	1	13	I would have retained him with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the Gospel ;
KJ21	Philemon	1	14	but without thy mind would I do nothing , that thy goodness should not be , as it were , of necessity but willingly .
KJ21	Philemon	1	15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season , that thou shouldest receive him back for ever—
KJ21	Philemon	1	16	not now as a servant , but more than a servant : as a brother beloved , especially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
KJ21	Philemon	1	17	If thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
KJ21	Philemon	1	18	If he hath wronged thee , or oweth thee aught , put that on mine account .
KJ21	Philemon	1	19	I , Paul , have written this with mine own hand : I will repay it ; albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides .
KJ21	Philemon	1	20	Yea , brother , let me have joy of thee in the Lord ; refresh my soul in the Lord .
KJ21	Philemon	1	21	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee , knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say .
KJ21	Philemon	1	22	But besides prepare me also a lodging , for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you .
KJ21	Philemon	1	23	There salute thee Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus ;
KJ21	Philemon	1	24	also Marcus , Aristarchus , Demas and Luke , my fellow laborers .
KJ21	Philemon	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
KJ21	Hebrews	1	1	God , who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in times past unto the fathers by the prophets ,
KJ21	Hebrews	1	2	hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son , whom He hath appointed Heir of all things , by whom also He made the worlds ,
KJ21	Hebrews	1	3	who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person , upholding all things by the word of His power , when He had by Himself purged our sins , sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high ,
KJ21	Hebrews	1	4	being made so much better than the angels , as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they .
KJ21	Hebrews	1	5	For unto which of the angels said God at any time , “ Thou art My Son ; this day have I begotten Thee ” ? And again , “ I will be to Him a Father , and He shall be to Me a Son ” ?
KJ21	Hebrews	1	6	And again , when He bringeth in the First-Begotten into the world , He saith , “ And let all the angels of God worship Him. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	1	7	And of the angels He saith , “ Who maketh His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	1	8	But unto the Son He saith , “ Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever ; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Thy Kingdom .
KJ21	Hebrews	1	9	Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity ; therefore God , even Thy God , hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	1	10	And , “ Thou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth , and the heavens are the works of Thine hands .
KJ21	Hebrews	1	11	They shall perish , but Thou remainest ; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment .
KJ21	Hebrews	1	12	And as a vesture shalt Thou fold them up , and they shall be changed . But Thou art the same , and Thy years shall not fail. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	1	13	But to which of the angels said He at any time , “ Sit on My right hand until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool ” ?
KJ21	Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth to minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation ?
KJ21	Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward ,
KJ21	Hebrews	2	3	how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation , which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by those who heard Him ,
KJ21	Hebrews	2	4	God also bearing them witness , both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost , according to His own will ?
KJ21	Hebrews	2	5	For it was not unto angels that He put in subjection the world to come , of which we speak .
KJ21	Hebrews	2	6	But one at a certain place testified , saying , “ What is man , that Thou art mindful of him ? Or the son of man , that Thou visitest him ?
KJ21	Hebrews	2	7	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels ; Thou crowned him with glory and honor and set him over the works of Thy hands .
KJ21	Hebrews	2	8	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. ” For in putting all in subjection under him , He left nothing that is not put under him . But now as yet we see not all things put under him .
KJ21	Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honor , that He by the grace of God should taste death for every man .
KJ21	Hebrews	2	10	For it became Him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
KJ21	Hebrews	2	11	For both He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of One , for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
KJ21	Hebrews	2	12	saying , “ I will declare Thy name unto My brethren ; in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto Thee. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	2	13	And again , “ I will put My trust in Him. ” And again , “ Behold I and the children whom God hath given Me. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	2	14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood , He also Himself likewise took part of the same , that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death — that is , the devil —
KJ21	Hebrews	2	15	and deliver those who all their lifetime were subject to bondage through fear of death .
KJ21	Hebrews	2	16	For verily He took not on Himself the nature of angels , but He took on Him the seed of Abraham .
KJ21	Hebrews	2	17	Therefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren , that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God , to make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
KJ21	Hebrews	2	18	For in that He Himself hath suffered , being tempted , He is able to succor those who are tempted .
KJ21	Hebrews	3	3	For this Man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses , inasmuch as He who hath built the house hath more honor than the house .
KJ21	Hebrews	3	2	who was faithful to Him that appointed Him , as also Moses was faithful in all His house .
KJ21	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by some man , but He that built all things is God .
KJ21	Hebrews	3	5	And Moses verily was faithful in all His house as a servant , as a testimony of those things which were to be spoken thereafter ;
KJ21	Hebrews	3	6	but Christ was faithful as a Son over His own house , whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of the hope , firm unto the end .
KJ21	Hebrews	3	7	Therefore as the Holy Ghost saith : “ Today if ye will hear His voice ,
KJ21	Hebrews	3	8	harden not your hearts as in the provocation , in the day of temptation in the wilderness ,
KJ21	Hebrews	3	9	when your fathers tempted Me , proved Me , and saw My works forty years .
KJ21	Hebrews	3	10	Therefore I was grieved with that generation , and said , ‘ They do always err in their heart , and they have not known My ways. ’
KJ21	Hebrews	3	11	So I swore in My wrath , ‘ They shall not enter into My rest. ’ ”
KJ21	Hebrews	3	12	Take heed , brethren , lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief , in departing from the living God .
KJ21	Hebrews	3	13	But exhort one another daily , while it is still called “ today , ” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin .
KJ21	Hebrews	3	14	For we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the confidence we had in the beginning steadfast unto the end ,
KJ21	Hebrews	3	15	while it is said , “ Today if ye will hear His voice , harden not your hearts as in the provocation. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	3	16	For some , when they had heard , did provoke , however not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
KJ21	Hebrews	3	17	But with whom was He grieved forty years ? Was it not with those who had sinned , whose carcasses fell in the wilderness ?
KJ21	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did He swear that they should not enter into His rest , but to those who believed not ?
KJ21	Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	4	For He spoke in a certain place of the seventh day in this way : “ And God rested on the seventh day from all His works. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	4	2	For unto us was the Gospel preached , as well as unto them ; but the Word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in those who heard it .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	3	For we who have believed do enter into rest , as He said , “ As I have sworn in My wrath , ‘ If they shall enter into My rest ’ ” —although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	5	And again in this place : “ If they shall enter into My rest ” — .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein , and those to whom it was first preached did not enter in because of unbelief ,
KJ21	Hebrews	4	7	again He designates a certain day , saying in David “ today , ” after so long a time , as it is said , “ Today if you will hear His voice , harden not your hearts. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	4	8	For if Joshua had given them rest , then He would not afterwards have spoken of another day .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	9	There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	10	For he that has entered into His rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as God did from His .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	11	Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest , lest any man fall according to the same example of unbelief .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	12	For the Word of God is living and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight , but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	14	Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed into the Heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast to our profession .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have a High Priest who can not be touched with the feelings of our infirmities , but was in all points tempted as we are , yet without sin .
KJ21	Hebrews	4	16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need .
KJ21	Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ glorified not Himself to be made a high priest , but He that said unto Him , “ Thou art My Son ; today have I begotten Thee. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	5	2	who can have compassion on the ignorant and on those who are outside of the Way , since he himself is also encompassed by infirmity .
KJ21	Hebrews	5	3	And by reason hereof , he ought , both for the people and also for himself , to make offering for sins .
KJ21	Hebrews	5	4	And no man taketh this honor unto himself , except he that is called by God , as was Aaron .
KJ21	Hebrews	5	6	And He saith also in another place , “ Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	5	7	Christ , in the days of His flesh , when He had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto Him that was able to save Him from death , and was heard in that He feared ,
KJ21	Hebrews	5	8	though He were a Son , yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered .
KJ21	Hebrews	5	9	And being made perfect , He became the author of eternal salvation unto all those who obey Him ,
KJ21	Hebrews	5	10	being called by God as a high priest after the order of Melchizedek ,
KJ21	Hebrews	5	11	of whom we have many things to say , which are hard to utter seeing ye are dull of hearing .
KJ21	Hebrews	5	12	For at the time when ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God , and have become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .
KJ21	Hebrews	5	13	For every one that useth milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness , for he is a babe .
KJ21	Hebrews	5	14	But strong meat belongeth to those who are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	6	if they shall fall away , to renew them again unto repentance , seeing that they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put Him to open shame .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	2	of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	3	And this we will do , if God permit .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost ,
KJ21	Hebrews	6	5	and have tasted the good Word of God and the powers of the world to come ,
KJ21	Hebrews	6	7	For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for those by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	8	But that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and is nigh unto being cursed , whose end is to be burned .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	9	But , beloved , though we thus speak , we are persuaded that there are better things for you , things that accompany salvation .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and labor of love , which ye have shown toward His name , in that ye have ministeredto the saints , and do minister .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end ,
KJ21	Hebrews	6	12	that ye be not slothful , but followers of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	13	For when God made promise to Abraham , because He could swear by no greater , He swore by Himself ,
KJ21	Hebrews	6	14	saying , “ Surely in blessing I will bless thee , and in multiplying I will multiply thee. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	6	15	And so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	16	For men verily swear by the greater , and an oath of confirmation is to them an end to all strife .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	17	Thereby God , willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel , confirmed it by an oath ,
KJ21	Hebrews	6	18	that by two immutable things , in which it was impossible for God to lie , we , who have fled for refuge , might have strong consolation to lay hold upon the hope set before us .
KJ21	Hebrews	6	19	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and steadfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ,
KJ21	Hebrews	6	20	where the Forerunner has entered for us , even Jesus , who is made a high priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	7	And beyond all contradiction , the lesser is blessed by the greater .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	2	To him also Abraham gave a tenth part of all , Melchizedek first being by interpretation “ king of righteousness , ” and after that also king of Salem , which means “ king of peace. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	7	3	Without father , without mother and without descent , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like unto the Son of God , he abideth a priest continually .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	5	And verily , those who are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law — that is , from their brethren — though they come out of the loins of Abraham .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	6	But Melchizedek , whose descent is not counted from them , received tithes from Abraham and blessed him that had the promises .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	8	And here men who die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	9	And , as I may so say , Levi also , who receiveth tithes , paid tithes through Abraham ,
KJ21	Hebrews	7	10	for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met Abraham .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	11	If therefore perfection were through the Levitical priesthood ( for under it the people received the law ) , what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek , and not be called according to the order of Aaron ?
KJ21	Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	13	For He of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah , of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	15	And this is yet far more evident when there ariseth another priest according to the similitude of Melchizedek ,
KJ21	Hebrews	7	16	who is made not according to the law of a carnal commandment , but according to the power of an endless life .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	17	For He testifieth : “ Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	7	18	For there is verily an annulling of the former commandment because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	19	For the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did , by which we draw nigh unto God .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as it was not without an oath that He was made priest
KJ21	Hebrews	7	21	( for those priests were made without an oath , but He with an oath by Him who said unto Him : “ The Lord swore and will not repent , ‘ Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. ’ ” ) ,
KJ21	Hebrews	7	22	by so much more was Jesus made a surety of a better testament .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	23	And those priests truly were many , because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death ;
KJ21	Hebrews	7	24	but this Man , because He continueth forever , hath an unchangeable priesthood .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore He is able also to save to the uttermost those who come unto God by Him , seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	26	For such a High Priest who is befitting for us , holy , undisposed to harm , undefiled , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ,
KJ21	Hebrews	7	27	who needeth not , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice daily first for His own sins and then for the people ’ s ; for this He did once when He offered up Himself .
KJ21	Hebrews	7	28	For the law maketh men high priests who have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which came since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore .
KJ21	Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them , He saith , “ Behold , the days come , ” saith the Lord , “ when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah—
KJ21	Hebrews	8	2	a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched and not man .
KJ21	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices ; therefore it is of necessity that this Man have something also to offer .
KJ21	Hebrews	8	4	For if He were on earth , He should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests who offer gifts according to the law ,
KJ21	Hebrews	8	5	and who serve unto the copy and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished by God when he was about to make the tabernacle . For , “ See , ” saith He , “ that thou make all things according to the pattern shown to thee on the mount. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	8	6	But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also He is the Mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
KJ21	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second .
KJ21	Hebrews	8	9	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt , because they continued not in My covenant , and I regarded them not , saith the Lord .
KJ21	Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord : I will put My laws into their minds and write them in their hearts , and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to Me a people .
KJ21	Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother , saying , ‘ Know the Lord , ’ for all shall know Me , from the least to the greatest .
KJ21	Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness , and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	8	13	In that He saith “ a new covenant , ” He hath made the first old . Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	9	It was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , which could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ,
KJ21	Hebrews	9	2	For there was a tabernacle made , the first , wherein was the candlestick and the table and the showbread , which is called the sanctuary .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	3	And after the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All ,
KJ21	Hebrews	9	4	which had the golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and Aaron ’ s rod that budded , and the tablets of the covenant ;
KJ21	Hebrews	9	5	and over it were the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat , of which we can not now speak particularly .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service to God .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	7	But into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people ,
KJ21	Hebrews	9	8	the Holy Ghost by this signifying that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest so long as the first tabernacle was yet standing .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	10	since it concerned only meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ , having come a High Priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands ( that is to say , not of this building ) ,
KJ21	Hebrews	9	12	neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by His own blood , He entered in once into the Holy Place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	13	For if sprinkling the unclean with the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh ,
KJ21	Hebrews	9	14	how much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
KJ21	Hebrews	9	15	And for this cause He is the Mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were covered under the first testament , those who are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	16	For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	17	For a testament is of force after men are dead , otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	18	And so not even the first testament was dedicated without blood .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book and all the people ,
KJ21	Hebrews	9	20	saying , “ This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	9	21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	22	And by the law almost all things are purged with blood , and without shedding of blood there is no remission .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	23	It was therefore necessary that the copies of things in the heavens should be purified with these , but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are copies of the true , but into Heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet should He offer Himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place with blood of others every year ;
KJ21	Hebrews	9	26	for then would He have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world ; but now once , in the end of the world , hath He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself .
KJ21	Hebrews	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the Judgment ,
KJ21	Hebrews	9	28	so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto those who look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin , unto salvation .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	10	By this will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	2	For then would not sacrifices have ceased to be offered ? For worshipers once purged should have had no more consciousness of sins .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	4	for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore when He cometh into the world , He saith , “ Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not have , but a body hast Thou prepared for Me .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	6	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin Thou hast had no pleasure .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	7	Then said I , ‘ Lo , I come ( in the volume of the Book it is written of Me ) to do Thy will , O God. ’ ”
KJ21	Hebrews	10	8	Above when He said , “ Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings , and offering for sin Thou wouldest not have , neither hadst pleasure therein ” ( which are offered in accordance with the law ) ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	9	then said He , “ Lo , I come to do Thy will , O God , ” He taketh away the first , that He may establish the second .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	11	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering time and again the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	12	But this Man , after He had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down at the right hand of God ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	13	from henceforth to wait until His enemies be made His footstool .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering He hath perfected for ever those who are sanctified .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	15	Of this the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us ; for after He had said before ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	16	“ This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord : I will put My laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ;
KJ21	Hebrews	10	17	and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore boldness , brethren , to enter into the Holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	20	by a new and living Way , which He hath consecrated for us through the veil ( that is to say , His flesh ) ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	21	and having a High Priest over the house of God ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	22	let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast to the profession of our faith without wavering ( for He is faithful who promised ) ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	24	and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	25	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as is the manner of some , but exhorting one another , and so much the more as ye see the Day approaching .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin willfully after having received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	28	He that despised Moses ’ law died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	29	Of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath accounted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath despised the Spirit of grace ?
KJ21	Hebrews	10	30	For we know Him that hath said , “ Vengeance belongeth unto Me ; I will recompense , ” saith the Lord . And again , “ The Lord shall judge His people. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	32	But call to remembrance the former days in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ,
KJ21	Hebrews	10	33	partly while ye were being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions , and partly while ye became companions of those who were so used .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	34	For ye had compassion on me in my bonds and took joyfully the despoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in Heaven a better and an enduring substance .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	35	Cast not away therefore your confidence , which hath great recompense of reward .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	36	For ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	37	“ For yet a little while , and He that shall come will come , and will not tarry .
KJ21	Hebrews	10	38	Now the just shall live by faith ; but if any man draw back , My soul shall have no pleasure in him. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not of those who draw back unto perdition , but of those who believe , to the saving of the soul .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	11	Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed , and was delivered of a child when she was past the age , because she judged Him faithful who had promised .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	2	For by it the elders obtained a good report .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	3	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts ; and by it he , being dead , yet speaketh .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was translated , that he should not see death , “ and was not found because God had translated him. ” For before his translation he had this testimony : that he pleased God .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please Him . For he that cometh to God must believe that He is , and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah , being warned by God of things not yet seen , moved with fear , prepared an ark for the saving of his house , by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should later receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for a city which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	12	Therefore there sprang even from one , and him as good as dead , as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith , not having received the promises but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded by them and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	14	For those who say such things declare plainly that they are seeking a fatherland .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	15	And truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God , for He hath prepared for them a City .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , when he was tried , offered up Isaac ; and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son ,
KJ21	Hebrews	11	18	of whom it was said , “ In Isaac shall thy seed be called , ”
KJ21	Hebrews	11	19	accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead , from whence he also received him , in a figurative sense .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob , when he was dying , blessed both the sons of Joseph and worshiped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph , when he was dying , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel , and gave commandment concerning his bones .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses , when he was born , was hidden three months by his parents , because they saw he was a handsome child ; and they were not afraid of the king ’ s edict .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , when he had come of age , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter ,
KJ21	Hebrews	11	25	choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ,
KJ21	Hebrews	11	26	esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt ; for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	28	Through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood , lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land , but the Egyptians , in attempting to do so , were drowned .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , after they had been compassed about for seven days .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	31	By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with those who believed not , having received the spies with peace .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	32	And what shall I say more ? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barak and of Samson and of Jephthah , of David also and Samuel and of the prophets ,
KJ21	Hebrews	11	33	who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
KJ21	Hebrews	11	34	quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword . Out of weakness they were made strong , waxed valiant in battle , and turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead raised to life again , and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance , that they might obtain a better resurrection .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	36	And others endured the trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea moreover , of bonds and imprisonment .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword . They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins , being destitute , afflicted , tormented
KJ21	Hebrews	11	38	( of whom the world was not worthy ) . They wandered in deserts and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
KJ21	Hebrews	11	39	And these all , having obtained a good report through faith , received not the promise ,
KJ21	Hebrews	11	40	God having provided some better thing for us , that they without us should not be made perfect .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	12	Therefore , lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees ,
KJ21	Hebrews	12	2	looking unto Jesus , the author and finisher of our faith , who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	3	For consider Him that endured such contradiction from sinners against Himself , lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	4	In striving against sin , ye have not yet resisted unto bloodshed .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	5	And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children : “ My son , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked by Him ;
KJ21	Hebrews	12	6	for whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth , and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	12	7	If ye endure chastening , God dealeth with you as with sons ; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not ?
KJ21	Hebrews	12	8	But if ye be without chastisement , whereof all arepartakers , then ye are bastards and not sons .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us , and we gave them reverence . Shall we not far rather be in subjection unto the Father of Spirits , and live ?
KJ21	Hebrews	12	10	For verily they chastened us for a few days according to their own pleasure , but He for our profit , that we might be partakers of His holiness .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	11	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous ; nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto those who are exercised thereby .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	13	and make straight paths for your feet , lest that which is lame be turned out of the way , but let it rather be healed .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	14	Follow peace with all men , and holiness , without which no man shall see the Lord ,
KJ21	Hebrews	12	15	looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness spring up to trouble you , and thereby many be defiled ;
KJ21	Hebrews	12	16	lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau , who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	17	For ye know how afterward , when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected ; for he found no place of repentance , though he sought it diligently with tears .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	18	For ye have not come unto the mount which might be touched and that burned with fire , nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest ,
KJ21	Hebrews	12	19	and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words , which voice those who heard entreated that the Word should not be spoken to them any more .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	20	( For they could not endure that which was commanded , that : “ if even so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	12	21	And so terrible was the sight that Moses said , “ I fear exceedingly and quake. ” )
KJ21	Hebrews	12	22	But ye have come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to an innumerable company of angels ,
KJ21	Hebrews	12	23	to the general assembly and church of the firstborn , who are written in Heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
KJ21	Hebrews	12	24	and to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling , that speaketh better things than that of Abel .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	25	See that ye refuse not Him that speaketh , for if they escaped not who refused Him that spoke on earth , much more shall we not escape if we turn away from Him that speaketh from Heaven ,
KJ21	Hebrews	12	26	whose voice then shook the earth . But now He hath promised , saying , “ Yet once more I shake not the earth only , but also heaven. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	12	27	And these words , “ yet once more , ” signifieth the removing of those things which can be shaken , such as things that are made , that those things which can not be shaken may remain .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore , we receiving a Kingdom which can not be moved , let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably , with reverence and godly fear .
KJ21	Hebrews	12	29	For our God is a consuming fire .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	13	Let us go forth therefore unto Him outside the camp , bearing His reproach .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	2	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers , for thereby some have entertained angels unawares .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	3	Remember those who are in bonds as though you were bound with them , and thse who suffer adversity , as being yourselves also in the body .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage is honorable in all , and the bed undefiled ; but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	5	Let your manner of living be without covetousness , and be content with such things as ye have . For He hath said , “ I will never leave thee , nor forsake thee ” ;
KJ21	Hebrews	13	6	so that we may boldly say , “ The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. ”
KJ21	Hebrews	13	7	Remember those who have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the Word of God . Follow their faith , considering the outcome of their manner of living .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , and today , and for ever .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	9	Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines . For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace , not with meats which have not profited those who have been occupied therewith .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar from which they have no right to eat , who serve the tabernacle .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned outside the camp .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	12	Therefore Jesus also , that He might sanctify the people with His own blood , suffered outside the gate .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	14	For here we have no continuing city , but we seek one to come .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	15	By Him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	16	But to do good and to communicate forget not , for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	17	Obey those who have the rule over you and submit yourselves , for they keep watch over your souls as ones who must give an account , that they may do it with joy and not with grief , for that is unprofitable for you .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us , for we trust we have a good conscience in all things , willing to live honestly .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	19	But I beseech you the more earnestly to do this , that I may be restored to you the sooner .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	20	Now the God of peace , who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great Shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
KJ21	Hebrews	13	21	make you perfect in every good work to do His will , working in you that which is well pleasing in His sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	22	And I beseech you , brethren , suffer the word of exhortation , for I have written this letter unto you with few words .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	23	Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty , with whom , if he come shortly , I will see you .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	24	Salute all those who have the rule over you , and all the saints . Those from Italy salute you .
KJ21	Hebrews	13	25	Grace be with you all . Amen .
KJ21	James	1	1	James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad : Greetings .
KJ21	James	1	2	My brethren , count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations ,
KJ21	James	1	3	knowing this : that the trying of your faith worketh patience .
KJ21	James	1	4	But let patience have her perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , lacking nothing .
KJ21	James	1	5	If any of you lack wisdom , let him ask of God , who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not , and it shall be given him .
KJ21	James	1	6	But let him ask in faith , never wavering ; for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea , driven and tossed by the wind .
KJ21	James	1	7	For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord .
KJ21	James	1	8	A doubleminded man is unstable in all his ways .
KJ21	James	1	9	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted ,
KJ21	James	1	10	but the rich in that he is made low , because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
KJ21	James	1	11	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat than it withereth the grass , and the flower thereof falleth , and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth . So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways .
KJ21	James	1	12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation ; for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord hath promised to those who love Him .
KJ21	James	1	13	Let no man say when he is tempted , “ I am tempted by God ” ; for God can not be tempted with evil , neither tempteth He any man .
KJ21	James	1	14	But every man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed .
KJ21	James	1	15	Then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin ; and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
KJ21	James	1	16	Do not err , my beloved brethren .
KJ21	James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
KJ21	James	1	18	Of His own will , He begot us by the word of truth , that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures .
KJ21	James	1	19	Therefore , my beloved brethren , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath ;
KJ21	James	1	20	for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God .
KJ21	James	1	21	Therefore lay apart all filthiness and the superfluity of wickedness , and receive with meekness the engrafted Word , which is able to save your souls .
KJ21	James	1	22	But be ye doers of the Word and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves .
KJ21	James	1	23	For if any be a hearer of the Word and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror ;
KJ21	James	1	24	for he beholdeth himself , and then goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
KJ21	James	1	25	But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein , he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work , this man shall be blessed in his deed .
KJ21	James	1	26	If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue , but deceiveth his own heart , this man ’ s religion is vain .
KJ21	James	1	27	Pure religion , undefiled before God and the Father , is this : to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world .
KJ21	James	2	2	For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring , in goodly apparel , and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment ,
KJ21	James	2	3	and ye have respect for him that weareth the grand clothing and say unto him , “ Sit thou here in a good place , ” and say to the poor man , “ Stand thou there , ” or , “ Sit here under my footstool , ”
KJ21	James	2	4	are ye not then partial in yourselves and have become judges with evil thoughts ?
KJ21	James	2	5	Hearken , my beloved brethren : Hath not God chosen the poor of this world , rich in faith , and heirs of the Kingdom which He hath promised to those who love Him ?
KJ21	James	2	6	But ye have despised the poor . Do not rich men oppress you and drag you before the judgment seats ?
KJ21	James	2	7	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called ?
KJ21	James	2	8	If ye fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture , “ Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , ” ye do well .
KJ21	James	2	9	But if ye have respect of persons , ye commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors .
KJ21	James	2	10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend on one point , he is guilty of all .
KJ21	James	2	11	For He that said , “ Do not commit adultery , ” said also , “ Do not kill. ” Now if thou commit no adultery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a transgressor of the law .
KJ21	James	2	12	So speak ye , and so do , as those who shall be judged by the law of liberty .
KJ21	James	2	13	For he shall have judgment without mercy , who hath shown no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment .
KJ21	James	2	14	What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he hath faith , and hath not works ? Can faith save him ?
KJ21	James	2	15	If a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food ,
KJ21	James	2	16	and one of you say unto them , “ Depart in peace ; be ye warmed and filled , ” without giving them those things which are needful to the body , what doth it profit ?
KJ21	James	2	17	Even so faith , if it hath not works , is dead , being alone .
KJ21	James	2	18	Yea , a man may say , “ Thou hast faith , and I have works. ” Show me thy faith apart from thy works , and I will show thee my faith by my works .
KJ21	James	2	19	Thou believest that there is one God ; thou doest well . The devils also believe — and tremble .
KJ21	James	2	20	But wilt thou know , O vain man , that faith without works is dead ?
KJ21	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar ?
KJ21	James	2	22	Seest thou how faith wrought with his works , and by works faith was made perfect ?
KJ21	James	2	23	And the Scripture was fulfilled which saith , “ Abraham believed God , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness ” ; and he was called the friend of God .
KJ21	James	2	24	Ye see then how by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
KJ21	James	2	25	Likewise also , was not Rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way ?
KJ21	James	2	26	For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also .
KJ21	James	3	3	Behold , we put bits in the horses ’ mouths , that they may obey us , and we turn about their whole body .
KJ21	James	3	2	For in many things we all offend . If any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body .
KJ21	James	3	4	Behold also the ships , which though they be so great and are driven by fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whithersoever the helmsman pleases .
KJ21	James	3	5	Even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things . Behold , how great a wood a little fire kindleth !
KJ21	James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity . So is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire from hell .
KJ21	James	3	7	For every kind of beast and bird and serpent and thing in the sea is tamed , and hath been tamed , by mankind .
KJ21	James	3	8	But the tongue can no man tame ; it is an unruly evil , full of deadly poison .
KJ21	James	3	9	Therewith we bless God , even the Father , and therewith we curse men , who are made in the similitude of God .
KJ21	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not so to be .
KJ21	James	3	11	Doth a fountain send forth from the same place sweet water and bitter ?
KJ21	James	3	12	Can the fig tree , my brethren , bear olive berries , or a vine figs ? So no fountain can yield both salt water and fresh .
KJ21	James	3	13	Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you ? Let him show his works out of good conduct and with the meekness of wisdom .
KJ21	James	3	14	But if ye have bitter envy and strife in your hearts , glory not , and lie not against the truth .
KJ21	James	3	15	Such wisdom descendeth not from above , but is earthly , sensual , devilish .
KJ21	James	3	16	For where envy and strife are , there is confusion and every evil work .
KJ21	James	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , easy to be entreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality and without hypocrisy .
KJ21	James	3	18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of those who make peace .
KJ21	James	4	4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses , know ye not that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
KJ21	James	4	2	Ye lust , and have not ; ye kill , and desire to have , and can not obtain . Ye fight and war , yet ye have not , because ye ask not .
KJ21	James	4	3	Ye ask and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may consume it upon your lusts .
KJ21	James	4	5	Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain , “ The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy ” ?
KJ21	James	4	6	But He giveth more grace ; therefore He saith , “ God resisteth the proud , but giveth grace unto the humble. ”
KJ21	James	4	7	Submit yourselves therefore to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
KJ21	James	4	8	Draw nigh to God , and He will draw nigh to you . Cleanse your hands , ye sinners , and purify your hearts , ye doubleminded .
KJ21	James	4	9	Be afflicted and mourn and weep . Let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
KJ21	James	4	10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and He shall lift you up .
KJ21	James	4	11	Speak not evil one of another , brethren . He that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law . But if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
KJ21	James	4	12	There is one Lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy . Who art thou that judgest another ?
KJ21	James	4	13	Come now , ye that say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a city and continue there a year , and buy and sell and get gain ” ;
KJ21	James	4	14	whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow . For what is your life ? It is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away .
KJ21	James	4	15	Instead ye ought to say , “ If the Lord will , we shall live and do this or that. ”
KJ21	James	4	16	But now ye rejoice in your boastings . All such rejoicing is evil .
KJ21	James	4	17	Therefore to him that knoweth how to do good and doeth it not , to him it is sin .
KJ21	James	5	5	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton . Ye have nourished your hearts , as in a day of slaughter .
KJ21	James	5	2	Your riches are corrupted and your garments motheaten .
KJ21	James	5	3	Your gold and silver are cankered , and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire . Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days .
KJ21	James	5	4	Behold , the hire of the laborers who have reaped your fields , which you kept back by fraud , crieth ; and the cries of those who have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth .
KJ21	James	5	6	Ye have condemned and killed the just , and he doth not resist you .
KJ21	James	5	7	Be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . Behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
KJ21	James	5	8	Be ye also patient ; make firm your hearts , for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh .
KJ21	James	5	9	Grudge not one against another , brethren , lest ye be condemned . Behold , the Judge standeth before the door !
KJ21	James	5	10	My brethren , take the prophets , who have spoken in the name of the Lord , as an example of suffering affliction and of patience .
KJ21	James	5	11	Behold , we count them happy who endure . Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord , how the Lord is full of pity and of tender mercy .
KJ21	James	5	12	But above all things , my brethren , swear not , neither by heaven , neither by earth , nor by any other oath ; but let your “ Yea ” be yea , and your “ Nay ” be nay , lest ye fall into condemnation .
KJ21	James	5	13	Is any among you afflicted ? Let him pray . Is any merry ? Let him sing psalms .
KJ21	James	5	14	Is any sick among you ? Let him call for the elders of the church , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord .
KJ21	James	5	15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up . And if he has committed sins , they shall be forgiven him .
KJ21	James	5	16	Confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much .
KJ21	James	5	17	Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are . And he prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it rained not on the earth for the space of three years and six months .
KJ21	James	5	18	And he prayed again , and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit .
KJ21	James	5	19	Brethren , if any of you err from the truth and one convert him ,
KJ21	James	5	20	let him know that he who converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death , and shall hide a multitude of sins .
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	1	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , To the strangers scattered throughout Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	2	elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : Grace unto you and peace be multiplied .
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	4	to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away , reserved in Heaven for you ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	5	who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	6	In this ye greatly rejoice , though now for a season , if need be , ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	7	that the trial of your faith ( being much more precious than gold that perisheth , though it be tested with fire ) might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	8	whom having not seen , ye love . In Him , though now ye see Him not , yet believing , ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	9	receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	10	Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently , and have prophesied of the grace that should come unto you ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	11	searching what , or what manner of time , the Spirit of Christ who was in them had signified when He testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow .
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	12	Unto them it was revealed that they ministered , not unto themselves , but unto us the things which are now reported unto you by those who have preached the Gospel unto you , with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven — things which the angels desire to look into .
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	13	Therefore gird up the loins of your mind ; be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	14	As obedient children , do not fashion yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	15	but as He who hath called you is holy , so be ye holy in all manner of living ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	16	because it is written : “ Be ye holy , for I am holy. ”
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	17	And if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man ’ s work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear .
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	18	For ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things , such as silver and gold , from your vain way of living which ye received by tradition from your fathers ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	19	but with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	20	who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you .
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	21	By Him ye believe in God , who raised Him up from the dead and gave Him glory , that your faith and hope might be in God .
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	22	Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren , see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	23	being born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever ;
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	24	for “ all flesh is as grass , and all the glory of man as the flower of grass . The grass withereth , and the flower thereof falleth away ;
KJ21	1%20Peter	1	25	but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. ” And this is the Word which by the Gospel is preached unto you .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	2	as newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the Word , that ye may grow thereby ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	3	if so it be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	4	Coming to Him as unto a living stone , disallowed indeed by men , but chosen by God and precious ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	5	ye also as living stones are built up a spiritual house , a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	6	Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture : “ Behold , I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone , elect , precious ; and he that believeth in Him shall not be confounded. ”
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	7	Unto you therefore who believe , He is precious ; but unto those who are disobedient , “ The stone which the builders disallowed , the same is made the head of the corner , ”
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	8	and , “ A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense , ” even to those who stumble at the Word , being disobedient , unto which also they were appointed .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	9	But ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a peculiar people , that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	10	In times past ye were not a people , but are now the people of God ; who had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	11	Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	12	having your way of life honest among the Gentiles , that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	13	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord ’ s sake , whether it be to the king as supreme ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	14	or unto governors as unto those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do well .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	15	For so is the will of God , that with welldoing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men ”
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	16	as free , and not using your liberty as a cloak for maliciousness , but as the servants of God .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	17	Honor all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honor the king .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	18	Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear , not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	19	For this is thankworthy : if a man , because of his conscience toward God , endure grief , suffering wrongfully .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	20	For what glory is it if , when ye be buffeted for your faults , ye shall take it patiently ? But if when ye do well and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	21	For even unto this were ye called , because Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow His steps ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	22	“ who did no sin , neither was guile found in His mouth ” ;
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	23	who when He was reviled , reviled not in return ; when He suffered , He threatened not , but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously ;
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	24	who His own self bore our sins in His own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness ; by whose stripes ye were healed .
KJ21	1%20Peter	2	25	For ye were as sheep going astray , but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	1	Peter
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	3	When adorning yourselves , let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair , and of wearing gold , or of putting on apparel ;
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	2	while they behold your chaste manner of living coupled with fear .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	4	but let it be the hidden man of the heart which is not corruptible , even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which in the sight of God is of great price .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	5	For in this manner in olden times the holy women also , who trusted in God , adorned themselves , being in subjection unto their own husbands ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	6	even as Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him lord . Ye are her daughters as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any bewilderment .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	7	Likewise , ye husbands , dwell with your wives with understanding , giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life , that your prayers be not hindered .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , be ye all of one mind , having compassion one for another . Love each other as brethren , be sympathetic , be courteous ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	9	not rendering evil for evil , or railing for railing , but contrariwise blessing , knowing that ye are called thereto , that ye might inherit a blessing .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	10	For , “ He that would love life and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no guile .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	11	Let him eschew evil and do good ; let him seek peace and pursue it .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous , and His ears are open unto their prayers ; but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. ”
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	13	And who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good ?
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	14	But if ye suffer for righteousness ’ sake , happy are ye . “ And be not afraid of their terror ; neither be troubled. ”
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts , and be ready always to give an answer to every man who asketh you a reason for the hope that is in you , with meekness and fear .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	16	Have a good conscience , that , whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers , they who falsely accuse may be ashamed by your good manner of life in Christ .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	17	For it is better , if the will of God be so , that ye suffer for welldoing than for evildoing .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that He might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	19	by which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	20	who one time were disobedient , when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared , wherein few , ( that is , eight souls ) were saved by water .
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	21	The like figure to this , even baptism , doth also now save us ( not the putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the answer of a good conscience toward God ) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	3	22	who has gone into Heaven and is at the right hand of God , angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto Him .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	1	Peter
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	4	wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same dissolute excess , speaking evil of you ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	2	that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men , but to the will of God .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	3	For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles , when we walked in lasciviousness , lusts , excess of wine , revelings , banquetings , and abominable idolatries ;
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	5	who shall give account to Him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	6	For , for this cause was the Gospel preached also to those who are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is at hand : be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	8	And above all things , have fervent charity among yourselves , for charity shall cover the multitude of sins .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	9	Use hospitality one to another without grudging .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	10	As every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	11	If any man speak , let him speak according to the oracles of God . If any man minister , let him do it according to the ability which God giveth , that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	12	Beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened unto you ;
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	13	but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ ’ s sufferings , that , when His glory shall be revealed , ye may be glad also with exceeding joy .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	14	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye , for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you . On their part evil is spoken of Him , but on your part He is glorified .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men ’ s matters .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	16	Yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed , but let him glorify God on this account .
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	17	For the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God . And if it first begin with us , what shall the end be of those who obey not the Gospel of God ?
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	18	And , “ If the righteous scarcely be saved , where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ? ”
KJ21	1%20Peter	4	19	Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to Him in welldoing , as unto a faithful Creator .
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	1	Peter
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	5	Likewise , ye younger , submit yourselves unto the elder . Yea , all of you be subject one to another , and be clothed with humility ; for “ God resisteth the proud , and giveth grace to the humble. ”
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	2	feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight of them , not by constraint but willingly , not for filthy lucre but out of a ready mind ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	3	neither as being lords over God ’ s heritage , but by being examples to the flock .
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	4	And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear , ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away .
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that He may exalt you in due time ,
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	7	casting all your cares upon Him , for He careth for you .
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	8	Be sober , be vigilant , because your adversary the devil walketh about as a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour .
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	9	Resist him , steadfast in the faith , knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world .
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	10	But after ye have suffered a while , may the God of all grace , who hath called us into His eternal glory by Christ Jesus , make you perfect , establish , strengthen , settle you .
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	11	To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	12	By Silvanus , whom I account to be a faithful brother unto you , I have written briefly , exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand .
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	13	The church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you , and so doth Mark , my son .
KJ21	1%20Peter	5	14	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity . Peace be with you all who are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord , according as
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	1	Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , To those who have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ :
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	3	His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of Him that hath called us to glory and virtue .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	4	Thereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises , that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	5	And besides this , using all diligence , add to your faith virtue , and to virtue knowledge ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	6	and to knowledge temperance , and to temperance patience , and to patience godliness ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	7	and to godliness brotherly kindness , and to brotherly kindness charity .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	8	For if these things be in you and abound , they make you that ye shall be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	9	But he that lacketh these things is blind and can not see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	10	Therefore brethren , give diligence all the more to make your calling and election sure , for if ye do these things ye shall never fall .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	12	Therefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them and are strengthened in the present truth .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	13	Yea , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	14	knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shown me .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	15	Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of His majesty .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	17	For He received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to Him from the Excellent Glory : “ This is My beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased. ”
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	18	And this voice , which came from Heaven , we heard when we were with Him on the holy mount .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy , unto which ye do well that ye take heed , as unto a light that shineth in a dark place , until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	20	knowing this first : that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation .
KJ21	2%20Peter	1	21	For the prophecy came not in olden times by the will of man , but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost .
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways , by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evilly spoken of .
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you — they whose judgment now for a long time lingereth not , and their damnation slumbereth not .
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	4	For if God spared not the angels who sinned , but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment ;
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	5	and spared not the old world , but saved Noah , the eighth person , a preacher of righteousness , bringing in the Flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	6	and , turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them to be overthrown , making them an example unto those who thereafter should live ungodly ;
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	7	and if He delivered righteous Lot , vexed with the filthy conduct of the wicked
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	8	( for that righteous man , having dwelt among them seeing and hearing , was vexed in his righteous soul day after day with their unlawful deeds ) —
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	9	then the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the Day of Judgment to be punished ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	10	but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise governance . Presumptuous are they and selfwilled ; they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	11	whereas angels , which are greater in power and might , bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord .
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	12	But these , as natural brute beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things that they understand not , and shall utterly perish in their own corruption ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	13	and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness , as those who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime . Spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselves with their own deceptions while they feast with you ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	14	having eyes full of adultery and who can not cease from sin , beguiling unstable souls ; their hearts they have exercised with covetous practices ; accursed children !
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	15	They have forsaken the right way and have gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages ofunrighteousness ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	16	but was rebuked for his iniquity : the dumb ass speaking with a man ’ s voice forbad the madness of the prophet .
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	17	These are wells without water , clouds that are carried by a tempest , for whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever .
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	18	For when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh and through much wantonness those who had clean escaped from those who live in error .
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	19	While they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption ; for by whom a man is overcome , by the same is he brought into bondage .
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	20	For if , after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	21	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they had known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them .
KJ21	2%20Peter	2	22	But it has happened unto them according to the true proverb : “ The dog turns to his own vomit again , ” and , “ the sow that was washed , to her wallowing in the mire . ”
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	2	that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us , the apostles of the Lord and Savior ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	3	knowing this first : that there shall come in the last days scoffers , walking after their own lusts
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	4	and saying , “ Where is the promise of His coming ? For since the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. ”
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	5	For of this they are willfully ignorant : that by the Word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	6	whereby the world as it then was , being overflowed with water , perished .
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	7	But the heavens and the earth which now are , by the same Word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the Day of Judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	8	But , beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing : that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slack concerning His promise , as some men count slackness , but is longsuffering toward us , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	10	But the Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night , in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat . The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up .
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	11	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy manner of living and godliness ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	12	looking for and hastening unto the coming of the Day of God , wherein the heavens , being on fire , shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat ?
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	13	Nevertheless we , according to His promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	14	Therefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found by Him in peace , without spot and blameless .
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	15	And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation , even as our beloved brother Paul also , according to the wisdom given unto him , hath written unto you ,
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	16	as also in all his epistles , speaking in them of these things . Therein are some things hard to understand , which those who are unlearned and unstable wrest , as they do also the other Scriptures , unto their own destruction .
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	17	Ye therefore , beloved , seeing that ye know these things beforehand , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own steadfastness .
KJ21	2%20Peter	3	18	But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To Him be glory both now and for ever . Amen .
KJ21	1%20John	1	1	That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , concerning the Word of Life
KJ21	1%20John	1	2	( for the Life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and show unto you that Eternal Life , which was with the Father and was manifested unto us ) ;
KJ21	1%20John	1	3	that which we have seen and heard , declare we unto you , that ye also may have fellowship with us ; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ .
KJ21	1%20John	1	4	And these things write we unto you , that your joy may be full .
KJ21	1%20John	1	5	This then is the message which we have heard from Him and declare unto you : that God is light , and in Him is no darkness at all .
KJ21	1%20John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with Him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth .
KJ21	1%20John	1	7	But if we walk in the light , as He is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin .
KJ21	1%20John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us .
KJ21	1%20John	1	9	If we confess our sins , He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
KJ21	1%20John	1	10	If we say that we have not sinned , we make Him a liar , and His Word is not in us .
KJ21	1%20John	2	1	John
KJ21	1%20John	2	2	And He is the propitiation for our sins , and not for ours only , but also for the sins of the whole world .
KJ21	1%20John	2	3	And hereby we know that we know Him : if we keep His commandments .
KJ21	1%20John	2	4	He that saith , “ I know Him , ” and keepeth not His commandments , is a liar and the truth is not in him .
KJ21	1%20John	2	5	But whoso keepeth His Word , in him verily is the love of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in Him .
KJ21	1%20John	2	6	He that saith that he abideth in Him , ought himself also so to walk , even as He walked .
KJ21	1%20John	2	7	Brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye have had from the beginning . The old commandment is the Word which ye have heard from the beginning .
KJ21	1%20John	2	8	Again , a new commandment I write unto you , which thing is true in Him and in you , because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth .
KJ21	1%20John	2	9	He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now .
KJ21	1%20John	2	10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is no occasion for stumbling in him .
KJ21	1%20John	2	11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes .
KJ21	1%20John	2	12	I write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for His name ’ s sake .
KJ21	1%20John	2	13	I write unto you , fathers , because ye have known Him that is from the beginning . I write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome the wicked one . I write unto you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
KJ21	1%20John	2	14	I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known Him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the Word of God abideth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
KJ21	1%20John	2	15	Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
KJ21	1%20John	2	16	For all that is in the world — the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life — is not of the Father , but is of the world .
KJ21	1%20John	2	17	And the world passeth away and the lust thereof , but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever .
KJ21	1%20John	2	18	Little children , it is the last time . And as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come , even now are there many antichrists , whereby we know that this is the last time .
KJ21	1%20John	2	19	They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us . But they went out , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us .
KJ21	1%20John	2	20	But ye have an unction from the Holy One , and ye know all things .
KJ21	1%20John	2	21	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
KJ21	1%20John	2	22	Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? He is antichrist who denieth the Father and the Son .
KJ21	1%20John	2	23	Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father ; he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also .
KJ21	1%20John	2	24	Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning . If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son and in the Father .
KJ21	1%20John	2	25	And this is the promise that He hath promised us : even eternal life .
KJ21	1%20John	2	26	These things have I written unto you concerning those who seduce you .
KJ21	1%20John	2	27	But the anointing which ye have received from Him abideth in you , and ye have no need that any man teach you . But as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is truth and is no lie , and even as it hath taught you , ye shall abide in Him .
KJ21	1%20John	2	28	And now , little children , abide in Him , that when He shall appear we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before Him at His coming .
KJ21	1%20John	2	29	If ye know that He is righteous , ye know that every one who doeth righteousness is born of Him .
KJ21	1%20John	3	1	John
KJ21	1%20John	3	3	And every man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself , even as He is pure .
KJ21	1%20John	3	2	Beloved , now we are the sons of God , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be ; but we know that , when He shall appear , we shall be like Him ; for we shall see Him as He is .
KJ21	1%20John	3	4	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law , for sin is the transgression of the law .
KJ21	1%20John	3	5	And ye know that He was manifested to take away our sins , and in Him is no sin .
KJ21	1%20John	3	6	Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not ; whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him , neither known Him .
KJ21	1%20John	3	7	Little children , let no man deceive you . He that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as He is righteous .
KJ21	1%20John	3	8	He that committeth sin is of the devil , for the devil sinneth from the beginning . For this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that He might destroy the works of the devil .
KJ21	1%20John	3	9	Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin ; for His seed remaineth in him , and he can not sin , because he is born of God .
KJ21	1%20John	3	10	By this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither is he that loveth not his brother .
KJ21	1%20John	3	11	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning : that we should love one another .
KJ21	1%20John	3	12	Be not as Cain , who was of that wicked one and slew his brother . And why did he slay him ? Because his own works were evil , and his brother ’ s righteous .
KJ21	1%20John	3	13	Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
KJ21	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . He that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
KJ21	1%20John	3	15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer , and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
KJ21	1%20John	3	16	Hereby we perceive the love of God : because He laid down His life for us . And we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
KJ21	1%20John	3	17	But whoso hath this world ’ s goods and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up the compassion of his heart from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
KJ21	1%20John	3	18	My little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue , but in deed and in truth .
KJ21	1%20John	3	19	And hereby we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hearts before Him .
KJ21	1%20John	3	20	For if our heart condemn us , God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things .
KJ21	1%20John	3	21	Beloved , if our heart condemn us not , then we have confidence toward God .
KJ21	1%20John	3	22	And whatsoever we ask we receive of Him , because we keep His commandment and do those things that are pleasing in His sight .
KJ21	1%20John	3	23	And this is His commandment : that we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another , as He gave us commandment .
KJ21	1%20John	3	24	And he that keepeth His commandments dwelleth in Him , and He in him . And hereby we know that He abideth in us : by the Spirit which He hath given us .
KJ21	1%20John	4	1	John
KJ21	1%20John	4	4	Ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them , because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world .
KJ21	1%20John	4	2	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God : Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh , is of God .
KJ21	1%20John	4	3	And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh , is not of God ; and such is the spirit of Antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come , and even now already it is in the world .
KJ21	1%20John	4	5	They are of the world ; therefore they speak of the world , and the world heareth them .
KJ21	1%20John	4	6	We are of God ; he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us . Hereby we know the Spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
KJ21	1%20John	4	7	Beloved , let us love one another , for love is of God , and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God .
KJ21	1%20John	4	8	He that loveth not , knoweth not God , for God is love .
KJ21	1%20John	4	9	In this was manifested the love of God toward us : that God sent His only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through Him .
KJ21	1%20John	4	10	Herein is love : not that we loved God , but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins .
KJ21	1%20John	4	11	Beloved , if God so loved us , we ought also to love one another .
KJ21	1%20John	4	12	No man hath seen God at any time . If we love one another , God dwelleth in us , and His love is perfected in us .
KJ21	1%20John	4	13	Hereby we know that we dwell in Him and He in us : because He hath given us of His Spirit .
KJ21	1%20John	4	14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world .
KJ21	1%20John	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God dwelleth in him , and he in God .
KJ21	1%20John	4	16	And we have known and believed the love that God hath for us . God is love , and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God , and God in him .
KJ21	1%20John	4	17	Herein is our love made perfect , that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment ; because as He is , so are we in this world .
KJ21	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear , because fear hath torment . He that feareth is not made perfect in love .
KJ21	1%20John	4	19	We love Him , because He first loved us .
KJ21	1%20John	4	20	If a man say , “ I love God , ” and hateth his brother , he is a liar . For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
KJ21	1%20John	4	21	And this commandment we have from Him : that he who loveth God love his brother also .
KJ21	1%20John	5	1	John
KJ21	1%20John	5	5	Who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God ?
KJ21	1%20John	5	2	By this we know that we love the children of God : when we love God and keep His commandments .
KJ21	1%20John	5	3	For this is the love of God : that we keep His commandments ; and His commandments are not grievous .
KJ21	1%20John	5	4	For whosoever is born of God overcometh the world . And this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith .
KJ21	1%20John	5	6	This is He that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . And it is the Spirit that beareth witness , because the Spirit is truth .
KJ21	1%20John	5	7	For there are three that bear record in Heaven : the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost ; and these three are one .
KJ21	1%20John	5	8	And there are three that bear witness on earth : the Spirit , and the water , and the blood ; and these three agree in one .
KJ21	1%20John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater , for this is the witness of God which He hath testified of His Son .
KJ21	1%20John	5	10	He that believeth in the Son of God hath the witness in himself ; he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar , because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Son .
KJ21	1%20John	5	11	And this is the record : that God hath given to us eternal life , and this life is in His Son .
KJ21	1%20John	5	12	He that hath the Son hath life , and he that hath not the Son hath not life .
KJ21	1%20John	5	13	These things I have written unto you that believe in the name of the Son of God , that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God .
KJ21	1%20John	5	14	And this is the confidence that we have in Him : that if we ask anything according to His will , He heareth us .
KJ21	1%20John	5	15	And if we know that He hear us , whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him .
KJ21	1%20John	5	16	If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death , he shall ask and He shall give him life , for those who sin not unto death . There is a sin unto death . I do not say that he shall pray about it .
KJ21	1%20John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin , and there is a sin not unto death .
KJ21	1%20John	5	18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not , but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
KJ21	1%20John	5	19	And we know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in wickedness .
KJ21	1%20John	5	20	And we know that the Son of God is come and hath given us an understanding , that we may know Him that is true ; and we are in Him that is true , even in His Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God and Eternal Life .
KJ21	1%20John	5	21	Little children , keep yourselves from idols . Amen .
KJ21	2%20John	1	2	for the truth ’ s sake , which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever :
KJ21	2%20John	1	1	The Elder , Unto the elect lady and her children , whom I love in the truth , and not I only , but also all those who have known the truth ,
KJ21	2%20John	1	3	Grace , mercy , and peace be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
KJ21	2%20John	1	4	I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth , as we have received a commandment from the Father .
KJ21	2%20John	1	5	And now I beseech thee , lady , not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee , but that which we had from the beginning : that we love one another .
KJ21	2%20John	1	6	And this is love : that we walk according to His commandments . This is the commandment , that , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
KJ21	2%20John	1	7	For many deceivers have entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . This is a deceiver and an antichrist .
KJ21	2%20John	1	8	Look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we may receive a full reward .
KJ21	2%20John	1	9	Whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God . He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ hath both the Father and the Son .
KJ21	2%20John	1	10	If there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him Godspeed ;
KJ21	2%20John	1	11	for he that biddeth him Godspeed is a partaker of his evil deeds .
KJ21	2%20John	1	12	Having many things to write unto you , I would not write with paper and ink ; but I trust to come unto you and speak face to face , that our joy may be full .
KJ21	2%20John	1	13	The children of thy elect sister greet thee . Amen .
KJ21	3%20John	1	3	For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , even as thou walkest in the truth .
KJ21	3%20John	1	1	The Elder , Unto the well-beloved Gaius , whom I love in the truth :
KJ21	3%20John	1	2	Beloved , I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health , even as thy soul prospereth .
KJ21	3%20John	1	4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth .
KJ21	3%20John	1	5	Beloved , thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers ,
KJ21	3%20John	1	6	who have borne witness of thy charity before the church . If thou send them forward on their journey in a godly manner , thou shalt do well ,
KJ21	3%20John	1	7	because for His name ’ s sake they went forth , taking nothing from the Gentiles .
KJ21	3%20John	1	8	We therefore ought to receive such , that we might be fellow helpers to the truth .
KJ21	3%20John	1	9	I wrote unto the church , but Diotrephes , who loveth to have preeminence among them , receiveth us not .
KJ21	3%20John	1	10	Therefore if I come , I will remember his deeds which he doeth , prating against us with malicious words . And not content therewith , neither doth he himself receive the brethren , and forbiddeth those who would , and casteth them out of the church .
KJ21	3%20John	1	11	Beloved , follow not that which is evil , but that which is good . He that doeth good is of God , but he that doeth evil hath not seen God .
KJ21	3%20John	1	12	Demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself . Yea , of this we also bear record , and ye know that our record is true .
KJ21	3%20John	1	13	I had many things to write , but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee ;
KJ21	3%20John	1	14	but I trust I shall shortly see thee , and we shall speak face to face . Peace be to thee . Our friends salute thee . Greet the friends by name .
KJ21	Jude	1	1	Jude , the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James , To those who are sanctified by God the Father , and preserved in Jesus Christ , and called :
KJ21	Jude	1	2	Mercy unto you , and peace and love be multiplied .
KJ21	Jude	1	3	Beloved , while I was giving all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation , it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints .
KJ21	Jude	1	4	For there are certain men who have crept in unawares , who were foreordained of old for this condemnation , ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness , and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Jude	1	5	I will therefore put you in remembrance , though ye once knew this , how the Lord , having saved the people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who believed not .
KJ21	Jude	1	6	And the angels who kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , He hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great Day—
KJ21	Jude	1	7	even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them , in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh , are set forth as an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire .
KJ21	Jude	1	8	Likewise also , these filthy dreamers defile the flesh , despise dominion , and speak evil of dignities .
KJ21	Jude	1	9	Yet Michael the archangel , when contending with the devil and disputing about the body of Moses , dared not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , “ The Lord rebuke thee ! ”
KJ21	Jude	1	10	But these speak evil of those things which they know not ; but what they come to know naturally as brute beasts , in those things they corrupt themselves .
KJ21	Jude	1	11	Woe unto them ! For they have gone in the way of Cain and have run greedily after the error of Balaam for their reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Korah .
KJ21	Jude	1	12	These are spots on your feasts of charity when they feast with you , feeding themselves without fear . Clouds they are without water , carried about by winds ; trees whose fruit withereth , without fruit , twice dead , plucked up by the roots ;
KJ21	Jude	1	13	raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever .
KJ21	Jude	1	14	And Enoch also , the seventh from Adam , prophesied of these , saying , “ Behold , the Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints
KJ21	Jude	1	15	to execute judgment upon all , and to convince all who are ungodly among them of all their godless deeds which they have godlessly committed , and of all the harsh speeches which godless sinners have spoken against Him. ”
KJ21	Jude	1	16	These are murmurers and complainers , walking after their own lusts ; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words , giving admiration to men ’ s persons to gain advantage .
KJ21	Jude	1	17	But , beloved , remember ye the words which were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJ21	Jude	1	18	how they told you that there would be mockers in the last times who would walk after their own ungodly lusts .
KJ21	Jude	1	19	These are they who separate themselves , sensual , having not the Spirit .
KJ21	Jude	1	20	But ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Ghost ,
KJ21	Jude	1	21	keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life .
KJ21	Jude	1	22	And on some have compassion , making a difference ;
KJ21	Jude	1	23	and others save with fear , pulling them out of the fire , hating even the garment spotted by the flesh .
KJ21	Jude	1	24	Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling , and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy ,
KJ21	Jude	1	25	to the only wise God our Savior be glory and majesty , dominion and power , now and ever . Amen .
KJ21	Revelation	1	1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto Him to show unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass . And He sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John ,
KJ21	Revelation	1	2	who bore record of the Word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all things that he saw .
KJ21	Revelation	1	3	Blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein ; for the time is at hand .
KJ21	Revelation	1	4	John , To the seven churches in Asia : Grace be unto you and peace from Him who is , and who was , and who is to come , and from the seven spirits which are before His throne ;
KJ21	Revelation	1	5	and from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , and the first-begotten of the dead , and the prince over the kings of the earth . Unto Him that loved us , and washed us from our sins in His own blood ,
KJ21	Revelation	1	6	and hath made us kings and priests unto God and His Father , to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
KJ21	Revelation	1	7	Behold , He cometh with clouds , and every eye shall see Him , and they also who pierced Him ; and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him . Even so . Amen .
KJ21	Revelation	1	8	“ I Am Alpha And Omega , The Beginning And The Ending , ” saith the Lord , who is , and who was , and who is to come , the Almighty .
KJ21	Revelation	1	9	I , John , who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the Kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was on the isle that is called Patmos , for the Word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Revelation	1	10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord ’ s Day , and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet ,
KJ21	Revelation	1	11	saying , “ I am Alpha and Omega , the First and the Last , ” and , “ What thou seest , write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia : unto Ephesus , and unto Smyrna , and unto Pergamos , and unto Thyatira , and unto Sardis , and unto Philadelphia , and unto Laodicea. ”
KJ21	Revelation	1	12	And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me . And being turned , I saw seven golden candlesticks ;
KJ21	Revelation	1	13	and in the midst of the seven candlesticks One like unto the Son of Man , clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the breast with a golden girdle .
KJ21	Revelation	1	14	His head and His hair were white like wool , as white as snow , and His eyes were as a flame of fire ;
KJ21	Revelation	1	15	and His feet like unto fine brass , as though they burned in a furnace , and His voice as the sound of many waters .
KJ21	Revelation	1	16	And He had in His right hand seven stars , and out of His mouth went a sharp twoedged sword , and His countenance shone as the sun shineth in his strength .
KJ21	Revelation	1	17	And when I saw Him , I fell at His feet as dead . And He laid His right hand upon me , saying unto me , “ Fear not ; I am the First and the Last .
KJ21	Revelation	1	18	I am He that liveth , and was dead ; and behold , I am alive for evermore , Amen , and have the keys of hell and of death .
KJ21	Revelation	1	19	Write the things which thou hast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be hereafter .
KJ21	Revelation	1	20	The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in My right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks : the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches , and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
KJ21	Revelation	2	2	I know thy works and thy labor and thy patience , and how thou canst not bear them that are evil ; and how thou hast tried them that say they are apostles and are not , and hast found them liars ;
KJ21	Revelation	2	3	and hast borne , and hast patience , and for My name ’ s sake hast labored and hast not fainted .
KJ21	Revelation	2	4	Nevertheless , I have something against thee , because thou hast left thy first love .
KJ21	Revelation	2	5	Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen , and repent and do the works as at first ; or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place , unless thou repent .
KJ21	Revelation	2	6	But this thou hast : that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
KJ21	Revelation	2	7	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches . To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life , which is in the midst of the Paradise of God. ’
KJ21	Revelation	2	8	“ And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write : ‘ These things saith the First and the Last , who was dead and is alive :
KJ21	Revelation	2	9	I know thy works and tribulation and poverty ( but thou art rich ) , and I know the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
KJ21	Revelation	2	10	Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer . Behold , the devil shall cast some of you into prison , that ye may be tried , and ye shall have tribulation ten days . Be thou faithful unto death , and I will give thee a crown of Life .
KJ21	Revelation	2	11	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches . He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death. ’
KJ21	Revelation	2	12	“ And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write : ‘ These things saith He that hath the sharp sword with two edges :
KJ21	Revelation	2	13	I know thy works and where thou dwellest , even where Satan ’ s seat is ; and that thou holdest fast My name and hast not denied My faith , even in those days wherein Antipas was My faithful martyr , who was slain among you , where Satan dwelleth .
KJ21	Revelation	2	14	But I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit fornication .
KJ21	Revelation	2	15	So thou also hast them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans , which thing I hate .
KJ21	Revelation	2	16	Repent , or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth .
KJ21	Revelation	2	17	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches . To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna , and will give him a white stone , and on the stone a new name written , which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it. ’
KJ21	Revelation	2	18	“ And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write : ‘ These things saith the Son of God , who hath His eyes like unto a flame of fire , and His feet are like fine brass :
KJ21	Revelation	2	19	I know thy works , and charity and service , and faith and thy patience , and thy works , and the last to be more than the first .
KJ21	Revelation	2	20	Notwithstanding , I have a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel , who calleth herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce My servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
KJ21	Revelation	2	21	And I gave her space to repent of her fornication , and she repented not .
KJ21	Revelation	2	22	Behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , unless they repent of their deeds .
KJ21	Revelation	2	23	And I will kill her children with death , and all the churches shall know that I am He that searcheth the reins and hearts ; and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
KJ21	Revelation	2	24	But unto you I say , and unto the rest in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine and who have not known the depths of Satan ( as they say ) I will put upon you no other burden .
KJ21	Revelation	2	25	But that which ye have already , hold fast till I come .
KJ21	Revelation	2	26	And he that overcometh and keepeth My works unto the end , to him will I give power over the nations ,
KJ21	Revelation	2	27	and “ he shall rule them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers , ” even as I have received from My Father .
KJ21	Revelation	2	28	And I will give him the morning star .
KJ21	Revelation	2	29	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ! ’
KJ21	Revelation	3	3	Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard ; and hold fast and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .
KJ21	Revelation	3	2	Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die , for I have not found thy works perfect before God .
KJ21	Revelation	3	4	Thou hast a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with Me in white , for they are worthy .
KJ21	Revelation	3	5	He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life , but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels .
KJ21	Revelation	3	6	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ! ’
KJ21	Revelation	3	7	“ And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write : ‘ These things saith He that is holy , He that is true , He that hath the key of David , He that openeth and no man shutteth , and shutteth and no man openeth :
KJ21	Revelation	3	8	I know thy works . Behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it . For thou hast a little strength , and hast kept My Word , and hast not denied My name .
KJ21	Revelation	3	9	Behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , who say they are Jews and are not , but do lie — behold , I will make them to come and worship at thy feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
KJ21	Revelation	3	10	Because thou hast kept the word of My patience , I will also keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth .
KJ21	Revelation	3	11	Behold , I come quickly ; hold fast that which thou hast , that no man take thy crown .
KJ21	Revelation	3	12	Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of My God , and he shall go out no more ; and I will write upon him the name of My God , and the name of the city of My God , which is New Jerusalem , which cometh down out of heaven from My God , and I will write upon him My new name .
KJ21	Revelation	3	13	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ! ’
KJ21	Revelation	3	14	“ And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write : ‘ These things saith the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God :
KJ21	Revelation	3	15	I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot ; I would thou wert cold or hot .
KJ21	Revelation	3	16	So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spew thee out of My mouth .
KJ21	Revelation	3	17	Because thou sayest , “ I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing , ” and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable , and poor and blind and naked ,
KJ21	Revelation	3	18	I counsel thee to buy from Me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich , and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear , and anoint thine eyes with eye salve , that thou mayest see .
KJ21	Revelation	3	19	As many as I love , I rebuke and chasten : be zealous therefore , and repent .
KJ21	Revelation	3	20	Behold , I stand at the door and knock . If any man hear My voice and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with Me .
KJ21	Revelation	3	21	To him that overcometh , will I grant to sit with Me on My throne , even as I also overcame and am set down with My Father on His throne .
KJ21	Revelation	3	22	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ! ’ ”
KJ21	Revelation	4	4	And round about the throne were four and twenty seats ; and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment , and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
KJ21	Revelation	4	2	And immediately I was in the Spirit ; and behold , a throne was set in Heaven , and One sat on the throne .
KJ21	Revelation	4	3	And He that sat thereon was to look upon like a jasper and a sardius stone ; and there was a rainbow round about the throne , in appearance like unto an emerald .
KJ21	Revelation	4	5	And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices . And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God ;
KJ21	Revelation	4	6	and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal . And in the midst of the throne , and round about the throne , were four living beings full of eyes in front and behind .
KJ21	Revelation	4	7	And the first being was like a lion , and the second being like a calf , and the third being had the face of a man , and the fourth being was like a flying eagle .
KJ21	Revelation	4	8	And each of the four living beings had six wings about him , and they were full of eyes within ; and they rested not day and night , saying , “ Holy , holy , holy , Lord God Almighty , who was , and is , and is to come ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	4	9	And when those living beings give glory and honor and thanks to Him that sat on the throne , who liveth for ever and ever ,
KJ21	Revelation	4	10	the four and twenty elders fall down before Him that sits on the throne , and worship Him that liveth for ever and ever , and cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
KJ21	Revelation	4	11	“ Thou art worthy , O Lord , to receive glory and honor and power ; for Thou hast created all things , and for Thy pleasure they are , and were created . ”
KJ21	Revelation	5	5	And one of the elders said unto me , “ Weep not ! Behold , the Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof. ”
KJ21	Revelation	5	2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof ? ”
KJ21	Revelation	5	3	And no man in Heaven , nor on earth , neither under the earth , was able to open the book , neither to look thereon .
KJ21	Revelation	5	4	And I wept much , because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book , neither to look thereon .
KJ21	Revelation	5	6	And I beheld , and lo , in the midst of the throne and the four living beings , and in the midst of the elders , stood a Lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God , sent forth into all the earth .
KJ21	Revelation	5	7	And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne .
KJ21	Revelation	5	8	And when He had taken the book , the four living beings and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps and golden vials full of incense , which are the prayers of saints .
KJ21	Revelation	5	9	And they sang a new song , saying , “ Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof ; for Thou wast slain , and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood , from every kindred and tongue , and people and nation ,
KJ21	Revelation	5	10	and hast made us unto our God kings and priests ; and we shall reign on the earth. ”
KJ21	Revelation	5	11	And I beheld , and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living beings and the elders ; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ,
KJ21	Revelation	5	12	saying with a loud voice , “ Worthy is the Lamb that was slain , to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength , and honor and glory and blessing ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	5	13	And I heard every creature which is in heaven and on the earth , and under the earth and such as are in the sea , and all that are in them , saying , “ Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb for ever and ever ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	5	14	And the four living beings said , “ Amen. ” And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped Him that liveth for ever and ever .
KJ21	Revelation	6	6	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living beings say , “ A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	6	2	And I saw , and behold , a white horse , and he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown was given unto him , and he went forth conquering and to conquer .
KJ21	Revelation	6	3	And when He had opened the second seal , I heard the second living being say , “ Come and see ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	6	4	And there went out another horse that was red ; and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , that they should kill one another ; and there was given unto him a great sword .
KJ21	Revelation	6	5	And when He had opened the third seal , I heard the third living being say , “ Come and see ! ” And I beheld , and lo , a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
KJ21	Revelation	6	7	And when He had opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living being say , “ Come and see ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	6	8	And I looked , and behold , a pale horse , and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed with him . And power was given unto them over a fourth part of the earth to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with the beasts of the earth .
KJ21	Revelation	6	9	And when He had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God , and for the testimony which they held .
KJ21	Revelation	6	10	And they cried with a loud voice , saying , “ How long , O Lord , holy and true , dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ? ”
KJ21	Revelation	6	11	And white robes were given unto every one of them , and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season , until their fellow servants and also their brethren , who were to be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
KJ21	Revelation	6	12	And I beheld when He had opened the sixth seal , and lo , there was a great earthquake , and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ;
KJ21	Revelation	6	13	and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind .
KJ21	Revelation	6	14	And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together , and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
KJ21	Revelation	6	15	And the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains ;
KJ21	Revelation	6	16	and they said to the mountains and rocks , “ Fall on us , and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb !
KJ21	Revelation	6	17	For the great Day of His wrath is come , and who shall be able to stand ? ”
KJ21	Revelation	7	7	of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand ; of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand ; of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand ;
KJ21	Revelation	7	2	And I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God ; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
KJ21	Revelation	7	3	saying , “ Hurt not the earth , neither the sea nor the trees , till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. ”
KJ21	Revelation	7	4	And I heard the number of them that were sealed : there were sealed a hundred and fortyfour thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
KJ21	Revelation	7	5	Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand ; of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand ; of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand ;
KJ21	Revelation	7	6	of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand ; of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand ; of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand ;
KJ21	Revelation	7	8	of the tribe of Zebulun were sealed twelve thousand ; of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand ; of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
KJ21	Revelation	7	9	After this I beheld , and lo , a great multitude , which no man could number , of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues , stood before the throne and before the Lamb , clothed in white robes and with palms in their hands .
KJ21	Revelation	7	10	And they cried with a loud voice , saying , “ Salvation to our God who sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	7	11	And all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four living beings , and fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God ,
KJ21	Revelation	7	12	saying , “ Amen . Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving , and honor and power and might , be unto our God for ever and ever . Amen ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	7	13	And one of the elders answered , saying unto me , “ Who are these that are arrayed in white robes , and from whence have they come ? ”
KJ21	Revelation	7	14	And I said unto him , “ Sir , thou knowest. ” And he said to me , “ These are they that came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
KJ21	Revelation	7	15	Therefore , “ they are before the throne of God , and serve Him day and night in His temple ; and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them .
KJ21	Revelation	7	16	They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat .
KJ21	Revelation	7	17	For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters , and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes . ”
KJ21	Revelation	8	8	And the second angel sounded and , as it were , a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea ; and a third part of the sea became blood ;
KJ21	Revelation	8	2	And I saw the seven angels who stood before God , and to them were given seven trumpets .
KJ21	Revelation	8	3	And another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden censer ; and there was given unto him much incense , that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar , which was before the throne .
KJ21	Revelation	8	4	And the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before God out of the angel ’ s hand .
KJ21	Revelation	8	5	And the angel took the censer , and filled it with fire from the altar , and cast it onto the earth ; and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings , and an earthquake .
KJ21	Revelation	8	6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
KJ21	Revelation	8	7	The first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth ; and a third part of the trees were burned up , and all green grass was burned up .
KJ21	Revelation	8	9	and a third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life , died , and a third part of the ships were destroyed .
KJ21	Revelation	8	10	And the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as if it were a lamp , and it fell upon a third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters ;
KJ21	Revelation	8	11	and the name of the star is called Wormwood . And a third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
KJ21	Revelation	8	12	And the fourth angel sounded , and a third part of the sun was smitten , and a third part of the moon and a third part of the stars , so that a third part of them was darkened ; and a third of the day shone not , and the night likewise .
KJ21	Revelation	8	13	And I beheld , and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven , saying with a loud voice , “ Woe , woe , woe to the inhabitants of the earth , because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three other angels , which are yet to sound ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	9	9	And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron , and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots with many horses running to battle .
KJ21	Revelation	9	2	And he opened the bottomless pit , and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
KJ21	Revelation	9	3	And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth ; and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
KJ21	Revelation	9	4	And it was commanded to them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree , but only those men who have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
KJ21	Revelation	9	5	And to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months ; and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man .
KJ21	Revelation	9	6	And in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
KJ21	Revelation	9	7	And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for battle ; and on their heads were , as it were , crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
KJ21	Revelation	9	8	And they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
KJ21	Revelation	9	10	And they had tails like unto scorpions , and there were stingers in their tails ; and their power was to hurt men five months .
KJ21	Revelation	9	11	And they had a king over them , the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue his name is Apollyon .
KJ21	Revelation	9	12	One woe is past ; and behold , there come two more woes hereafter .
KJ21	Revelation	9	13	And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which stands before God ,
KJ21	Revelation	9	14	saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , “ Loose the four angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates. ”
KJ21	Revelation	9	15	And the four angels were loosed , who had been prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year , to slay a third part of men .
KJ21	Revelation	9	16	And the number of the army of horsemen was two hundred thousand thousand , and I heard the number of them .
KJ21	Revelation	9	17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision , and they that sat on them had breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone ; and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions , and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone .
KJ21	Revelation	9	18	By these three was a third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
KJ21	Revelation	9	19	For their power is in their mouth and in their tails ; for their tails were like unto serpents and had heads , and with them they cause hurt .
KJ21	Revelation	9	20	And the rest of the men , who were not killed by these plagues , yet repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not worship devils , and idols of gold and silver , and brass and stone and of wood , which can neither see nor hear nor walk ;
KJ21	Revelation	9	21	neither repented they of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
KJ21	Revelation	10	10	And I took the little book out of the angel ’ s hand and ate it up , and it was in my mouth sweet as honey ; and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
KJ21	Revelation	10	2	And he had in his hand a little book open . And he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth ,
KJ21	Revelation	10	3	and cried with a loud voice , as when a lion roareth . And when he had cried , seven thunders uttered their voices .
KJ21	Revelation	10	4	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write , and I heard a voice from Heaven saying unto me , “ Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not. ”
KJ21	Revelation	10	5	And the angel , whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth , lifted up his hand to heaven .
KJ21	Revelation	10	6	And he swore by Him that liveth for ever and ever , who created heaven and the things that are therein , and the earth and the things that are therein , and the sea and the things which are therein , that there should be time no longer ,
KJ21	Revelation	10	7	but that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as He hath declared to His servants the prophets .
KJ21	Revelation	10	8	And the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke unto me again and said , “ Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. ”
KJ21	Revelation	10	9	And I went unto the angel and said unto him , “ Give me the little book. ” And he said unto me , “ Take it and eat it up , and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. ”
KJ21	Revelation	10	11	And he said unto me , “ Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations , and tongues and kings . ”
KJ21	Revelation	11	11	But after three days and a half , the Spirit of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fellupon them that saw them .
KJ21	Revelation	11	2	But the court which is outside the temple , leave out , and measure it not , for it is given unto the Gentiles ; and the Holy City shall they tread under foot for forty and two months .
KJ21	Revelation	11	3	And I will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth. ”
KJ21	Revelation	11	4	These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks , standing before the God of the earth .
KJ21	Revelation	11	5	And if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies ; and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
KJ21	Revelation	11	6	These have power to shut heaven , that it rain not in the days of their prophecy , and have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to smite the earth with all plagues , as often as they will .
KJ21	Revelation	11	7	And when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them and kill them .
KJ21	Revelation	11	8	And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also our Lord was crucified .
KJ21	Revelation	11	9	And they of the people and kindreds , and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half , and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves .
KJ21	Revelation	11	10	And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry , and shall send gifts one to another , because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth .
KJ21	Revelation	11	12	And they heard a great voice from Heaven , saying unto them , “ Come up hither ! ” And they ascended up to Heaven in a cloud , and their enemies beheld them .
KJ21	Revelation	11	13	And that same hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth part of the city fell ; and in the earthquake were slain seven thousand men , and the remnant were seized with fear , and gave glory to the God of Heaven .
KJ21	Revelation	11	14	The second woe is past ; and behold , the third woe cometh quickly .
KJ21	Revelation	11	15	And the seventh angel sounded , and there were great voices in Heaven , saying , “ The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ , and He shall reign for ever and ever ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	11	16	And the four and twenty elders , who sat before God on their seats , fell upon their faces and worshiped God ,
KJ21	Revelation	11	17	saying , “ We give Thee thanks , O Lord God Almighty , who art , and wast , and art to come , because Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power , and hast reigned .
KJ21	Revelation	11	18	And the nations were angry ; and Thy wrath is come , and the time of the dead , that they should be judged , and that Thou shouldest give reward unto Thy servants the prophets , and to the saints and them that fear Thy name , small and great , and shouldest destroy them that destroy the earth. ”
KJ21	Revelation	11	19	And the temple of God was opened in Heaven ; and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament , and there were lightnings and voices , and thunderings and an earthquake , and great hail .
KJ21	Revelation	12	12	Therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them ! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea ! For the devil has come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. ”
KJ21	Revelation	12	2	And she , being with child , cried , travailing in birth and in pain to be delivered .
KJ21	Revelation	12	3	And there appeared another wonder in heaven : behold , a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .
KJ21	Revelation	12	4	And his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven , and cast them to the earth . And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered to devour her child as soon as it was born .
KJ21	Revelation	12	5	And she brought forth a manchild , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron ; and her child was caught up unto God and to His throne .
KJ21	Revelation	12	6	And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared by God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
KJ21	Revelation	12	7	And there was war in Heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels ,
KJ21	Revelation	12	8	and prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in Heaven .
KJ21	Revelation	12	9	And the great dragon was cast out — that serpent of old called the Devil and Satan , who deceiveth the whole world . He was cast out onto the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
KJ21	Revelation	12	10	And I heard a loud voice saying in Heaven , “ Now have come salvation and strength , and the Kingdom of our God , and the power of His Christ ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , who accused them before our God day and night .
KJ21	Revelation	12	11	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony , and they loved not their lives unto the death .
KJ21	Revelation	12	13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman who brought forth the manchild .
KJ21	Revelation	12	14	And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
KJ21	Revelation	12	15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood .
KJ21	Revelation	12	16	And the earth helped the woman ; and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
KJ21	Revelation	12	17	And the dragon was wroth with the woman , and he went to make war with the remnant of her seed , who keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
KJ21	Revelation	13	13	And he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men .
KJ21	Revelation	13	2	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion . And the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
KJ21	Revelation	13	3	And I saw that one of his heads was , as it were , wounded to death , and his deadly wound was healed . And all the world wondered after the beast .
KJ21	Revelation	13	4	And they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast , and they worshiped the beast , saying , “ Who is like unto the beast ? Who is able to make war with him ? ”
KJ21	Revelation	13	5	And there was given unto him a mouth , speaking great things and blasphemies , and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months .
KJ21	Revelation	13	6	And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme His name , and His tabernacle , and them that dwell in Heaven .
KJ21	Revelation	13	7	And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them ; and power was given him over all kindreds , and tongues , and nations .
KJ21	Revelation	13	8	And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb , slain from the foundation of the world .
KJ21	Revelation	13	9	If any man have an ear , let him hear :
KJ21	Revelation	13	10	He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity . He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . Here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
KJ21	Revelation	13	11	And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb , and he spoke as a dragon .
KJ21	Revelation	13	12	And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him ; and he causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
KJ21	Revelation	13	14	And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast , saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast , which had the wound by a sword and lived .
KJ21	Revelation	13	15	And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak and cause to be killed as many as would not worship the image of the beast .
KJ21	Revelation	13	16	And he causeth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads ,
KJ21	Revelation	13	17	that no man might buy or sell , save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name .
KJ21	Revelation	13	18	Here is wisdom : Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man ; and his number is six hundred threescore and six .
KJ21	Revelation	14	14	And I looked , and behold , a white cloud ; and upon the cloud sat one like unto the Son of Man , having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle .
KJ21	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a voice from Heaven as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder , and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps .
KJ21	Revelation	14	3	And they sang , as it were , a new song before the throne , and before the four living beings and the elders ; and no man could learn that song , except the hundred and forty and four thousand who were redeemed from the earth .
KJ21	Revelation	14	4	These are they that were not defiled with women , for they are virgins . These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth . These were redeemed from among men , being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb .
KJ21	Revelation	14	5	And in their mouth was found no guile , for they are without fault before the throne of God .
KJ21	Revelation	14	6	And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven , having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth , and to every nation and kindred , and tongue and people ,
KJ21	Revelation	14	7	saying with a loud voice , “ Fear God and give glory to Him , for the hour of His Judgment is come . Worship Him that made heaven and earth , and the sea and the fountains of waters. ”
KJ21	Revelation	14	8	And there followed another angel , saying , “ Babylon is fallen ! Fallen is that great city , because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. ”
KJ21	Revelation	14	9	And the third angel followed them , saying with a loud voice , “ If any man worship the beast and his image , and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand ,
KJ21	Revelation	14	10	the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out unmixed into the cup of His indignation ; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb .
KJ21	Revelation	14	11	And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever ; and they have no rest day or night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. ”
KJ21	Revelation	14	12	Here is the patience of the saints : here are they that keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus .
KJ21	Revelation	14	13	And I heard a voice from Heaven , saying unto me , “ Write : ’ Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth. ’ ” “ Yea , ” saith the Spirit , “ that they may rest from their labors , and their works do follow them. ”
KJ21	Revelation	14	15	And another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , “ Thrust in thy sickle and reap ; for the time has come for thee to reap , for the harvest of the earth is ripe. ”
KJ21	Revelation	14	16	And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth , and the earth was reaped .
KJ21	Revelation	14	17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in Heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
KJ21	Revelation	14	18	And another angel came out from the altar , who had power over fire , and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle , saying , “ Thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth , for her grapes are fully ripe. ”
KJ21	Revelation	14	19	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God .
KJ21	Revelation	14	20	And the wine press was trodden outside the city , and blood came out of the wine press , even unto the horse bridles , for the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs .
KJ21	Revelation	15	15	And I saw another sign in Heaven , great and marvelous : seven angels holding the seven last plagues , for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
KJ21	Revelation	15	2	And I saw , as it were , a sea of glass mingled with fire , and them that had gotten the victory over the beast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , standing on the sea of glass and having the harps of God .
KJ21	Revelation	15	3	And they sing the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , “ Great and marvelous are Thy works , Lord God Almighty ! Just and true are Thy ways , Thou King of saints !
KJ21	Revelation	15	4	Who shall not fear Thee , O Lord , and glorify Thy name ? For Thou only art holy . For all nations shall come and worship before Thee , for Thy judgments are made manifest. ”
KJ21	Revelation	15	5	And after that I looked , and behold , the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in Heaven was opened ;
KJ21	Revelation	15	6	and the seven angels , having the seven plagues , came out of the temple , clothed in pure and white linen and having their breasts girded with golden girdles .
KJ21	Revelation	15	7	And one of the four living beings gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God , who liveth for ever and ever .
KJ21	Revelation	15	8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power , and no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
KJ21	Revelation	16	16	And he gathered them together at a place called in the Hebrew tongue , Armageddon .
KJ21	Revelation	16	2	And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men who had the mark of the beast and upon them that worshiped his image .
KJ21	Revelation	16	3	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man , and every living soul died in the sea .
KJ21	Revelation	16	4	And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters ; and they became blood .
KJ21	Revelation	16	5	And I heard the angel of the waters say , “ Thou art righteous , O Lord , who art , and wast , and shall be , because Thou hast judged thus ;
KJ21	Revelation	16	6	for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets , and Thou hast given them blood to drink , for they are worthy. ”
KJ21	Revelation	16	7	And I heard another out of the altar say , “ Even so , Lord God Almighty ; true and righteous are Thy judgments. ”
KJ21	Revelation	16	8	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
KJ21	Revelation	16	9	And men were scorched with great heat , and they blasphemed the name of God , who hath power over these plagues ; and they repented not to give Him glory .
KJ21	Revelation	16	10	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness , and they gnawed their tongues from pain ;
KJ21	Revelation	16	11	and they blasphemed the God of Heaven because of their pains and their sores , and repented not of their deeds .
KJ21	Revelation	16	12	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
KJ21	Revelation	16	13	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
KJ21	Revelation	16	14	For they are the spirits of devils working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them for the battle of that great Day of God Almighty .
KJ21	Revelation	16	15	“ Behold , I come as a thief . Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments , lest he walk naked , and they see his shame. ”
KJ21	Revelation	16	17	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ; and there came a great voice out of the temple of Heaven from the throne , saying , “ It Is Done ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	16	18	And there were voices and thunders and lightnings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as has not been since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake and so great .
KJ21	Revelation	16	19	And the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell , and great Babylon came to remembrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath .
KJ21	Revelation	16	20	And every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
KJ21	Revelation	16	21	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven , every stone about the weight of a talent . And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail , for the plague thereof was exceeding great .
KJ21	Revelation	17	17	For God hath put into their hearts to fulfill His will and to agree , and to give their kingdom unto the beast , until the words of God shall be fulfilled .
KJ21	Revelation	17	2	with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. ”
KJ21	Revelation	17	3	So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness ; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast , full of names of blasphemy , and having seven heads and ten horns .
KJ21	Revelation	17	4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color , and bedecked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication ;
KJ21	Revelation	17	5	and upon her forehead was a name written : Mystery , Babylon the Great , Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth .
KJ21	Revelation	17	6	And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . And when I saw her , I wondered with great amazement .
KJ21	Revelation	17	7	And the angel said unto me , “ Why dost thou marvel ? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her , which hath the seven heads and ten horns .
KJ21	Revelation	17	8	The beast that thou sawest was , and is not , and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition ; and they that dwell on the earth , whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world , shall wonder when they behold the beast that was , and is not , and yet is .
KJ21	Revelation	17	9	“ And here is the mind which hath wisdom : The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth .
KJ21	Revelation	17	10	And there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other has not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
KJ21	Revelation	17	11	And the beast that was , and is not , even he is the eighth , yet is one of the seven and goeth into perdition .
KJ21	Revelation	17	12	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings , who have received no kingdom as yet , but will receive power as kings for one hour with the beast .
KJ21	Revelation	17	13	These have one mind , and shall give their power and strength unto the beast .
KJ21	Revelation	17	14	These shall make war with the Lamb , and the Lamb shall overcome them ; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings , and they that are with Him are called , and chosen , and faithful. ”
KJ21	Revelation	17	15	And he saith unto me , “ The waters which thou sawest , where the whore sitteth , are peoples and multitudes , and nations and tongues .
KJ21	Revelation	17	16	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire .
KJ21	Revelation	17	18	And the woman whom thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth . ”
KJ21	Revelation	18	18	and they cried when they saw the smoke of her burning , saying , ‘ What city is like unto this great city ! ’
KJ21	Revelation	18	2	And he cried mightily with a strong voice , saying , “ Babylon the great is fallen , is fallen , and is become the habitation of devils , and the hold of every foul spirit , and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird .
KJ21	Revelation	18	3	For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication ; and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth have waxed rich through the abundance of her indulgences pleasures. ”
KJ21	Revelation	18	4	And I heard another voice from Heaven , saying , “ Come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues ;
KJ21	Revelation	18	5	for her sins have reached unto Heaven , and God hath remembered her iniquities .
KJ21	Revelation	18	6	Reward her even as she has rewarded you , and unto her double according to her works ; in the cup which she hath filled , fill to her double .
KJ21	Revelation	18	7	How much she hath glorified herself and lived voluptuously ! That much torment and sorrow give back to her ; for she saith in her heart , ‘ I sit a queen and am no widow , and shall see no sorrow. ’
KJ21	Revelation	18	8	Therefore shall her plagues come in one day ” death and mourning and famine , and she shall be utterly burned with fire ; for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her .
KJ21	Revelation	18	9	“ And the kings of the earth , who have committed fornication and lived wantonly with her , shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
KJ21	Revelation	18	10	standing afar off for the fear of her torment , saying , ‘ Alas ! Alas , that great city Babylon , that mighty city ! For in one hour has thy judgment come. ’
KJ21	Revelation	18	11	“ And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her , for no man buyeth their merchandise any more :
KJ21	Revelation	18	12	the merchandise of gold , and silver , and precious stones , and of pearls ; and fine linen , and purple , and silk , and scarlet ; all scented wood , all manner of vessels of ivory and most precious wood , and of brass , and iron , and marble ;
KJ21	Revelation	18	13	and cinnamon , and perfumes , and ointments , and frankincense , and wine , and oil , and fine flour , and wheat ; and cattle , and sheep , and horses , and chariots ; and slaves , and the souls of men .
KJ21	Revelation	18	14	“ And the fruits that thy soul lusted after have departed from thee , and all things which were dainty and goodly have departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
KJ21	Revelation	18	15	The merchants of these things , who were made rich by her , shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment , weeping and wailing
KJ21	Revelation	18	16	and saying , ‘ Alas ! Alas , that great city , that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet , and bedecked with gold and precious stones and pearls !
KJ21	Revelation	18	17	For in one hour such great riches have come to nought ! ’ “ And every shipmaster and all the company in ships , and sailors , and as many as trade by sea , stood afar off ;
KJ21	Revelation	18	19	And they cast dust on their heads and cried , weeping and wailing , saying , ‘ Alas ! Alas , that great city , wherein all that had ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her extravagances ! For in one hour is she made desolate ! ’
KJ21	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her , thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets , for God hath avenged you on her. ”
KJ21	Revelation	18	21	Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , “ Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
KJ21	Revelation	18	22	And the voice of harpers and musicians , and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee ; and no craftsman , of whatsoever craft he be , shall be found any more in thee ; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee ;
KJ21	Revelation	18	23	and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee . For thy merchants were the great men of the earth , for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived .
KJ21	Revelation	18	24	And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints , and of all that were slain upon the earth . ”
KJ21	Revelation	19	19	And I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies gathered together to make war against Him that sat on the horse , and against His army .
KJ21	Revelation	19	2	for true and righteous are His judgments : He hath judged the great whore who corrupted the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of His servants at her hand. ”
KJ21	Revelation	19	3	And again they said , “ Alleluia ! ” And her smoke rose up for ever and ever .
KJ21	Revelation	19	4	And the four and twenty elders and the four living beings fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne , saying , “ Amen ! Alleluia ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	19	5	And a voice came out of the throne , saying , “ Praise our God , all ye His servants , and ye that fear Him , both small and great. ”
KJ21	Revelation	19	6	And I heard , as it were , the voice of a great multitude , and the voice of many waters , and the voice of mighty thunderings , saying , “ Alleluia ! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth .
KJ21	Revelation	19	7	Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to Him , for the marriage of the Lamb is come , and His wife hath made herself ready. ”
KJ21	Revelation	19	8	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen , clean and white ; for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints .
KJ21	Revelation	19	9	And he said unto me , “ Write : ‘ Blessed are they that are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. ’ ” And he said unto me , “ These are the true sayings of God. ”
KJ21	Revelation	19	10	And I fell at his feet to worship him . But he said unto me , “ See that thou do it not ! I am thy fellow servant and one of thy brethren , who hold to the testimony of Jesus . Worship God ! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. ”
KJ21	Revelation	19	11	And I saw Heaven opened , and behold , a white horse ; and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness He doth judge and make war .
KJ21	Revelation	19	12	His eyes were as a flame of fire , and on His head were many crowns ; and He had a name written that no man knew , but He Himself .
KJ21	Revelation	19	13	And He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood , and His name is called , The Word of God .
KJ21	Revelation	19	14	And the armies which were in Heaven , clothed in fine linen white and clean , followed Him upon white horses .
KJ21	Revelation	19	15	And out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword with which He shall smite the nations , and He shall rule them with a rod of iron ; and He treadeth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God .
KJ21	Revelation	19	16	And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written : King Of Kings , And Lord Of Lords .
KJ21	Revelation	19	17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun , and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , “ Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ,
KJ21	Revelation	19	18	that ye may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of captains , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them , and the flesh of all men , both free and bond , both small and great. ”
KJ21	Revelation	19	20	And the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet who wrought miracles in his presence , by which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast , and them that worshiped his image . These both were cast alive into a lake of fire , burning with brimstone .
KJ21	Revelation	19	21	And the remnant were slain with the sword of Him that sat upon the horse , whose sword proceeded out of His mouth . And all the fowls were filled with their flesh .
KJ21	Revelation	20	20	And I saw an angel come down from Heaven , having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand .
KJ21	Revelation	20	2	And he laid hold on the dragon , that serpent of old , who is the devil and Satan , and bound him for a thousand years .
KJ21	Revelation	20	3	And he cast him into the bottomless pit , and shut him up and set a seal upon him , that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled ; and after that he must be loosed a little season .
KJ21	Revelation	20	4	And I saw thrones and they that sat upon them , and judgment was given unto them . And I saw the souls of them that had been beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the Word of God , and who had not worshiped the beast , nor his image , nor had received his mark upon their foreheads or on their hands ; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years .
KJ21	Revelation	20	5	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished . This is the first resurrection .
KJ21	Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with Him a thousand years .
KJ21	Revelation	20	7	And when the thousand years are expired , Satan shall be loosed out of his prison ,
KJ21	Revelation	20	8	and shall go out to deceive the nations to the four quarters of the earth — Gog and Magog — to gather them together for battle , thenumber of whom is as the sand of the sea .
KJ21	Revelation	20	9	And they went out over the breadth of the earth , and compassed the camp of the saints about , and the beloved city . And fire came down from God out of heaven , and devoured them .
KJ21	Revelation	20	10	And the devil who had deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are ; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
KJ21	Revelation	20	11	And I saw a great white throne and Him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away , and there was found no place for them .
KJ21	Revelation	20	12	And I saw the dead , small and great , standing before God , and the books were opened ; and another book was opened , which is the Book of Life . And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
KJ21	Revelation	20	13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them ; and they were judged every man according to their works .
KJ21	Revelation	20	14	And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire . This is the second death .
KJ21	Revelation	20	15	And whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire .
KJ21	Revelation	21	21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls ; each separate gate was of one pearl , and the street of the city was pure gold , as it were , transparent glass .
KJ21	Revelation	21	2	And I , John , saw the holy city , New Jerusalem , coming down from God out of Heaven , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
KJ21	Revelation	21	3	And I heard a great voice out of Heaven , saying , “ Behold , the tabernacle of God is with men , and He will dwell with them ; and they shall be His people , and God Himself shall be with them and be their God .
KJ21	Revelation	21	4	And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes , and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain ; for the former things are passed away. ”
KJ21	Revelation	21	5	And He that sat upon the throne said , “ Behold , I make all things new. ” And He said unto me , “ Write , for these words are true and faithful. ”
KJ21	Revelation	21	6	And He said unto me , “ It is done ! I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end . I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the Water of Life freely .
KJ21	Revelation	21	7	He that overcometh shall inherit all things ; and I will be his God , and he shall be my son .
KJ21	Revelation	21	8	But the fearful , and unbelieving , and the abominable , and murderers , and whoremongers , and sorcerers , and idolaters , and all liars , shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone , which is the second death. ”
KJ21	Revelation	21	9	And there came unto me one of the seven angels , who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues , and talked with me , saying , “ Come hither ; I will show thee the bride , the Lamb ’ s wife. ”
KJ21	Revelation	21	10	And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain , and showed me that great city , the Holy Jerusalem , descending out of Heaven from God ,
KJ21	Revelation	21	11	having the glory of God . And her light was like unto a stone most precious , even like a jasper stone , clear as crystal .
KJ21	Revelation	21	12	It had a wall great and high , and had twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels ; and names were written thereon , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel :
KJ21	Revelation	21	13	on the east three gates , on the north three gates , on the south three gates , and on the west three gates .
KJ21	Revelation	21	14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
KJ21	Revelation	21	15	And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city , and the gates thereof and the walls thereof .
KJ21	Revelation	21	16	And the city lieth foursquare , and the length is as great as the breadth ; and he measured the city with the reed : twelve thousand furlongs ; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
KJ21	Revelation	21	17	And he measured the wall thereof : a hundred and forty and four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the angel .
KJ21	Revelation	21	18	And the wall was built of jasper ; and the city was pure gold , like unto clear glass .
KJ21	Revelation	21	19	And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones : the first foundation was jasper , the second sapphire , the third chalcedony , the fourth emerald ,
KJ21	Revelation	21	20	the fifth sardonyx , the sixth sardius , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh jacinth , and the twelfth amethyst .
KJ21	Revelation	21	22	And I saw no temple therein , for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it .
KJ21	Revelation	21	23	And the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon to shine in it ; for the glory of God gave it light , and the Lamb is the light thereof .
KJ21	Revelation	21	24	And the nations of them that are saved shall walk in the light of it , and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it .
KJ21	Revelation	21	25	And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day , for there shall be no night there ,
KJ21	Revelation	21	26	and they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it .
KJ21	Revelation	21	27	And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth , neither whatsoever worketh abomination , or maketh a lie , but only they that are written in the Lamb ’ s Book of Life .
KJ21	Revelation	22	22	And he showed me a pure river of the Water of Life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb .
KJ21	Revelation	22	2	In the midst of the street of it , and on either side of the river , there was the Tree of Life , which bore twelve kinds of fruit and yielded her fruit every month ; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
KJ21	Revelation	22	3	And there shall be no more curse , but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it , and His servants shall serve Him .
KJ21	Revelation	22	4	And they shall see His face , and His name shall be in their foreheads .
KJ21	Revelation	22	5	And there shall be no night there , and they will need no candle , neither light of the sun ; for the Lord God giveth them light . And they shall reign for ever and ever .
KJ21	Revelation	22	6	And he said unto me , “ These sayings are faithful and true , ” and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show unto His servants the things which must shortly be done .
KJ21	Revelation	22	7	“ Behold , I come quickly. ” Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book .
KJ21	Revelation	22	8	And I , John , saw these things and heard them . And when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things .
KJ21	Revelation	22	9	Then said he unto me , “ See that thou do it not , for I am thy fellow servant , and of thy brethren the prophets , and of them that keep the sayings of this book . Worship God ! ”
KJ21	Revelation	22	10	And he said unto me , “ Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book , for the time is at hand .
KJ21	Revelation	22	11	He that is unjust , let him be unjust still ; and he that is filthy , let him be filthy still ; and he that is righteous , let him be righteous still ; and he that is holy , let him be holy still. ”
KJ21	Revelation	22	12	“ And behold , I come quickly , and My reward is with Me , to give to every man according as his work shall be .
KJ21	Revelation	22	13	I am Alpha and Omega , the Beginning and the End , the First and the Last. ”
KJ21	Revelation	22	14	Blessed are they that do His commandments , that they may have right to the Tree of Life , and may enter in through the gates into the city .
KJ21	Revelation	22	15	For outside are dogs and sorcerers , and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters , and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie .
KJ21	Revelation	22	16	“ I , Jesus , have sent Mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches . I am the Root and the Offspring of David , and the Bright and Morning Star. ”
KJ21	Revelation	22	17	And the Spirit and the bride say , “ Come. ” And let him that heareth say , “ Come. ” And let him that is athirst come ; and whosoever will , let him take the Water of Life freely .
KJ21	Revelation	22	18	For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book : If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book .
KJ21	Revelation	22	19	And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life and out of the Holy City , and from the things which are written in this book .
KJ21	Revelation	22	20	He that testifieth these things saith , “ Surely I come quickly. ” Amen . Even so , come , Lord Jesus .
KJ21	Revelation	22	21	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
