NKJV	Genesis	1	1	In the ( B ) beginning ( C ) God created the heavens and the earth .
NKJV	Genesis	1	2	The earth was ( D ) without form , and void ; and darkness [ a ] was on the face of the deep . ( E ) And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters .
NKJV	Genesis	1	3	( F ) Then God said , ( G ) “ Let there be ( H ) light ” ; and there was light .
NKJV	Genesis	1	4	And God saw the light , that it was good ; and God divided the light from the darkness .
NKJV	Genesis	1	5	God called the light Day , and the ( I ) darkness He called Night . [ b ] So the evening and the morning were the first day .
NKJV	Genesis	1	6	Then God said , ( J ) “ Let there be a [ c ] firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters. ”
NKJV	Genesis	1	7	Thus God made the firmament , ( K ) and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were ( L ) above the firmament ; and it was so .
NKJV	Genesis	1	8	And God called the firmament Heaven . So the evening and the morning were the second day .
NKJV	Genesis	1	9	Then God said , ( M ) “ Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place , and ( N ) let the dry land appear ” ; and it was so .
NKJV	Genesis	1	10	And God called the dry land Earth , and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas . And God saw that it was good .
NKJV	Genesis	1	11	Then God said , “ Let the earth ( O ) bring forth grass , the herb that yields seed , and the ( P ) fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind , whose seed is in itself , on the earth ” ; and it was so .
NKJV	Genesis	1	12	And the earth brought forth grass , the herb that yields seed according to its kind , and the tree that yields fruit , whose seed is in itself according to its kind . And God saw that it was good .
NKJV	Genesis	1	13	So the evening and the morning were the third day .
NKJV	Genesis	1	14	Then God said , “ Let there be ( Q ) lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs and ( R ) seasons , and for days and years ;
NKJV	Genesis	1	15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth ” ; and it was so .
NKJV	Genesis	1	16	Then God made two great [ d ] lights : the ( S ) greater light to rule the day , and the ( T ) lesser light to rule the night . He made ( U ) the stars also .
NKJV	Genesis	1	17	God set them in the firmament of the ( V ) heavens to give light on the earth ,
NKJV	Genesis	1	18	and to ( W ) rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness . And God saw that it was good .
NKJV	Genesis	1	19	So the evening and the morning were the fourth day .
NKJV	Genesis	1	20	Then God said , “ Let the waters abound with an abundance of living [ e ] creatures , and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the [ f ] firmament of the heavens. ”
NKJV	Genesis	1	21	So ( X ) God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves , with which the waters abounded , according to their kind , and every winged bird according to its kind . And God saw that it was good .
NKJV	Genesis	1	22	And God blessed them , saying , ( Y ) “ Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let birds multiply on the earth. ”
NKJV	Genesis	1	23	So the evening and the morning were the fifth day .
NKJV	Genesis	1	24	Then God said , “ Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind : cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth , each according to its kind ” ; and it was so .
NKJV	Genesis	1	25	And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind , cattle according to its kind , and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind . And God saw that it was good .
NKJV	Genesis	1	26	Then God said , ( Z ) “ Let Us make man in Our image , according to Our likeness ; ( AA ) let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , over the birds of the air , and over the cattle , over [ g ] all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. ”
NKJV	Genesis	1	27	So God created man ( AB ) in His own image ; in the image of God He created him ; ( AC ) male and female He created them .
NKJV	Genesis	1	28	Then God blessed them , and God said to them , ( AD ) “ Be fruitful and multiply ; fill the earth and ( AE ) subdue it ; have dominion over the fish of the sea , over the birds of the air , and over every living thing that [ h ] moves on the earth. ”
NKJV	Genesis	1	29	And God said , “ See , I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth , and every tree whose fruit yields seed ; ( AF ) to you it shall be for food .
NKJV	Genesis	1	30	Also , to ( AG ) every beast of the earth , to every ( AH ) bird of the air , and to everything that creeps on the earth , in which there is [ i ] life , I have given every green herb for food ” ; and it was so .
NKJV	Genesis	1	31	Then ( AI ) God saw everything that He had made , and indeed it was very good . So the evening and the morning were the sixth day .

NKJV	Genesis	2	2	( B ) And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done , and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done .
NKJV	Genesis	2	3	Then God ( C ) blessed the seventh day and sanctified it , because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made .
NKJV	Genesis	2	4	( D ) This is the [ a ] history of the heavens and the earth when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens ,
NKJV	Genesis	2	5	before any ( E ) plant of the field was in the earth and before any herb of the field had grown . For the Lord God had not ( F ) caused it to rain on the earth , and there was no man ( G ) to till the ground ;
NKJV	Genesis	2	6	but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground .
NKJV	Genesis	2	7	And the Lord God formed man of the ( H ) dust of the ground , and ( I ) breathed into his ( J ) nostrils the breath of life ; and ( K ) man became a living being . Life in God ’ s Garden
NKJV	Genesis	2	8	The Lord God planted ( L ) a garden ( M ) eastward in ( N ) Eden , and there He put the man whom He had formed .
NKJV	Genesis	2	9	And out of the ground the Lord God made ( O ) every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food . ( P ) The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of the knowledge of good and ( Q ) evil .
NKJV	Genesis	2	10	Now a river went out of Eden to water the garden , and from there it parted and became four riverheads .
NKJV	Genesis	2	11	The name of the first is Pishon ; it is the one which skirts ( R ) the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold .
NKJV	Genesis	2	12	And the gold of that land is good . ( S ) Bdellium and the onyx stone are there .
NKJV	Genesis	2	13	The name of the second river is Gihon ; it is the one which goes around the whole land of Cush .
NKJV	Genesis	2	14	The name of the third river is ( T ) Hiddekel ; [ b ] it is the one which goes toward the east of [ c ] Assyria . The fourth river is the Euphrates .
NKJV	Genesis	2	15	Then the Lord God took [ d ] the man and put him in the garden of Eden to [ e ] tend and keep it .
NKJV	Genesis	2	16	And the Lord God commanded the man , saying , “ Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat ;
NKJV	Genesis	2	17	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ( U ) you shall not eat , for in the day that you eat of it ( V ) you [ f ] shall surely ( W ) die. ”
NKJV	Genesis	2	18	And the Lord God said , “ It is not good that man should be alone ; ( X ) I will make him a helper comparable to him. ”
NKJV	Genesis	2	19	( Y ) Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air , and ( Z ) brought them to [ g ] Adam to see what he would call them . And whatever Adam called each living creature , that was its name .
NKJV	Genesis	2	20	So Adam gave names to all cattle , to the birds of the air , and to every beast of the field . But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him .
NKJV	Genesis	2	21	And the Lord God caused a ( AA ) deep sleep to fall on Adam , and he slept ; and He took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh in its place .
NKJV	Genesis	2	22	Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He [ h ] made into a woman , ( AB ) and He ( AC ) brought her to the man .
NKJV	Genesis	2	23	And Adam said : “ This is now ( AD ) bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh ; She shall be called [ i ] Woman , Because she was ( AE ) taken out of [ j ] Man. ”
NKJV	Genesis	2	24	( AF ) Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and ( AG ) be [ k ] joined to his wife , and they shall become one flesh .
NKJV	Genesis	2	25	( AH ) And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ( AI ) ashamed .

NKJV	Genesis	3	3	but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God has said , ‘ You shall not eat it , nor shall you ( E ) touch it , lest you die. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	3	2	And the woman said to the serpent , “ We may eat the ( D ) fruit of the trees of the garden ;
NKJV	Genesis	3	4	( F ) Then the serpent said to the woman , “ You will not surely die .
NKJV	Genesis	3	5	For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened , and you will be like God , knowing good and evil. ”
NKJV	Genesis	3	6	So when the woman ( G ) saw that the tree was good for food , that it was [ a ] pleasant to the eyes , and a tree desirable to make one wise , she took of its fruit ( H ) and ate . She also gave to her husband with her , and he ate .
NKJV	Genesis	3	7	Then the eyes of both of them were opened , ( I ) and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves [ b ] coverings .
NKJV	Genesis	3	8	And they heard ( J ) the [ c ] sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the [ d ] cool of the day , and Adam and his wife ( K ) hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden .
NKJV	Genesis	3	9	Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him , “ Where are you ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	3	10	So he said , “ I heard Your voice in the garden , ( L ) and I was afraid because I was naked ; and I hid myself. ”
NKJV	Genesis	3	11	And He said , “ Who told you that you were naked ? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	3	12	Then the man said , ( M ) “ The woman whom You gave to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I ate. ”
NKJV	Genesis	3	13	And the Lord God said to the woman , “ What is this you have done ? ” The woman said , ( N ) “ The serpent deceived me , and I ate. ”
NKJV	Genesis	3	14	So the Lord God said to the serpent : “ Because you have done this , You are cursed more than all cattle , And more than every beast of the field ; On your belly you shall go , And ( O ) you shall eat dust All the days of your life .
NKJV	Genesis	3	15	And I will put enmity Between you and the woman , And between ( P ) your seed and ( Q ) her Seed ; ( R ) He shall bruise your head , And you shall bruise His heel. ”
NKJV	Genesis	3	16	To the woman He said : “ I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception ; ( S ) In pain you shall bring forth children ; ( T ) Your desire shall be [ e ] for your husband , And he shall ( U ) rule over you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	3	17	Then to Adam He said , ( V ) “ Because you have heeded the voice of your wife , and have eaten from the tree ( W ) of which I commanded you , saying , ‘ You shall not eat of it ’ : ( X ) “ Cursed is the ground for your sake ; ( Y ) In toil you shall eat of it All the days of your life .
NKJV	Genesis	3	18	Both thorns and thistles it shall [ f ] bring forth for you , And ( Z ) you shall eat the herb of the field .
NKJV	Genesis	3	19	( AA ) In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread Till you return to the ground , For out of it you were taken ; ( AB ) For dust you are , And ( AC ) to dust you shall return. ”
NKJV	Genesis	3	20	And Adam called his wife ’ s name ( AD ) Eve , [ g ] because she was the mother of all living .
NKJV	Genesis	3	21	Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made tunics of skin , and clothed them .
NKJV	Genesis	3	22	Then the Lord God said , “ Behold , the man has become like one of Us , to know good and evil . And now , lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live forever ” —
NKJV	Genesis	3	23	therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden ( AE ) to till the ground from which he was taken .
NKJV	Genesis	3	24	So ( AF ) He drove out the man ; and He placed ( AG ) cherubim ( AH ) at the east of the garden of Eden , and a flaming sword which turned every way , to guard the way to the tree of ( AI ) life .

NKJV	Genesis	4	4	Abel also brought of ( D ) the firstborn of his flock and of ( E ) their fat . And the Lord ( F ) respected Abel and his offering ,
NKJV	Genesis	4	2	Then she bore again , this time his brother [ b ] Abel . Now ( B ) Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
NKJV	Genesis	4	3	And [ c ] in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit ( C ) of the ground to the Lord .
NKJV	Genesis	4	5	but He did not respect Cain and his offering . And Cain was very angry , and his countenance fell .
NKJV	Genesis	4	6	So the Lord said to Cain , “ Why are you angry ? And why has your countenance fallen ?
NKJV	Genesis	4	7	If you do well , will you not be accepted ? And if you do not do well , sin lies at the door . And its desire is [ d ] for you , but you should rule over it. ”
NKJV	Genesis	4	8	Now Cain [ e ] talked with Abel his [ f ] brother ; and it came to pass , when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and ( G ) killed him .
NKJV	Genesis	4	9	Then the Lord said to Cain , “ Where is Abel your brother ? ” He said , ( H ) “ I do not know . Am I ( I ) my brother ’ s keeper ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	4	10	And He said , “ What have you done ? The voice of your brother ’ s blood ( J ) cries out to Me from the ground .
NKJV	Genesis	4	11	So now ( K ) you are cursed from the earth , which has opened its mouth to receive your brother ’ s blood from your hand .
NKJV	Genesis	4	12	When you till the ground , it shall no longer yield its strength to you . A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth. ”
NKJV	Genesis	4	13	And Cain said to the Lord , “ My [ g ] punishment is greater than I can bear !
NKJV	Genesis	4	14	Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground ; ( L ) I shall be ( M ) hidden from Your face ; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth , and it will happen that ( N ) anyone who finds me will kill me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	4	15	And the Lord said to him , [ h ] “ Therefore , whoever kills Cain , vengeance shall be taken on him ( O ) sevenfold. ” And the Lord set a ( P ) mark on Cain , lest anyone finding him should kill him . The Family of Cain
NKJV	Genesis	4	16	Then Cain ( Q ) went out from the ( R ) presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of [ i ] Nod on the east of Eden .
NKJV	Genesis	4	17	And Cain knew his wife , and she conceived and bore Enoch . And he built a city , ( S ) and called the name of the city after the name of his son—Enoch .
NKJV	Genesis	4	18	To Enoch was born Irad ; and Irad begot Mehujael , and Mehujael begot Methushael , and Methushael begot Lamech .
NKJV	Genesis	4	19	Then Lamech took for himself ( T ) two wives : the name of one was Adah , and the name of the second was Zillah .
NKJV	Genesis	4	20	And Adah bore Jabal . He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock .
NKJV	Genesis	4	21	His brother ’ s name was Jubal . He was the father of all those who play the harp and [ j ] flute .
NKJV	Genesis	4	22	And as for Zillah , she also bore Tubal-Cain , an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron . And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah .
NKJV	Genesis	4	23	Then Lamech said to his wives : “ Adah and Zillah , hear my voice ; Wives of Lamech , listen to my speech ! For I have [ k ] killed a man for wounding me , Even a young man [ l ] for hurting me .
NKJV	Genesis	4	24	( U ) If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold , Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold. ” A New Son
NKJV	Genesis	4	25	And Adam knew his wife again , and she bore a son and ( V ) named him [ m ] Seth , “ For God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel , whom Cain killed. ”
NKJV	Genesis	4	26	And as for Seth , ( W ) to him also a son was born ; and he named him [ n ] Enosh . Then men began ( X ) to call on the name of the Lord . Footnotes - Genesis 4:1 Lit .

NKJV	Genesis	8	11	Then the dove came to him in the evening , and behold , a freshly plucked olive leaf was in her mouth ; and Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth .

NKJV	Genesis	14	16	So he ( Y ) brought back all the goods , and also brought back his brother Lot and his goods , as well as the women and the people .
NKJV	Genesis	14	17	And the king of Sodom ( Z ) went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh ( that is , the ( AA ) King ’ s Valley ) , ( AB ) after his return from the [ e ] defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him . Abram and Melchizedek ( AC )
NKJV	Genesis	14	18	Then ( AD ) Melchizedek king of Salem brought out ( AE ) bread and wine ; he was ( AF ) the priest of ( AG ) God Most High .
NKJV	Genesis	14	19	And he blessed him and said : ( AH ) “ Blessed be Abram of God Most High , ( AI ) Possessor of heaven and earth ;
NKJV	Genesis	14	20	And ( AJ ) blessed be God Most High , Who has delivered your enemies into your hand. ” And he ( AK ) gave him [ f ] a tithe of all .
NKJV	Genesis	14	21	Now the king of Sodom said to Abram , “ Give me the [ g ] persons , and take the goods for yourself. ”
NKJV	Genesis	14	22	But Abram ( AL ) said to the king of Sodom , “ I ( AM ) have raised my hand to the Lord , God Most High , ( AN ) the Possessor of heaven and earth ,

NKJV	Genesis	15	15	Now as for you , ( AA ) you shall [ d ] go ( AB ) to your fathers in peace ; ( AC ) you shall be buried at a good old age .
NKJV	Genesis	15	2	( F ) But Abram said , “ Lord God , what will You give me , ( G ) seeing I [ b ] go childless , and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	15	3	Then Abram said , “ Look , You have given me no offspring ; indeed ( H ) one [ c ] born in my house is my heir ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	15	4	And behold , the word of the Lord came to him , saying , “ This one shall not be your heir , but one who ( I ) will come from your own body shall be your heir. ”
NKJV	Genesis	15	5	Then He brought him outside and said , “ Look now toward heaven , and ( J ) count the ( K ) stars if you are able to number them. ” And He said to him , ( L ) “ So shall your ( M ) descendants be. ”
NKJV	Genesis	15	6	And he ( N ) believed in the Lord , and He ( O ) accounted it to him for righteousness .
NKJV	Genesis	15	7	Then He said to him , “ I am the Lord , who ( P ) brought you out of ( Q ) Ur of the Chaldeans , ( R ) to give you this land to inherit it. ”
NKJV	Genesis	15	8	And he said , “ Lord God , ( S ) how shall I know that I will inherit it ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	15	9	So He said to him , “ Bring Me a three-year-old heifer , a three-year-old female goat , a three-year-old ram , a turtledove , and a young pigeon. ”
NKJV	Genesis	15	10	Then he brought all these to Him and ( T ) cut them in two , down the middle , and placed each piece opposite the other ; but he did not cut ( U ) the birds in two .
NKJV	Genesis	15	11	And when the vultures came down on the carcasses , Abram drove them away .
NKJV	Genesis	15	12	Now when the sun was going down , ( V ) a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and behold , horror and great darkness fell upon him .
NKJV	Genesis	15	13	Then He said to Abram : “ Know certainly ( W ) that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs , and will serve them , and ( X ) they will afflict them four hundred years .
NKJV	Genesis	15	14	And also the nation whom they serve ( Y ) I will judge ; afterward ( Z ) they shall come out with great possessions .
NKJV	Genesis	15	16	But ( AD ) in the fourth generation they shall return here , for the iniquity ( AE ) of the Amorites ( AF ) is not yet complete. ”

NKJV	Genesis	16	2	( D ) So Sarai said to Abram , “ See now , the Lord ( E ) has restrained me from bearing children . Please , ( F ) go in to my maid ; perhaps I shall [ a ] obtain children by her. ” And Abram ( G ) heeded the voice of Sarai .
NKJV	Genesis	16	3	Then Sarai , Abram ’ s wife , took Hagar her maid , the Egyptian , and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife , after Abram ( H ) had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan .
NKJV	Genesis	16	4	So he went in to Hagar , and she conceived . And when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress became ( I ) despised in her [ b ] eyes .
NKJV	Genesis	16	5	Then Sarai said to Abram , [ c ] “ My wrong be upon you ! I gave my maid into your embrace ; and when she saw that she had conceived , I became despised in her eyes . ( J ) The Lord judge between you and me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	16	6	( K ) So Abram said to Sarai , “ Indeed your maid is in your hand ; do to her as you please. ” And when Sarai dealt harshly with her , ( L ) she fled from her presence .
NKJV	Genesis	16	7	Now the ( M ) Angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness , ( N ) by the spring on the way to ( O ) Shur .
NKJV	Genesis	16	8	And He said , “ Hagar , Sarai ’ s maid , where have you come from , and where are you going ? ” She said , “ I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai. ”
NKJV	Genesis	16	9	The Angel of the Lord said to her , “ Return to your mistress , and ( P ) submit yourself under her hand. ”
NKJV	Genesis	16	10	Then the Angel of the Lord said to her , ( Q ) “ I will multiply your descendants exceedingly , so that they shall not be counted for multitude. ”
NKJV	Genesis	16	11	And the Angel of the Lord said to her : “ Behold , you are with child , ( R ) And you shall bear a son . You shall call his name [ d ] Ishmael , Because the Lord has heard your affliction .
NKJV	Genesis	16	12	( S ) He shall be a wild man ; His hand shall be against every man , And every man ’ s hand against him . ( T ) And he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. ”
NKJV	Genesis	16	13	Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her , You-Are- [ e ] the-God-Who-Sees ; for she said , “ Have I also here [ f ] seen Him ( U ) who sees me ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	16	14	Therefore the well was called ( V ) Beer Lahai Roi ; [ g ] observe , it is ( W ) between Kadesh and Bered .
NKJV	Genesis	16	15	So ( X ) Hagar bore Abram a son ; and Abram named his son , whom Hagar bore , Ishmael .

NKJV	Genesis	17	17	Then Abraham fell on his face ( AA ) and laughed , and said in his heart , “ Shall a child be born to a man who is one hundred years old ? And shall Sarah , who is ninety years old , bear a child ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	17	2	And I will make My ( F ) covenant between Me and you , and ( G ) will multiply you exceedingly. ”
NKJV	Genesis	17	3	Then Abram fell on his face , and God talked with him , saying :
NKJV	Genesis	17	4	“ As for Me , behold , My covenant is with you , and you shall be ( H ) a father of [ b ] many nations .
NKJV	Genesis	17	5	No longer shall ( I ) your name be called [ c ] Abram , but your name shall be [ d ] Abraham ; ( J ) for I have made you a father of [ e ] many nations .
NKJV	Genesis	17	6	I will make you exceedingly fruitful ; and I will make ( K ) nations of you , and ( L ) kings shall come from you .
NKJV	Genesis	17	7	And I will ( M ) establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations , for an everlasting covenant , ( N ) to be God to you and ( O ) your descendants after you .
NKJV	Genesis	17	8	Also ( P ) I give to you and your descendants after you the land ( Q ) in [ f ] which you are a stranger , all the land of Canaan , as an everlasting possession ; and ( R ) I will be their God. ”
NKJV	Genesis	17	9	And God said to Abraham : “ As for you , ( S ) you shall keep My covenant , you and your descendants after you throughout their generations .
NKJV	Genesis	17	10	This is My covenant which you shall keep , between Me and you and your descendants after you : ( T ) Every male child among you shall be circumcised ;
NKJV	Genesis	17	11	and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins , and it shall be ( U ) a sign of the covenant between Me and you .
NKJV	Genesis	17	12	He who is eight days old among you ( V ) shall be circumcised , every male child in your generations , he who is born in your house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not your descendant .
NKJV	Genesis	17	13	He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised , and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
NKJV	Genesis	17	14	And the uncircumcised male child , who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin , that person ( W ) shall be cut off from his people ; he has broken My covenant. ”
NKJV	Genesis	17	15	Then God said to Abraham , “ As for Sarai your wife , you shall not call her name Sarai , but [ g ] Sarah shall be her name .
NKJV	Genesis	17	16	And I will bless her ( X ) and also give you a son by her ; then I will bless her , and she shall be a mother ( Y ) of nations ; ( Z ) kings of peoples shall be from her. ”
NKJV	Genesis	17	18	And Abraham ( AB ) said to God , “ Oh , that Ishmael might live before You ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	17	19	Then God said : “ No , ( AC ) Sarah your wife shall bear you a son , and you shall call his name Isaac ; I will establish My ( AD ) covenant with him for an everlasting covenant , and with his descendants after him .
NKJV	Genesis	17	20	And as for Ishmael , I have heard you . Behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and ( AE ) will multiply him exceedingly . He shall beget ( AF ) twelve princes , ( AG ) and I will make him a great nation .
NKJV	Genesis	17	21	But My ( AH ) covenant I will establish with Isaac , ( AI ) whom Sarah shall bear to you at this ( AJ ) set time next year. ”
NKJV	Genesis	17	22	Then He finished talking with him , and God went up from Abraham .
NKJV	Genesis	17	23	So Abraham took Ishmael his son , all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham ’ s house , and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very same day , as God had said to him .
NKJV	Genesis	17	24	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
NKJV	Genesis	17	25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
NKJV	Genesis	17	26	That very same day Abraham was circumcised , and his son Ishmael ;

NKJV	Genesis	18	18	since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth shall be ( V ) blessed in him ?
NKJV	Genesis	18	2	( C ) So he lifted his eyes and looked , and behold , three men were standing by him ; ( D ) and when he saw them , he ran from the tent door to meet them , and bowed himself to the ground ,
NKJV	Genesis	18	3	and said , “ My Lord , if I have now found favor in Your sight , do not pass on by Your servant .
NKJV	Genesis	18	4	Please let ( E ) a little water be brought , and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree .
NKJV	Genesis	18	5	And ( F ) I will bring a morsel of bread , that ( G ) you may refresh your hearts . After that you may pass by , ( H ) inasmuch as you have come to your servant. ” They said , “ Do as you have said. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	6	So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said , “ Quickly , make ready three measures of fine meal ; knead it and make cakes. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	7	And Abraham ran to the herd , took a tender and good calf , gave it to a young man , and he hastened to prepare it .
NKJV	Genesis	18	8	So ( I ) he took butter and milk and the calf which he had prepared , and set it before them ; and he stood by them under the tree as they ate .
NKJV	Genesis	18	9	Then they said to him , “ Where is Sarah your wife ? ” So he said , “ Here , ( J ) in the tent. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	10	And He said , “ I will certainly return to you ( K ) according to the time of life , and behold , ( L ) Sarah your wife shall have a son. ” ( Sarah was listening in the tent door which was behind him . )
NKJV	Genesis	18	11	Now ( M ) Abraham and Sarah were old , well advanced in age ; and [ b ] Sarah ( N ) had passed the age of childbearing .
NKJV	Genesis	18	12	Therefore Sarah ( O ) laughed within herself , saying , ( P ) “ After I have grown old , shall I have pleasure , my ( Q ) lord being old also ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	13	And the Lord said to Abraham , “ Why did Sarah laugh , saying , ‘ Shall I surely bear a child , since I am old ? ’
NKJV	Genesis	18	14	( R ) Is anything too hard for the Lord ? ( S ) At the appointed time I will return to you , according to the time of life , and Sarah shall have a son. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	15	But Sarah denied it , saying , “ I did not laugh , ” for she was afraid . And He said , “ No , but you did laugh ! ” Abraham Intercedes for Sodom
NKJV	Genesis	18	16	Then the men rose from there and looked toward Sodom , and Abraham went with them ( T ) to send them on the way .
NKJV	Genesis	18	17	And the Lord said , ( U ) “ Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing ,
NKJV	Genesis	18	19	For I have known him , in order ( W ) that he may command his children and his household after him , that they keep the way of the Lord , to do righteousness and justice , that the Lord may bring to Abraham what He has spoken to him. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	20	And the Lord said , “ Because ( X ) the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great , and because their ( Y ) sin is very grave ,
NKJV	Genesis	18	21	( Z ) I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me ; and if not , ( AA ) I will know. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	22	Then the men turned away from there ( AB ) and went toward Sodom , but Abraham still stood before the Lord .
NKJV	Genesis	18	23	And Abraham ( AC ) came near and said , ( AD ) “ Would You also ( AE ) destroy the ( AF ) righteous with the wicked ?
NKJV	Genesis	18	24	Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city ; would You also destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous that were in it ?
NKJV	Genesis	18	25	Far be it from You to do such a thing as this , to slay the righteous with the wicked , so ( AG ) that the righteous should be as the wicked ; far be it from You ! ( AH ) Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	26	So the Lord said , ( AI ) “ If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their sakes. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	27	Then Abraham answered and said , “ Indeed now , I who am ( AJ ) but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord :
NKJV	Genesis	18	28	Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous ; would You destroy all of the city for lack of five ? ” So He said , “ If I find there forty-five , I will not destroy it. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	29	And he spoke to Him yet again and said , “ Suppose there should be forty found there ? ” So He said , “ I will not do it for the sake of forty. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	30	Then he said , “ Let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak : Suppose thirty should be found there ? ” So He said , “ I will not do it if I find thirty there. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	31	And he said , “ Indeed now , I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord : Suppose twenty should be found there ? ” So He said , “ I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	32	Then he said , ( AK ) “ Let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak but once more : Suppose ten should be found there ? ” ( AL ) And He said , “ I will not destroy it for the sake of ten. ”
NKJV	Genesis	18	33	So the Lord went His way as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham ; and Abraham returned to his place . Footnotes - Genesis 18:1 Heb .

NKJV	Genesis	19	19	Indeed now , your servant has found favor in your sight , and you have increased your mercy which you have shown me by saving my life ; but I can not escape to the mountains , lest some evil overtake me and I die .
NKJV	Genesis	19	2	And he said , “ Here now , my lords , please ( C ) turn in to your servant ’ s house and spend the night , and ( D ) wash your feet ; then you may rise early and go on your way. ” And they said , ( E ) “ No , but we will spend the night in the open square. ”
NKJV	Genesis	19	3	But he insisted strongly ; so they turned in to him and entered his house . ( F ) Then he made them a feast , and baked ( G ) unleavened bread , and they ate .
NKJV	Genesis	19	4	Now before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of Sodom , both old and young , all the people from every quarter , surrounded the house .
NKJV	Genesis	19	5	( H ) And they called to Lot and said to him , “ Where are the men who came to you tonight ? ( I ) Bring them out to us that we ( J ) may know them carnally. ”
NKJV	Genesis	19	6	So ( K ) Lot went out to them through the doorway , shut the door behind him ,
NKJV	Genesis	19	7	and said , “ Please , my brethren , do not do so wickedly !
NKJV	Genesis	19	8	( L ) See now , I have two daughters who have not known a man ; please , let me bring them out to you , and you may do to them as you wish ; only do nothing to these men , ( M ) since this is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof. ”
NKJV	Genesis	19	9	And they said , “ Stand back ! ” Then they said , “ This one ( N ) came in to [ a ] stay here , ( O ) and he keeps acting as a judge ; now we will deal worse with you than with them. ” So they pressed hard against the man Lot , and came near to break down the door .
NKJV	Genesis	19	10	But the men reached out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them , and shut the door .
NKJV	Genesis	19	11	And they ( P ) struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness , both small and great , so that they became weary trying to find the door . Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed ( Q )
NKJV	Genesis	19	12	Then the men said to Lot , “ Have you anyone else here ? Son-in-law , your sons , your daughters , and whomever you have in the city— ( R ) take them out of this place !
NKJV	Genesis	19	13	For we will destroy this place , because the ( S ) outcry against them has grown great before the face of the Lord , and ( T ) the Lord has sent us to destroy it. ”
NKJV	Genesis	19	14	So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law , ( U ) who had married his daughters , and said , ( V ) “ Get up , get out of this place ; for the Lord will destroy this city ! ” ( W ) But to his sons-in-law he seemed to be joking .
NKJV	Genesis	19	15	When the morning dawned , the angels urged Lot to hurry , saying , ( X ) “ Arise , take your wife and your two daughters who are here , lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city. ”
NKJV	Genesis	19	16	And while he lingered , the men ( Y ) took hold of his hand , his wife ’ s hand , and the hands of his two daughters , the ( Z ) Lord being merciful to him , ( AA ) and they brought him out and set him outside the city .
NKJV	Genesis	19	17	So it came to pass , when they had brought them outside , that [ b ] he said , ( AB ) “ Escape for your life ! ( AC ) Do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain . Escape ( AD ) to the mountains , lest you be [ c ] destroyed. ”
NKJV	Genesis	19	18	Then Lot said to them , “ Please , ( AE ) no , my lords !
NKJV	Genesis	19	20	See now , this city is near enough to flee to , and it is a little one ; please let me escape there ( is it not a little one ? ) and my soul shall live. ”
NKJV	Genesis	19	21	And he said to him , “ See , ( AF ) I have favored you concerning this thing also , in that I will not overthrow this city for which you have spoken .
NKJV	Genesis	19	22	Hurry , escape there . For ( AG ) I can not do anything until you arrive there. ” Therefore ( AH ) the name of the city was called [ d ] Zoar .
NKJV	Genesis	19	23	The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar .
NKJV	Genesis	19	24	Then the Lord rained ( AI ) brimstone and ( AJ ) fire on Sodom and Gomorrah , from the Lord out of the heavens .
NKJV	Genesis	19	25	So He [ e ] overthrew those cities , all the plain , all the inhabitants of the cities , and ( AK ) what grew on the ground .
NKJV	Genesis	19	26	But his wife looked back behind him , and she became ( AL ) a pillar of salt .
NKJV	Genesis	19	27	And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where ( AM ) he had stood before the Lord .
NKJV	Genesis	19	28	Then he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain ; and he saw , and behold , ( AN ) the smoke of the land which went up like the smoke of a furnace .
NKJV	Genesis	19	29	And it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God ( AO ) remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt . The Descendants of Lot
NKJV	Genesis	19	30	Then Lot went up out of Zoar and ( AP ) dwelt in the mountains , and his two daughters were with him ; for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar . And he and his two daughters dwelt in a cave .
NKJV	Genesis	19	31	Now the firstborn said to the younger , “ Our father is old , and there is no man on the earth ( AQ ) to come in to us as is the custom of all the earth .
NKJV	Genesis	19	32	Come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we ( AR ) may preserve the [ f ] lineage of our father. ”
NKJV	Genesis	19	33	So they made their father drink wine that night . And the firstborn went in and lay with her father , and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose .
NKJV	Genesis	19	34	It happened on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger , “ Indeed I lay with my father last night ; let us make him drink wine tonight also , and you go in and lie with him , that we may preserve the [ g ] lineage of our father. ”
NKJV	Genesis	19	35	Then they made their father drink wine that night also . And the younger arose and lay with him , and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose .
NKJV	Genesis	19	36	Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father .
NKJV	Genesis	19	37	The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab ; ( AS ) he is the father of the Moabites to this day .
NKJV	Genesis	19	38	And the younger , she also bore a son and called his name Ben-Ammi ; ( AT ) he is the father of the people of Ammon to this day .

NKJV	Genesis	20	20	And Abraham journeyed from ( A ) there to the South , and dwelt between ( B ) Kadesh and Shur , and ( C ) stayed in Gerar .
NKJV	Genesis	20	2	Now Abraham said of Sarah his wife , ( D ) “ She is my sister. ” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and ( E ) took Sarah .
NKJV	Genesis	20	3	But ( F ) God came to Abimelech ( G ) in a dream by night , and said to him , ( H ) “ Indeed you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken , for she is [ a ] a man ’ s wife. ”
NKJV	Genesis	20	4	But Abimelech had not come near her ; and he said , “ Lord , ( I ) will You slay a righteous nation also ?
NKJV	Genesis	20	5	Did he not say to me , ‘ She is my sister ’ ? And she , even she herself said , ‘ He is my brother. ’ ( J ) In the [ b ] integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this. ”
NKJV	Genesis	20	6	And God said to him in a dream , “ Yes , I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart . For ( K ) I also withheld you from sinning ( L ) against Me ; therefore I did not let you touch her .
NKJV	Genesis	20	7	Now therefore , restore the man ’ s wife ; ( M ) for he is a prophet , and he will pray for you and you shall live . But if you do not restore her , ( N ) know that you shall surely die , you ( O ) and all who are yours. ”
NKJV	Genesis	20	8	So Abimelech rose early in the morning , called all his servants , and told all these things in their hearing ; and the men were very much afraid .
NKJV	Genesis	20	9	And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him , “ What have you done to us ? How have I [ c ] offended you , ( P ) that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin ? You have done deeds to me ( Q ) that ought not to be done. ”
NKJV	Genesis	20	10	Then Abimelech said to Abraham , “ What did you have in view , that you have done this thing ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	20	11	And Abraham said , “ Because I thought , surely ( R ) the fear of God is not in this place ; and ( S ) they will kill me on account of my wife .
NKJV	Genesis	20	12	But indeed ( T ) she is truly my sister . She is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
NKJV	Genesis	20	13	And it came to pass , when ( U ) God caused me to wander from my father ’ s house , that I said to her , ‘ This is your kindness that you should do for me : in every place , wherever we go , ( V ) say of me , “ He is my brother. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	20	14	Then Abimelech ( W ) took sheep , oxen , and male and female servants , and gave them to Abraham ; and he restored Sarah his wife to him .
NKJV	Genesis	20	15	And Abimelech said , “ See , ( X ) my land is before you ; dwell where it pleases you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	20	16	Then to Sarah he said , “ Behold , I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver ; ( Y ) indeed this [ d ] vindicates you ( Z ) before all who are with you and before everybody. ” Thus she was [ e ] rebuked .
NKJV	Genesis	20	17	So Abraham ( AA ) prayed to God ; and God ( AB ) healed Abimelech , his wife , and his female servants . Then they bore children ;
NKJV	Genesis	20	18	for the Lord ( AC ) had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah , Abraham ’ s wife .

NKJV	Genesis	21	21	He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran ; and his mother ( AA ) took a wife for him from the land of Egypt . A Covenant with Abimelech
NKJV	Genesis	21	2	For Sarah ( D ) conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age , ( E ) at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
NKJV	Genesis	21	3	And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him—whom Sarah bore to him— ( F ) Isaac . [ a ]
NKJV	Genesis	21	4	Then Abraham ( G ) circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old , ( H ) as God had commanded him .
NKJV	Genesis	21	5	Now ( I ) Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him .
NKJV	Genesis	21	6	And Sarah said , ( J ) “ God has [ b ] made me laugh , and all who hear ( K ) will laugh with me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	21	7	She also said , “ Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children ? ( L ) For I have borne him a son in his old age. ” Hagar and Ishmael Depart ( M )
NKJV	Genesis	21	8	So the child grew and was weaned . And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned .
NKJV	Genesis	21	9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar ( N ) the Egyptian , whom she had borne to Abraham , ( O ) scoffing . [ c ]
NKJV	Genesis	21	10	Therefore she said to Abraham , ( P ) “ Cast out this bondwoman and her son ; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , namely with Isaac. ”
NKJV	Genesis	21	11	And the matter was very [ d ] displeasing in Abraham ’ s sight ( Q ) because of his son .
NKJV	Genesis	21	12	But God said to Abraham , “ Do not let it be displeasing in your sight because of the lad or because of your bondwoman . Whatever Sarah has said to you , listen to her voice ; for ( R ) in Isaac your seed shall be called .
NKJV	Genesis	21	13	Yet I will also make ( S ) a nation of the son of the bondwoman , because he is your [ e ] seed. ”
NKJV	Genesis	21	14	So Abraham rose early in the morning , and took bread and [ f ] a skin of water ; and putting it on her shoulder , he gave it and the boy to Hagar , and ( T ) sent her away . Then she departed and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba .
NKJV	Genesis	21	15	And the water in the skin was used up , and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs .
NKJV	Genesis	21	16	Then she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot ; for she said to herself , “ Let me not see the death of the boy. ” So she sat opposite him , and lifted her voice and wept .
NKJV	Genesis	21	17	And ( U ) God heard the voice of the lad . Then the ( V ) angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven , and said to her , “ What ails you , Hagar ? Fear not , for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is .
NKJV	Genesis	21	18	Arise , lift up the lad and hold him with your hand , for ( W ) I will make him a great nation. ”
NKJV	Genesis	21	19	Then ( X ) God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water . And she went and filled the skin with water , and gave the lad a drink .
NKJV	Genesis	21	20	So God ( Y ) was with the lad ; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness , ( Z ) and became an archer .
NKJV	Genesis	21	22	And it came to pass at that time that ( AB ) Abimelech and Phichol , the commander of his army , spoke to Abraham , saying , ( AC ) “ God is with you in all that you do .
NKJV	Genesis	21	23	Now therefore , ( AD ) swear [ g ] to me by God that you will not deal falsely with me , with my offspring , or with my posterity ; but that according to the kindness that I have done to you , you will do to me and to the land in which you have dwelt. ”
NKJV	Genesis	21	24	And Abraham said , “ I will swear. ”
NKJV	Genesis	21	25	Then Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech ’ s servants ( AE ) had seized .
NKJV	Genesis	21	26	And Abimelech said , “ I do not know who has done this thing ; you did not tell me , nor had I heard of it until today. ”
NKJV	Genesis	21	27	So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech , and the two of them ( AF ) made a [ h ] covenant .
NKJV	Genesis	21	28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
NKJV	Genesis	21	29	Then Abimelech asked Abraham , ( AG ) “ What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	21	30	And he said , “ You will take these seven ewe lambs from my hand , that ( AH ) they may be my witness that I have dug this well. ”
NKJV	Genesis	21	31	Therefore he ( AI ) called that place [ i ] Beersheba , because the two of them swore an oath there .
NKJV	Genesis	21	32	Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba . So Abimelech rose with Phichol , the commander of his army , and they returned to the land of the Philistines .
NKJV	Genesis	21	33	Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba , and ( AJ ) there called on the name of the Lord , ( AK ) the Everlasting God .

NKJV	Genesis	22	22	Chesed , Hazo , Pildash , Jidlaph , and Bethuel. ”
NKJV	Genesis	22	2	Then He said , “ Take now your son , ( C ) your only son Isaac , whom you ( D ) love , and go ( E ) to the land of Moriah , and offer him there as a ( F ) burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	22	3	So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son ; and he split the wood for the burnt offering , and arose and went to the place of which God had told him .
NKJV	Genesis	22	4	Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off .
NKJV	Genesis	22	5	And Abraham said to his young men , “ Stay here with the donkey ; the [ a ] lad and I will go yonder and worship , and we will ( G ) come back to you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	22	6	So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and ( H ) laid it on Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife , and the two of them went together .
NKJV	Genesis	22	7	But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said , “ My father ! ” And he said , “ Here I am , my son. ” Then he said , “ Look , the fire and the wood , but where is the [ b ] lamb for a burnt offering ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	22	8	And Abraham said , “ My son , God will provide for Himself the ( I ) lamb for a ( J ) burnt offering. ” So the two of them went together .
NKJV	Genesis	22	9	Then they came to the place of which God had told him . And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order ; and he bound Isaac his son and ( K ) laid him on the altar , upon the wood .
NKJV	Genesis	22	10	And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son .
NKJV	Genesis	22	11	But the ( L ) Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said , “ Abraham , Abraham ! ” So he said , “ Here I am. ”
NKJV	Genesis	22	12	And He said , ( M ) “ Do not lay your hand on the lad , or do anything to him ; for ( N ) now I know that you fear God , since you have not ( O ) withheld your son , your only son , from Me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	22	13	Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked , and there behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns . So Abraham went and took the ram , and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son .
NKJV	Genesis	22	14	And Abraham called the name of the place , [ c ] The-Lord-Will-Provide ; as it is said to this day , “ In the Mount of the Lord it shall be provided. ”
NKJV	Genesis	22	15	Then the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven ,
NKJV	Genesis	22	16	and said : ( P ) “ By Myself I have sworn , says the Lord , because you have done this thing , and have not withheld your son , your only son—
NKJV	Genesis	22	17	blessing I will ( Q ) bless you , and multiplying I will multiply your descendants ( R ) as the stars of the heaven ( S ) and as the sand which is on the seashore ; and ( T ) your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies .
NKJV	Genesis	22	18	( U ) In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed , ( V ) because you have obeyed My voice. ”
NKJV	Genesis	22	19	So Abraham returned to his young men , and they rose and went together to ( W ) Beersheba ; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba . The Family of Nahor
NKJV	Genesis	22	20	Now it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham , saying , “ Indeed ( X ) Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor :
NKJV	Genesis	22	21	( Y ) Huz his firstborn , Buz his brother , Kemuel the father ( Z ) of Aram ,
NKJV	Genesis	22	23	And ( AA ) Bethuel begot [ d ] Rebekah . These eight Milcah bore to Nahor , Abraham ’ s brother .

NKJV	Genesis	23	23	Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years ; these were the years of the life of Sarah .
NKJV	Genesis	23	2	So Sarah died in ( A ) Kirjath Arba ( that is , ( B ) Hebron ) in the land of Canaan , and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her .
NKJV	Genesis	23	3	Then Abraham stood up from before his dead , and spoke to the sons of ( C ) Heth , saying ,
NKJV	Genesis	23	4	( D ) “ I am a foreigner and a visitor among you . ( E ) Give me property for a burial place among you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight. ”
NKJV	Genesis	23	5	And the sons of Heth answered Abraham , saying to him ,
NKJV	Genesis	23	6	“ Hear us , my lord : You are ( F ) a [ a ] mighty prince among us ; bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places . None of us will withhold from you his burial place , that you may bury your dead. ”
NKJV	Genesis	23	7	Then Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land , the sons of Heth .
NKJV	Genesis	23	8	And he spoke with them , saying , “ If it is your wish that I bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and [ b ] meet with Ephron the son of Zohar for me ,
NKJV	Genesis	23	9	that he may give me the cave of ( G ) Machpelah which he has , which is at the end of his field . Let him give it to me at the full price , as property for a burial place among you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	23	10	Now Ephron dwelt among the sons of Heth ; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the presence of the sons of Heth , all who ( H ) entered at the gate of his city , saying ,
NKJV	Genesis	23	11	( I ) “ No , my lord , hear me : I give you the field and the cave that is in it ; I give it to you in the presence of the sons of my people . I give it to you . Bury your dead ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	23	12	Then Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land ;
NKJV	Genesis	23	13	and he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land , saying , “ If you will give it , please hear me . I will give you money for the field ; take it from me and I will bury my dead there. ”
NKJV	Genesis	23	14	And Ephron answered Abraham , saying to him ,
NKJV	Genesis	23	15	“ My lord , listen to me ; the land is worth four hundred ( J ) shekels of silver . What is that between you and me ? So bury your dead. ”
NKJV	Genesis	23	16	And Abraham listened to Ephron ; and Abraham ( K ) weighed out the silver for Ephron which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , currency of the merchants .
NKJV	Genesis	23	17	So ( L ) the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah , which was before Mamre , the field and the cave which was in it , and all the trees that were in the field , which were within all the surrounding borders , were deeded
NKJV	Genesis	23	18	to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth , before all who went in at the gate of his city .
NKJV	Genesis	23	19	And after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah , before Mamre ( that is , Hebron ) in the land of Canaan .
NKJV	Genesis	23	20	So the field and the cave that is in it ( M ) were deeded to Abraham by the sons of Heth as property for a burial place . Footnotes - Genesis 23:6 Lit . prince of God - Genesis 23:8 entreat Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Genesis	24	24	So she said to him , ( AC ) “ I am the daughter of Bethuel , Milcah ’ s son , whom she bore to Nahor. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	2	So Abraham said ( C ) to the oldest servant of his house , who ( D ) ruled over all that he had , “ Please , ( E ) put your hand under my thigh ,
NKJV	Genesis	24	3	and I will make you ( F ) swear [ a ] by the Lord , the God of heaven and the God of the earth , that ( G ) you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I dwell ;
NKJV	Genesis	24	4	( H ) but you shall go ( I ) to my country and to my family , and take a wife for my son Isaac. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	5	And the servant said to him , “ Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land . Must I take your son back to the land from which you came ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	6	But Abraham said to him , “ Beware that you do not take my son back there .
NKJV	Genesis	24	7	The Lord God of heaven , who ( J ) took me from my father ’ s house and from the land of my family , and who spoke to me and swore to me , saying , ( K ) ‘ To your [ b ] descendants I give this land , ’ ( L ) He will send His angel before you , and you shall take a wife for my son from there .
NKJV	Genesis	24	8	And if the woman is not willing to follow you , then ( M ) you will be released from this oath ; only do not take my son back there. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	9	So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and swore to him concerning this matter .
NKJV	Genesis	24	10	Then the servant took ten of his master ’ s camels and departed , ( N ) for all his master ’ s goods were in his hand . And he arose and went to Mesopotamia , to ( O ) the city of Nahor .
NKJV	Genesis	24	11	And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at evening time , the time ( P ) when women go out to draw water .
NKJV	Genesis	24	12	Then he ( Q ) said , “ O Lord God of my master Abraham , please ( R ) give me success this day , and show kindness to my master Abraham .
NKJV	Genesis	24	13	Behold , here ( S ) I stand by the well of water , and ( T ) the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water .
NKJV	Genesis	24	14	Now let it be that the young woman to whom I say , ‘ Please let down your pitcher that I may drink , ’ and she says , ‘ Drink , and I will also give your camels a drink ’ —let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac . And ( U ) by this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	15	And it happened , ( V ) before he had finished speaking , that behold , ( W ) Rebekah , [ c ] who was born to Bethuel , son of ( X ) Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham ’ s brother , came out with her pitcher on her shoulder .
NKJV	Genesis	24	16	Now the young woman ( Y ) was very beautiful to behold , a virgin ; no man had known her . And she went down to the well , filled her pitcher , and came up .
NKJV	Genesis	24	17	And the servant ran to meet her and said , “ Please let me drink a little water from your pitcher. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	18	( Z ) So she said , “ Drink , my lord. ” Then she quickly let her pitcher down to her hand , and gave him a drink .
NKJV	Genesis	24	19	And when she had finished giving him a drink , she said , “ I will draw water for your camels also , until they have finished drinking. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	20	Then she quickly emptied her pitcher into the trough , ran back to the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
NKJV	Genesis	24	21	And the man , wondering at her , remained silent so as to know whether ( AA ) the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not .
NKJV	Genesis	24	22	So it was , when the camels had finished drinking , that the man took a golden ( AB ) nose ring weighing half a shekel , and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels of gold ,
NKJV	Genesis	24	23	and said , “ Whose daughter are you ? Tell me , please , is there room in your father ’ s house for us [ d ] to lodge ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	25	Moreover she said to him , “ We have both straw and feed enough , and room to lodge. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	26	Then the man ( AD ) bowed down his head and worshiped the Lord .
NKJV	Genesis	24	27	And he said , ( AE ) “ Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham , who has not forsaken ( AF ) His mercy and His truth toward my master . As for me , being on the way , the Lord ( AG ) led me to the house of my master ’ s brethren. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	28	So the young woman ran and told her mother ’ s household these things .
NKJV	Genesis	24	29	Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was ( AH ) Laban , and Laban ran out to the man by the well .
NKJV	Genesis	24	30	So it came to pass , when he saw the nose ring , and the bracelets on his sister ’ s wrists , and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah , saying , “ Thus the man spoke to me , ” that he went to the man . And there he stood by the camels at the well .
NKJV	Genesis	24	31	And he said , “ Come in , ( AI ) O blessed of the Lord ! Why do you stand outside ? For I have prepared the house , and a place for the camels. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	32	Then the man came to the house . And he unloaded the camels , and ( AJ ) provided straw and feed for the camels , and water to ( AK ) wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him .
NKJV	Genesis	24	33	Food was set before him to eat , but he said , ( AL ) “ I will not eat until I have told about my errand. ” And he said , “ Speak on. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	34	So he said , “ I am Abraham ’ s servant .
NKJV	Genesis	24	35	The Lord ( AM ) has blessed my master greatly , and he has become great ; and He has given him flocks and herds , silver and gold , male and female servants , and camels and donkeys .
NKJV	Genesis	24	36	And Sarah my master ’ s wife ( AN ) bore a son to my master when she was old ; and ( AO ) to him he has given all that he has .
NKJV	Genesis	24	37	Now my master ( AP ) made me swear , saying , ‘ You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I dwell ;
NKJV	Genesis	24	38	( AQ ) but you shall go to my father ’ s house and to my family , and take a wife for my son. ’
NKJV	Genesis	24	39	( AR ) And I said to my master , ‘ Perhaps the woman will not follow me. ’
NKJV	Genesis	24	40	( AS ) But he said to me , ‘ The Lord , ( AT ) before whom I walk , will send His angel with you and [ e ] prosper your way ; and you shall take a wife for my son from my family and from my father ’ s house .
NKJV	Genesis	24	41	( AU ) You will be clear from this oath when you arrive among my family ; for if they will not give her to you , then you will be released from my oath. ’
NKJV	Genesis	24	42	“ And this day I came to the well and said , ( AV ) ‘ O Lord God of my master Abraham , if You will now prosper the way in which I go ,
NKJV	Genesis	24	43	( AW ) behold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes out to draw water , and I say to her , “ Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink , ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	44	and she says to me , “ Drink , and I will draw for your camels also , ” —let her be the woman whom the Lord has appointed for my master ’ s son. ’
NKJV	Genesis	24	45	( AX ) “ But before I had finished ( AY ) speaking in my heart , there was Rebekah , coming out with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went down to the well and drew water . And I said to her , ‘ Please let me drink. ’
NKJV	Genesis	24	46	And she made haste and let her pitcher down from her shoulder , and said , ‘ Drink , and I will give your camels a drink also. ’ So I drank , and she gave the camels a drink also .
NKJV	Genesis	24	47	Then I asked her , and said , ‘ Whose daughter are you ? ’ And she said , ‘ The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor ’ s son , whom Milcah bore to him. ’ So I put the nose ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists .
NKJV	Genesis	24	48	( AZ ) And I bowed my head and worshiped the Lord , and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham , who had led me in the way of truth to ( BA ) take the daughter of my master ’ s brother for his son .
NKJV	Genesis	24	49	Now if you will ( BB ) deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me . And if not , tell me , that I may turn to the right hand or to the left. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said , ( BC ) “ The thing comes from the Lord ; we can not ( BD ) speak to you either bad or good .
NKJV	Genesis	24	51	( BE ) Here is Rebekah before you ; take her and go , and let her be your master ’ s son ’ s wife , as the Lord has spoken. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	52	And it came to pass , when Abraham ’ s servant heard their words , that ( BF ) he worshiped the Lord , bowing himself to the earth .
NKJV	Genesis	24	53	Then the servant brought out ( BG ) jewelry of silver , jewelry of gold , and clothing , and gave them to Rebekah . He also gave ( BH ) precious things to her brother and to her mother .
NKJV	Genesis	24	54	And he and the men who were with him ate and drank and stayed all night . Then they arose in the morning , and he said , ( BI ) “ Send me away to my master. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	55	But her brother and her mother said , “ Let the young woman stay with us a few days , at least ten ; after that she may go. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	56	And he said to them , “ Do not [ f ] hinder me , since the Lord has prospered my way ; send me away so that I may go to my master. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	57	So they said , “ We will call the young woman and ask her personally. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	58	Then they called Rebekah and said to her , “ Will you go with this man ? ” And she said , “ I will go. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	59	So they sent away Rebekah their sister ( BJ ) and her nurse , and Abraham ’ s servant and his men .
NKJV	Genesis	24	60	And they blessed Rebekah and said to her : “ Our sister , may you become ( BK ) The mother of thousands of ten thousands ; ( BL ) And may your descendants possess The gates of those who hate them. ”
NKJV	Genesis	24	61	Then Rebekah and her maids arose , and they rode on the camels and followed the man . So the servant took Rebekah and departed .
NKJV	Genesis	24	62	Now Isaac came from the way of ( BM ) Beer Lahai Roi , for he dwelt in the South .
NKJV	Genesis	24	63	And Isaac went out ( BN ) to meditate in the field in the evening ; and he lifted his eyes and looked , and there , the camels were coming .
NKJV	Genesis	24	64	Then Rebekah lifted her eyes , and when she saw Isaac ( BO ) she dismounted from her camel ;
NKJV	Genesis	24	65	for she had said to the servant , “ Who is this man walking in the field to meet us ? ” The servant said , “ It is my master. ” So she took a veil and covered herself .
NKJV	Genesis	24	66	And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done .
NKJV	Genesis	24	67	Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah ’ s tent ; and he ( BP ) took Rebekah and she became his wife , and he loved her . So Isaac ( BQ ) was comforted after his mother ’ s death .

NKJV	Genesis	25	9	And ( I ) his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of ( J ) Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite ,
NKJV	Genesis	25	10	( K ) the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth . ( L ) There Abraham was buried , and Sarah his wife .
NKJV	Genesis	25	11	And it came to pass , after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac . And Isaac dwelt at ( M ) Beer Lahai Roi . The Families of Ishmael and Isaac ( N )
NKJV	Genesis	25	12	Now this is the ( O ) genealogy of Ishmael , Abraham ’ s son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah ’ s maidservant , bore to Abraham .
NKJV	Genesis	25	13	And ( P ) these were the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : The firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; then Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
NKJV	Genesis	25	14	Mishma , Dumah , Massa ,
NKJV	Genesis	25	15	[ a ] Hadar , Tema , Jetur , Naphish , and Kedemah .
NKJV	Genesis	25	16	These were the sons of Ishmael and these were their names , by their towns and their [ b ] settlements , ( Q ) twelve princes according to their nations .
NKJV	Genesis	25	17	These were the years of the life of Ishmael : one hundred and thirty-seven years ; and ( R ) he breathed his last and died , and was gathered to his people .
NKJV	Genesis	25	18	( S ) ( They dwelt from Havilah as far as Shur , which is east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria . ) He [ c ] died ( T ) in the presence of all his brethren .
NKJV	Genesis	25	19	This is the ( U ) genealogy of Isaac , Abraham ’ s son . ( V ) Abraham begot Isaac .
NKJV	Genesis	25	20	Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah as wife , ( W ) the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram , ( X ) the sister of Laban the Syrian .
NKJV	Genesis	25	21	Now Isaac pleaded with the Lord for his wife , because she was barren ; ( Y ) and the Lord granted his plea , ( Z ) and Rebekah his wife conceived .
NKJV	Genesis	25	22	But the children struggled together within her ; and she said , “ If all is well , why am I like this ? ” ( AA ) So she went to inquire of the Lord .
NKJV	Genesis	25	23	And the Lord said to her : ( AB ) “ Two nations are in your womb , Two peoples shall be separated from your body ; One people shall be stronger than ( AC ) the other , ( AD ) And the older shall serve the younger. ”
NKJV	Genesis	25	24	So when her days were fulfilled for her to give birth , indeed there were twins in her womb .
NKJV	Genesis	25	26	Afterward his brother came out , and ( AF ) his hand took hold of Esau ’ s heel ; so ( AG ) his name was called [ e ] Jacob . Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them .
NKJV	Genesis	25	27	So the boys grew . And Esau was ( AH ) a skillful hunter , a man of the field ; but Jacob was ( AI ) a [ f ] mild man , ( AJ ) dwelling in tents .
NKJV	Genesis	25	28	And Isaac loved Esau because he ( AK ) ate of his game , ( AL ) but Rebekah loved Jacob . Esau Sells His Birthright ( AM )
NKJV	Genesis	25	29	Now Jacob cooked a stew ; and Esau came in from the field , and he was weary .
NKJV	Genesis	25	30	And Esau said to Jacob , “ Please feed me with that same red stew , for I am weary. ” Therefore his name was called [ g ] Edom .
NKJV	Genesis	25	31	But Jacob said , “ Sell me your birthright as of this day. ”
NKJV	Genesis	25	32	And Esau said , “ Look , I am about to die ; so ( AN ) what is this birthright to me ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	25	33	Then Jacob said , [ h ] “ Swear to me as of this day. ” So he swore to him , and ( AO ) sold his birthright to Jacob .
NKJV	Genesis	25	34	And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils ; then ( AP ) he ate and drank , arose , and went his way . Thus Esau ( AQ ) despised his birthright .

NKJV	Genesis	26	26	Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath , one of his friends , ( AG ) and Phichol the commander of his army .
NKJV	Genesis	26	2	Then the Lord appeared to him and said : ( C ) “ Do not go down to Egypt ; live in ( D ) the land of which I shall tell you .
NKJV	Genesis	26	3	( E ) Dwell in this land , and ( F ) I will be with you and ( G ) bless you ; for to you and your descendants ( H ) I give all these lands , and I will perform ( I ) the oath which I swore to Abraham your father .
NKJV	Genesis	26	4	And ( J ) I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven ; I will give to your descendants all these lands ; ( K ) and in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed ;
NKJV	Genesis	26	5	( L ) because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge , My commandments , My statutes , and My laws. ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	6	So Isaac dwelt in Gerar .
NKJV	Genesis	26	7	And the men of the place asked about his wife . And ( M ) he said , “ She is my sister ” ; for ( N ) he was afraid to say , “ She is my wife , ” because he thought , “ lest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah , because she is ( O ) beautiful to behold. ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	8	Now it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked through a window , and saw , and there was Isaac , [ a ] showing endearment to Rebekah his wife .
NKJV	Genesis	26	9	Then Abimelech called Isaac and said , “ Quite obviously she is your wife ; so how could you say , ‘ She is my sister ’ ? ” Isaac said to him , “ Because I said , ‘ Lest I die on account of her. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	10	And Abimelech said , “ What is this you have done to us ? One of the people might soon have lain with your wife , and ( P ) you would have brought guilt on us. ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	11	So Abimelech charged all his people , saying , “ He who ( Q ) touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	12	Then Isaac sowed in that land , and reaped in the same year ( R ) a hundredfold ; and the Lord ( S ) blessed him .
NKJV	Genesis	26	13	The man ( T ) began to prosper , and continued prospering until he became very prosperous ;
NKJV	Genesis	26	14	for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants . So the Philistines ( U ) envied him .
NKJV	Genesis	26	15	Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells ( V ) which his father ’ s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , and they had filled them with earth .
NKJV	Genesis	26	16	And Abimelech said to Isaac , “ Go away from us , for ( W ) you are much mightier than we. ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	17	Then Isaac departed from there and [ b ] pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar , and dwelt there .
NKJV	Genesis	26	18	And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father , for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham . ( X ) He called them by the names which his father had called them .
NKJV	Genesis	26	19	Also Isaac ’ s servants dug in the valley , and found a well of running water there .
NKJV	Genesis	26	20	But the herdsmen of Gerar ( Y ) quarreled with Isaac ’ s herdsmen , saying , “ The water is ours. ” So he called the name of the well [ c ] Esek , because they quarreled with him .
NKJV	Genesis	26	21	Then they dug another well , and they quarreled over that one also . So he called its name [ d ] Sitnah .
NKJV	Genesis	26	22	And he moved from there and dug another well , and they did not quarrel over it . So he called its name [ e ] Rehoboth , because he said , “ For now the Lord has made room for us , and we shall ( Z ) be fruitful in the land. ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	23	Then he went up from there to Beersheba .
NKJV	Genesis	26	24	And the Lord ( AA ) appeared to him the same night and said , ( AB ) “ I am the God of your father Abraham ; ( AC ) do not fear , for ( AD ) I am with you . I will bless you and multiply your descendants for My servant Abraham ’ s sake. ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	25	So he ( AE ) built an altar there and ( AF ) called on the name of the Lord , and he pitched his tent there ; and there Isaac ’ s servants dug a well .
NKJV	Genesis	26	27	And Isaac said to them , “ Why have you come to me , ( AH ) since you hate me and have ( AI ) sent me away from you ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	28	But they said , “ We have certainly seen that the Lord ( AJ ) is with you . So we said , ‘ Let there now be an oath between us , between you and us ; and let us make a [ f ] covenant with you ,
NKJV	Genesis	26	29	that you will do us no harm , since we have not touched you , and since we have done nothing to you but good and have sent you away in peace . ( AK ) You are now the blessed of the Lord. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	30	( AL ) So he made them a feast , and they ate and drank .
NKJV	Genesis	26	31	Then they arose early in the morning and ( AM ) swore an oath with one another ; and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
NKJV	Genesis	26	32	It came to pass the same day that Isaac ’ s servants came and told him about the well which they had dug , and said to him , “ We have found water. ”
NKJV	Genesis	26	33	So he called it [ g ] Shebah . ( AN ) Therefore the name of the city is [ h ] Beersheba to this day .
NKJV	Genesis	26	34	( AO ) When Esau was forty years old , he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite .
NKJV	Genesis	26	35	And ( AP ) they were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah . Footnotes - Genesis 26:8 caressing - Genesis 26:17 camped - Genesis 26:20 Lit . Quarrel - Genesis 26:21 Lit .

NKJV	Genesis	27	27	And he came near and ( S ) kissed him ; and he smelled the smell of his clothing , and blessed him and said : “ Surely , ( T ) the smell of my son Is like the smell of a field Which the Lord has blessed .
NKJV	Genesis	27	2	Then he said , “ Behold now , I am old . I ( C ) do not know the day of my death .
NKJV	Genesis	27	3	( D ) Now therefore , please take your weapons , your quiver and your bow , and go out to the field and hunt game for me .
NKJV	Genesis	27	4	And make me [ a ] savory food , such as I love , and bring it to me that I may eat , that my soul ( E ) may bless you before I die. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	5	Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son . And Esau went to the field to hunt game and to bring it .
NKJV	Genesis	27	6	So Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son , saying , “ Indeed I heard your father speak to Esau your brother , saying ,
NKJV	Genesis	27	7	‘ Bring me game and make [ b ] savory food for me , that I may eat it and bless you in the presence of the Lord before my death. ’
NKJV	Genesis	27	8	Now therefore , my son , ( F ) obey my voice according to what I command you .
NKJV	Genesis	27	9	Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats , and I will make ( G ) savory food from them for your father , such as he loves .
NKJV	Genesis	27	10	Then you shall take it to your father , that he may eat it , and that he ( H ) may bless you before his death. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	11	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother , “ Look , ( I ) Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am a smooth-skinned man .
NKJV	Genesis	27	12	Perhaps my father will ( J ) feel me , and I shall seem to be a deceiver to him ; and I shall bring ( K ) a curse on myself and not a blessing. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	13	But his mother said to him , ( L ) “ Let your curse be on me , my son ; only obey my voice , and go , get them for me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	14	And he went and got them and brought them to his mother , and his mother ( M ) made [ c ] savory food , such as his father loved .
NKJV	Genesis	27	15	Then Rebekah took ( N ) the choice clothes of her elder son Esau , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob her younger son .
NKJV	Genesis	27	16	And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck .
NKJV	Genesis	27	17	Then she gave the savory food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
NKJV	Genesis	27	18	So he went to his father and said , “ My father. ” And he said , “ Here I am . Who are you , my son ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	19	Jacob said to his father , “ I am Esau your firstborn ; I have done just as you told me ; please arise , sit and eat of my game , ( O ) that your soul may bless me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	20	But Isaac said to his son , “ How is it that you have found it so quickly , my son ? ” And he said , “ Because the Lord your God brought it to me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	21	Isaac said to Jacob , “ Please come near , that I ( P ) may feel you , my son , whether you are really my son Esau or not. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	22	So Jacob went near to Isaac his father , and he felt him and said , “ The voice is Jacob ’ s voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	23	And he did not recognize him , because ( Q ) his hands were hairy like his brother Esau ’ s hands ; so he blessed him .
NKJV	Genesis	27	24	Then he said , “ Are you really my son Esau ? ” He said , “ I am. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	25	He said , “ Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son ’ s game , so ( R ) that my soul may bless you. ” So he brought it near to him , and he ate ; and he brought him wine , and he drank .
NKJV	Genesis	27	26	Then his father Isaac said to him , “ Come near now and kiss me , my son. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	28	Therefore may ( U ) God give you Of ( V ) the dew of heaven , Of ( W ) the fatness of the earth , And ( X ) plenty of grain and wine .
NKJV	Genesis	27	29	( Y ) Let peoples serve you , And nations bow down to you . Be master over your brethren , And ( Z ) let your mother ’ s sons bow down to you . ( AA ) Cursed be everyone who curses you , And blessed be those who bless you ! ” Esau ’ s Lost Hope ( AB )
NKJV	Genesis	27	30	Now it happened , as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob , and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
NKJV	Genesis	27	31	He also had made [ d ] savory food , and brought it to his father , and said to his father , “ Let my father arise and ( AC ) eat of his son ’ s game , that your soul may bless me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	32	And his father Isaac said to him , “ Who are you ? ” So he said , “ I am your son , your firstborn , Esau. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	33	Then Isaac trembled exceedingly , and said , “ Who ? Where is the one who hunted game and brought it to me ? I ate all of it before you came , and I have blessed him— ( AD ) and indeed he shall be blessed. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	34	When Esau heard the words of his father , ( AE ) he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry , and said to his father , “ Bless me—me also , O my father ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	35	But he said , “ Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	36	And Esau said , ( AF ) “ Is he not rightly named [ e ] Jacob ? For he has supplanted me these two times . He took away my birthright , and now look , he has taken away my blessing ! ” And he said , “ Have you not reserved a blessing for me ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	37	Then Isaac answered and said to Esau , ( AG ) “ Indeed I have made him your master , and all his brethren I have given to him as servants ; with ( AH ) grain and wine I have [ f ] sustained him . What shall I do now for you , my son ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	38	And Esau said to his father , “ Have you only one blessing , my father ? Bless me—me also , O my father ! ” And Esau lifted up his voice ( AI ) and wept .
NKJV	Genesis	27	39	Then Isaac his father answered and said to him : “ Behold , ( AJ ) your dwelling shall be of the [ g ] fatness of the earth , And of the dew of heaven from above .
NKJV	Genesis	27	40	By your sword you shall live , And ( AK ) you shall serve your brother ; And ( AL ) it shall come to pass , when you become restless , That you shall break his yoke from your neck. ” Jacob Escapes from Esau
NKJV	Genesis	27	41	So Esau ( AM ) hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him , and Esau said in his heart , ( AN ) “ The days of mourning for my father [ h ] are at hand ; ( AO ) then I will kill my brother Jacob. ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	42	And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah . So she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said to him , “ Surely your brother Esau ( AP ) comforts himself concerning you by intending to kill you .
NKJV	Genesis	27	43	Now therefore , my son , obey my voice : arise , flee to my brother Laban ( AQ ) in Haran .
NKJV	Genesis	27	44	And stay with him a ( AR ) few days , until your brother ’ s fury turns away ,
NKJV	Genesis	27	45	until your brother ’ s anger turns away from you , and he forgets what you have done to him ; then I will send and bring you from there . Why should I be bereaved also of you both in one day ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	27	46	And Rebekah said to Isaac , ( AS ) “ I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth ; ( AT ) if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth , like these who are the daughters of the land , what good will my life be to me ? ” Footnotes - Genesis 27:4 tasty - Genesis 27:7 tasty - Genesis 27:14 tasty - Genesis 27:31 tasty - Genesis 27:36 Supplanter or Deceitful , lit .

NKJV	Genesis	28	28	Then Isaac called Jacob and ( A ) blessed him , and [ a ] charged him , and said to him : ( B ) “ You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan .
NKJV	Genesis	28	2	( C ) Arise , go to ( D ) Padan Aram , to the house of ( E ) Bethuel your mother ’ s father ; and take yourself a wife from there of the daughters of ( F ) Laban your mother ’ s brother .
NKJV	Genesis	28	3	“ May ( G ) God Almighty bless you , And make you ( H ) fruitful and multiply you , That you may be an assembly of peoples ;
NKJV	Genesis	28	4	And give you ( I ) the blessing of Abraham , To you and your descendants with you , That you may inherit the land ( J ) In [ b ] which you are a stranger , Which God gave to Abraham. ”
NKJV	Genesis	28	5	So Isaac sent Jacob away , and he went to Padan Aram , to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebekah , the mother of Jacob and Esau . Esau Marries Mahalath
NKJV	Genesis	28	6	Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan Aram to take himself a wife from there , and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge , saying , “ You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan , ”
NKJV	Genesis	28	7	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padan Aram .
NKJV	Genesis	28	8	Also Esau saw ( K ) that the daughters of Canaan did not please his father Isaac .
NKJV	Genesis	28	9	So Esau went to Ishmael and ( L ) took ( M ) Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael , Abraham ’ s son , ( N ) the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife in addition to the wives he had . Jacob ’ s Vow at Bethel
NKJV	Genesis	28	10	Now Jacob ( O ) went out from Beersheba and went toward ( P ) Haran .
NKJV	Genesis	28	11	So he came to a certain place and stayed there all night , because the sun had set . And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head , and he lay down in that place to sleep .
NKJV	Genesis	28	12	Then he ( Q ) dreamed , and behold , a ladder was set up on the earth , and its top reached to heaven ; and there ( R ) the angels of God were ascending and descending on it .
NKJV	Genesis	28	13	( S ) And behold , the Lord stood above it and said : ( T ) “ I am the Lord God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac ; ( U ) the land on which you lie I will give to you and your descendants .
NKJV	Genesis	28	14	Also your ( V ) descendants shall be as the dust of the earth ; you shall spread abroad ( W ) to the west and the east , to the north and the south ; and in you and ( X ) in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed .
NKJV	Genesis	28	15	Behold , ( Y ) I am with you and will ( Z ) keep [ c ] you wherever you go , and will ( AA ) bring you back to this land ; for ( AB ) I will not leave you ( AC ) until I have done what I have spoken to you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	28	16	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said , “ Surely the Lord is in ( AD ) this place , and I did not know it. ”
NKJV	Genesis	28	17	And he was afraid and said , “ How awesome is this place ! This is none other than the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	28	18	Then Jacob rose early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put at his head , ( AE ) set it up as a pillar , ( AF ) and poured oil on top of it .
NKJV	Genesis	28	19	And he called the name of ( AG ) that place [ d ] Bethel ; but the name of that city had been Luz previously .
NKJV	Genesis	28	20	( AH ) Then Jacob made a vow , saying , “ If ( AI ) God will be with me , and keep me in this way that I am going , and give me ( AJ ) bread to eat and clothing to put on ,
NKJV	Genesis	28	21	so that ( AK ) I come back to my father ’ s house in peace , ( AL ) then the Lord shall be my God .

NKJV	Genesis	29	29	And Laban gave his maid ( W ) Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as a maid .
NKJV	Genesis	29	2	And he looked , and saw a ( B ) well in the field ; and behold , there were three flocks of sheep lying by it ; for out of that well they watered the flocks . A large stone was on the well ’ s mouth .
NKJV	Genesis	29	3	Now all the flocks would be gathered there ; and they would roll the stone from the well ’ s mouth , water the sheep , and put the stone back in its place on the well ’ s mouth .
NKJV	Genesis	29	4	And Jacob said to them , “ My brethren , where are you from ? ” And they said , “ We are from ( C ) Haran. ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	5	Then he said to them , “ Do you know ( D ) Laban the son of Nahor ? ” And they said , “ We know him. ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	6	So he said to them , ( E ) “ Is he well ? ” And they said , “ He is well . And look , his daughter Rachel ( F ) is coming with the sheep. ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	7	Then he said , “ Look , it is still [ a ] high day ; it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together . Water the sheep , and go and feed them. ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	8	But they said , “ We can not until all the flocks are gathered together , and they have rolled the stone from the well ’ s mouth ; then we water the sheep. ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	9	Now while he was still speaking with them , ( G ) Rachel came with her father ’ s sheep , for she was a shepherdess .
NKJV	Genesis	29	10	And it came to pass , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother ’ s brother , and the sheep of Laban his mother ’ s brother , that Jacob went near and ( H ) rolled the stone from the well ’ s mouth , and watered the flock of Laban his mother ’ s brother .
NKJV	Genesis	29	11	Then Jacob ( I ) kissed Rachel , and lifted up his voice and wept .
NKJV	Genesis	29	12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was ( J ) her father ’ s relative and that he was Rebekah ’ s son . ( K ) So she ran and told her father .
NKJV	Genesis	29	13	Then it came to pass , when Laban heard the report about Jacob his sister ’ s son , that ( L ) he ran to meet him , and embraced him and kissed him , and brought him to his house . So he told Laban all these things .
NKJV	Genesis	29	14	And Laban said to him , ( M ) “ Surely you are my bone and my flesh. ” And he stayed with him for a month . Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel
NKJV	Genesis	29	15	Then Laban said to Jacob , “ Because you are my relative , should you therefore serve me for nothing ? Tell me , ( N ) what should your wages be ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	16	Now Laban had two daughters : the name of the elder was Leah , and the name of the younger was Rachel .
NKJV	Genesis	29	17	Leah ’ s eyes were [ b ] delicate , but Rachel was ( O ) beautiful of form and appearance .
NKJV	Genesis	29	18	Now Jacob loved Rachel ; so he said , ( P ) “ I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter. ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	19	And Laban said , “ It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man . Stay with me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	20	So Jacob ( Q ) served seven years for Rachel , and they seemed only a few days to him because of the love he had for her .
NKJV	Genesis	29	21	Then Jacob said to Laban , “ Give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may ( R ) go in to her. ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	22	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and ( S ) made a feast .
NKJV	Genesis	29	23	Now it came to pass in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob ; and he went in to her .
NKJV	Genesis	29	24	And Laban gave his maid ( T ) Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maid .
NKJV	Genesis	29	25	So it came to pass in the morning , that behold , it was Leah . And he said to Laban , “ What is this you have done to me ? Was it not for Rachel that I served you ? Why then have you ( U ) deceived me ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	26	And Laban said , “ It must not be done so in our [ c ] country , to give the younger before the firstborn .
NKJV	Genesis	29	27	( V ) Fulfill her week , and we will give you this one also for the service which you will serve with me still another seven years. ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	28	Then Jacob did so and fulfilled her week . So he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife also .
NKJV	Genesis	29	30	Then Jacob also went in to Rachel , and he also ( X ) loved Rachel more than Leah . And he served with Laban ( Y ) still another seven years . The Children of Jacob
NKJV	Genesis	29	31	When the Lord ( Z ) saw that Leah was [ d ] unloved , He ( AA ) opened her womb ; but Rachel was barren .
NKJV	Genesis	29	32	So Leah conceived and bore a son , and she called his name [ e ] Reuben ; for she said , “ The Lord has surely ( AB ) looked on my affliction . Now therefore , my husband will love me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	29	33	Then she conceived again and bore a son , and said , “ Because the Lord has heard that I am [ f ] unloved , He has therefore given me this son also. ” And she called his name [ g ] Simeon .
NKJV	Genesis	29	34	She conceived again and bore a son , and said , “ Now this time my husband will become attached to me , because I have borne him three sons. ” Therefore his name was called [ h ] Levi .
NKJV	Genesis	29	35	And she conceived again and bore a son , and said , “ Now I will praise the Lord. ” Therefore she called his name ( AC ) Judah . [ i ] Then she stopped bearing .

NKJV	Genesis	30	30	For what you had before I came was little , and it has increased to a great amount ; the Lord has blessed you [ l ] since my coming . And now , when shall I also ( Y ) provide for my own house ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	2	And Jacob ’ s anger was aroused against Rachel , and he said , ( D ) “ Am I in the place of God , who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	3	So she said , “ Here is ( E ) my maid Bilhah ; go in to her , ( F ) and she will bear a child on my knees , ( G ) that I also may [ a ] have children by her. ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	4	Then she gave him Bilhah her maid ( H ) as wife , and Jacob went in to her .
NKJV	Genesis	30	5	And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son .
NKJV	Genesis	30	6	Then Rachel said , “ God has ( I ) judged my case ; and He has also heard my voice and given me a son. ” Therefore she called his name [ b ] Dan .
NKJV	Genesis	30	7	And Rachel ’ s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son .
NKJV	Genesis	30	8	Then Rachel said , “ With [ c ] great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister , and indeed I have prevailed. ” So she called his name [ d ] Naphtali .
NKJV	Genesis	30	9	When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing , she took Zilpah her maid and ( J ) gave her to Jacob as wife .
NKJV	Genesis	30	10	And Leah ’ s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son .
NKJV	Genesis	30	11	Then Leah said , [ e ] “ A troop comes ! ” So she called his name [ f ] Gad .
NKJV	Genesis	30	12	And Leah ’ s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son .
NKJV	Genesis	30	13	Then Leah said , “ I am happy , for the daughters ( K ) will call me blessed. ” So she called his name [ g ] Asher .
NKJV	Genesis	30	14	Now Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them to his mother Leah . Then Rachel said to Leah , ( L ) “ Please give me some of your son ’ s mandrakes. ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	15	But she said to her , ( M ) “ Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband ? Would you take away my son ’ s mandrakes also ? ” And Rachel said , “ Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son ’ s mandrakes. ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	16	When Jacob came out of the field in the evening , Leah went out to meet him and said , “ You must come in to me , for I have surely hired you with my son ’ s mandrakes. ” And he lay with her that night .
NKJV	Genesis	30	17	And God listened to Leah , and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son .
NKJV	Genesis	30	18	Leah said , “ God has given me my wages , because I have given my maid to my husband. ” So she called his name [ h ] Issachar .
NKJV	Genesis	30	19	Then Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son .
NKJV	Genesis	30	20	And Leah said , “ God has endowed me with a good endowment ; now my husband will dwell with me , because I have borne him six sons. ” So she called his name [ i ] Zebulun .
NKJV	Genesis	30	21	Afterward she bore a ( N ) daughter , and called her name [ j ] Dinah .
NKJV	Genesis	30	22	Then God ( O ) remembered Rachel , and God listened to her and ( P ) opened her womb .
NKJV	Genesis	30	23	And she conceived and bore a son , and said , “ God has taken away ( Q ) my reproach. ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	24	So she called his name [ k ] Joseph , and said , ( R ) “ The Lord shall add to me another son. ” Jacob ’ s Agreement with Laban
NKJV	Genesis	30	25	And it came to pass , when Rachel had borne Joseph , that Jacob said to Laban , ( S ) “ Send me away , that I may go to ( T ) my own place and to my country .
NKJV	Genesis	30	26	Give me my wives and my children ( U ) for whom I have served you , and let me go ; for you know my service which I have done for you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	27	And Laban said to him , “ Please stay , if I have found favor in your eyes , for ( V ) I have learned by experience that the Lord has blessed me for your sake. ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	28	Then he said , ( W ) “ Name me your wages , and I will give it. ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	29	So Jacob said to him , ( X ) “ You know how I have served you and how your livestock has been with me .
NKJV	Genesis	30	31	So he said , “ What shall I give you ? ” And Jacob said , “ You shall not give me anything . If you will do this thing for me , I will again feed and keep your flocks :
NKJV	Genesis	30	32	Let me pass through all your flock today , removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep , and all the brown ones among the lambs , and the spotted and speckled among the goats ; and ( Z ) these shall be my wages .
NKJV	Genesis	30	33	So my ( AA ) righteousness will answer for me in time to come , when the subject of my wages comes before you : every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats , and brown among the lambs , will be considered stolen , if it is with me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	34	And Laban said , “ Oh , that it were according to your word ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	30	35	So he removed that day the male goats that were ( AB ) speckled and spotted , all the female goats that were speckled and spotted , every one that had some white in it , and all the brown ones among the lambs , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
NKJV	Genesis	30	36	Then he put three days ’ journey between himself and Jacob , and Jacob fed the rest of Laban ’ s flocks .
NKJV	Genesis	30	37	Now ( AC ) Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and chestnut trees , peeled white strips in them , and exposed the white which was in the rods .
NKJV	Genesis	30	38	And the rods which he had peeled , he set before the flocks in the gutters , in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink , so that they should conceive when they came to drink .
NKJV	Genesis	30	39	So the flocks conceived before the rods , and the flocks brought forth streaked , speckled , and spotted .
NKJV	Genesis	30	40	Then Jacob separated the lambs , and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban ; but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Laban ’ s flock .
NKJV	Genesis	30	41	And it came to pass , whenever the stronger livestock conceived , that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods .
NKJV	Genesis	30	42	But when the flocks were feeble , he did not put them in ; so the feebler were Laban ’ s and the stronger Jacob ’ s .
NKJV	Genesis	30	43	Thus the man ( AD ) became exceedingly prosperous , and ( AE ) had large flocks , female and male servants , and camels and donkeys .

NKJV	Genesis	31	31	Then Jacob answered and said to Laban , “ Because I was ( AF ) afraid , for I said , ‘ Perhaps you would take your daughters from me by force. ’
NKJV	Genesis	31	2	And Jacob saw the ( B ) countenance of Laban , and indeed it was not ( C ) favorable toward him as before .
NKJV	Genesis	31	3	Then the Lord said to Jacob , ( D ) “ Return to the land of your fathers and to your family , and I will ( E ) be with you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	31	4	So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field , to his flock ,
NKJV	Genesis	31	5	and said to them , ( F ) “ I see your father ’ s [ a ] countenance , that it is not favorable toward me as before ; but the God of my father ( G ) has been with me .
NKJV	Genesis	31	6	And ( H ) you know that with all my might I have served your father .
NKJV	Genesis	31	7	Yet your father has deceived me and ( I ) changed my wages ( J ) ten times , but God ( K ) did not allow him to hurt me .
NKJV	Genesis	31	8	If he said thus : ( L ) ‘ The speckled shall be your wages , ’ then all the flocks bore speckled . And if he said thus : ‘ The streaked shall be your wages , ’ then all the flocks bore streaked .
NKJV	Genesis	31	9	So God has ( M ) taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me .
NKJV	Genesis	31	10	“ And it happened , at the time when the flocks conceived , that I lifted my eyes and saw in a dream , and behold , the rams which leaped upon the flocks were streaked , speckled , and gray-spotted .
NKJV	Genesis	31	11	Then ( N ) the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream , saying , ‘ Jacob. ’ And I said , ‘ Here I am. ’
NKJV	Genesis	31	12	And He said , ‘ Lift your eyes now and see , all the rams which leap on the flocks are streaked , speckled , and gray-spotted ; for ( O ) I have seen all that Laban is doing to you .
NKJV	Genesis	31	13	I am the God of Bethel , ( P ) where you anointed the pillar and where you made a vow to Me . Now ( Q ) arise , get out of this land , and return to the land of your family. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	31	14	Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him , ( R ) “ Is there still any portion or inheritance for us in our father ’ s house ?
NKJV	Genesis	31	15	Are we not considered strangers by him ? For ( S ) he has sold us , and also completely consumed our money .
NKJV	Genesis	31	16	For all these riches which God has taken from our father are really ours and our children ’ s ; now then , whatever God has said to you , do it. ”
NKJV	Genesis	31	17	Then Jacob rose and set his sons and his wives on camels .
NKJV	Genesis	31	18	And he carried away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gained , his acquired livestock which he had gained in Padan Aram , to go to his father Isaac in the land of ( T ) Canaan .
NKJV	Genesis	31	19	Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep , and Rachel had stolen the ( U ) household [ b ] idols that were her father ’ s .
NKJV	Genesis	31	20	And Jacob stole away , unknown to Laban the Syrian , in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee .
NKJV	Genesis	31	21	So he fled with all that he had . He arose and crossed the river , and ( V ) headed [ c ] toward the mountains of Gilead . Laban Pursues Jacob
NKJV	Genesis	31	22	And Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled .
NKJV	Genesis	31	23	Then he took ( W ) his brethren with him and pursued him for seven days ’ journey , and he overtook him in the mountains of Gilead .
NKJV	Genesis	31	24	But God ( X ) had come to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night , and said to him , “ Be careful that you ( Y ) speak to Jacob neither good nor bad. ”
NKJV	Genesis	31	25	So Laban overtook Jacob . Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains , and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountains of Gilead .
NKJV	Genesis	31	26	And Laban said to Jacob : “ What have you done , that you have stolen away unknown to me , and ( Z ) carried away my daughters like captives taken with the sword ?
NKJV	Genesis	31	27	Why did you flee away secretly , and steal away from me , and not tell me ; for I might have sent you away with joy and songs , with timbrel and harp ?
NKJV	Genesis	31	28	And you did not allow me ( AA ) to kiss my sons and my daughters . Now ( AB ) you have done foolishly in so doing .
NKJV	Genesis	31	29	It is in my power to do you harm , but the ( AC ) God of your father spoke to me ( AD ) last night , saying , ‘ Be careful that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad. ’
NKJV	Genesis	31	30	And now you have surely gone because you greatly long for your father ’ s house , but why did you ( AE ) steal my gods ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	31	32	With whomever you find your gods , ( AG ) do not let him live . In the presence of our brethren , identify what I have of yours and take it with you. ” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them .
NKJV	Genesis	31	33	And Laban went into Jacob ’ s tent , into Leah ’ s tent , and into the two maids ’ tents , but he did not find them . Then he went out of Leah ’ s tent and entered Rachel ’ s tent .
NKJV	Genesis	31	34	Now Rachel had taken the [ d ] household idols , put them in the camel ’ s saddle , and sat on them . And Laban [ e ] searched all about the tent but did not find them .
NKJV	Genesis	31	35	And she said to her father , “ Let it not displease my lord that I can not ( AH ) rise before you , for the manner of women is with me. ” And he searched but did not find the [ f ] household idols .
NKJV	Genesis	31	36	Then Jacob was angry and rebuked Laban , and Jacob answered and said to Laban : “ What is my [ g ] trespass ? What is my sin , that you have so hotly pursued me ?
NKJV	Genesis	31	37	Although you have searched all my things , what part of your household things have you found ? Set it here before my brethren and your brethren , that they may judge between us both !
NKJV	Genesis	31	38	These twenty years I have been with you ; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried their young , and I have not eaten the rams of your flock .
NKJV	Genesis	31	39	( AI ) That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you ; I bore the loss of it . ( AJ ) You required it from my hand , whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
NKJV	Genesis	31	40	There I was ! In the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night , and my sleep departed from my eyes .
NKJV	Genesis	31	41	Thus I have been in your house twenty years ; I ( AK ) served you fourteen years for your two daughters , and six years for your flock , and ( AL ) you have changed my wages ten times .
NKJV	Genesis	31	42	( AM ) Unless the God of my father , the God of Abraham and ( AN ) the Fear of Isaac , had been with me , surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed . ( AO ) God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands , and ( AP ) rebuked you last night. ” Laban ’ s Covenant with Jacob
NKJV	Genesis	31	43	And Laban answered and said to Jacob , “ These daughters are my daughters , and these children are my children , and this flock is my flock ; all that you see is mine . But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne ?
NKJV	Genesis	31	44	Now therefore , come , ( AQ ) let us make a [ h ] covenant , ( AR ) you and I , and let it be a witness between you and me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	31	45	So Jacob ( AS ) took a stone and set it up as a pillar .
NKJV	Genesis	31	46	Then Jacob said to his brethren , “ Gather stones. ” And they took stones and made a heap , and they ate there on the heap .
NKJV	Genesis	31	47	Laban called it [ i ] Jegar Sahadutha , but Jacob called it [ j ] Galeed .
NKJV	Genesis	31	48	And Laban said , ( AT ) “ This heap is a witness between you and me this day. ” Therefore its name was called Galeed ,
NKJV	Genesis	31	49	also ( AU ) Mizpah , [ k ] because he said , “ May the Lord watch between you and me when we are absent one from another .
NKJV	Genesis	31	50	If you afflict my daughters , or if you take other wives besides my daughters , although no man is with us—see , God is witness between you and me ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	31	51	Then Laban said to Jacob , “ Here is this heap and here is this pillar , which I have placed between you and me .
NKJV	Genesis	31	52	This heap is a witness , and this pillar is a witness , that I will not pass beyond this heap to you , and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me , for harm .
NKJV	Genesis	31	53	The God of Abraham , the God of Nahor , and the God of their father ( AV ) judge between us. ” And Jacob ( AW ) swore by ( AX ) the [ l ] Fear of his father Isaac .
NKJV	Genesis	31	54	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain , and called his brethren to eat bread . And they ate bread and stayed all night on the mountain .
NKJV	Genesis	31	55	And early in the morning Laban arose , and ( AY ) kissed his sons and daughters and ( AZ ) blessed them . Then Laban departed and ( BA ) returned to his place .

NKJV	Genesis	32	2	When Jacob saw them , he said , “ This is God ’ s ( B ) camp. ” And he called the name of that place [ a ] Mahanaim .
NKJV	Genesis	32	3	Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother ( C ) in the land of Seir , ( D ) the [ b ] country of Edom .
NKJV	Genesis	32	4	And he commanded them , saying , ( E ) “ Speak thus to my lord Esau , ‘ Thus your servant Jacob says : “ I have dwelt with Laban and stayed there until now .
NKJV	Genesis	32	5	( F ) I have oxen , donkeys , flocks , and male and female servants ; and I have sent to tell my lord , that ( G ) I may find favor in your sight. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	32	6	Then the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , “ We came to your brother Esau , and ( H ) he also is coming to meet you , and four hundred men are with him. ”
NKJV	Genesis	32	7	So Jacob was greatly afraid and ( I ) distressed ; and he divided the people that were with him , and the flocks and herds and camels , into two companies .
NKJV	Genesis	32	8	And he said , “ If Esau comes to the one company and [ c ] attacks it , then the other company which is left will escape. ”
NKJV	Genesis	32	9	( J ) Then Jacob said , ( K ) “ O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac , the Lord ( L ) who said to me , ‘ Return to your country and to your family , and I will deal well with you ’ :
NKJV	Genesis	32	10	I am not worthy of the least of all the ( M ) mercies and of all the truth which You have shown Your servant ; for I crossed over this Jordan with ( N ) my staff , and now I have become two companies .
NKJV	Genesis	32	11	( O ) Deliver me , I pray , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau ; for I fear him , lest he come and [ d ] attack me and ( P ) the mother with the children .
NKJV	Genesis	32	12	For ( Q ) You said , ‘ I will surely treat you well , and make your descendants as the ( R ) sand of the sea , which can not be numbered for multitude. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	32	13	So he lodged there that same night , and took what [ e ] came to his hand as ( S ) a present for Esau his brother :
NKJV	Genesis	32	14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats , two hundred ewes and twenty rams ,
NKJV	Genesis	32	15	thirty milk camels with their colts , forty cows and ten bulls , twenty female donkeys and ten foals .
NKJV	Genesis	32	16	Then he delivered them to the hand of his servants , every drove by itself , and said to his servants , “ Pass over before me , and put some distance between successive droves. ”
NKJV	Genesis	32	17	And he commanded the first one , saying , “ When Esau my brother meets you and asks you , saying , ‘ To whom do you belong , and where are you going ? Whose are these in front of you ? ’
NKJV	Genesis	32	18	then you shall say , ‘ They are your servant Jacob ’ s . It is a present sent to my lord Esau ; and behold , he also is behind us. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	32	19	So he commanded the second , the third , and all who followed the droves , saying , “ In this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him ;
NKJV	Genesis	32	20	and also say , ‘ Behold , your servant Jacob is behind us. ’ ” For he said , “ I will ( T ) appease him with the present that goes before me , and afterward I will see his face ; perhaps he will accept me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	32	21	So the present went on over before him , but he himself lodged that night in the camp . Wrestling with God
NKJV	Genesis	32	22	And he arose that night and took his two wives , his two female servants , and his eleven sons , ( U ) and crossed over the ford of Jabbok .
NKJV	Genesis	32	23	He took them , sent them [ f ] over the brook , and sent over what he had .
NKJV	Genesis	32	24	Then Jacob was left alone ; and ( V ) a Man wrestled with him until the [ g ] breaking of day .
NKJV	Genesis	32	25	Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him , He [ h ] touched the socket of his hip ; and ( W ) the socket of Jacob ’ s hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him .
NKJV	Genesis	32	26	And ( X ) He said , “ Let Me go , for the day breaks. ” But he said , ( Y ) “ I will not let You go unless You bless me ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	32	27	So He said to him , “ What is your name ? ” He said , “ Jacob. ”
NKJV	Genesis	32	28	And He said , ( Z ) “ Your name shall no longer be called Jacob , but [ i ] Israel ; for you have ( AA ) struggled with God and ( AB ) with men , and have prevailed. ”
NKJV	Genesis	32	29	Then Jacob asked , saying , “ Tell me Your name , I pray. ” And He said , ( AC ) “ Why is it that you ask about My name ? ” And He ( AD ) blessed him there .

NKJV	Genesis	33	33	Now Jacob lifted his eyes and looked , and there , ( A ) Esau was coming , and with him were four hundred men . So he divided the children among Leah , Rachel , and the two maidservants .
NKJV	Genesis	33	2	And he put the maidservants and their children in front , Leah and her children behind , and Rachel and Joseph last .
NKJV	Genesis	33	3	Then he crossed over before them and ( B ) bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
NKJV	Genesis	33	4	( C ) But Esau ran to meet him , and embraced him , ( D ) and fell on his neck and kissed him , and they wept .
NKJV	Genesis	33	5	And he lifted his eyes and saw the women and children , and said , “ Who are these with you ? ” So he said , “ The children ( E ) whom God has graciously given your servant. ”
NKJV	Genesis	33	6	Then the maidservants came near , they and their children , and bowed down .
NKJV	Genesis	33	7	And Leah also came near with her children , and they bowed down . Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near , and they bowed down .
NKJV	Genesis	33	8	Then Esau said , “ What do you mean by ( F ) all this company which I met ? ” And he said , “ These are ( G ) to find favor in the sight of my lord. ”
NKJV	Genesis	33	9	But Esau said , “ I have enough , my brother ; keep what you have for yourself. ”
NKJV	Genesis	33	10	And Jacob said , “ No , please , if I have now found favor in your sight , then receive my present from my hand , inasmuch as I ( H ) have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God , and you were pleased with me .
NKJV	Genesis	33	11	Please , take ( I ) my blessing that is brought to you , because God has dealt ( J ) graciously with me , and because I have [ a ] enough. ” ( K ) So he urged him , and he took it .
NKJV	Genesis	33	12	Then Esau said , “ Let us take our journey ; let us go , and I will go before you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	33	13	But Jacob said to him , “ My lord knows that the children are weak , and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me . And if the men should drive them hard one day , all the flock will die .
NKJV	Genesis	33	14	Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant . I will lead on slowly at a pace which the livestock that go before me , and the children , [ b ] are able to endure , until I come to my lord ( L ) in Seir. ”
NKJV	Genesis	33	15	And Esau said , “ Now let me leave with you some of the people who are with me. ” But he said , “ What need is there ? ( M ) Let me find favor in the sight of my lord. ”
NKJV	Genesis	33	16	So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir .
NKJV	Genesis	33	17	And Jacob journeyed to ( N ) Succoth , built himself a house , and made [ c ] booths for his livestock . Therefore the name of the place is called [ d ] Succoth . Jacob Comes to Canaan
NKJV	Genesis	33	18	Then Jacob came [ e ] safely to ( O ) the city of ( P ) Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Padan Aram ; and he pitched his tent before the city .
NKJV	Genesis	33	19	And ( Q ) he bought the parcel of [ f ] land , where he had pitched his tent , from the children of Hamor , Shechem ’ s father , for one hundred pieces of money .
NKJV	Genesis	33	20	Then he erected an altar there and called it ( R ) El [ g ] Elohe Israel .

NKJV	Genesis	34	34	Now ( A ) Dinah the daughter of Leah , whom she had borne to Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
NKJV	Genesis	34	2	And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , prince of the country , saw her , he ( B ) took her and lay with her , and violated her .
NKJV	Genesis	34	3	His soul [ a ] was strongly attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob , and he loved the young woman and spoke [ b ] kindly to the young woman .
NKJV	Genesis	34	4	So Shechem ( C ) spoke to his father Hamor , saying , “ Get me this young woman as a wife. ”
NKJV	Genesis	34	5	And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter . Now his sons were with his livestock in the field ; so Jacob ( D ) held [ c ] his peace until they came .
NKJV	Genesis	34	6	Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him .
NKJV	Genesis	34	7	And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it ; and the men were grieved and very angry , because he ( E ) had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob ’ s daughter , ( F ) a thing which ought not to be done .
NKJV	Genesis	34	8	But Hamor spoke with them , saying , “ The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter . Please give her to him as a wife .
NKJV	Genesis	34	9	And make marriages with us ; give your daughters to us , and take our daughters to yourselves .
NKJV	Genesis	34	10	So you shall dwell with us , and the land shall be before you . Dwell and trade in it , and acquire possessions for yourselves in it. ”
NKJV	Genesis	34	11	Then Shechem said to her father and her brothers , “ Let me find favor in your eyes , and whatever you say to me I will give .
NKJV	Genesis	34	12	Ask me ever so much ( G ) dowry [ d ] and gift , and I will give according to what you say to me ; but give me the young woman as a wife. ”
NKJV	Genesis	34	13	But the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father , and spoke ( H ) deceitfully , because he had defiled Dinah their sister .
NKJV	Genesis	34	14	And they said to them , “ We can not do this thing , to give our sister to one who is ( I ) uncircumcised , for ( J ) that would be a reproach to us .
NKJV	Genesis	34	15	But on this condition we will consent to you : If you will become as we are , if every male of you is circumcised ,
NKJV	Genesis	34	16	then we will give our daughters to you , and we will take your daughters to us ; and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
NKJV	Genesis	34	17	But if you will not heed us and be circumcised , then we will take our daughter and be gone. ”
NKJV	Genesis	34	18	And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem , Hamor ’ s son .
NKJV	Genesis	34	19	So the young man did not delay to do the thing , because he delighted in Jacob ’ s daughter . He was ( K ) more honorable than all the household of his father .
NKJV	Genesis	34	20	And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the ( L ) gate of their city , and spoke with the men of their city , saying :
NKJV	Genesis	34	21	“ These men are at peace with us . Therefore let them dwell in the land and trade in it . For indeed the land is large enough for them . Let us take their daughters to us as wives , and let us give them our daughters .
NKJV	Genesis	34	22	Only on this condition will the men consent to dwell with us , to be one people : if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised .
NKJV	Genesis	34	23	Will not their livestock , their property , and every animal of theirs be ours ? Only let us consent to them , and they will dwell with us. ”
NKJV	Genesis	34	24	And all who went out of the gate of his city heeded Hamor and Shechem his son ; every male was circumcised , all who ( M ) went out of the gate of his city .
NKJV	Genesis	34	25	Now it came to pass on the third day , when they were in pain , that two of the sons of Jacob , ( N ) Simeon and Levi , Dinah ’ s brothers , each took his sword and came boldly upon the city and killed all the males .
NKJV	Genesis	34	26	And they ( O ) killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah from Shechem ’ s house , and went out .
NKJV	Genesis	34	27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain , and plundered the city , because their sister had been defiled .
NKJV	Genesis	34	28	They took their sheep , their oxen , and their donkeys , what was in the city and what was in the field ,
NKJV	Genesis	34	29	and all their wealth . All their little ones and their wives they took captive ; and they plundered even all that was in the houses .
NKJV	Genesis	34	30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , ( P ) “ You have ( Q ) troubled me ( R ) by making me obnoxious among the inhabitants of the land , among the Canaanites and the Perizzites ; ( S ) and since I am few in number , they will gather themselves together against me and kill me . I shall be destroyed , my household and I. ”
NKJV	Genesis	34	31	But they said , “ Should he treat our sister like a harlot ? ” Footnotes - Genesis 34:3 Lit . clung to - Genesis 34:3 tenderly - Genesis 34:5 kept silent - Genesis 34:12 bride-price Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Genesis	35	35	Then God said to Jacob , “ Arise , go up to ( A ) Bethel and dwell there ; and make an altar there to God , ( B ) who appeared to you ( C ) when you fled from the face of Esau your brother. ”
NKJV	Genesis	35	2	And Jacob said to his ( D ) household and to all who were with him , “ Put away ( E ) the foreign gods that are among you , ( F ) purify yourselves , and change your garments .
NKJV	Genesis	35	3	Then let us arise and go up to Bethel ; and I will make an altar there to God , ( G ) who answered me in the day of my distress ( H ) and has been with me in the way which I have gone. ”
NKJV	Genesis	35	4	So they gave Jacob all the foreign [ a ] gods which were in their hands , and the ( I ) earrings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under ( J ) the terebinth tree which was by Shechem .
NKJV	Genesis	35	5	And they journeyed , and ( K ) the terror of God was upon the cities that were all around them , and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob .
NKJV	Genesis	35	6	So Jacob came to ( L ) Luz ( that is , Bethel ) , which is in the land of Canaan , he and all the people who were with him .
NKJV	Genesis	35	7	And he ( M ) built an altar there and called the place [ b ] El Bethel , because ( N ) there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother .
NKJV	Genesis	35	8	Now ( O ) Deborah , Rebekah ’ s nurse , died , and she was buried below Bethel under the terebinth tree . So the name of it was called [ c ] Allon Bachuth .
NKJV	Genesis	35	9	Then ( P ) God appeared to Jacob again , when he came from Padan Aram , and ( Q ) blessed him .
NKJV	Genesis	35	10	And God said to him , “ Your name is Jacob ; ( R ) your name shall not be called Jacob anymore , ( S ) but Israel shall be your name. ” So He called his name Israel .
NKJV	Genesis	35	11	Also God said to him : ( T ) “ I am God Almighty . ( U ) Be fruitful and multiply ; ( V ) a nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you , and kings shall come from your body .
NKJV	Genesis	35	12	The ( W ) land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you ; and to your descendants after you I give this land. ”
NKJV	Genesis	35	13	Then God ( X ) went [ d ] up from him in the place where He talked with him .
NKJV	Genesis	35	14	So Jacob ( Y ) set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him , a pillar of stone ; and he poured a drink offering on it , and he poured oil on it .
NKJV	Genesis	35	15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him , ( Z ) Bethel . Death of Rachel
NKJV	Genesis	35	16	Then they journeyed from Bethel . And when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath , Rachel labored in childbirth , and she had hard labor .
NKJV	Genesis	35	17	Now it came to pass , when she was in hard labor , that the midwife said to her , “ Do not fear ; ( AA ) you will have this son also. ”
NKJV	Genesis	35	18	And so it was , as her soul was departing ( for she died ) , that she called his name [ e ] Ben-Oni ; but his father called him [ f ] Benjamin .
NKJV	Genesis	35	19	So ( AB ) Rachel died and was buried on the way to ( AC ) Ephrath ( that is , Bethlehem ) .
NKJV	Genesis	35	20	And Jacob set a pillar on her grave , which is the pillar of Rachel ’ s grave ( AD ) to this day .
NKJV	Genesis	35	21	Then Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond ( AE ) the tower of Eder .
NKJV	Genesis	35	22	And it happened , when Israel dwelt in that land , that Reuben went and ( AF ) lay with Bilhah his father ’ s concubine ; and Israel heard about it . Jacob ’ s Twelve Sons Now the sons of Jacob were twelve :
NKJV	Genesis	35	23	the sons of Leah were ( AG ) Reuben , Jacob ’ s firstborn , and Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , and Zebulun ;
NKJV	Genesis	35	24	the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin ;
NKJV	Genesis	35	25	the sons of Bilhah , Rachel ’ s maidservant , were Dan and Naphtali ;
NKJV	Genesis	35	26	and the sons of Zilpah , Leah ’ s maidservant , were Gad and Asher . These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Padan Aram . Death of Isaac
NKJV	Genesis	35	27	Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at ( AH ) Mamre , or ( AI ) Kirjath Arba [ g ] ( that is , Hebron ) , where Abraham and Isaac had dwelt .
NKJV	Genesis	35	28	Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years .
NKJV	Genesis	35	29	So Isaac breathed his last and died , and ( AJ ) was [ h ] gathered to his people , being old and full of days . And ( AK ) his sons Esau and Jacob buried him .

NKJV	Genesis	37	37	Now Jacob dwelt in the land ( A ) where his father was a [ a ] stranger , in the land of Canaan .
NKJV	Genesis	37	2	This is the history of Jacob . Joseph , being seventeen years old , was feeding the flock with his brothers . And the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah , his father ’ s wives ; and Joseph brought ( B ) a bad report of them to his father .
NKJV	Genesis	37	3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was ( C ) the son of his old age . Also he ( D ) made him a tunic of many colors .
NKJV	Genesis	37	4	But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers , they ( E ) hated him and could not speak peaceably to him .
NKJV	Genesis	37	5	Now Joseph had a dream , and he told it to his brothers ; and they hated him even more .
NKJV	Genesis	37	6	So he said to them , “ Please hear this dream which I have dreamed :
NKJV	Genesis	37	7	( F ) There we were , binding sheaves in the field . Then behold , my sheaf arose and also stood upright ; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf. ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	8	And his brothers said to him , “ Shall you indeed reign over us ? Or shall you indeed have dominion over us ? ” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words .
NKJV	Genesis	37	9	Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers , and said , “ Look , I have dreamed another dream . And this time , ( G ) the sun , the moon , and the eleven stars bowed down to me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	10	So he told it to his father and his brothers ; and his father rebuked him and said to him , “ What is this dream that you have dreamed ? Shall your mother and I and ( H ) your brothers indeed come to bow down to the earth before you ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	11	And ( I ) his brothers envied him , but his father ( J ) kept the matter in mind . Joseph Sold by His Brothers
NKJV	Genesis	37	12	Then his brothers went to feed their father ’ s flock in ( K ) Shechem .
NKJV	Genesis	37	13	And Israel said to Joseph , “ Are not your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem ? Come , I will send you to them. ” So he said to him , “ Here I am. ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	14	Then he said to him , “ Please go and see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks , and bring back word to me. ” So he sent him out of the Valley of ( L ) Hebron , and he went to Shechem .
NKJV	Genesis	37	15	Now a certain man found him , and there he was , wandering in the field . And the man asked him , saying , “ What are you seeking ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	16	So he said , “ I am seeking my brothers . ( M ) Please tell me where they are feeding their flocks. ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	17	And the man said , “ They have departed from here , for I heard them say , ‘ Let us go to Dothan. ’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in ( N ) Dothan .
NKJV	Genesis	37	18	Now when they saw him afar off , even before he came near them , ( O ) they conspired against him to kill him .
NKJV	Genesis	37	19	Then they said to one another , “ Look , this [ b ] dreamer is coming !
NKJV	Genesis	37	20	( P ) Come therefore , let us now kill him and cast him into some pit ; and we shall say , ‘ Some wild beast has devoured him. ’ We shall see what will become of his dreams ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	21	But ( Q ) Reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands , and said , “ Let us not kill him. ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	22	And Reuben said to them , “ Shed no blood , but cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness , and do not lay a hand on him ” —that he might deliver him out of their hands , and bring him back to his father .
NKJV	Genesis	37	23	So it came to pass , when Joseph had come to his brothers , that they ( R ) stripped Joseph of his tunic , the tunic of many colors that was on him .
NKJV	Genesis	37	24	Then they took him and cast him into a pit . And the pit was empty ; there was no water in it .
NKJV	Genesis	37	25	( S ) And they sat down to eat a meal . Then they lifted their eyes and looked , and there was a company of ( T ) Ishmaelites , coming from Gilead with their camels , bearing spices , ( U ) balm , and myrrh , on their way to carry them down to Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	37	26	So Judah said to his brothers , “ What profit is there if we kill our brother and ( V ) conceal his blood ?
NKJV	Genesis	37	27	Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites , and ( W ) let not our hand be upon him , for he is ( X ) our brother and ( Y ) our flesh. ” And his brothers listened .
NKJV	Genesis	37	28	Then ( Z ) Midianite traders passed by ; so the brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit , ( AA ) and sold him to the Ishmaelites for ( AB ) twenty shekels of silver . And they took Joseph to Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	37	29	Then Reuben returned to the pit , and indeed Joseph was not in the pit ; and he ( AC ) tore his clothes .
NKJV	Genesis	37	30	And he returned to his brothers and said , “ The lad ( AD ) is no more ; and I , where shall I go ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	31	So they took ( AE ) Joseph ’ s tunic , killed a kid of the goats , and dipped the tunic in the blood .
NKJV	Genesis	37	32	Then they sent the tunic of many colors , and they brought it to their father and said , “ We have found this . Do you know whether it is your son ’ s tunic or not ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	33	And he recognized it and said , “ It is my son ’ s tunic . A ( AF ) wild beast has devoured him . Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces. ”
NKJV	Genesis	37	34	Then Jacob ( AG ) tore his clothes , put sackcloth on his waist , and ( AH ) mourned for his son many days .
NKJV	Genesis	37	35	And all his sons and all his daughters ( AI ) arose to comfort him ; but he refused to be comforted , and he said , “ For ( AJ ) I shall go down into the grave to my son in mourning. ” Thus his father wept for him .
NKJV	Genesis	37	36	Now ( AK ) the [ c ] Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard .

NKJV	Genesis	38	38	It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers , and ( A ) visited a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah .
NKJV	Genesis	38	2	And Judah ( B ) saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was ( C ) Shua , and he married her and went in to her .
NKJV	Genesis	38	3	So she conceived and bore a son , and he called his name ( D ) Er .
NKJV	Genesis	38	4	She conceived again and bore a son , and she called his name ( E ) Onan .
NKJV	Genesis	38	5	And she conceived yet again and bore a son , and called his name ( F ) Shelah . He was at Chezib when she bore him .
NKJV	Genesis	38	6	Then Judah ( G ) took a wife for Er his firstborn , and her name was ( H ) Tamar .
NKJV	Genesis	38	7	But ( I ) Er , Judah ’ s firstborn , was wicked in the sight of the Lord , ( J ) and the Lord killed him .
NKJV	Genesis	38	8	And Judah said to Onan , “ Go in to ( K ) your brother ’ s wife and marry her , and raise up an heir to your brother. ”
NKJV	Genesis	38	9	But Onan knew that the heir would not be ( L ) his ; and it came to pass , when he went in to his brother ’ s wife , that he emitted on the ground , lest he should give an heir to his brother .
NKJV	Genesis	38	10	And the thing which he did [ a ] displeased the Lord ; therefore He killed ( M ) him also .
NKJV	Genesis	38	11	Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law , ( N ) “ Remain a widow in your father ’ s house till my son Shelah is grown. ” For he said , “ Lest he also die like his brothers. ” And Tamar went and dwelt ( O ) in her father ’ s house .
NKJV	Genesis	38	12	Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua , Judah ’ s wife , died ; and Judah ( P ) was comforted , and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah , he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite .
NKJV	Genesis	38	13	And it was told Tamar , saying , “ Look , your father-in-law is going up ( Q ) to Timnah to shear his sheep. ”
NKJV	Genesis	38	14	So she took off her widow ’ s garments , covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself , and ( R ) sat in an open place which was on the way to Timnah ; for she saw ( S ) that Shelah was grown , and she was not given to him as a wife .
NKJV	Genesis	38	15	When Judah saw her , he thought she was a harlot , because she had covered her face .
NKJV	Genesis	38	16	Then he turned to her by the way , and said , “ Please let me come in to you ” ; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law . So she said , “ What will you give me , that you may come in to me ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	38	17	And he said , ( T ) “ I will send a young goat from the flock. ” So she said , ( U ) “ Will you give me a pledge till you send it ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	38	18	Then he said , “ What pledge shall I give you ? ” So she said , ( V ) “ Your signet and cord , and your staff that is in your hand. ” Then he gave them to her , and went in to her , and she conceived by him .
NKJV	Genesis	38	19	So she arose and went away , and ( W ) laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood .
NKJV	Genesis	38	20	And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite , to receive his pledge from the woman ’ s hand , but he did not find her .
NKJV	Genesis	38	21	Then he asked the men of that place , saying , “ Where is the harlot who was [ b ] openly by the roadside ? ” And they said , “ There was no harlot in this place. ”
NKJV	Genesis	38	22	So he returned to Judah and said , “ I can not find her . Also , the men of the place said there was no harlot in this place. ”
NKJV	Genesis	38	23	Then Judah said , “ Let her take them for herself , lest we be shamed ; for I sent this young goat and you have not found her. ”
NKJV	Genesis	38	24	And it came to pass , about three months after , that Judah was told , saying , “ Tamar your daughter-in-law has ( X ) played the harlot ; furthermore she is [ c ] with child by harlotry. ” So Judah said , “ Bring her out ( Y ) and let her be burned ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	38	25	When she was brought out , she sent to her father-in-law , saying , “ By the man to whom these belong , I am with child. ” And she said , ( Z ) “ Please determine whose these are—the signet and cord , and staff. ”
NKJV	Genesis	38	26	So Judah ( AA ) acknowledged them and said , ( AB ) “ She has been more righteous than I , because ( AC ) I did not give her to Shelah my son. ” And he ( AD ) never knew her again .
NKJV	Genesis	38	27	Now it came to pass , at the time for giving birth , that behold , twins were in her womb .
NKJV	Genesis	38	28	And so it was , when she was giving birth , that the one put out his hand ; and the midwife took a scarlet thread and bound it on his hand , saying , “ This one came out first. ”
NKJV	Genesis	38	29	Then it happened , as he drew back his hand , that his brother came out unexpectedly ; and she said , “ How did you break through ? This breach be upon you ! ” Therefore his name was called ( AE ) Perez . [ d ]
NKJV	Genesis	38	30	Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand . And his name was called ( AF ) Zerah .

NKJV	Genesis	39	39	Now Joseph had been taken ( A ) down to Egypt . And ( B ) Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , ( C ) bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there .
NKJV	Genesis	39	2	( D ) The Lord was with Joseph , and he was a successful man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
NKJV	Genesis	39	3	And his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord ( E ) made all he did [ a ] to prosper in his hand .
NKJV	Genesis	39	4	So Joseph ( F ) found favor in his sight , and served him . Then he made him ( G ) overseer of his house , and all that he had he put [ b ] under his authority .
NKJV	Genesis	39	5	So it was , from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had , that ( H ) the Lord blessed the Egyptian ’ s house for Joseph ’ s sake ; and the blessing of the Lord was on all that he had in the house and in the field .
NKJV	Genesis	39	6	Thus he left all that he had in Joseph ’ s [ c ] hand , and he did not know what he had except for the [ d ] bread which he ate . Now Joseph ( I ) was handsome in form and appearance .
NKJV	Genesis	39	7	And it came to pass after these things that his master ’ s wife [ e ] cast longing eyes on Joseph , and she said , ( J ) “ Lie with me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	39	8	But he refused and said to his master ’ s wife , “ Look , my master does not know what is with me in the house , and he has committed all that he has to my hand .
NKJV	Genesis	39	9	There is no one greater in this house than I , nor has he kept back anything from me but you , because you are his wife . ( K ) How then can I do this great wickedness , and ( L ) sin against God ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	39	10	So it was , as she spoke to Joseph day by day , that he ( M ) did not heed her , to lie with her or to be with her .
NKJV	Genesis	39	11	But it happened about this time , when Joseph went into the house to do his work , and none of the men of the house was inside ,
NKJV	Genesis	39	12	that she ( N ) caught him by his garment , saying , “ Lie with me. ” But he left his garment in her hand , and fled and ran outside .
NKJV	Genesis	39	13	And so it was , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and fled outside ,
NKJV	Genesis	39	14	that she called to the men of her house and spoke to them , saying , “ See , he has brought in to us a ( O ) Hebrew to [ f ] mock us . He came in to me to lie with me , and I cried out with a loud voice .
NKJV	Genesis	39	15	And it happened , when he heard that I lifted my voice and cried out , that he left his garment with me , and fled and went outside. ”
NKJV	Genesis	39	16	So she kept his garment with her until his master came home .
NKJV	Genesis	39	17	Then she ( P ) spoke to him with words like these , saying , “ The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to mock me ;
NKJV	Genesis	39	18	so it happened , as I lifted my voice and cried out , that he left his garment with me and fled outside. ”
NKJV	Genesis	39	19	So it was , when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him , saying , “ Your servant did to me after this manner , ” that his ( Q ) anger was aroused .
NKJV	Genesis	39	20	Then Joseph ’ s master took him and ( R ) put him into the ( S ) prison , a place where the king ’ s prisoners were confined . And he was there in the prison .
NKJV	Genesis	39	21	But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy , and He ( T ) gave [ g ] him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
NKJV	Genesis	39	22	And the keeper of the prison ( U ) committed to Joseph ’ s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison ; whatever they did there , it was his doing .
NKJV	Genesis	39	23	The keeper of the prison did not look into anything that was under [ h ] Joseph ’ s authority , because ( V ) the Lord was with him ; and whatever he did , the Lord made it prosper .

NKJV	Genesis	40	40	It came to pass after these things that the ( A ) butler and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their lord , the king of Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	40	2	And Pharaoh was ( B ) angry with his two officers , the chief butler and the chief baker .
NKJV	Genesis	40	3	( C ) So he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , in the prison , the place where Joseph was confined .
NKJV	Genesis	40	4	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them , and he served them ; so they were in custody for a while .
NKJV	Genesis	40	5	Then the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt , who were confined in the prison , ( D ) had a dream , both of them , each man ’ s dream in one night and each man ’ s dream with its own interpretation .
NKJV	Genesis	40	6	And Joseph came in to them in the morning and looked at them , and saw that they were [ a ] sad .
NKJV	Genesis	40	7	So he asked Pharaoh ’ s officers who were with him in the custody of his lord ’ s house , saying , ( E ) “ Why do you look so sad today ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	40	8	And they said to him , ( F ) “ We each have had a dream , and there is no interpreter of it. ” So Joseph said to them , ( G ) “ Do not interpretations belong to God ? Tell them to me , please. ”
NKJV	Genesis	40	9	Then the chief butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , “ Behold , in my dream a vine was before me ,
NKJV	Genesis	40	10	and in the vine were three branches ; it was as though it budded , its blossoms shot forth , and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes .
NKJV	Genesis	40	11	Then Pharaoh ’ s cup was in my hand ; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh ’ s cup , and placed the cup in Pharaoh ’ s hand. ”
NKJV	Genesis	40	12	And Joseph said to him , ( H ) “ This is the interpretation of it : The three branches ( I ) are three days .
NKJV	Genesis	40	13	Now within three days Pharaoh will ( J ) lift up your head and restore you to your [ b ] place , and you will put Pharaoh ’ s cup in his hand according to the former manner , when you were his butler .
NKJV	Genesis	40	14	But ( K ) remember me when it is well with you , and ( L ) please show kindness to me ; make mention of me to Pharaoh , and get me out of this house .
NKJV	Genesis	40	15	For indeed I was ( M ) stolen away from the land of the Hebrews ; ( N ) and also I have done nothing here that they should put me into the dungeon. ”
NKJV	Genesis	40	16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good , he said to Joseph , “ I also was in my dream , and there were three [ c ] white baskets on my head .
NKJV	Genesis	40	17	In the uppermost basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh , and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head. ”
NKJV	Genesis	40	18	So Joseph answered and said , ( O ) “ This is the interpretation of it : The three baskets are three days .
NKJV	Genesis	40	19	( P ) Within three days Pharaoh will lift [ d ] off your head from you and ( Q ) hang you on a tree ; and the birds will eat your flesh from you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	40	20	Now it came to pass on the third day , which was Pharaoh ’ s ( R ) birthday , that he ( S ) made a feast for all his servants ; and he ( T ) lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants .
NKJV	Genesis	40	21	Then he ( U ) restored the chief butler to his butlership again , and ( V ) he placed the cup in Pharaoh ’ s hand .
NKJV	Genesis	40	22	But he ( W ) hanged the chief baker , as Joseph had interpreted to them .
NKJV	Genesis	40	23	Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph , but ( X ) forgot him . Footnotes - Genesis 40:6 dejected - Genesis 40:13 position - Genesis 40:16 Or baskets of white bread - Genesis 40:19 Lit . up Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Genesis	41	41	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ See , I have ( AJ ) set you over all the land of Egypt. ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	2	Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows , fine looking and fat ; and they fed in the meadow .
NKJV	Genesis	41	3	Then behold , seven other cows came up after them out of the river , ugly and gaunt , and stood by the other cows on the bank of the river .
NKJV	Genesis	41	4	And the ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows . So Pharaoh awoke .
NKJV	Genesis	41	5	He slept and dreamed a second time ; and suddenly seven heads of grain came up on one stalk , plump and good .
NKJV	Genesis	41	6	Then behold , seven thin heads , blighted by the ( B ) east wind , sprang up after them .
NKJV	Genesis	41	7	And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads . So Pharaoh awoke , and indeed , it was a dream .
NKJV	Genesis	41	8	Now it came to pass in the morning ( C ) that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all ( D ) the magicians of Egypt and all its ( E ) wise men . And Pharaoh told them his dreams , but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh .
NKJV	Genesis	41	9	Then the ( F ) chief butler spoke to Pharaoh , saying : “ I remember my faults this day .
NKJV	Genesis	41	10	When Pharaoh was ( G ) angry with his servants , ( H ) and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , both me and the chief baker ,
NKJV	Genesis	41	11	( I ) we each had a dream in one night , he and I . Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his own dream .
NKJV	Genesis	41	12	Now there was a young ( J ) Hebrew man with us there , a ( K ) servant of the captain of the guard . And we told him , and he ( L ) interpreted our dreams for us ; to each man he interpreted according to his own dream .
NKJV	Genesis	41	13	And it came to pass , just ( M ) as he interpreted for us , so it happened . He restored me to my office , and he hanged him. ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	14	( N ) Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they ( O ) brought him quickly ( P ) out of the dungeon ; and he shaved , ( Q ) changed his clothing , and came to Pharaoh .
NKJV	Genesis	41	15	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ I have had a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it . ( R ) But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream , to interpret it. ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	16	So Joseph answered Pharaoh , saying , ( S ) “ It is not in me ; ( T ) God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace. ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph : “ Behold , ( U ) in my dream I stood on the bank of the river .
NKJV	Genesis	41	18	Suddenly seven cows came up out of the river , fine looking and fat ; and they fed in the meadow .
NKJV	Genesis	41	19	Then behold , seven other cows came up after them , poor and very ugly and gaunt , such ugliness as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	41	20	And the gaunt and ugly cows ate up the first seven , the fat cows .
NKJV	Genesis	41	21	When they had eaten them up , no one would have known that they had eaten them , for they were just as ugly as at the beginning . So I awoke .
NKJV	Genesis	41	22	Also I saw in my dream , and suddenly seven [ a ] heads came up on one stalk , full and good .
NKJV	Genesis	41	23	Then behold , seven heads , withered , thin , and blighted by the east wind , sprang up after them .
NKJV	Genesis	41	24	And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads . So ( V ) I told this to the magicians , but there was no one who could explain it to me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh , “ The dreams of Pharaoh are one ; ( W ) God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do :
NKJV	Genesis	41	26	The seven good cows are seven years , and the seven good [ b ] heads are seven years ; the dreams are one .
NKJV	Genesis	41	27	And the seven thin and ugly cows which came up after them are seven years , and the seven empty heads blighted by the east wind are ( X ) seven years of famine .
NKJV	Genesis	41	28	( Y ) This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh . God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do .
NKJV	Genesis	41	29	Indeed ( Z ) seven years of great plenty will come throughout all the land of Egypt ;
NKJV	Genesis	41	30	but after them seven years of famine will ( AA ) arise , and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt ; and the famine ( AB ) will deplete the land .
NKJV	Genesis	41	31	So the plenty will not be known in the land because of the famine following , for it will be very severe .
NKJV	Genesis	41	32	And the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice because the ( AC ) thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass .
NKJV	Genesis	41	33	“ Now therefore , let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man , and set him over the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	41	34	Let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint [ c ] officers over the land , ( AD ) to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years .
NKJV	Genesis	41	35	And ( AE ) let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming , and store up grain under the [ d ] authority of Pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
NKJV	Genesis	41	36	Then that food shall be as a [ e ] reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt , that the land ( AF ) may not [ f ] perish during the famine. ” Joseph ’ s Rise to Power
NKJV	Genesis	41	37	So ( AG ) the advice was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants .
NKJV	Genesis	41	38	And Pharaoh said to his servants , “ Can we find such a one as this , a man ( AH ) in whom is the Spirit of God ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Inasmuch as God has shown you all this , there is no one as discerning and wise as you .
NKJV	Genesis	41	40	( AI ) You shall be [ g ] over my house , and all my people shall be ruled according to your word ; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	42	Then Pharaoh ( AK ) took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Joseph ’ s hand ; and he ( AL ) clothed him in garments of fine linen ( AM ) and put a gold chain around his neck .
NKJV	Genesis	41	43	And he had him ride in the second ( AN ) chariot which he had ; ( AO ) and they cried out before him , “ Bow the knee ! ” So he set him ( AP ) over all the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	41	44	Pharaoh also said to Joseph , “ I am Pharaoh , and without your consent no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	45	And Pharaoh called Joseph ’ s name [ h ] Zaphnath-Paaneah . And he gave him as a wife ( AQ ) Asenath , the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On . So Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	41	46	Joseph was thirty years old when he ( AR ) stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	41	47	Now in the seven plentiful years the ground brought forth [ i ] abundantly .
NKJV	Genesis	41	48	So he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities ; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them .
NKJV	Genesis	41	49	Joseph gathered very much grain , ( AS ) as the sand of the sea , until he stopped counting , for it was immeasurable .
NKJV	Genesis	41	50	( AT ) And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came , whom Asenath , the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On , bore to him .
NKJV	Genesis	41	51	Joseph called the name of the firstborn [ j ] Manasseh : “ For God has made me forget all my toil and all my ( AU ) father ’ s house. ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	52	And the name of the second he called [ k ] Ephraim : “ For God has caused me to be ( AV ) fruitful in the land of my affliction. ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	53	Then the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended ,
NKJV	Genesis	41	54	( AW ) and the seven years of famine began to come , ( AX ) as Joseph had said . The famine was in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
NKJV	Genesis	41	55	So when all the land of Egypt was famished , the people cried to Pharaoh for bread . Then Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians , “ Go to Joseph ; ( AY ) whatever he says to you , do. ”
NKJV	Genesis	41	56	The famine was over all the face of the earth , and Joseph opened [ l ] all the storehouses and ( AZ ) sold to the Egyptians . And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	41	57	( BA ) So all countries came to Joseph in Egypt to ( BB ) buy grain , because the famine was severe in all lands .

NKJV	Genesis	42	42	When ( A ) Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt , Jacob said to his sons , “ Why do you look at one another ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	2	And he said , “ Indeed I have heard that there is grain in Egypt ; go down to that place and buy for us there , that we may ( B ) live and not die. ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	3	So Joseph ’ s ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	42	4	But Jacob did not send Joseph ’ s brother Benjamin with his brothers , for he said , ( C ) “ Lest some calamity befall him. ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	5	And the sons of Israel went to buy grain among those who journeyed , for the famine was ( D ) in the land of Canaan .
NKJV	Genesis	42	6	Now Joseph was governor ( E ) over the land ; and it was he who sold to all the people of the land . And Joseph ’ s brothers came and ( F ) bowed down before him with their faces to the earth .
NKJV	Genesis	42	7	Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them , but he acted as ( G ) a stranger to them and spoke [ a ] roughly to them . Then he said to them , “ Where do you come from ? ” And they said , “ From the land of Canaan to buy food. ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	8	So Joseph recognized his brothers , but they did not recognize him .
NKJV	Genesis	42	9	Then Joseph ( H ) remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them , and said to them , “ You are spies ! You have come to see the [ b ] nakedness of the land ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	10	And they said to him , “ No , my lord , but your servants have come to buy food .
NKJV	Genesis	42	11	We are all one man ’ s sons ; we are honest men ; your servants are not spies. ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	12	But he said to them , “ No , but you have come to see the nakedness of the land. ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	13	And they said , “ Your servants are twelve brothers , the sons of one man in the land of Canaan ; and in fact , the youngest is with our father today , and one ( I ) is no more. ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	14	But Joseph said to them , “ It is as I spoke to you , saying , ‘ You are spies ! ’
NKJV	Genesis	42	15	In this manner you shall be tested : ( J ) By the life of Pharaoh , you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here .
NKJV	Genesis	42	16	Send one of you , and let him bring your brother ; and you shall be [ c ] kept in prison , that your words may be tested to see whether there is any truth in you ; or else , by the life of Pharaoh , surely you are spies ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	17	So he [ d ] put them all together in prison ( K ) three days .
NKJV	Genesis	42	18	Then Joseph said to them the third day , “ Do this and live , ( L ) for I fear God :
NKJV	Genesis	42	19	If you are honest men , let one of your brothers be confined to your prison house ; but you , go and carry grain for the famine of your houses .
NKJV	Genesis	42	20	And ( M ) bring your youngest brother to me ; so your words will be verified , and you shall not die. ” And they did so .
NKJV	Genesis	42	21	Then they said to one another , ( N ) “ We are truly guilty concerning our brother , for we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us , and we would not hear ; ( O ) therefore this distress has come upon us. ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	22	And Reuben answered them , saying , ( P ) “ Did I not speak to you , saying , ‘ Do not sin against the boy ’ ; and you would not listen ? Therefore behold , his blood is now ( Q ) required of us. ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	23	But they did not know that Joseph understood them , for he spoke to them through an interpreter .
NKJV	Genesis	42	24	And he turned himself away from them and ( R ) wept . Then he returned to them again , and talked with them . And he took ( S ) Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes . The Brothers Return to Canaan
NKJV	Genesis	42	25	Then Joseph ( T ) gave a command to fill their sacks with grain , to ( U ) restore every man ’ s money to his sack , and to give them provisions for the journey . ( V ) Thus he did for them .
NKJV	Genesis	42	26	So they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there .
NKJV	Genesis	42	27	But as ( W ) one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the encampment , he saw his money ; and there it was , in the mouth of his sack .
NKJV	Genesis	42	28	So he said to his brothers , “ My money has been restored , and there it is , in my sack ! ” Then their hearts [ e ] failed them and they were afraid , saying to one another , “ What is this that God has done to us ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	29	Then they went to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened to them , saying :
NKJV	Genesis	42	30	“ The man who is lord of the land ( X ) spoke [ f ] roughly to us , and took us for spies of the country .
NKJV	Genesis	42	31	But we said to him , ‘ We are honest men ; we are not spies .
NKJV	Genesis	42	32	We are twelve brothers , sons of our father ; one is no more , and the youngest is with our father this day in the land of Canaan. ’
NKJV	Genesis	42	33	Then the man , the lord of the country , said to us , ( Y ) ‘ By this I will know that you are honest men : Leave one of your brothers here with me , take food for the famine of your households , and be gone .
NKJV	Genesis	42	34	And bring your ( Z ) youngest brother to me ; so I shall know that you are not spies , but that you are honest men . I will grant your brother to you , and you may ( AA ) trade in the land. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	35	Then it happened as they emptied their sacks , that surprisingly ( AB ) each man ’ s bundle of money was in his sack ; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
NKJV	Genesis	42	36	And Jacob their father said to them , “ You have ( AC ) bereaved me : Joseph is no more , Simeon is no more , and you want to take ( AD ) Benjamin . All these things are against me. ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	37	Then Reuben spoke to his father , saying , “ Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you ; put him in my hands , and I will bring him back to you. ”
NKJV	Genesis	42	38	But he said , “ My son shall not go down with you , for ( AE ) his brother is dead , and he is left alone . ( AF ) If any calamity should befall him along the way in which you go , then you would ( AG ) bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave. ” Footnotes - Genesis 42:7 harshly - Genesis 42:9 Exposed parts - Genesis 42:16 Lit . bound - Genesis 42:17 Lit . gathered - Genesis 42:28 sank - Genesis 42:30 harshly Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Genesis	43	43	Now the famine was ( A ) severe in the land .
NKJV	Genesis	43	2	And it came to pass , when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought from Egypt , that their father said to them , “ Go ( B ) back , buy us a little food. ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	3	But Judah spoke to him , saying , “ The man solemnly warned us , saying , ‘ You shall not see my face unless your ( C ) brother is with you. ’
NKJV	Genesis	43	4	If you send our brother with us , we will go down and buy you food .
NKJV	Genesis	43	5	But if you will not send him , we will not go down ; for the man said to us , ‘ You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	6	And Israel said , “ Why did you deal so [ a ] wrongfully with me as to tell the man whether you had still another brother ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	7	But they said , “ The man asked us pointedly about ourselves and our family , saying , ‘ Is your father still alive ? Have you another brother ? ’ And we told him according to these words . Could we possibly have known that he would say , ‘ Bring your brother down ’ ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	8	Then Judah said to Israel his father , “ Send the lad with me , and we will arise and go , that we may ( D ) live and not die , both we and you and also our little ones .
NKJV	Genesis	43	9	I myself will be surety for him ; from my hand you shall require him . ( E ) If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you , then let me bear the blame forever .
NKJV	Genesis	43	10	For if we had not lingered , surely by now we would have returned this second time. ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	11	And their father Israel said to them , “ If it must be so , then do this : Take some of the best fruits of the land in your vessels and ( F ) carry down a present for the man—a little ( G ) balm and a little honey , spices and myrrh , pistachio nuts and almonds .
NKJV	Genesis	43	12	Take double money in your hand , and take back in your hand the money ( H ) that was returned in the mouth of your sacks ; perhaps it was an oversight .
NKJV	Genesis	43	13	Take your brother also , and arise , go back to the man .
NKJV	Genesis	43	14	And may God ( I ) Almighty ( J ) give you mercy before the man , that he may release your other brother and Benjamin . ( K ) If I am bereaved , I am bereaved ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	15	So the men took that present and Benjamin , and they took double money in their hand , and arose and went ( L ) down to Egypt ; and they stood before Joseph .
NKJV	Genesis	43	16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the ( M ) steward of his house , “ Take these men to my home , and slaughter [ b ] an animal and make ready ; for these men will dine with me at noon. ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	17	Then the man did as Joseph ordered , and the man brought the men into Joseph ’ s house .
NKJV	Genesis	43	18	Now the men were ( N ) afraid because they were brought into Joseph ’ s house ; and they said , “ It is because of the money , which was returned in our sacks the first time , that we are brought in , so that he may [ c ] make a case against us and seize us , to take us as slaves with our donkeys. ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	19	When they drew near to the steward of Joseph ’ s house , they talked with him at the door of the house ,
NKJV	Genesis	43	20	and said , “ O sir , ( O ) we indeed came down the first time to buy food ;
NKJV	Genesis	43	21	but ( P ) it happened , when we came to the encampment , that we opened our sacks , and there , each man ’ s money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight ; so we have brought it back in our hand .
NKJV	Genesis	43	22	And we have brought down other money in our hands to buy food . We do not know who put our money in our sacks. ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	23	But he said , “ Peace be with you , do not be afraid . Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks ; I had your money. ” Then he brought ( Q ) Simeon out to them .
NKJV	Genesis	43	24	So the man brought the men into Joseph ’ s house and ( R ) gave them water , and they washed their feet ; and he gave their donkeys feed .
NKJV	Genesis	43	25	Then they made the present ready for Joseph ’ s coming at noon , for they heard that they would eat bread there .
NKJV	Genesis	43	26	And when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and ( S ) bowed down before him to the earth .
NKJV	Genesis	43	27	Then he asked them about their well-being , and said , “ Is your father well , the old man ( T ) of whom you spoke ? Is he still alive ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	28	And they answered , “ Your servant our father is in good health ; he is still alive. ” ( U ) And they bowed their heads down and prostrated themselves .
NKJV	Genesis	43	29	Then he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin , ( V ) his mother ’ s son , and said , “ Is this your younger brother ( W ) of whom you spoke to me ? ” And he said , “ God be gracious to you , my son. ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	30	Now ( X ) his heart yearned for his brother ; so Joseph made haste and sought somewhere to weep . And he went into his chamber and ( Y ) wept there .
NKJV	Genesis	43	31	Then he washed his face and came out ; and he restrained himself , and said , “ Serve the ( Z ) bread. ”
NKJV	Genesis	43	32	So they set him a place by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves ; because the Egyptians could not eat food with the ( AA ) Hebrews , for that is ( AB ) an abomination to the Egyptians .
NKJV	Genesis	43	33	And they sat before him , the firstborn according to his ( AC ) birthright and the youngest according to his youth ; and the men looked in astonishment at one another .
NKJV	Genesis	43	34	Then he took servings to them from before him , but Benjamin ’ s serving was ( AD ) five times as much as any of theirs . So they drank and were merry with him .

NKJV	Genesis	44	44	And he commanded [ a ] the ( A ) steward of his house , saying , ( B ) “ Fill the men ’ s sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put each man ’ s money in the mouth of his sack .
NKJV	Genesis	44	2	Also put my cup , the silver cup , in the mouth of the sack of the youngest , and his grain money. ” So he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
NKJV	Genesis	44	3	As soon as the morning dawned , the men were sent away , they and their donkeys .
NKJV	Genesis	44	4	When they had gone out of the city , and were not yet far off , Joseph said to his steward , “ Get up , follow the men ; and when you overtake them , say to them , ‘ Why have you ( C ) repaid evil for good ?
NKJV	Genesis	44	5	Is not this the one from which my lord drinks , and with which he indeed practices divination ? You have done evil in so doing. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	44	6	So he overtook them , and he spoke to them these same words .
NKJV	Genesis	44	7	And they said to him , “ Why does my lord say these words ? Far be it from us that your servants should do such a thing .
NKJV	Genesis	44	8	Look , we brought back to you from the land of Canaan ( D ) the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks . How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord ’ s house ?
NKJV	Genesis	44	9	With whomever of your servants it is found , ( E ) let him die , and we also will be my lord ’ s slaves. ”
NKJV	Genesis	44	10	And he said , “ Now also let it be according to your words ; he with whom it is found shall be my slave , and you shall be blameless. ”
NKJV	Genesis	44	11	Then each man speedily let down his sack to the ground , and each opened his sack .
NKJV	Genesis	44	12	So he searched . He began with the oldest and [ b ] left off with the youngest ; and the cup was found in Benjamin ’ s sack .
NKJV	Genesis	44	13	Then they ( F ) tore their clothes , and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city .
NKJV	Genesis	44	14	So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph ’ s house , and he was still there ; and they ( G ) fell before him on the ground .
NKJV	Genesis	44	15	And Joseph said to them , “ What deed is this you have done ? Did you not know that such a man as I can certainly practice divination ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	44	16	Then Judah said , “ What shall we say to my lord ? What shall we speak ? Or how shall we clear ourselves ? God has ( H ) found out the iniquity of your servants ; here ( I ) we are , my lord ’ s slaves , both we and he also with whom the cup was found. ”
NKJV	Genesis	44	17	But he said , ( J ) “ Far be it from me that I should do so ; the man in whose hand the cup was found , he shall be my slave . And as for you , go up in peace to your father. ” Judah Intercedes for Benjamin
NKJV	Genesis	44	18	Then Judah came near to him and said : “ O my lord , please let your servant speak a word in my lord ’ s hearing , and ( K ) do not let your anger burn against your servant ; for you are even like Pharaoh .
NKJV	Genesis	44	19	My lord asked his servants , saying , ‘ Have you a father or a brother ? ’
NKJV	Genesis	44	20	And we said to my lord , ‘ We have a father , an old man , and ( L ) a child of his old age , who is young ; his brother is ( M ) dead , and he ( N ) alone is left of his mother ’ s children , and his ( O ) father loves him. ’
NKJV	Genesis	44	21	Then you said to your servants , ( P ) ‘ Bring him down to me , that I may set my eyes on him. ’
NKJV	Genesis	44	22	And we said to my lord , ‘ The lad can not leave his father , for if he should leave his father , his father would die. ’
NKJV	Genesis	44	23	But you said to your servants , ( Q ) ‘ Unless your youngest brother comes down with you , you shall see my face no more. ’
NKJV	Genesis	44	24	“ So it was , when we went up to your servant my father , that we told him the words of my lord .
NKJV	Genesis	44	25	And ( R ) our father said , ‘ Go back and buy us a little food. ’
NKJV	Genesis	44	26	But we said , ‘ We can not go down ; if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down ; for we may not see the man ’ s face unless our youngest brother is with us. ’
NKJV	Genesis	44	27	Then your servant my father said to us , ‘ You know that ( S ) my wife bore me two sons ;
NKJV	Genesis	44	28	and the one went out from me , and I said , ( T ) “ Surely he is torn to pieces ” ; and I have not seen him since .
NKJV	Genesis	44	29	But if you ( U ) take this one also from me , and calamity befalls him , you shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave. ’
NKJV	Genesis	44	30	“ Now therefore , when I come to your servant my father , and the lad is not with us , since ( V ) his life is bound up in the lad ’ s life ,
NKJV	Genesis	44	31	it will happen , when he sees that the lad is not with us , that he will die . So your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave .
NKJV	Genesis	44	32	For your servant became surety for the lad to my father , saying , ( W ) ‘ If I do not bring him back to you , then I shall bear the blame before my father forever. ’
NKJV	Genesis	44	33	Now therefore , please ( X ) let your servant remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord , and let the lad go up with his brothers .
NKJV	Genesis	44	34	For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me , lest perhaps I see the evil that would [ c ] come upon my father ? ” Footnotes - Genesis 44:1 Lit . the one over - Genesis 44:12 finished with - Genesis 44:34 Lit . find Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Genesis	45	45	Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood by him , and he cried out , “ Make everyone go out from me ! ” So no one stood with him ( A ) while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
NKJV	Genesis	45	2	And he ( B ) wept aloud , and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it .
NKJV	Genesis	45	3	Then Joseph said to his brothers , ( C ) “ I am Joseph ; does my father still live ? ” But his brothers could not answer him , for they were dismayed in his presence .
NKJV	Genesis	45	4	And Joseph said to his brothers , “ Please come near to me. ” So they came near . Then he said : “ I am Joseph your brother , ( D ) whom you sold into Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	45	5	But now , do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here ; ( E ) for God sent me before you to preserve life .
NKJV	Genesis	45	6	For these two years the ( F ) famine has been in the land , and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting .
NKJV	Genesis	45	7	And God ( G ) sent me before you to preserve a [ a ] posterity for you in the earth , and to save your lives by a great deliverance .
NKJV	Genesis	45	8	So now it was not you who sent me here , but ( H ) God ; and He has made me ( I ) a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ( J ) ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Genesis	45	9	“ Hurry and go up to my father , and say to him , ‘ Thus says your son Joseph : “ God has made me lord of all Egypt ; come down to me , do not [ b ] tarry .
NKJV	Genesis	45	10	( K ) You shall dwell in the land of Goshen , and you shall be near to me , you and your children , your children ’ s children , your flocks and your herds , and all that you have .
NKJV	Genesis	45	11	There I will ( L ) provide for you , lest you and your household , and all that you have , come to poverty ; for there are still five years of famine. ” ’
NKJV	Genesis	45	12	“ And behold , your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is ( M ) my mouth that speaks to you .
NKJV	Genesis	45	13	So you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that you have seen ; and you shall hurry and ( N ) bring my father down here. ”
NKJV	Genesis	45	14	Then he fell on his brother Benjamin ’ s neck and wept , and Benjamin wept on his neck .
NKJV	Genesis	45	15	Moreover he ( O ) kissed all his brothers and wept over them , and after that his brothers talked with him .
NKJV	Genesis	45	16	Now the report of it was heard in Pharaoh ’ s house , saying , “ Joseph ’ s brothers have come. ” So it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well .
NKJV	Genesis	45	17	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Say to your brothers , ‘ Do this : Load your animals and depart ; go to the land of Canaan .
NKJV	Genesis	45	18	Bring your father and your households and come to me ; I will give you the best of the land of Egypt , and you will eat ( P ) the [ c ] fat of the land .
NKJV	Genesis	45	19	Now you are commanded—do this : Take carts out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives ; bring your father and come .
NKJV	Genesis	45	20	Also do not be concerned about your goods , for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	45	21	Then the sons of Israel did so ; and Joseph gave them ( Q ) carts , [ d ] according to the command of Pharaoh , and he gave them provisions for the journey .
NKJV	Genesis	45	22	He gave to all of them , to each man , ( R ) changes of garments ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and ( S ) five changes of garments .
NKJV	Genesis	45	23	And he sent to his father these things : ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain , bread , and food for his father for the journey .
NKJV	Genesis	45	24	So he sent his brothers away , and they departed ; and he said to them , “ See that you do not become troubled along the way. ”
NKJV	Genesis	45	25	Then they went up out of Egypt , and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father .
NKJV	Genesis	45	26	And they told him , saying , “ Joseph is still alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. ” ( T ) And Jacob ’ s heart stood still , because he did not believe them .
NKJV	Genesis	45	27	But when they told him all the words which Joseph had said to them , and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit ( U ) of Jacob their father revived .
NKJV	Genesis	45	28	Then Israel said , “ It is enough . Joseph my son is still alive . I will go and see him before I die. ” Footnotes - Genesis 45:7 remnant - Genesis 45:9 delay - Genesis 45:18 The choicest produce - Genesis 45:21 wagons Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Genesis	46	46	So Israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to ( B ) Beersheba , and offered sacrifices ( C ) to the God of his father Isaac .
NKJV	Genesis	46	2	Then God spoke to Israel ( D ) in the visions of the night , and said , “ Jacob , Jacob ! ” And he said , “ Here I am. ”
NKJV	Genesis	46	3	So He said , “ I am God , ( E ) the God of your father ; do not fear to go down to Egypt , for I will ( F ) make of you a great nation there .
NKJV	Genesis	46	4	( G ) I will go down with you to Egypt , and I will also surely ( H ) bring you up again ; and ( I ) Joseph [ a ] will put his hand on your eyes. ”
NKJV	Genesis	46	5	Then ( J ) Jacob arose from Beersheba ; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob , their little ones , and their wives , in the [ b ] carts ( K ) which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
NKJV	Genesis	46	6	So they took their livestock and their goods , which they had acquired in the land of Canaan , and went to Egypt , ( L ) Jacob and all his descendants with him .
NKJV	Genesis	46	7	His sons and his sons ’ sons , his daughters and his sons ’ daughters , and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt .

NKJV	Genesis	46	28	Then he sent Judah before him to Joseph , ( AL ) to point out before him the way to Goshen . And they came ( AM ) to the land of Goshen .
NKJV	Genesis	46	29	So Joseph made ready his ( AN ) chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel ; and he presented himself to him , and ( AO ) fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while .
NKJV	Genesis	46	30	And Israel said to Joseph , ( AP ) “ Now let me die , since I have seen your face , because you are still alive. ”
NKJV	Genesis	46	31	Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father ’ s household , ( AQ ) “ I will go up and tell Pharaoh , and say to him , ‘ My brothers and those of my father ’ s house , who were in the land of Canaan , have come to me .

NKJV	Genesis	46	34	that you shall say , ‘ Your servants ’ ( AT ) occupation has been with livestock ( AU ) from our youth even till now , both we and also our fathers , ’ that you may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is ( AV ) an [ o ] abomination to the Egyptians. ” Footnotes - Genesis 46:4 Will close your eyes when you die - Genesis 46:5 wagons - Genesis 46:10 Nemuel ,

NKJV	Genesis	47	47	Then Joseph ( A ) went and told Pharaoh , and said , “ My father and my brothers , their flocks and their herds and all that they possess , have come from the land of Canaan ; and indeed they are in ( B ) the land of Goshen. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	2	And he took five men from among his brothers and ( C ) presented them to Pharaoh .
NKJV	Genesis	47	3	Then Pharaoh said to his brothers , ( D ) “ What is your occupation ? ” And they said to Pharaoh , ( E ) “ Your servants are shepherds , both we and also our fathers. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	4	And they said to Pharaoh , ( F ) “ We have come to dwell in the land , because your servants have no pasture for their flocks , ( G ) for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan . Now therefore , please let your servants ( H ) dwell in the land of Goshen. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	5	Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph , saying , “ Your father and your brothers have come to you .
NKJV	Genesis	47	6	( I ) The land of Egypt is before you . Have your father and brothers dwell in the best of the land ; let them dwell ( J ) in the land of Goshen . And if you know any competent men among them , then make them chief herdsmen over my livestock. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	7	Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and set him before Pharaoh ; and Jacob ( K ) blessed Pharaoh .
NKJV	Genesis	47	8	Pharaoh said to Jacob , “ How old are you ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	9	And Jacob said to Pharaoh , ( L ) “ The days of the years of my [ a ] pilgrimage are ( M ) one hundred and thirty years ; ( N ) few and evil have been the days of the years of my life , and ( O ) they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	10	So Jacob ( P ) blessed Pharaoh , and went out from before Pharaoh .
NKJV	Genesis	47	11	And Joseph situated his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of ( Q ) Rameses , ( R ) as Pharaoh had commanded .
NKJV	Genesis	47	12	Then Joseph provided ( S ) his father , his brothers , and all his father ’ s household with bread , according to the number in their families . Joseph Deals with the Famine
NKJV	Genesis	47	13	Now there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very severe , ( T ) so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine .
NKJV	Genesis	47	14	( U ) And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan , for the grain which they bought ; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh ’ s house .
NKJV	Genesis	47	15	So when the money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said , “ Give us bread , for ( V ) why should we die in your presence ? For the money has failed. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	16	Then Joseph said , “ Give your livestock , and I will give you bread for your livestock , if the money is gone. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph , and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses , the flocks , the cattle of the herds , and for the donkeys . Thus he [ b ] fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock that year .
NKJV	Genesis	47	18	When that year had ended , they came to him the next year and said to him , “ We will not hide from my lord that our money is gone ; my lord also has our herds of livestock . There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands .
NKJV	Genesis	47	19	Why should we die before your eyes , both we and our land ? Buy us and our land for bread , and we and our land will be servants of Pharaoh ; give us seed , that we may ( W ) live and not die , that the land may not be desolate. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	20	Then Joseph ( X ) bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh ; for every man of the Egyptians sold his field , because the famine was severe upon them . So the land became Pharaoh ’ s .
NKJV	Genesis	47	21	And as for the people , he [ c ] moved them into the cities , from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other end .
NKJV	Genesis	47	22	( Y ) Only the land of the ( Z ) priests he did not buy ; for the priests had rations allotted to them by Pharaoh , and they ate their rations which Pharaoh gave them ; therefore they did not sell their lands .
NKJV	Genesis	47	23	Then Joseph said to the people , “ Indeed I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh . Look , here is seed for you , and you shall sow the land .
NKJV	Genesis	47	24	And it shall come to pass in the harvest that you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh . Four-fifths shall be your own , as seed for the field and for your food , for those of your households and as food for your little ones. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	25	So they said , “ You have saved ( AA ) our lives ; let us find favor in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh ’ s servants. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	26	And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day , that Pharaoh should have one-fifth , ( AB ) except for the land of the priests only , which did not become Pharaoh ’ s . Joseph ’ s Vow to Jacob
NKJV	Genesis	47	27	So Israel ( AC ) dwelt in the land of Egypt , in the country of Goshen ; and they had possessions there and ( AD ) grew and multiplied exceedingly .
NKJV	Genesis	47	28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years . So the length of Jacob ’ s life was one hundred and forty-seven years .
NKJV	Genesis	47	29	When the time ( AE ) drew near that Israel must die , he called his son Joseph and said to him , “ Now if I have found favor in your sight , please ( AF ) put your hand under my thigh , and ( AG ) deal kindly and truly with me . ( AH ) Please do not bury me in Egypt ,
NKJV	Genesis	47	30	but ( AI ) let me lie with my fathers ; you shall carry me out of Egypt and ( AJ ) bury me in their burial place. ” And he said , “ I will do as you have said. ”
NKJV	Genesis	47	31	Then he said , “ Swear to me. ” And he swore to him . So ( AK ) Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed .

NKJV	Genesis	48	48	Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told , “ Indeed your father is sick ” ; and he took with him his two sons , ( B ) Manasseh and Ephraim .
NKJV	Genesis	48	2	And Jacob was told , “ Look , your son Joseph is coming to you ” ; and Israel [ a ] strengthened himself and sat up on the bed .
NKJV	Genesis	48	3	Then Jacob said to Joseph : “ God ( C ) Almighty appeared to me at ( D ) Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me ,
NKJV	Genesis	48	4	and said to me , ‘ Behold , I will ( E ) make you fruitful and multiply you , and I will make of you a multitude of people , and ( F ) give this land to your descendants after you ( G ) as an everlasting possession. ’
NKJV	Genesis	48	5	And now your ( H ) two sons , Ephraim and Manasseh , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt , are mine ; as Reuben and Simeon , they shall be mine .
NKJV	Genesis	48	6	Your [ b ] offspring [ c ] whom you beget after them shall be yours ; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance .
NKJV	Genesis	48	7	But as for me , when I came from Padan , ( I ) Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way , when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath ; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath ( that is , Bethlehem ) . ”
NKJV	Genesis	48	8	Then Israel saw Joseph ’ s sons , and said , “ Who are these ? ”
NKJV	Genesis	48	9	Joseph said to his father , “ They are my sons , whom God has given me in this place. ” And he said , “ Please bring them to me , and ( J ) I will bless them. ”
NKJV	Genesis	48	10	Now ( K ) the eyes of Israel were dim with age , so that he could not see . Then Joseph brought them near him , and he ( L ) kissed them and embraced them .
NKJV	Genesis	48	11	And Israel said to Joseph , ( M ) “ I had not thought to see your face ; but in fact , God has also shown me your offspring ! ”
NKJV	Genesis	48	12	So Joseph brought them from beside his knees , and he bowed down with his face to the earth .
NKJV	Genesis	48	13	And Joseph took them both , Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel ’ s left hand , and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel ’ s right hand , and brought them near him .
NKJV	Genesis	48	14	Then Israel stretched out his right hand and ( N ) laid it on Ephraim ’ s head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Manasseh ’ s head , ( O ) guiding his hands knowingly , for Manasseh was the ( P ) firstborn .
NKJV	Genesis	48	15	And ( Q ) he blessed Joseph , and said : “ God , ( R ) before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked , The God who has fed me all my life long to this day ,
NKJV	Genesis	48	16	The Angel ( S ) who has redeemed me from all evil , Bless the lads ; Let ( T ) my name be named upon them , And the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; And let them ( U ) grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. ”
NKJV	Genesis	48	17	Now when Joseph saw that his father ( V ) laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim , it displeased him ; so he took hold of his father ’ s hand to remove it from Ephraim ’ s head to Manasseh ’ s head .
NKJV	Genesis	48	18	And Joseph said to his father , “ Not so , my father , for this one is the firstborn ; put your right hand on his head. ”
NKJV	Genesis	48	19	But his father refused and said , ( W ) “ I know , my son , I know . He also shall become a people , and he also shall be great ; but truly ( X ) his younger brother shall be greater than he , and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations. ”
NKJV	Genesis	48	20	So he blessed them that day , saying , ( Y ) “ By you Israel will bless , saying , ‘ May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh ! ’ ” And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh .
NKJV	Genesis	48	21	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ Behold , I am dying , but ( Z ) God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers .
NKJV	Genesis	48	22	Moreover ( AA ) I have given to you one [ d ] portion above your brothers , which I took from the hand ( AB ) of the Amorite with my sword and my bow. ” Footnotes - Genesis 48:2 Collected his strength - Genesis 48:6 children - Genesis 48:6 Who are born to you - Genesis 48:22 Lit . shoulder Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Genesis	50	50	Then Joseph ( A ) fell on his father ’ s face and ( B ) wept over him , and kissed him .
NKJV	Genesis	50	2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to ( C ) embalm his father . So the physicians embalmed Israel .
NKJV	Genesis	50	3	Forty days were required for him , for such are the days required for those who are embalmed ; and the Egyptians ( D ) mourned [ a ] for him seventy days .
NKJV	Genesis	50	4	Now when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph spoke to ( E ) the household of Pharaoh , saying , “ If now I have found favor in your eyes , please speak in the hearing of Pharaoh , saying ,
NKJV	Genesis	50	5	( F ) ‘ My father made me swear , saying , “ Behold , I am dying ; in my grave ( G ) which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan , there you shall bury me. ” Now therefore , please let me go up and bury my father , and I will come back. ’ ”
NKJV	Genesis	50	6	And Pharaoh said , “ Go up and bury your father , as he made you swear. ”
NKJV	Genesis	50	7	So Joseph went up to bury his father ; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
NKJV	Genesis	50	8	as well as all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father ’ s house . Only their little ones , their flocks , and their herds they left in the land of Goshen .
NKJV	Genesis	50	9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen , and it was a very great gathering .
NKJV	Genesis	50	10	Then they came to the threshing floor of Atad , which is beyond the Jordan , and they ( H ) mourned there with a great and very solemn lamentation . ( I ) He observed seven days of mourning for his father .
NKJV	Genesis	50	11	And when the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad , they said , “ This is a deep mourning of the Egyptians. ” Therefore its name was called [ b ] Abel Mizraim , which is beyond the Jordan .
NKJV	Genesis	50	12	So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them .
NKJV	Genesis	50	13	For ( J ) his sons carried him to the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , before Mamre , which Abraham ( K ) bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place .
NKJV	Genesis	50	14	And after he had buried his father , Joseph returned to Egypt , he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father . Joseph Reassures His Brothers
NKJV	Genesis	50	15	When Joseph ’ s brothers saw that their father was dead , ( L ) they said , “ Perhaps Joseph will hate us , and may [ c ] actually repay us for all the evil which we did to him. ”
NKJV	Genesis	50	16	So they sent messengers to Joseph , saying , “ Before your father died he commanded , saying ,
NKJV	Genesis	50	17	‘ Thus you shall say to Joseph : “ I beg you , please forgive the trespass of your brothers and their sin ; ( M ) for they did evil to you. ” ’ Now , please , forgive the trespass of the servants of ( N ) the God of your father. ” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him .
NKJV	Genesis	50	18	Then his brothers also went and ( O ) fell down before his face , and they said , “ Behold , we are your servants. ”
NKJV	Genesis	50	19	Joseph said to them , ( P ) “ Do not be afraid , ( Q ) for am I in the place of God ?
NKJV	Genesis	50	20	( R ) But as for you , you meant evil against me ; but ( S ) God meant it for good , in order to bring it about as it is this day , to save many people alive .
NKJV	Genesis	50	21	Now therefore , do not be afraid ; ( T ) I will provide for you and your little ones. ” And he comforted them and spoke [ d ] kindly to them . Death of Joseph ( U )
NKJV	Genesis	50	22	So Joseph dwelt in Egypt , he and his father ’ s household . And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years .
NKJV	Genesis	50	23	Joseph saw Ephraim ’ s children ( V ) to the third generation . ( W ) The children of Machir , the son of Manasseh , ( X ) were also brought up on Joseph ’ s knees .
NKJV	Genesis	50	24	And Joseph said to his brethren , “ I am dying ; but ( Y ) God will surely visit you , and bring you out of this land to the land ( Z ) of which He swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob. ”
NKJV	Genesis	50	25	Then ( AA ) Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel , saying , “ God will surely [ e ] visit you , and ( AB ) you shall carry up my ( AC ) bones from here. ”
NKJV	Genesis	50	26	So Joseph died , being one hundred and ten years old ; and they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in Egypt . Footnotes - Genesis 50:3 Lit . wept - Genesis 50:11 Lit .

NKJV	Exodus	1	1	Now ( A ) these are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt ; each man and his household came with Jacob :
NKJV	Exodus	1	2	Reuben , Simeon , Levi , and Judah ;
NKJV	Exodus	1	3	Issachar , Zebulun , and Benjamin ;
NKJV	Exodus	1	4	Dan , Naphtali , Gad , and Asher .
NKJV	Exodus	1	5	All those [ a ] who were descendants of Jacob were ( B ) seventy [ b ] persons ( for Joseph was in Egypt already ) .
NKJV	Exodus	1	6	And ( C ) Joseph died , all his brothers , and all that generation .
NKJV	Exodus	1	7	( D ) But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly , multiplied and [ c ] grew exceedingly mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
NKJV	Exodus	1	8	Now there arose a new king over Egypt , ( E ) who did not know Joseph .
NKJV	Exodus	1	9	And he said to his people , “ Look , the people of the children of Israel are more and ( F ) mightier than we ;
NKJV	Exodus	1	10	( G ) come , let us ( H ) deal shrewdly with them , lest they multiply , and it happen , in the event of war , that they also join our enemies and fight against us , and so go up out of the land. ”
NKJV	Exodus	1	11	Therefore they set taskmasters over them ( I ) to afflict them with their ( J ) burdens . And they built for Pharaoh ( K ) supply cities , Pithom ( L ) and Raamses .
NKJV	Exodus	1	12	But the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew . And they were in dread of the children of Israel .
NKJV	Exodus	1	13	So the Egyptians made the children of Israel ( M ) serve with [ d ] rigor .
NKJV	Exodus	1	14	And they ( N ) made their lives bitter with hard bondage— ( O ) in mortar , in brick , and in all manner of service in the field . All their service in which they made them serve was with rigor .
NKJV	Exodus	1	15	Then the king of Egypt spoke to the ( P ) Hebrew midwives , of whom the name of one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah ;
NKJV	Exodus	1	16	and he said , “ When you do the duties of a midwife for the Hebrew women , and see them on the birthstools , if it is a ( Q ) son , then you shall kill him ; but if it is a daughter , then she shall live. ”
NKJV	Exodus	1	17	But the midwives ( R ) feared God , and did not do ( S ) as the king of Egypt commanded them , but saved the male children alive .
NKJV	Exodus	1	18	So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them , “ Why have you done this thing , and saved the male children alive ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	1	19	And ( T ) the midwives said to Pharaoh , “ Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women ; for they [ e ] are lively and give birth before the midwives come to them. ”
NKJV	Exodus	1	20	( U ) Therefore God dealt well with the midwives , and the people multiplied and [ f ] grew very mighty .
NKJV	Exodus	1	21	And so it was , because the midwives feared God , ( V ) that He [ g ] provided households for them .
NKJV	Exodus	1	22	So Pharaoh commanded all his people , saying , ( W ) “ Every son who is [ h ] born you shall cast into the river , and every daughter you shall save alive. ” Footnotes - Exodus 1:5 Lit . who came from the loins of - Exodus 1:5 DSS , LXX seventy-five ; cf .

NKJV	Exodus	2	2	So the woman conceived and bore a son . And ( C ) when she saw that he was a beautiful child , she hid him three months .
NKJV	Exodus	2	3	But when she could no longer hide him , she took an ark of ( D ) bulrushes for him , daubed it with ( E ) asphalt and ( F ) pitch , put the child in it , and laid it in the reeds ( G ) by the river ’ s bank .
NKJV	Exodus	2	4	( H ) And his sister stood afar off , to know what would be done to him .
NKJV	Exodus	2	5	Then the ( I ) daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river . And her maidens walked along the riverside ; and when she saw the ark among the reeds , she sent her maid to get it .
NKJV	Exodus	2	6	And when she opened it , she saw the child , and behold , the baby wept . So she had compassion on him , and said , “ This is one of the Hebrews ’ children. ”
NKJV	Exodus	2	7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh ’ s daughter , “ Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for you ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	2	8	And Pharaoh ’ s daughter said to her , “ Go. ” So the maiden went and called the child ’ s mother .
NKJV	Exodus	2	9	Then Pharaoh ’ s daughter said to her , “ Take this child away and nurse him for me , and I will give you your wages. ” So the woman took the child and nursed him .
NKJV	Exodus	2	10	And the child grew , and she brought him to Pharaoh ’ s daughter , and he became ( J ) her son . So she called his name [ a ] Moses , saying , “ Because I drew him out of the water. ” Moses Flees to Midian ( K )
NKJV	Exodus	2	11	Now it came to pass in those days , ( L ) when Moses was grown , that he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens . And he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew , one of his brethren .
NKJV	Exodus	2	12	So he looked this way and that way , and when he saw no one , he ( M ) killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand .
NKJV	Exodus	2	13	And ( N ) when he went out the second day , behold , two Hebrew men ( O ) were fighting , and he said to the one who did the wrong , “ Why are you striking your companion ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	2	14	Then he said , ( P ) “ Who made you a prince and a judge over us ? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian ? ” So Moses ( Q ) feared and said , “ Surely this thing is known ! ”
NKJV	Exodus	2	15	When Pharaoh heard of this matter , he sought to kill Moses . But ( R ) Moses fled from [ b ] the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of ( S ) Midian ; and he sat down by ( T ) a well .
NKJV	Exodus	2	16	( U ) Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters . ( V ) And they came and drew water , and they filled the ( W ) troughs to water their father ’ s flock .
NKJV	Exodus	2	17	Then the ( X ) shepherds came and ( Y ) drove them away ; but Moses stood up and helped them , and ( Z ) watered their flock .
NKJV	Exodus	2	18	When they came to ( AA ) Reuel [ c ] their father , ( AB ) he said , “ How is it that you have come so soon today ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	2	19	And they said , “ An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds , and he also drew enough water for us and watered the flock. ”
NKJV	Exodus	2	20	So he said to his daughters , “ And where is he ? Why is it that you have left the man ? Call him , that he may ( AC ) eat bread. ”
NKJV	Exodus	2	21	Then Moses was content to live with the man , and he gave ( AD ) Zipporah his daughter to Moses .
NKJV	Exodus	2	22	And she bore him a son . He called his name ( AE ) Gershom , [ d ] for he said , “ I have been ( AF ) a [ e ] stranger in a foreign land. ”
NKJV	Exodus	2	23	Now it happened ( AG ) in the process of time that the king of Egypt died . Then the children of Israel ( AH ) groaned because of the bondage , and they cried out ; and ( AI ) their cry came up to God because of the bondage .
NKJV	Exodus	2	24	So God ( AJ ) heard their groaning , and God ( AK ) remembered His ( AL ) covenant with Abraham , with Isaac , and with Jacob .

NKJV	Exodus	3	3	Then Moses said , “ I will now turn aside and see this ( G ) great sight , why the bush does not burn. ”
NKJV	Exodus	3	2	And ( F ) the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush . So he looked , and behold , the bush was burning with fire , but the bush was not consumed .
NKJV	Exodus	3	4	So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to look , God called ( H ) to him from the midst of the bush and said , “ Moses , Moses ! ” And he said , “ Here I am. ”
NKJV	Exodus	3	5	Then He said , “ Do not draw near this place . ( I ) Take your sandals off your feet , for the place where you stand is holy ground. ”
NKJV	Exodus	3	6	Moreover He said , ( J ) “ I am the God of your father—the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ” And Moses hid his face , for ( K ) he was afraid to look upon God .
NKJV	Exodus	3	7	And the Lord said : ( L ) “ I have surely seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt , and have heard their cry ( M ) because of their taskmasters , ( N ) for I know their [ a ] sorrows .
NKJV	Exodus	3	8	So ( O ) I have come down to ( P ) deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up from that land ( Q ) to a good and large land , to a land ( R ) flowing with milk and honey , to the place of ( S ) the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites .
NKJV	Exodus	3	9	Now therefore , behold , ( T ) the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me , and I have also seen the ( U ) oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them .
NKJV	Exodus	3	10	( V ) Come now , therefore , and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people , the children of Israel , out of Egypt. ”
NKJV	Exodus	3	11	But Moses said to God , ( W ) “ Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh , and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	3	12	So He said , ( X ) “ I will certainly be with you . And this shall be a ( Y ) sign to you that I have sent you : When you have brought the people out of Egypt , you shall serve God on this mountain. ”
NKJV	Exodus	3	13	Then Moses said to God , “ Indeed , when I come to the children of Israel and say to them , ‘ The God of your fathers has sent me to you , ’ and they say to me , ‘ What is His name ? ’ what shall I say to them ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	3	14	And God said to Moses , “ I AM WHO I AM. ” And He said , “ Thus you shall say to the children of Israel , ( Z ) ‘ I AM has sent me to you. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	3	15	Moreover God said to Moses , “ Thus you shall say to the children of Israel : ‘ The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has sent me to you . This is ( AA ) My name forever , and this is My memorial to all generations. ’
NKJV	Exodus	3	16	Go and ( AB ) gather the elders of Israel together , and say to them , ‘ The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , appeared to me , saying , ( AC ) “ I have surely visited you and seen what is done to you in Egypt ;
NKJV	Exodus	3	17	and I have said ( AD ) I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites , to a land flowing with milk and honey. ” ’
NKJV	Exodus	3	18	Then ( AE ) they will heed your voice ; and ( AF ) you shall come , you and the elders of Israel , to the king of Egypt ; and you shall say to him , ‘ The Lord God of the Hebrews has ( AG ) met with us ; and now , please , let us go three days ’ journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God. ’
NKJV	Exodus	3	19	But I am sure that the king of Egypt ( AH ) will not let you go , no , not even by a mighty hand .
NKJV	Exodus	3	20	So I will ( AI ) stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with ( AJ ) all My wonders which I will do in its midst ; and ( AK ) after that he will let you go .
NKJV	Exodus	3	21	And ( AL ) I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians ; and it shall be , when you go , that you shall not go empty-handed .
NKJV	Exodus	3	22	( AM ) But every woman shall ask of her neighbor , namely , of her who dwells near her house , ( AN ) articles of silver , articles of gold , and clothing ; and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters .

NKJV	Exodus	4	4	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Reach out your hand and take it by the tail ” ( and he reached out his hand and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand ) ,
NKJV	Exodus	4	2	So the Lord said to him , “ What is that in your hand ? ” He said , “ A rod. ”
NKJV	Exodus	4	3	And He said , “ Cast it on the ground. ” So he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from it .
NKJV	Exodus	4	5	“ that they may ( A ) believe that the ( B ) Lord God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has appeared to you. ”
NKJV	Exodus	4	6	Furthermore the Lord said to him , “ Now put your hand in your bosom. ” And he put his hand in his bosom , and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous , ( C ) like snow .
NKJV	Exodus	4	7	And He said , “ Put your hand in your bosom again. ” So he put his hand in his bosom again , and drew it out of his bosom , and behold , ( D ) it was restored like his other flesh .
NKJV	Exodus	4	8	“ Then it will be , if they do not believe you , nor heed the message of the ( E ) first sign , that they may believe the message of the latter sign .
NKJV	Exodus	4	9	And it shall be , if they do not believe even these two signs , or listen to your voice , that you shall take water from [ a ] the river and pour it on the dry land . ( F ) The water which you take from the river will become blood on the dry land. ”
NKJV	Exodus	4	10	Then Moses said to the Lord , “ O my Lord , I am not eloquent , neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant ; but ( G ) I am slow of speech and [ b ] slow of tongue. ”
NKJV	Exodus	4	11	So the Lord said to him , ( H ) “ Who has made man ’ s mouth ? Or who makes the mute , the deaf , the seeing , or the blind ? Have not I , the Lord ?
NKJV	Exodus	4	12	Now therefore , go , and I will be ( I ) with your mouth and teach you what you shall say. ”
NKJV	Exodus	4	13	But he said , “ O my Lord , ( J ) please send by the hand of whomever else You may send. ”
NKJV	Exodus	4	14	So ( K ) the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses , and He said : “ Is not Aaron the Levite your ( L ) brother ? I know that he can speak well . And look , ( M ) he is also coming out to meet you . When he sees you , he will be glad in his heart .
NKJV	Exodus	4	15	Now ( N ) you shall speak to him and ( O ) put the words in his mouth . And I will be with your mouth and with his mouth , and ( P ) I will teach you what you shall do .
NKJV	Exodus	4	16	So he shall be your spokesman to the people . And he himself shall be as a mouth for you , and ( Q ) you shall be to him as God .

NKJV	Exodus	4	22	Then you shall ( AA ) say to Pharaoh , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( AB ) “ Israel is My son , ( AC ) My firstborn .
NKJV	Exodus	4	23	So I say to you , let My son go that he may serve Me . But if you refuse to let him go , indeed ( AD ) I will kill your son , your firstborn. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	4	24	And it came to pass on the way , at the ( AE ) encampment , that the Lord ( AF ) met him and sought to ( AG ) kill him .

NKJV	Exodus	5	5	And Pharaoh said , “ Look , the people of the land are ( H ) many now , and you make them rest from their labor ! ”
NKJV	Exodus	5	2	And Pharaoh said , ( B ) “ Who is the Lord , that I should obey His voice to let Israel go ? I do not know the Lord , ( C ) nor will I let Israel go. ”

NKJV	Exodus	5	6	So the same day Pharaoh commanded the ( I ) taskmasters of the people and their officers , saying ,
NKJV	Exodus	5	7	“ You shall no longer give the people straw to make ( J ) brick as before . Let them go and gather straw for themselves .
NKJV	Exodus	5	8	And you shall lay on them the quota of bricks which they made before . You shall not reduce it . For they are idle ; therefore they cry out , saying , ‘ Let us go and sacrifice to our God. ’
NKJV	Exodus	5	9	Let more work be laid on the men , that they may labor in it , and let them not regard false words. ”
NKJV	Exodus	5	10	And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people , saying , “ Thus says Pharaoh : ‘ I will not give you straw .
NKJV	Exodus	5	11	Go , get yourselves straw where you can find it ; yet none of your work will be reduced. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	5	12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw .
NKJV	Exodus	5	13	And the taskmasters forced them to hurry , saying , “ Fulfill your work , your daily quota , as when there was straw. ”
NKJV	Exodus	5	14	Also the ( K ) officers of the children of Israel , whom Pharaoh ’ s taskmasters had set over them , were ( L ) beaten and were asked , “ Why have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today , as before ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	5	15	Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh , saying , “ Why are you dealing thus with your servants ?
NKJV	Exodus	5	16	There is no straw given to your servants , and they say to us , ‘ Make brick ! ’ And indeed your servants are beaten , but the fault is in your own people. ”
NKJV	Exodus	5	17	But he said , “ You are idle ! Idle ! Therefore you say , ‘ Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord. ’
NKJV	Exodus	5	18	Therefore go now and work ; for no straw shall be given you , yet you shall deliver the quota of bricks. ”
NKJV	Exodus	5	19	And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble after it was said , “ You shall not reduce any bricks from your daily quota. ”
NKJV	Exodus	5	20	Then , as they came out from Pharaoh , they met Moses and Aaron who stood there to meet them .
NKJV	Exodus	5	21	( M ) And they said to them , “ Let the Lord look on you and judge , because you have made [ b ] us abhorrent in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to kill us. ” Israel ’ s Deliverance Assured ( N )
NKJV	Exodus	5	22	So Moses returned to the Lord and said , “ Lord , why have You brought trouble on this people ? Why is it You have sent me ?

NKJV	Exodus	7	6	Then Moses and Aaron ( M ) did so ; just as the Lord commanded them , so they did .
NKJV	Exodus	7	8	Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying ,
NKJV	Exodus	7	9	“ When Pharaoh speaks to you , saying , ( Q ) ‘ Show a miracle for yourselves , ’ then you shall say to Aaron , ( R ) ‘ Take your rod and cast it before Pharaoh , and let it become a serpent. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	7	10	So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh , and they did so , just ( S ) as the Lord commanded . And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants , and it ( T ) became a serpent .
NKJV	Exodus	7	11	But Pharaoh also ( U ) called the wise men and ( V ) the [ b ] sorcerers ; so the magicians of Egypt , they also ( W ) did in like manner with their [ c ] enchantments .
NKJV	Exodus	7	12	For every man threw down his rod , and they became serpents . But Aaron ’ s rod swallowed up their rods .

NKJV	Exodus	7	17	Thus says the Lord : “ By this ( AC ) you shall know that I am the Lord . Behold , I will strike the waters which are in the river with the rod that is in my hand , and ( AD ) they shall be turned ( AE ) to blood .

NKJV	Exodus	8	8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , ( H ) “ Entreat [ b ] the Lord that He may take away the frogs from me and from my people ; and I will let the people ( I ) go , that they may sacrifice to the Lord. ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	2	But if you ( B ) refuse to let them go , behold , I will smite all your territory with ( C ) frogs .
NKJV	Exodus	8	3	So the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly , which shall go up and come into your house , into your ( D ) bedroom , on your bed , into the houses of your servants , on your people , into your ovens , and into your kneading bowls .
NKJV	Exodus	8	4	And the frogs shall come up on you , on your people , and on all your servants. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	5	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , “ Say to Aaron , ( E ) ‘ Stretch out your hand with your rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	6	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt , and ( F ) the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Exodus	8	7	( G ) And the magicians did so with their [ a ] enchantments , and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Exodus	8	9	And Moses said to Pharaoh , “ Accept the honor of saying when I shall intercede for you , for your servants , and for your people , to destroy the frogs from you and your houses , that they may remain in the river only. ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	10	So he said , “ Tomorrow. ” And he said , “ Let it be according to your word , that you may know that ( J ) there is no one like the Lord our God .
NKJV	Exodus	8	11	And the frogs shall depart from you , from your houses , from your servants , and from your people . They shall remain in the river only. ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	12	Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh . And Moses ( K ) cried out to the Lord concerning the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh .
NKJV	Exodus	8	13	So the Lord did according to the word of Moses . And the frogs died out of the houses , out of the courtyards , and out of the fields .
NKJV	Exodus	8	14	They gathered them together in heaps , and the land stank .
NKJV	Exodus	8	15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was ( L ) relief , ( M ) he hardened his heart and did not heed them , as the Lord had said . The Third Plague : Lice
NKJV	Exodus	8	16	So the Lord said to Moses , “ Say to Aaron , ‘ Stretch out your rod , and strike the dust of the land , so that it may become [ c ] lice throughout all the land of Egypt. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	17	And they did so . For Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth , and ( N ) it became lice on man and beast . All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Exodus	8	18	Now ( O ) the magicians so worked with their [ d ] enchantments to bring forth lice , but they ( P ) could not . So there were lice on man and beast .
NKJV	Exodus	8	19	Then the magicians said to Pharaoh , “ This is ( Q ) the [ e ] finger of God. ” But Pharaoh ’ s ( R ) heart grew hard , and he did not heed them , just as the Lord had said . The Fourth Plague : Flies
NKJV	Exodus	8	20	And the Lord said to Moses , ( S ) “ Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes out to the water . Then say to him , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( T ) “ Let My people go , that they may serve Me .
NKJV	Exodus	8	21	Or else , if you will not let My people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants , on your people and into your houses . The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground on which they stand .
NKJV	Exodus	8	22	And in that day ( U ) I will set apart the land of ( V ) Goshen , in which My people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there , in order that you may ( W ) know that I am the Lord in the midst of the ( X ) land .
NKJV	Exodus	8	23	I will [ f ] make a difference between My people and your people . Tomorrow this ( Y ) sign shall be. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	24	And the Lord did so . ( Z ) Thick swarms of flies came into the house of Pharaoh , into his servants ’ houses , and into all the land of Egypt . The land was corrupted because of the swarms of flies .
NKJV	Exodus	8	25	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , “ Go , sacrifice to your God in the land. ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	26	And Moses said , “ It is not right to do so , for we would be sacrificing ( AA ) the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God . If we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes , then will they not [ g ] stone us ?
NKJV	Exodus	8	27	We will go ( AB ) three days ’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God as ( AC ) He will command us. ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	28	So Pharaoh said , “ I will let you go , that you may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness ; only you shall not go very far away . ( AD ) Intercede for me. ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	29	Then Moses said , “ Indeed I am going out from you , and I will entreat the Lord , that the swarms of flies may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people . But let Pharaoh not ( AE ) deal deceitfully anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord. ”
NKJV	Exodus	8	30	So Moses went out from Pharaoh and ( AF ) entreated the Lord .
NKJV	Exodus	8	31	And the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people . Not one remained .
NKJV	Exodus	8	32	But Pharaoh ( AG ) hardened his heart at this time also ; neither would he let the people go .

NKJV	Exodus	9	9	And it will become fine dust in all the land of Egypt , and it will cause ( I ) boils that break out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt. ”
NKJV	Exodus	9	2	For if you ( C ) refuse to let them go , and still hold them ,
NKJV	Exodus	9	3	behold , the ( D ) hand of the Lord will be on your cattle in the field , on the horses , on the donkeys , on the camels , on the oxen , and on the sheep—a very severe pestilence .
NKJV	Exodus	9	4	And ( E ) the Lord will make a difference between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt . So nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	9	5	Then the Lord appointed a set time , saying , “ Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land. ”
NKJV	Exodus	9	6	So the Lord did this thing on the next day , and ( F ) all the livestock of Egypt died ; but of the livestock of the children of Israel , not one died .
NKJV	Exodus	9	7	Then Pharaoh sent , and indeed , not even one of the livestock of the Israelites was dead . But the ( G ) heart of Pharaoh became hard , and he did not let the people go . The Sixth Plague : Boils ( H )
NKJV	Exodus	9	8	So the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Take for yourselves handfuls of ashes from a furnace , and let Moses scatter it toward the heavens in the sight of Pharaoh .
NKJV	Exodus	9	10	Then they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh , and Moses scattered them toward heaven . And they caused ( J ) boils that break out in sores on man and beast .
NKJV	Exodus	9	11	And the ( K ) magicians could not stand before Moses because of the ( L ) boils , for the boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians .
NKJV	Exodus	9	12	But the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh ; and he ( M ) did not heed them , just ( N ) as the Lord had spoken to Moses . The Seventh Plague : Hail
NKJV	Exodus	9	13	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( O ) “ Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh , and say to him , ‘ Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews : “ Let My people go , that they may ( P ) serve Me ,
NKJV	Exodus	9	14	for at this time I will send all My plagues to your very heart , and on your servants and on your people , ( Q ) that you may know that there is none like Me in all the earth .
NKJV	Exodus	9	15	Now if I had ( R ) stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with ( S ) pestilence , then you would have been cut off from the earth .
NKJV	Exodus	9	16	But indeed for ( T ) this purpose I have raised you up , that I may ( U ) show My power in you , and that My ( V ) name may be declared in all the earth .
NKJV	Exodus	9	17	As yet you exalt yourself against My people in that you will not let them go .
NKJV	Exodus	9	18	Behold , tomorrow about this time I will cause very heavy hail to rain down , such as has not been in Egypt since its founding until now .
NKJV	Exodus	9	19	Therefore send now and gather your livestock and all that you have in the field , for the hail shall come down on every man and every animal which is found in the field and is not brought home ; and they shall die. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	9	20	He who ( W ) feared the word of the Lord among the ( X ) servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee to the houses .
NKJV	Exodus	9	21	But he who did not regard the word of the Lord left his servants and his livestock in the field .
NKJV	Exodus	9	22	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Stretch out your hand toward heaven , that there may be ( Y ) hail in all the land of Egypt—on man , on beast , and on every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt. ”
NKJV	Exodus	9	23	And Moses stretched out his rod toward heaven ; and ( Z ) the Lord sent thunder and hail , and fire darted to the ground . And the Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Exodus	9	24	So there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , so very heavy that there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
NKJV	Exodus	9	25	And the ( AA ) hail struck throughout the whole land of Egypt , all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail struck every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field .
NKJV	Exodus	9	26	( AB ) Only in the land of Goshen , where the children of Israel were , there was no hail .
NKJV	Exodus	9	27	And Pharaoh sent and ( AC ) called for Moses and Aaron , and said to them , ( AD ) “ I have sinned this time . ( AE ) The Lord is righteous , and my people and I are wicked .
NKJV	Exodus	9	28	( AF ) Entreat [ a ] the Lord , that there may be no more [ b ] mighty thundering and hail , for it is enough . I will let you ( AG ) go , and you shall stay no longer. ”
NKJV	Exodus	9	29	So Moses said to him , “ As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will ( AH ) spread out my hands to the Lord ; the thunder will cease , and there will be no more hail , that you may know that the ( AI ) earth is the Lord ’ s .
NKJV	Exodus	9	30	But as for you and your servants , ( AJ ) I know that you will not yet fear the Lord God. ”
NKJV	Exodus	9	31	Now the flax and the barley were struck , ( AK ) for the barley was in the head and the flax was in bud .
NKJV	Exodus	9	32	But the wheat and the spelt were not struck , for they are [ c ] late crops .
NKJV	Exodus	9	33	So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and ( AL ) spread out his hands to the Lord ; then the thunder and the hail ceased , and the rain was not poured on the earth .
NKJV	Exodus	9	34	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain , the hail , and the thunder had ceased , he sinned yet more ; and he hardened his heart , he and his servants .
NKJV	Exodus	9	35	So ( AM ) the heart of Pharaoh was hard ; neither would he let the children of Israel go , as the Lord had spoken by Moses .

NKJV	Exodus	10	10	Then he said to them , “ The Lord had better be with you when I let you and your little ones go ! Beware , for evil is ahead of you .
NKJV	Exodus	10	2	and that ( D ) you may tell in the hearing of your son and your son ’ s son the mighty things I have done in Egypt , and My signs which I have done among them , that you may ( E ) know that I am the Lord. ”
NKJV	Exodus	10	3	So Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews : ‘ How long will you refuse to ( F ) humble yourself before Me ? Let My people go , that they may ( G ) serve Me .
NKJV	Exodus	10	4	Or else , if you refuse to let My people go , behold , tomorrow I will bring ( H ) locusts into your territory .
NKJV	Exodus	10	5	And they shall cover the face of the earth , so that no one will be able to see the earth ; and ( I ) they shall eat the residue of what is left , which remains to you from the hail , and they shall eat every tree which grows up for you out of the field .
NKJV	Exodus	10	6	They shall ( J ) fill your houses , the houses of all your servants , and the houses of all the Egyptians—which neither your fathers nor your fathers ’ fathers have seen , since the day that they were on the earth to this day. ’ ” And he turned and went out from Pharaoh .
NKJV	Exodus	10	7	Then Pharaoh ’ s ( K ) servants said to him , “ How long shall this man be ( L ) a snare to us ? Let the men go , that they may serve the Lord their God . Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	10	8	So Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh , and he said to them , “ Go , serve the Lord your God . Who are the ones that are going ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	10	9	And Moses said , “ We will go with our young and our old ; with our sons and our daughters , with our flocks and our herds we will go , for ( M ) we must hold a feast to the Lord. ”

NKJV	Exodus	10	13	So Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind on the land all that day and all that night . When it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
NKJV	Exodus	10	14	And ( Q ) the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested on all the territory of Egypt . They were very severe ; ( R ) previously there had been no such locusts as they , nor shall there be such after them .
NKJV	Exodus	10	15	For they ( S ) covered the face of the whole earth , so that the land was darkened ; and they ( T ) ate every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left . So there remained nothing green on the trees or on the plants of the field throughout all the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Exodus	10	16	Then Pharaoh called ( U ) for Moses and Aaron in haste , and said , ( V ) “ I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you .
NKJV	Exodus	10	17	Now therefore , please forgive my sin only this once , and ( W ) entreat [ a ] the Lord your God , that He may take away from me this death only. ”
NKJV	Exodus	10	18	So he ( X ) went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord .
NKJV	Exodus	10	19	And the Lord turned a very strong west wind , which took the locusts away and blew them ( Y ) into the Red Sea . There remained not one locust in all the territory of Egypt .
NKJV	Exodus	10	20	But the Lord ( Z ) hardened Pharaoh ’ s heart , and he did not let the children of Israel go . The Ninth Plague : Darkness

NKJV	Exodus	10	23	They did not see one another ; nor did anyone rise from his place for three days . ( AD ) But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
NKJV	Exodus	10	24	Then Pharaoh called to Moses and ( AE ) said , “ Go , serve the Lord ; only let your flocks and your herds be kept back . Let your ( AF ) little ones also go with you. ”
NKJV	Exodus	10	25	But Moses said , “ You must also give [ c ] us sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God .
NKJV	Exodus	10	26	Our ( AG ) livestock also shall go with us ; not a hoof shall be left behind . For we must take some of them to serve the Lord our God , and even we do not know with what we must serve the Lord until we arrive there. ”
NKJV	Exodus	10	27	But the Lord ( AH ) hardened Pharaoh ’ s heart , and he would not let them go .
NKJV	Exodus	10	28	Then Pharaoh said to him , ( AI ) “ Get away from me ! Take heed to yourself and see my face no more ! For in the day you see my face you shall die ! ”
NKJV	Exodus	10	29	So Moses said , “ You have spoken well . ( AJ ) I will never see your face again. ” Footnotes - Exodus 10:17 make supplication to - Exodus 10:21 Lit . that one may feel the darkness - Exodus 10:25 Lit . into our hands Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Exodus	13	15	And it came to pass , when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go , that ( W ) the Lord killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast .

NKJV	Exodus	13	17	Then it came to pass , when Pharaoh had let the people go , that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines , although that was near ; for God said , “ Lest perhaps the people ( Z ) change their minds when they see war , and ( AA ) return to Egypt. ”

NKJV	Exodus	14	14	( T ) The Lord will fight for you , and you shall ( U ) hold [ c ] your peace. ”
NKJV	Exodus	14	2	“ Speak to the children of Israel , ( A ) that they turn and camp before ( B ) Pi Hahiroth , between ( C ) Migdol and the sea , opposite Baal Zephon ; you shall camp before it by the sea .
NKJV	Exodus	14	3	For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , ( D ) ‘ They are bewildered by the land ; the wilderness has closed them in. ’
NKJV	Exodus	14	4	Then ( E ) I will harden Pharaoh ’ s heart , so that he will pursue them ; and I ( F ) will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army , ( G ) that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord. ” And they did so .
NKJV	Exodus	14	5	Now it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled , and ( H ) the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people ; and they said , “ Why have we done this , that we have let Israel go from serving us ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	14	6	So he [ a ] made ready his chariot and took his people with him .
NKJV	Exodus	14	7	Also , he took ( I ) six hundred choice chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt with captains over every one of them .
NKJV	Exodus	14	8	And the Lord ( J ) hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued the children of Israel ; and ( K ) the children of Israel went out with boldness .
NKJV	Exodus	14	9	So the ( L ) Egyptians pursued them , all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh , his horsemen and his army , and overtook them camping by the sea beside Pi Hahiroth , before Baal Zephon .
NKJV	Exodus	14	10	And when Pharaoh drew near , the children of Israel lifted their eyes , and behold , the Egyptians marched after them . So they were very afraid , and the children of Israel ( M ) cried out to the Lord .
NKJV	Exodus	14	11	( N ) Then they said to Moses , “ Because there were no graves in Egypt , have you taken us away to die in the wilderness ? Why have you so dealt with us , to bring us up out of Egypt ?
NKJV	Exodus	14	12	( O ) Is this not the word that we told you in Egypt , saying , ‘ Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians ’ ? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness. ”
NKJV	Exodus	14	13	And Moses said to the people , ( P ) “ Do not be afraid . ( Q ) Stand still , and see the ( R ) salvation [ b ] of the Lord , which He will accomplish for you today . For the Egyptians whom you see today , you shall ( S ) see again no more forever .
NKJV	Exodus	14	15	And the Lord said to Moses , “ Why do you cry to Me ? Tell the children of Israel to go forward .
NKJV	Exodus	14	16	But ( V ) lift up your rod , and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it . And the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
NKJV	Exodus	14	17	And I indeed will ( W ) harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them . So I will ( X ) gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army , his chariots , and his horsemen .
NKJV	Exodus	14	18	Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I have gained honor for Myself over Pharaoh , his chariots , and his horsemen. ”
NKJV	Exodus	14	19	And the Angel of God , ( Y ) who went before the camp of Israel , moved and went behind them ; and the pillar of cloud went from before them and stood behind them .
NKJV	Exodus	14	20	So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel . Thus it was a cloud and darkness to the one , and it gave light by night to the other , so that the one did not come near the other all that night .
NKJV	Exodus	14	21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and ( Z ) made the sea into dry land , and the waters were ( AA ) divided .
NKJV	Exodus	14	22	So ( AB ) the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground , and the waters were ( AC ) a wall to them on their right hand and on their left .
NKJV	Exodus	14	23	And the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea , all Pharaoh ’ s horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
NKJV	Exodus	14	24	Now it came to pass , in the morning ( AD ) watch , that ( AE ) the Lord looked down upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud , and He [ d ] troubled the army of the Egyptians .
NKJV	Exodus	14	25	And He [ e ] took off their chariot wheels , so that they drove them with difficulty ; and the Egyptians said , “ Let us flee from the face of Israel , for the Lord ( AF ) fights for them against the Egyptians. ”
NKJV	Exodus	14	26	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Stretch out your hand over the sea , that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians , on their chariots , and on their horsemen. ”
NKJV	Exodus	14	27	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and when the morning appeared , the sea ( AG ) returned to its full depth , while the Egyptians were fleeing into it . So the Lord ( AH ) overthrew [ f ] the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
NKJV	Exodus	14	28	Then ( AI ) the waters returned and covered the chariots , the horsemen , and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them . Not so much as one of them remained .
NKJV	Exodus	14	29	But ( AJ ) the children of Israel had walked on dry land in the midst of the sea , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left .
NKJV	Exodus	14	30	So the Lord ( AK ) saved [ g ] Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians , and Israel ( AL ) saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore .
NKJV	Exodus	14	31	Thus Israel saw the great [ h ] work which the Lord had done in Egypt ; so the people feared the Lord , and ( AM ) believed the Lord and His servant Moses .

NKJV	Exodus	15	4	( J ) Pharaoh ’ s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea ; ( K ) His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea .

NKJV	Exodus	15	8	And ( R ) with the blast of Your nostrils The waters were gathered together ; ( S ) The floods stood upright like a heap ; The depths [ a ] congealed in the heart of the sea .
NKJV	Exodus	15	9	( T ) The enemy said , ‘ I will pursue , I will overtake , I will ( U ) divide the spoil ; My desire shall be satisfied on them . I will draw my sword , My hand shall destroy them. ’

NKJV	Exodus	15	18	“ The ( AO ) Lord shall reign forever and ever. ”
NKJV	Exodus	15	19	For the ( AP ) horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea , and ( AQ ) the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them . But the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea . The Song of Miriam ( AR )
NKJV	Exodus	15	20	Then Miriam ( AS ) the prophetess , ( AT ) the sister of Aaron , ( AU ) took the timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her ( AV ) with timbrels and with dances .
NKJV	Exodus	15	21	And Miriam ( AW ) answered them : ( AX ) “ Sing to the Lord , For He has triumphed gloriously ! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea ! ” Bitter Waters Made Sweet
NKJV	Exodus	15	22	So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea ; then they went out into the Wilderness of ( AY ) Shur . And they went three days in the wilderness and found no ( AZ ) water .
NKJV	Exodus	15	23	Now when they came to ( BA ) Marah , they could not drink the waters of Marah , for they were bitter . Therefore the name of it was called [ d ] Marah .
NKJV	Exodus	15	24	And the people ( BB ) complained against Moses , saying , “ What shall we drink ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	15	25	So he cried out to the Lord , and the Lord showed him a tree . ( BC ) When he cast it into the waters , the waters were made sweet . There He ( BD ) made a statute and an [ e ] ordinance for them , and there ( BE ) He tested them ,
NKJV	Exodus	15	26	and said , ( BF ) “ If you diligently heed the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in His sight , give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes , I will put none of the ( BG ) diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians .

NKJV	Exodus	16	16	This is the thing which the Lord has commanded : ‘ Let every man gather it ( Y ) according to each one ’ s need , one ( Z ) omer for each person , according to the number of persons ; let every man take for those who are in his tent. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	2	Then the whole congregation of the children of Israel ( C ) complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness .
NKJV	Exodus	16	3	And the children of Israel said to them , ( D ) “ Oh , that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt , ( E ) when we sat by the pots of meat and when we ate bread to the full ! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger. ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	4	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Behold , I will rain ( F ) bread from heaven for you . And the people shall go out and gather [ a ] a certain quota every day , that I may ( G ) test them , whether they will ( H ) walk in My law or not .
NKJV	Exodus	16	5	And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in , and ( I ) it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	6	Then Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , ( J ) “ At evening you shall know that the Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Exodus	16	7	And in the morning you shall see ( K ) the glory of the Lord ; for He ( L ) hears your complaints against the Lord . But ( M ) what are we , that you complain against us ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	8	Also Moses said , “ This shall be seen when the Lord gives you meat to eat in the evening , and in the morning bread to the full ; for the Lord hears your complaints which you make against Him . And what are we ? Your complaints are not against us but ( N ) against the Lord. ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	9	Then Moses spoke to Aaron , “ Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel , ( O ) ‘ Come near before the Lord , for He has heard your complaints. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	10	Now it came to pass , as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of the Lord ( P ) appeared in the cloud .
NKJV	Exodus	16	11	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Exodus	16	12	( Q ) “ I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel . Speak to them , saying , ( R ) ‘ At twilight you shall eat meat , and ( S ) in the morning you shall be filled with bread . And you shall know that I am the Lord your God. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	13	So it was that ( T ) quail came up at evening and covered the camp , and in the morning ( U ) the dew lay all around the camp .
NKJV	Exodus	16	14	And when the layer of dew lifted , there , on the surface of the wilderness , was ( V ) a small round ( W ) substance , as fine as frost on the ground .
NKJV	Exodus	16	15	So when the children of Israel saw it , they said to one another , “ What is it ? ” For they did not know what it was . And Moses said to them , ( X ) “ This is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat .
NKJV	Exodus	16	17	Then the children of Israel did so and gathered , some more , some less .
NKJV	Exodus	16	18	So when they measured it by omers , ( AA ) he who gathered much had nothing left over , and he who gathered little had no lack . Every man had gathered according to each one ’ s need .
NKJV	Exodus	16	19	And Moses said , “ Let no one ( AB ) leave any of it till morning. ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	20	Notwithstanding they did not [ b ] heed Moses . But some of them left part of it until morning , and it bred worms and stank . And Moses was angry with them .
NKJV	Exodus	16	21	So they gathered it every morning , every man according to his need . And when the sun became hot , it melted .
NKJV	Exodus	16	22	And so it was , on the sixth day , that they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for each one . And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses .
NKJV	Exodus	16	23	Then he said to them , “ This is what the Lord has said : ‘ Tomorrow is ( AC ) a Sabbath rest , a holy Sabbath to the Lord . Bake what you will bake today , and boil what you will boil ; and lay up for yourselves all that remains , to be kept until morning. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	24	So they laid it up till morning , as Moses commanded ; and it did not ( AD ) stink , nor were there any worms in it .
NKJV	Exodus	16	25	Then Moses said , “ Eat that today , for today is a Sabbath to the Lord ; today you will not find it in the field .
NKJV	Exodus	16	26	( AE ) Six days you shall gather it , but on the seventh day , the Sabbath , there will be none. ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	27	Now it happened that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather , but they found none .
NKJV	Exodus	16	28	And the Lord said to Moses , “ How long ( AF ) do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws ?
NKJV	Exodus	16	29	See ! For the Lord has given you the Sabbath ; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days . Let every man remain in his place ; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day .
NKJV	Exodus	16	31	And the house of Israel called its name [ c ] Manna . And ( AG ) it was like white coriander seed , and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey .
NKJV	Exodus	16	32	Then Moses said , “ This is the thing which the Lord has commanded : ‘ Fill an omer with it , to be kept for your generations , that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness , when I brought you out of the land of Egypt. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	33	And Moses said to Aaron , ( AH ) “ Take a pot and put an omer of manna in it , and lay it up before the Lord , to be kept for your generations. ”
NKJV	Exodus	16	34	As the Lord commanded Moses , so Aaron laid it up ( AI ) before the Testimony , to be kept .
NKJV	Exodus	16	35	And the children of Israel ( AJ ) ate manna ( AK ) forty years , ( AL ) until they came to an inhabited land ; they ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan .

NKJV	Exodus	17	17	Then ( B ) all the congregation of the children of Israel set out on their journey from the Wilderness of ( C ) Sin , according to the commandment of the Lord , and camped in Rephidim ; but there was no water for the people to ( D ) drink .
NKJV	Exodus	17	2	( E ) Therefore the people contended with Moses , and said , “ Give us water , that we may drink. ” So Moses said to them , “ Why do you contend with me ? Why do you ( F ) tempt the Lord ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	17	3	And the people thirsted there for water , and the people ( G ) complained against Moses , and said , “ Why is it you have brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our ( H ) livestock with thirst ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	17	4	So Moses ( I ) cried out to the Lord , saying , “ What shall I do with this people ? They are almost ready to ( J ) stone [ a ] me ! ”
NKJV	Exodus	17	5	And the Lord said to Moses , ( K ) “ Go on before the people , and take with you some of the elders of Israel . Also take in your hand your rod with which ( L ) you struck the river , and go .
NKJV	Exodus	17	6	( M ) Behold , I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb ; and you shall strike the rock , and water will come out of it , that the people may drink. ” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
NKJV	Exodus	17	7	So he called the name of the place ( N ) Massah [ b ] and [ c ] Meribah , because of the contention of the children of Israel , and because they [ d ] tempted the Lord , saying , “ Is the Lord among us or not ? ” Victory over the Amalekites ( O )
NKJV	Exodus	17	8	( P ) Now Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim .
NKJV	Exodus	17	9	And Moses said to Joshua , “ Choose us some men and go out , fight with Amalek . Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with ( Q ) the rod of God in my hand. ”
NKJV	Exodus	17	10	So Joshua did as Moses said to him , and fought with Amalek . And Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
NKJV	Exodus	17	11	And so it was , when Moses ( R ) held up his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
NKJV	Exodus	17	12	But Moses ’ hands became [ e ] heavy ; so they took a stone and put it under him , and he sat on it . And Aaron and Hur supported his hands , one on one side , and the other on the other side ; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun .
NKJV	Exodus	17	13	So Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword .
NKJV	Exodus	17	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( S ) “ Write this for a memorial in the book and recount it in the hearing of Joshua , that ( T ) I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. ”
NKJV	Exodus	17	15	And Moses built an altar and called its name , [ f ] The-Lord-Is-My-Banner ;
NKJV	Exodus	17	16	for he said , “ Because [ g ] the Lord has ( U ) sworn : the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. ” Footnotes - Exodus 17:4 Put me to death by stoning - Exodus 17:7 Lit .

NKJV	Exodus	18	18	Both you and these people who are with you will surely wear yourselves out . For this thing is too much for you ; ( V ) you are not able to perform it by yourself .
NKJV	Exodus	18	2	Then Jethro , Moses ’ father-in-law , took ( D ) Zipporah , Moses ’ wife , after he had sent her back ,
NKJV	Exodus	18	3	with her ( E ) two sons , of whom the name of one was [ a ] Gershom ( for he said , ( F ) “ I have been a [ b ] stranger in a foreign land ” )
NKJV	Exodus	18	4	and the name of the other was [ c ] Eliezer ( for he said , “ The God of my father was my ( G ) help , and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh ” ) ;
NKJV	Exodus	18	5	and Jethro , Moses ’ father-in-law , came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness , where he was encamped at ( H ) the mountain of God .
NKJV	Exodus	18	6	Now he had said to Moses , “ I , your father-in-law Jethro , am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her. ”
NKJV	Exodus	18	7	So Moses ( I ) went out to meet his father-in-law , bowed down , and ( J ) kissed him . And they asked each other about their well-being , and they went into the tent .
NKJV	Exodus	18	8	And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel ’ s sake , all the hardship that had come upon them on the way , and how the Lord had ( K ) delivered them .
NKJV	Exodus	18	9	Then Jethro rejoiced for all the ( L ) good which the Lord had done for Israel , whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians .
NKJV	Exodus	18	10	And Jethro said , ( M ) “ Blessed be the Lord , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh , and who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
NKJV	Exodus	18	11	Now I know that the Lord is ( N ) greater than all the gods ; ( O ) for in the very thing in which they [ d ] behaved ( P ) proudly , He was above them. ”
NKJV	Exodus	18	12	Then Jethro , Moses ’ father-in-law , [ e ] took a burnt ( Q ) offering and other sacrifices to offer to God . And Aaron came with all the elders of Israel ( R ) to eat bread with Moses ’ father-in-law before God .
NKJV	Exodus	18	13	And so it was , on the next day , that Moses ( S ) sat to judge the people ; and the people stood before Moses from morning until evening .
NKJV	Exodus	18	14	So when Moses ’ father-in-law saw all that he did for the people , he said , “ What is this thing that you are doing for the people ? Why do you alone [ f ] sit , and all the people stand before you from morning until evening ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	18	15	And Moses said to his father-in-law , “ Because ( T ) the people come to me to inquire of God .
NKJV	Exodus	18	16	When they have ( U ) a [ g ] difficulty , they come to me , and I judge between one and another ; and I make known the statutes of God and His laws. ”
NKJV	Exodus	18	17	So Moses ’ father-in-law said to him , “ The thing that you do is not good .
NKJV	Exodus	18	19	Listen now to my voice ; I will give you [ h ] counsel , and God will be with you : Stand ( W ) before God for the people , so that you may ( X ) bring the difficulties to God .
NKJV	Exodus	18	20	And you shall ( Y ) teach them the statutes and the laws , and show them the way in which they must walk and ( Z ) the work they must do .
NKJV	Exodus	18	21	Moreover you shall select from all the people ( AA ) able men , such as ( AB ) fear God , ( AC ) men of truth , ( AD ) hating covetousness ; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
NKJV	Exodus	18	22	And let them judge the people at all times . ( AE ) Then it will be that every great matter they shall bring to you , but every small matter they themselves shall judge . So it will be easier for you , for ( AF ) they will bear the burden with you .
NKJV	Exodus	18	23	If you do this thing , and God so commands you , then you will be able to endure , and all this people will also go to their ( AG ) place in peace. ”
NKJV	Exodus	18	24	So Moses heeded the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said .
NKJV	Exodus	18	25	And ( AH ) Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people : rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
NKJV	Exodus	18	26	So they judged the people at all times ; the ( AI ) hard [ i ] cases they brought to Moses , but they judged every small case themselves .

NKJV	Exodus	19	19	And when the blast of the trumpet sounded long and became louder and louder , ( AB ) Moses spoke , and ( AC ) God answered him by voice .
NKJV	Exodus	19	2	For they had departed from ( B ) Rephidim , had come to the Wilderness of Sinai , and camped in the wilderness . So Israel camped there before ( C ) the mountain .
NKJV	Exodus	19	3	And ( D ) Moses went up to God , and the Lord ( E ) called to him from the mountain , saying , “ Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
NKJV	Exodus	19	4	( F ) ‘ You have seen what I did to the Egyptians , and how ( G ) I [ a ] bore you on eagles ’ wings and brought you to Myself .
NKJV	Exodus	19	5	Now ( H ) therefore , if you will indeed obey My voice and ( I ) keep My covenant , then ( J ) you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people ; for all the earth is ( K ) Mine .
NKJV	Exodus	19	6	And you shall be to Me a ( L ) kingdom of priests and a ( M ) holy nation. ’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel. ”
NKJV	Exodus	19	7	So Moses came and called for the ( N ) elders of the people , and [ b ] laid before them all these words which the Lord commanded him .
NKJV	Exodus	19	8	Then ( O ) all the people answered together and said , “ All that the Lord has spoken we will do. ” So Moses brought back the words of the people to the Lord .
NKJV	Exodus	19	9	And the Lord said to Moses , “ Behold , I come to you ( P ) in the thick cloud , ( Q ) that the people may hear when I speak with you , and believe you forever. ” So Moses told the words of the people to the Lord .
NKJV	Exodus	19	10	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Go to the people and ( R ) consecrate them today and tomorrow , and let them wash their clothes .
NKJV	Exodus	19	11	And let them be ready for the third day . For on the third day the Lord will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people .
NKJV	Exodus	19	12	You shall set bounds for the people all around , saying , ‘ Take heed to yourselves that you do not go up to the mountain or touch its base . ( S ) Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death .
NKJV	Exodus	19	13	Not a hand shall touch him , but he shall surely be stoned or shot with an arrow ; whether man or beast , he shall not live. ’ When the trumpet sounds long , they shall come near the mountain. ”
NKJV	Exodus	19	14	So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people , and they washed their clothes .
NKJV	Exodus	19	15	And he said to the people , “ Be ready for the third day ; ( T ) do not come near your wives. ”
NKJV	Exodus	19	16	Then it came to pass on the third day , in the morning , that there were ( U ) thunderings and lightnings , and a thick cloud on the mountain ; and the sound of the trumpet was very loud , so that all the people who were in the camp ( V ) trembled .
NKJV	Exodus	19	17	And ( W ) Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God , and they stood at the foot of the mountain .
NKJV	Exodus	19	18	Now ( X ) Mount Sinai was completely in smoke , because the Lord descended upon ( Y ) it in fire . ( Z ) Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace , and [ c ] the ( AA ) whole mountain quaked greatly .
NKJV	Exodus	19	20	Then the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai , on the top of the mountain . And the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
NKJV	Exodus	19	21	And the Lord said to Moses , “ Go down and warn the people , lest they break through ( AD ) to gaze at the Lord , and many of them perish .
NKJV	Exodus	19	22	Also let the ( AE ) priests who come near the Lord ( AF ) consecrate themselves , lest the Lord ( AG ) break out against them. ”
NKJV	Exodus	19	23	But Moses said to the Lord , “ The people can not come up to Mount Sinai ; for You warned us , saying , ( AH ) ‘ Set bounds around the mountain and consecrate it. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	19	24	Then the Lord said to him , “ Away ! Get down and then come up , you and Aaron with you . But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord , lest He break out against them. ”

NKJV	Exodus	20	11	For ( Q ) in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth , the sea , and all that is in them , and rested the seventh day . Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it .
NKJV	Exodus	20	12	( R ) “ Honor your father and your mother , that your days may be ( S ) long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you .

NKJV	Exodus	20	18	Now ( AA ) all the people ( AB ) witnessed the thunderings , the lightning flashes , the sound of the trumpet , and the mountain ( AC ) smoking ; and when the people saw it , they trembled and stood afar off .
NKJV	Exodus	20	19	Then they said to Moses , ( AD ) “ You speak with us , and we will hear ; but ( AE ) let not God speak with us , lest we die. ”

NKJV	Exodus	20	22	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Thus you shall say to the children of Israel : ‘ You have seen that I have talked with you ( AJ ) from heaven .

NKJV	Exodus	31	31	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Exodus	31	2	( B ) “ See , I have called by name Bezalel the ( C ) son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah .
NKJV	Exodus	31	3	And I have ( D ) filled him with the Spirit of God , in wisdom , in understanding , in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
NKJV	Exodus	31	4	to design artistic works , to work in gold , in silver , in bronze ,

NKJV	Exodus	31	11	( O ) and the anointing oil and ( P ) sweet incense for the holy place . According to all that I have commanded you they shall do. ” The Sabbath Law
NKJV	Exodus	31	12	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Exodus	31	13	“ Speak also to the children of Israel , saying : ( Q ) ‘ Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep , for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations , that you may know that I am the Lord who ( R ) sanctifies [ b ] you .
NKJV	Exodus	31	14	( S ) You shall keep the Sabbath , therefore , for it is holy to you . Everyone who [ c ] profanes it shall surely be put to death ; for ( T ) whoever does any work on it , that person shall be cut off from among his people .
NKJV	Exodus	31	15	Work shall be done for ( U ) six days , but the ( V ) seventh is the Sabbath of rest , holy to the Lord . Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
NKJV	Exodus	31	16	Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath , to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant .
NKJV	Exodus	31	17	It is ( W ) a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever ; for ( X ) in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth , and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	31	18	And when He had made an end of speaking with him on Mount Sinai , He gave Moses ( Y ) two tablets of the Testimony , tablets of stone , written with the finger of God .

NKJV	Exodus	32	32	Yet now , if You will forgive their sin—but if not , I pray , ( AO ) blot me ( AP ) out of Your book which You have written. ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	2	And Aaron said to them , “ Break off the ( G ) golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives , your sons , and your daughters , and bring them to me. ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	3	So all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them to Aaron .
NKJV	Exodus	32	4	( H ) And he received the gold from their hand , and he fashioned it with an engraving tool , and made a molded calf . Then they said , “ This is your god , O Israel , that ( I ) brought you out of the land of Egypt ! ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	5	So when Aaron saw it , he built an altar before it . And Aaron made a ( J ) proclamation and said , “ Tomorrow is a feast to the Lord. ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	6	Then they rose early on the next day , offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people ( K ) sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
NKJV	Exodus	32	7	And the Lord said to Moses , ( L ) “ Go , get down ! For your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt ( M ) have corrupted themselves .
NKJV	Exodus	32	8	They have turned aside quickly out of the way which ( N ) I commanded them . They have made themselves a molded calf , and worshiped it and sacrificed to it , and said , ( O ) ‘ This is your god , O Israel , that brought you out of the land of Egypt ! ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	9	And the Lord said to Moses , ( P ) “ I have seen this people , and indeed it is a [ b ] stiff-necked people !
NKJV	Exodus	32	10	Now therefore , ( Q ) let Me alone , that ( R ) My wrath may burn hot against them and I may [ c ] consume them . And ( S ) I will make of you a great nation. ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	11	( T ) Then Moses pleaded with [ d ] the Lord his God , and said : “ Lord , why does Your wrath burn hot against Your people whom You have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand ?
NKJV	Exodus	32	12	( U ) Why should the Egyptians speak , and say , ‘ He brought them out to harm them , to kill them in the mountains , and to consume them from the face of the earth ’ ? Turn from Your fierce wrath , and ( V ) relent from this harm to Your people .
NKJV	Exodus	32	13	Remember Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , Your servants , to whom You ( W ) swore by Your own self , and said to them , ( X ) ‘ I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven ; and all this land that I have spoken of I give to your descendants , and they shall inherit it forever. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	14	So the Lord ( Y ) relented from the harm which He said He would do to His people .
NKJV	Exodus	32	15	And ( Z ) Moses turned and went down from the mountain , and the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand . The tablets were written on both sides ; on the one side and on the other they were written .
NKJV	Exodus	32	16	Now the ( AA ) tablets were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets .
NKJV	Exodus	32	17	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said to Moses , “ There is a noise of war in the camp. ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	18	But he said : “ It is not the noise of the shout of victory , Nor the noise of the cry of defeat , But the sound of singing I hear. ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	19	So it was , as soon as he came near the camp , that ( AB ) he saw the calf and the dancing . So Moses ’ anger became hot , and he cast the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain .
NKJV	Exodus	32	20	( AC ) Then he took the calf which they had made , burned it in the fire , and ground it to powder ; and he scattered it on the water and made the children of Israel drink it .
NKJV	Exodus	32	21	And Moses said to Aaron , ( AD ) “ What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them ? ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	22	So Aaron said , “ Do not let the anger of my lord become hot . ( AE ) You know the people , that they are set on evil .
NKJV	Exodus	32	23	For they said to me , ‘ Make us gods that shall go before us ; as for this Moses , the man who brought us out of the land of Egypt , we do not know what has become of him. ’
NKJV	Exodus	32	24	And I said to them , ‘ Whoever has any gold , let them break it off. ’ So they gave it to me , and I cast it into the fire , and this calf came out. ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	25	Now when Moses saw that the people were ( AF ) unrestrained ( for Aaron ( AG ) had not restrained them , to their shame among their enemies ) ,
NKJV	Exodus	32	26	then Moses stood in the entrance of the camp , and said , “ Whoever is on the Lord ’ s side—come to me ! ” And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him .
NKJV	Exodus	32	27	And he said to them , “ Thus says the Lord God of Israel : ‘ Let every man put his sword on his side , and go in and out from entrance to entrance throughout the camp , and ( AH ) let every man kill his brother , every man his companion , and every man his neighbor. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	28	So the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses . And about three thousand men of the people fell that day .
NKJV	Exodus	32	29	( AI ) Then Moses said , [ e ] “ Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord , that He may bestow on you a blessing this day , for every man has opposed his son and his brother. ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	30	Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses said to the people , ( AJ ) “ You have committed a great sin . So now I will go up to the Lord ; ( AK ) perhaps I can ( AL ) make atonement for your sin. ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	31	Then Moses ( AM ) returned to the Lord and said , “ Oh , these people have committed a great sin , and have ( AN ) made for themselves a god of gold !
NKJV	Exodus	32	33	And the Lord said to Moses , ( AQ ) “ Whoever has sinned against Me , I will ( AR ) blot him out of My book .
NKJV	Exodus	32	34	Now therefore , go , lead the people to the place of which I have ( AS ) spoken to you . ( AT ) Behold , My Angel shall go before you . Nevertheless , ( AU ) in the day when I ( AV ) visit for punishment , I will visit punishment upon them for their sin. ”
NKJV	Exodus	32	35	So the Lord plagued the people because of ( AW ) what they did with the calf which Aaron made .

NKJV	Exodus	33	33	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Depart and go up from here , you ( A ) and the people whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt , to the land of which I swore to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , saying , ( B ) ‘ To your descendants I will give it. ’
NKJV	Exodus	33	2	( C ) And I will send My Angel before you , ( D ) and I will drive out the Canaanite and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite .
NKJV	Exodus	33	3	Go up ( E ) to a land flowing with milk and honey ; for I will not go up in your midst , lest ( F ) I [ a ] consume you on the way , for you are a ( G ) stiff-necked [ b ] people. ”
NKJV	Exodus	33	4	And when the people heard this bad news , ( H ) they mourned , ( I ) and no one put on his ornaments .
NKJV	Exodus	33	5	For the Lord had said to Moses , “ Say to the children of Israel , ‘ You are a stiff-necked people . I could come up into your midst in one moment and consume you . Now therefore , take off your [ c ] ornaments , that I may ( J ) know what to do to you. ’ ”
NKJV	Exodus	33	6	So the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb . Moses Meets with the Lord
NKJV	Exodus	33	7	Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp , far from the camp , and ( K ) called it the tabernacle of meeting . And it came to pass that everyone who ( L ) sought the Lord went out to the tabernacle of meeting which was outside the camp .
NKJV	Exodus	33	8	So it was , whenever Moses went out to the tabernacle , that all the people rose , and each man stood ( M ) at his tent door and watched Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle .
NKJV	Exodus	33	9	And it came to pass , when Moses entered the tabernacle , that the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the Lord ( N ) talked with Moses .
NKJV	Exodus	33	10	All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tabernacle door , and all the people rose and ( O ) worshiped , each man in his tent door .
NKJV	Exodus	33	11	So ( P ) the Lord spoke to Moses face to face , as a man speaks to his friend . And he would return to the camp , but ( Q ) his servant Joshua the son of Nun , a young man , did not depart from the tabernacle . The Promise of God ’ s Presence
NKJV	Exodus	33	12	Then Moses said to the Lord , “ See , ( R ) You say to me , ‘ Bring up this people. ’ But You have not let me know whom You will send with me . Yet You have said , ( S ) ‘ I know you by name , and you have also found grace in My sight. ’
NKJV	Exodus	33	13	Now therefore , I pray , ( T ) if I have found grace in Your sight , ( U ) show me now Your way , that I may know You and that I may find grace in Your sight . And consider that this nation is ( V ) Your people. ”
NKJV	Exodus	33	14	And He said , ( W ) “ My Presence will go with you , and I will give you ( X ) rest. ”
NKJV	Exodus	33	15	Then he said to Him , ( Y ) “ If Your Presence does not go with us , do not bring us up from here .
NKJV	Exodus	33	16	For how then will it be known that Your people and I have found grace in Your sight , ( Z ) except You go with us ? So we ( AA ) shall be separate , Your people and I , from all the people who are upon the face of the earth. ”
NKJV	Exodus	33	17	So the Lord said to Moses , ( AB ) “ I will also do this thing that you have spoken ; for you have found grace in My sight , and I know you by name. ”
NKJV	Exodus	33	18	And he said , “ Please , show me ( AC ) Your glory. ”
NKJV	Exodus	33	19	Then He said , “ I will make all My ( AD ) goodness pass before you , and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you . ( AE ) I will be gracious to whom I will be ( AF ) gracious , and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. ”
NKJV	Exodus	33	20	But He said , “ You can not see My face ; for ( AG ) no man shall see Me , and live. ”
NKJV	Exodus	33	21	And the Lord said , “ Here is a place by Me , and you shall stand on the rock .
NKJV	Exodus	33	22	So it shall be , while My glory passes by , that I will put you ( AH ) in the cleft of the rock , and will ( AI ) cover you with My hand while I pass by .
NKJV	Exodus	33	23	Then I will take away My hand , and you shall see My back ; but My face shall ( AJ ) not be seen. ” Footnotes - Exodus 33:3 destroy - Exodus 33:3 stubborn - Exodus 33:5 jewelry Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Exodus	34	34	But ( BA ) whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him , he would take the veil off until he came out ; and he would come out and speak to the children of Israel whatever he had been commanded .
NKJV	Exodus	34	2	So be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai , and present yourself to Me there ( D ) on the top of the mountain .
NKJV	Exodus	34	3	And no man shall ( E ) come up with you , and let no man be seen throughout all the mountain ; let neither flocks nor herds feed before that mountain. ”
NKJV	Exodus	34	4	So he cut two tablets of stone like the first ones . Then Moses rose early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai , as the Lord had commanded him ; and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone .
NKJV	Exodus	34	5	Now the Lord descended in the ( F ) cloud and stood with him there , and ( G ) proclaimed the name of the Lord .
NKJV	Exodus	34	6	And the Lord passed before him and proclaimed , “ The Lord , the Lord ( H ) God , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abounding in ( I ) goodness and ( J ) truth ,
NKJV	Exodus	34	7	( K ) keeping mercy for thousands , ( L ) forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , ( M ) by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children ’ s children to the third and the fourth generation. ”
NKJV	Exodus	34	8	So Moses made haste and ( N ) bowed his head toward the earth , and worshiped .
NKJV	Exodus	34	9	Then he said , “ If now I have found grace in Your sight , O Lord , ( O ) let my Lord , I pray , go among us , even though we are a ( P ) stiff-necked [ a ] people ; and pardon our iniquity and our sin , and take us as ( Q ) Your inheritance. ” The Covenant Renewed ( R )
NKJV	Exodus	34	10	And He said : “ Behold , ( S ) I make a covenant . Before all your people I will ( T ) do [ b ] marvels such as have not been done in all the earth , nor in any nation ; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the Lord . For it is ( U ) an awesome thing that I will do with you .
NKJV	Exodus	34	11	( V ) Observe what I command you this day . Behold , ( W ) I am driving out from before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite .
NKJV	Exodus	34	12	( X ) Take heed to yourself , lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going , lest it be a snare in your midst .
NKJV	Exodus	34	13	But you shall ( Y ) destroy their altars , break their sacred pillars , and ( Z ) cut down their wooden images
NKJV	Exodus	34	14	( for you shall worship ( AA ) no other god , for the Lord , whose ( AB ) name is Jealous , is a ( AC ) jealous God ) ,
NKJV	Exodus	34	15	lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they ( AD ) play the harlot with their gods and make sacrifice to their gods , and one of them ( AE ) invites you and you ( AF ) eat of his sacrifice ,
NKJV	Exodus	34	16	and you take of ( AG ) his daughters for your sons , and his daughters ( AH ) play the harlot with their gods and make your sons play the harlot with their gods .
NKJV	Exodus	34	17	( AI ) “ You shall make no molded gods for yourselves .
NKJV	Exodus	34	18	“ The Feast of ( AJ ) Unleavened Bread you shall keep . Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , as I commanded you , in the appointed time of the month of Abib ; for in the ( AK ) month of Abib you came out from Egypt .
NKJV	Exodus	34	19	( AL ) “ All [ c ] that open the womb are Mine , and every male firstborn among your livestock , whether ox or sheep .
NKJV	Exodus	34	20	But ( AM ) the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb . And if you will not redeem him , then you shall break his neck . All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem . “ And none shall appear before Me ( AN ) empty-handed .
NKJV	Exodus	34	21	( AO ) “ Six days you shall work , but on the seventh day you shall rest ; in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest .
NKJV	Exodus	34	22	“ And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks , of the firstfruits of wheat harvest , and the Feast of Ingathering at the year ’ s end .
NKJV	Exodus	34	23	( AP ) “ Three times in the year all your men shall appear before the Lord , the Lord God of Israel .
NKJV	Exodus	34	24	For I will ( AQ ) cast out the nations before you and enlarge your borders ; neither will any man covet your land when you go up to appear before the Lord your God three times in the year .
NKJV	Exodus	34	25	“ You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven , ( AR ) nor shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be left until morning .
NKJV	Exodus	34	26	( AS ) “ The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God . You shall not boil a young goat in its mother ’ s milk. ”
NKJV	Exodus	34	27	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Write ( AT ) these words , for according to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel. ”
NKJV	Exodus	34	28	( AU ) So he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights ; he neither ate bread nor drank water . And ( AV ) He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant , the [ d ] Ten Commandments . The Shining Face of Moses
NKJV	Exodus	34	29	Now it was so , when Moses came down from Mount Sinai ( and the ( AW ) two tablets of the Testimony were in Moses ’ hand when he came down from the mountain ) , that Moses did not know that ( AX ) the skin of his face shone while he talked with Him .
NKJV	Exodus	34	30	So when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone , and they were afraid to come near him .
NKJV	Exodus	34	31	Then Moses called to them , and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him ; and Moses talked with them .
NKJV	Exodus	34	32	Afterward all the children of Israel came near , ( AY ) and he gave them as commandments all that the Lord had spoken with him on Mount Sinai .
NKJV	Exodus	34	33	And when Moses had finished speaking with them , he put ( AZ ) a veil on his face .
NKJV	Exodus	34	35	And whenever the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses ’ face shone , then Moses would put the veil on his face again , until he went in to speak with Him .

NKJV	Exodus	35	4	And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel , saying , ( F ) “ This is the thing which the Lord commanded , saying :

NKJV	Exodus	35	20	And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses .
NKJV	Exodus	35	21	Then everyone came ( X ) whose heart [ b ] was stirred , and everyone whose spirit was willing , and they ( Y ) brought the Lord ’ s offering for the work of the tabernacle of meeting , for all its service , and for the holy garments .

NKJV	Exodus	35	30	And Moses said to the children of Israel , “ See , ( AH ) the Lord has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah ;

NKJV	Exodus	36	36	He made for it four pillars of acacia wood , and overlaid them with gold , with their hooks of gold ; and he cast four sockets of silver for them .
NKJV	Exodus	36	2	Then Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab , and every gifted artisan in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom , everyone ( C ) whose heart [ b ] was stirred , to come and do the work .
NKJV	Exodus	36	3	And they received from Moses all the ( D ) offering which the children of Israel ( E ) had brought for the work of the service of making the sanctuary . So they continued bringing to him freewill offerings every morning .
NKJV	Exodus	36	4	Then all the craftsmen who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came , each from the work he was doing ,
NKJV	Exodus	36	5	and they spoke to Moses , saying , ( F ) “ The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the Lord commanded us to do. ”

NKJV	Leviticus	13	12	“ And if leprosy breaks out all over the skin , and the leprosy covers all the skin of the one who has the sore , from his head to his foot , wherever the priest looks ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	14	But when raw flesh appears on him , he shall be unclean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	15	And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him to be unclean ; for the raw flesh is unclean . It is leprosy .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	16	Or if the raw flesh changes and turns white again , he shall come to the priest .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	17	And the priest shall examine him ; and indeed if the sore has turned white , then the priest shall pronounce him clean who has the sore . He is clean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	18	“ If the body develops a ( G ) boil in the skin , and it is healed ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	19	and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a bright spot , reddish-white , then it shall be shown to the priest ;
NKJV	Leviticus	13	20	and if , when the priest sees it , it indeed appears deeper than the skin , and its hair has turned white , the priest shall pronounce him unclean . It is a leprous sore which has broken out of the boil .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	21	But if the priest examines it , and indeed there are no white hairs in it , and it is not deeper than the skin , but has faded , then the priest shall isolate him seven days ;
NKJV	Leviticus	13	22	and if it should at all spread over the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean . It is a [ e ] leprous sore .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	23	But if the bright spot stays in one place , and has not spread , it is the scar of the boil ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	24	“ Or if the body receives a ( H ) burn on its skin by fire , and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot , reddish-white or white ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	25	then the priest shall examine it ; and indeed if the hair of the bright spot has turned white , and it appears deeper than the skin , it is leprosy broken out in the burn . Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean . It is a leprous sore .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	26	But if the priest examines it , and indeed there are no white hairs in the bright spot , and it is not deeper than the skin , but has faded , then the priest shall isolate him seven days .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	27	And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day . If it has at all spread over the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean . It is a leprous sore .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	28	But if the bright spot stays in one place , and has not spread on the skin , but has faded , it is a swelling from the burn . The priest shall pronounce him clean , for it is the scar from the burn .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	29	“ If a man or woman has a sore on the head or the beard ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	30	then the priest shall examine the sore ; and indeed if it appears deeper than the skin , and there is in it thin yellow hair , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean . It is a scaly leprosy of the head or beard .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	31	But if the priest examines the scaly sore , and indeed it does not appear deeper than the skin , and there is no black hair in it , then the priest shall isolate the one who has the scale seven days .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	32	And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the sore ; and indeed if the scale has not spread , and there is no yellow hair in it , and the scale does not appear deeper than the skin ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	33	he shall shave himself , but the scale he shall not shave . And the priest shall isolate the one who has the scale another seven days .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	34	On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scale ; and indeed if the scale has not spread over the skin , and does not appear deeper than the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him clean . He shall wash his clothes and be clean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	35	But if the scale should at all spread over the skin after his cleansing ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	36	then the priest shall examine him ; and indeed if the scale has spread over the skin , the priest need not seek for yellow hair . He is unclean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	37	But if the scale appears to be at a standstill , and there is black hair grown up in it , the scale has healed . He is clean , and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	38	“ If a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body , specifically white bright spots ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	39	then the priest shall look ; and indeed if the bright spots on the skin of the body are dull white , it is a white spot that grows on the skin . He is clean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	40	“ As for the man whose hair has fallen from his head , he is bald , but he is clean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	41	He whose hair has fallen from his forehead , he is bald on the forehead , but he is clean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	42	And if there is on the bald head or bald ( I ) forehead a reddish-white sore , it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	43	Then the priest shall examine it ; and indeed if the swelling of the sore is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead , as the appearance of leprosy on the skin of the body ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	44	he is a leprous man . He is unclean . The priest shall surely pronounce him [ f ] unclean ; his sore is on his ( J ) head .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	45	“ Now the leper on whom the sore is , his clothes shall be torn and his head ( K ) bare ; and he shall ( L ) cover his mustache , and cry , ( M ) ‘ Unclean ! Unclean ! ’
NKJV	Leviticus	13	46	He shall be unclean . All the days he has the sore he shall be unclean . He is unclean , and he shall [ g ] dwell alone ; his dwelling shall be ( N ) outside the camp . The Law Concerning Leprous Garments
NKJV	Leviticus	13	47	“ Also , if a garment has a [ h ] leprous plague in it , whether it is a woolen garment or a linen garment ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	48	whether it is in the warp or woof of linen or wool , whether in leather or in anything made of leather ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	49	and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather , whether in the warp or in the woof , or in anything made of leather , it is a leprous [ i ] plague and shall be shown to the priest .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	50	The priest shall examine the plague and isolate that which has the plague seven days .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	51	And he shall examine the plague on the seventh day . If the plague has spread in the garment , either in the warp or in the woof , in the leather or in anything made of leather , the plague is ( O ) an active leprosy . It is unclean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	52	He shall therefore burn that garment in which is the plague , whether warp or woof , in wool or in linen , or anything of leather , for it is an active leprosy ; the garment shall be burned in the fire .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	53	“ But if the priest examines it , and indeed the plague has not spread in the garment , either in the warp or in the woof , or in anything made of leather ,
NKJV	Leviticus	13	54	then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the plague ; and he shall isolate it another seven days .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	55	Then the priest shall examine the plague after it has been washed ; and indeed if the plague has not changed its color , though the plague has not spread , it is unclean , and you shall burn it in the fire ; it continues eating away , whether the damage is outside or inside .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	56	If the priest examines it , and indeed the plague has faded after washing it , then he shall tear it out of the garment , whether out of the warp or out of the woof , or out of the leather .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	57	But if it appears again in the garment , either in the warp or in the woof , or in anything made of leather , it is a spreading plague ; you shall burn with fire that in which is the plague .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	58	And if you wash the garment , either warp or woof , or whatever is made of leather , if the plague has disappeared from it , then it shall be washed a second time , and shall be clean .
NKJV	Leviticus	13	59	“ This is the law of the leprous plague in a garment of wool or linen , either in the warp or woof , or in anything made of leather , to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean. ” Footnotes - Leviticus 13:2 Heb . saraath , disfiguring skin diseases , including leprosy , and so in vv . 2–46 and 14:2–32 - Leviticus 13:3 defiled - Leviticus 13:8 defiled - Leviticus 13:11 defiled - Leviticus 13:22 infection - Leviticus 13:44 altogether defiled - Leviticus 13:46 live alone - Leviticus 13:47 A mold , fungus , or similar infestation , and so in vv . 47–59 - Leviticus 13:49 mark Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Leviticus	14	33	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying :

NKJV	Leviticus	22	2	“ Speak to Aaron and his sons , that they ( A ) separate [ a ] themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they ( B ) do not profane My holy name by what they ( C ) dedicate to Me : I am the Lord .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	3	Say to them : ‘ Whoever of all your descendants throughout your generations , who goes near the holy things which the children of Israel dedicate to the Lord , ( D ) while he has [ b ] uncleanness upon him , that person shall be cut off from My presence : I am the Lord .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	4	‘ Whatever man of the descendants of Aaron , who is a ( E ) leper or has ( F ) a discharge , shall not eat the holy offerings ( G ) until he is clean . And ( H ) whoever touches anything made unclean by a corpse , or ( I ) a man who has had an emission of semen ,
NKJV	Leviticus	22	5	or ( J ) whoever touches any creeping thing by which he would be made unclean , or ( K ) any person by whom he would become unclean , whatever his uncleanness may be—
NKJV	Leviticus	22	6	the person who has touched any such thing shall be unclean until evening , and shall not eat the holy offerings unless he ( L ) washes his body with water .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	7	And when the sun goes down he shall be clean ; and afterward he may eat the holy offerings , because ( M ) it is his food .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	8	( N ) Whatever dies naturally or is torn by beasts he shall not eat , to defile himself with it : I am the Lord .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	9	‘ They shall therefore keep ( O ) My [ c ] ordinance , ( P ) lest they bear sin for it and die thereby , if they profane it : I the Lord sanctify them .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	10	( Q ) ‘ No outsider shall eat the holy offering ; one who [ d ] dwells with the priest , or a hired servant , shall not eat the holy thing .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	11	But if the priest ( R ) buys a person with his money , he may eat it ; and one who is born in his house may eat his food .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	12	If the priest ’ s daughter is married to an outsider , she may not eat of the holy offerings .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	13	But if the priest ’ s daughter is a widow or divorced , and has no child , and has returned to her father ’ s house as in her youth , she may eat her father ’ s food ; but no outsider shall eat it .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	14	‘ And if a man eats the holy offering unintentionally , then he shall restore a holy offering to the priest , and add one-fifth to it .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	15	They shall not profane the ( S ) holy offerings of the children of Israel , which they offer to the Lord ,
NKJV	Leviticus	22	16	or allow them to bear the guilt of trespass when they eat their holy offerings ; for I the Lord sanctify them. ’ ” Offerings Accepted and Not Accepted
NKJV	Leviticus	22	17	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Leviticus	22	18	“ Speak to Aaron and his sons , and to all the children of Israel , and say to them : ( T ) ‘ Whatever man of the house of Israel , or of the strangers in Israel , who [ e ] offers his sacrifice for any of his vows or for any of his freewill offerings , which they offer to the Lord as a burnt offering—
NKJV	Leviticus	22	19	( U ) you shall offer of your own free will a male without blemish from the cattle , from the sheep , or from the goats .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	20	( V ) Whatever has a defect , you shall not offer , for it shall not be acceptable on your behalf .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	21	And ( W ) whoever offers a sacrifice of a peace offering to the Lord , ( X ) to fulfill his vow , or a freewill offering from the cattle or the sheep , it must be perfect to be accepted ; there shall be no defect in it .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	23	Either a bull or a lamb that has any limb ( AA ) too long or too short you may offer as a freewill offering , but for a vow it shall not be accepted .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	24	‘ You shall not offer to the Lord what is bruised or crushed , or torn or cut ; nor shall you make any offering of them in your land .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	25	Nor ( AB ) from a foreigner ’ s hand shall you offer any of these as ( AC ) the bread of your God , because their ( AD ) corruption is in them , and defects are in them . They shall not be accepted on your behalf. ’ ”
NKJV	Leviticus	22	26	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Leviticus	22	27	( AE ) “ When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born , it shall be seven days with its mother ; and from the eighth day and thereafter it shall be accepted as an offering made by fire to the Lord .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	28	Whether it is a cow or ewe , do not kill both her ( AF ) and her young on the same day .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	29	And when you ( AG ) offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Lord , offer it of your own free will .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	30	On the same day it shall be eaten ; you shall leave ( AH ) none of it until morning : I am the Lord .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	31	( AI ) “ Therefore you shall keep My commandments , and perform them : I am the Lord .
NKJV	Leviticus	22	32	( AJ ) You shall not profane My holy name , but ( AK ) I will be [ g ] hallowed among the children of Israel . I am the Lord who ( AL ) sanctifies you ,
NKJV	Leviticus	22	33	( AM ) who brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Leviticus 22:2 keep themselves apart from - Leviticus 22:3 defilement - Leviticus 22:9 charge - Leviticus 22:10 As a visitor - Leviticus 22:18 brings his offering - Leviticus 22:22 running sore - Leviticus 22:32 treated as holy Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Leviticus	23	26	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Leviticus	23	27	( V ) “ Also the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the Day of Atonement . It shall be a holy convocation for you ; you shall afflict your souls , and offer an offering made by fire to the Lord .
NKJV	Leviticus	23	28	And you shall do no work on that same day , for it is the Day of Atonement , ( W ) to make atonement for you before the Lord your God .
NKJV	Leviticus	23	29	For any person who is not ( X ) afflicted in soul on that same day ( Y ) shall be cut off from his people .

NKJV	Leviticus	24	24	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Leviticus	24	2	( B ) “ Command the children of Israel that they bring to you pure oil of pressed olives for the light , to make the lamps burn continually .
NKJV	Leviticus	24	3	Outside the veil of the Testimony , in the tabernacle of meeting , Aaron shall be in charge of it from evening until morning before the Lord continually ; it shall be a statute forever in your generations .

NKJV	Leviticus	24	9	And ( H ) it shall be for Aaron and his sons , ( I ) and they shall eat it in a holy place ; for it is most holy to him from the offerings of the Lord made by fire , by a perpetual statute. ” The Penalty for Blasphemy
NKJV	Leviticus	24	10	Now the son of an Israelite woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel ; and this Israelite woman ’ s son and a man of Israel fought each other in the camp .
NKJV	Leviticus	24	11	And the Israelite woman ’ s son ( J ) blasphemed the name of the Lord and ( K ) cursed ; and so they ( L ) brought him to Moses . ( His mother ’ s name was Shelomith the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan . )
NKJV	Leviticus	24	12	Then they ( M ) put him [ b ] in custody , ( N ) that [ c ] the mind of the Lord might be shown to them .
NKJV	Leviticus	24	13	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Leviticus	24	14	“ Take outside the camp him who has cursed ; then let all who heard him ( O ) lay their hands on his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
NKJV	Leviticus	24	15	“ Then you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying : ‘ Whoever curses his God ( P ) shall [ d ] bear his sin .
NKJV	Leviticus	24	16	And whoever ( Q ) blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death . All the congregation shall certainly stone him , the stranger as well as him who is born in the land . When he blasphemes the name of the Lord , he shall be put to death .
NKJV	Leviticus	24	17	( R ) ‘ Whoever kills any man shall surely be put to death .
NKJV	Leviticus	24	18	( S ) Whoever kills an animal shall make it good , animal for animal .
NKJV	Leviticus	24	19	‘ If a man causes disfigurement of his neighbor , as ( T ) he has done , so shall it be done to him—
NKJV	Leviticus	24	20	fracture for ( U ) fracture , ( V ) eye for eye , tooth for tooth ; as he has caused disfigurement of a man , so shall it be done to him .
NKJV	Leviticus	24	21	And whoever kills an animal shall restore it ; but whoever kills a man shall be put to death .
NKJV	Leviticus	24	22	You shall have ( W ) the [ e ] same law for the stranger and for one from your own country ; for I am the Lord your God. ’ ”
NKJV	Leviticus	24	23	Then Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and they took outside the camp him who had cursed , and stoned him with stones . So the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses .

NKJV	Leviticus	25	25	( AB ) ‘ If one of your brethren becomes poor , and has sold some of his possession , and if ( AC ) his redeeming relative comes to redeem it , then he may redeem what his brother sold .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	2	“ Speak to the children of Israel , and say to them : ‘ When you come into the land which I give you , then the land shall ( C ) keep a sabbath to the Lord .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	3	Six years you shall sow your field , and six years you shall prune your vineyard , and gather its fruit ;
NKJV	Leviticus	25	4	but in the ( D ) seventh year there shall be a sabbath of solemn ( E ) rest for the land , a sabbath to the Lord . You shall neither sow your field nor prune your vineyard .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	5	( F ) What grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap , nor gather the grapes of your untended vine , for it is a year of rest for the land .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	6	And the sabbath produce of the land shall be food for you : for you , your male and female servants , your hired man , and the stranger who dwells with you ,
NKJV	Leviticus	25	7	for your livestock and the beasts that are in your land—all its produce shall be for food . The Year of Jubilee
NKJV	Leviticus	25	8	‘ And you shall count seven sabbaths of years for yourself , seven times seven years ; and the time of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty-nine years .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	9	Then you shall cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month ; ( G ) on the Day of Atonement you shall make the trumpet to sound throughout all your land .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	10	And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year , and ( H ) proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants . It shall be a Jubilee for you ; ( I ) and each of you shall return to his possession , and each of you shall return to his family .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	11	That fiftieth year shall be a Jubilee to you ; in it ( J ) you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of its own accord , nor gather the grapes of your untended vine .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	12	For it is the Jubilee ; it shall be holy to you ; ( K ) you shall eat its produce from the field .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	13	( L ) ‘ In this Year of Jubilee , each of you shall return to his possession .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	14	And if you sell anything to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor ’ s hand , you shall not ( M ) oppress one another .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	15	( N ) According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor , and according to the number of years of crops he shall sell to you .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	16	According to the multitude of years you shall increase its price , and according to the fewer number of years you shall diminish its price ; for he sells to you according to the number of the years of the crops .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	17	Therefore ( O ) you shall not [ a ] oppress one another , ( P ) but you shall fear your God ; for I am the Lord your God . Provisions for the Seventh Year
NKJV	Leviticus	25	18	( Q ) ‘ So you shall observe My statutes and keep My judgments , and perform them ; ( R ) and you will dwell in the land in safety .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	19	Then the land will yield its fruit , and ( S ) you will eat your fill , and dwell there in safety .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	20	‘ And if you say , ( T ) “ What shall we eat in the seventh year , since ( U ) we shall not sow nor gather in our produce ? ”
NKJV	Leviticus	25	21	Then I will ( V ) command My blessing on you in the ( W ) sixth year , and it will bring forth produce enough for three years .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	22	( X ) And you shall sow in the eighth year , and eat ( Y ) old produce until the ninth year ; until its produce comes in , you shall eat of the old harvest . Redemption of Property
NKJV	Leviticus	25	23	‘ The land shall not be sold permanently , for ( Z ) the land is Mine ; for you are ( AA ) strangers and sojourners with Me .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	24	And in all the land of your possession you shall grant redemption of the land .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	26	Or if the man has no one to redeem it , but he himself becomes able to redeem it ,
NKJV	Leviticus	25	27	then ( AD ) let him count the years since its sale , and restore the remainder to the man to whom he sold it , that he may return to his possession .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	28	But if he is not able to have it restored to himself , then what was sold shall remain in the hand of him who bought it until the Year of Jubilee ; ( AE ) and in the Jubilee it shall be released , and he shall return to his possession .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	29	‘ If a man sells a house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold ; within a full year he may redeem it .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	30	But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year , then the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to him who bought it , throughout his generations . It shall not be released in the Jubilee .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	31	However the houses of villages which have no wall around them shall be counted as the fields of the country . They may be redeemed , and they shall be released in the Jubilee .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	32	Nevertheless ( AF ) the cities of the Levites , and the houses in the cities of their possession , the Levites may redeem at any time .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	33	And if a man purchases a house from the Levites , then the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall be released in the Jubilee ; for the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	34	But ( AG ) the field of the common-land of their cities may not be ( AH ) sold , for it is their perpetual possession . Lending to the Poor
NKJV	Leviticus	25	35	‘ If one of your brethren becomes poor , and [ b ] falls into poverty among you , then you shall ( AI ) help him , like a stranger or a sojourner , that he may live with you .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	36	( AJ ) Take no usury or interest from him ; but ( AK ) fear your God , that your brother may live with you .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	37	You shall not lend him your money for usury , nor lend him your food at a profit .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	38	( AL ) I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God . The Law Concerning Slavery
NKJV	Leviticus	25	39	‘ And if one of your brethren who dwells by you becomes poor , and sells himself to you , you shall not compel him to serve as a slave .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	40	As a hired servant and a sojourner he shall be with you , and shall serve you until the Year of Jubilee .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	41	And then he shall depart from you—he and his children ( AM ) with him—and shall return to his own family . He shall return to the possession of his fathers .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	42	For they are ( AN ) My servants , whom I brought out of the land of Egypt ; they shall not be sold as slaves .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	43	( AO ) You shall not rule over him ( AP ) with [ c ] rigor , but you ( AQ ) shall fear your God .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	44	And as for your male and female slaves whom you may have—from the nations that are around you , from them you may buy male and female slaves .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	45	Moreover you may buy ( AR ) the children of the strangers who dwell among you , and their families who are with you , which they beget in your land ; and they shall become your property .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	46	And ( AS ) you may take them as an inheritance for your children after you , to inherit them as a possession ; they shall be your permanent slaves . But regarding your brethren , the children of Israel , you shall not rule over one another with rigor .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	47	‘ Now if a sojourner or stranger close to you becomes rich , and one of your brethren who dwells by him becomes poor , and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner close to you , or to a member of the stranger ’ s family ,
NKJV	Leviticus	25	48	after he is sold he may be redeemed again . One of his brothers may redeem him ;
NKJV	Leviticus	25	49	or his uncle or his uncle ’ s son may redeem him ; or anyone who is near of kin to him in his family may redeem him ; or if he is able he may redeem himself .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	50	Thus he shall reckon with him who bought him : The price of his release shall be according to the number of years , from the year that he was sold to him until the Year of Jubilee ; it shall be ( AT ) according to the time of a hired servant for him .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	51	If there are still many years remaining , according to them he shall repay the price of his redemption from the money with which he was bought .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	52	And if there remain but a few years until the Year of Jubilee , then he shall reckon with him , and according to his years he shall repay him the price of his redemption .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	53	He shall be with him as a yearly hired servant , and he shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	54	And if he is not redeemed in these years , then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee—he and his children with him .
NKJV	Leviticus	25	55	For the children of Israel are servants to Me ; they are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .

NKJV	Numbers	8	8	Then let them take a young bull with ( I ) its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil , and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering .
NKJV	Numbers	8	2	“ Speak to Aaron , and say to him , ‘ When you ( B ) arrange the lamps , the seven ( C ) lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand. ’ ”
NKJV	Numbers	8	3	And Aaron did so ; he arranged the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand , as the Lord commanded Moses .
NKJV	Numbers	8	4	( D ) Now this workmanship of the lampstand was hammered gold ; from its shaft to its flowers it was ( E ) hammered work . ( F ) According to the pattern which the Lord had shown Moses , so he made the lampstand . Cleansing and Dedication of the Levites
NKJV	Numbers	8	5	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Numbers	8	6	“ Take the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse them ceremonially .
NKJV	Numbers	8	7	Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them : Sprinkle ( G ) water of purification on them , and ( H ) let [ a ] them shave all their body , and let them wash their clothes , and so make themselves clean .
NKJV	Numbers	8	9	( J ) And you shall bring the Levites before the tabernacle of meeting , ( K ) and you shall gather together the whole congregation of the children of Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	8	10	So you shall bring the Levites before the Lord , and the children of Israel ( L ) shall lay their hands on the Levites ;
NKJV	Numbers	8	11	and Aaron shall [ b ] offer the Levites before the Lord like a ( M ) wave offering from the children of Israel , that they may perform the work of the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	8	12	( N ) Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls , and you shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord , to make atonement for the Levites .
NKJV	Numbers	8	13	“ And you shall stand the Levites before Aaron and his sons , and then offer them like a wave offering to the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	8	14	Thus you shall ( O ) separate the Levites from among the children of Israel , and the Levites shall be ( P ) Mine .
NKJV	Numbers	8	15	After that the Levites shall go in to service the tabernacle of meeting . So you shall cleanse them and ( Q ) offer them like a wave offering .
NKJV	Numbers	8	16	For they are ( R ) wholly given to Me from among the children of Israel ; I have taken them for Myself ( S ) instead of all who open the womb , the firstborn of all the children of Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	8	17	( T ) For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are Mine , both man and beast ; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I [ c ] sanctified them to Myself .
NKJV	Numbers	8	18	I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the children of Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	8	19	And ( U ) I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the children of Israel , to do the work for the children of Israel in the tabernacle of meeting , and to make atonement for the children of Israel , ( V ) that there be no plague among the children of Israel when the children of Israel come near the sanctuary. ”
NKJV	Numbers	8	20	Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel did to the Levites ; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so the children of Israel did to them .
NKJV	Numbers	8	21	( W ) And the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes ; then Aaron presented them like a wave offering before the Lord , and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them .
NKJV	Numbers	8	22	( X ) After that the Levites went in to do their work in the tabernacle of meeting before Aaron and his sons ; ( Y ) as the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so they did to them .
NKJV	Numbers	8	23	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	8	24	“ This is what pertains to the Levites : ( Z ) From twenty-five years old and above one may enter to perform service in the work of the tabernacle of meeting ;
NKJV	Numbers	8	25	and at the age of fifty years they must cease performing this work , and shall work no more .
NKJV	Numbers	8	26	They may minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of meeting , ( AA ) to attend to needs , but they themselves shall do no work . Thus you shall do to the Levites regarding their duties. ” Footnotes - Numbers 8:7 Heb . let them cause a razor to pass over - Numbers 8:11 present - Numbers 8:17 set them apart Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Numbers	9	9	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	9	2	“ Let the children of Israel keep ( B ) the Passover at its appointed ( C ) time .
NKJV	Numbers	9	3	On the fourteenth day of this month , [ a ] at twilight , you shall [ b ] keep it at its appointed time . According to all its [ c ] rites and ceremonies you shall keep it. ”
NKJV	Numbers	9	4	So Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover .
NKJV	Numbers	9	5	And ( D ) they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month , at twilight , in the Wilderness of Sinai ; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did .
NKJV	Numbers	9	6	Now there were certain men who were ( E ) defiled by a human corpse , so that they could not keep the Passover on that day ; ( F ) and they came before Moses and Aaron that day .
NKJV	Numbers	9	7	And those men said to him , “ We became defiled by a human corpse . Why are we kept from presenting the offering of the Lord at its appointed time among the children of Israel ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	9	8	And Moses said to them , “ Stand still , that ( G ) I may hear what the Lord will command concerning you. ”
NKJV	Numbers	9	10	“ Speak to the children of Israel , saying : ‘ If anyone of you or your [ d ] posterity is unclean because of a corpse , or is far away on a journey , he may still keep the Lord ’ s Passover .
NKJV	Numbers	9	11	On ( H ) the fourteenth day of the second month , at twilight , they may keep it . They shall ( I ) eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
NKJV	Numbers	9	12	( J ) They shall leave none of it until morning , ( K ) nor break one of its bones . ( L ) According to all the [ e ] ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it .
NKJV	Numbers	9	13	But the man who is clean and is not on a journey , and ceases to keep the Passover , that same person ( M ) shall be cut off from among his people , because he ( N ) did not bring the offering of the Lord at its appointed time ; that man shall ( O ) bear his sin .
NKJV	Numbers	9	14	‘ And if a stranger [ f ] dwells among you , and would keep the Lord ’ s Passover , he must do so according to the rite of the Passover and according to its ceremony ; ( P ) you shall have one [ g ] ordinance , both for the stranger and the native of the land. ’ ” The Cloud and the Fire ( Q )
NKJV	Numbers	9	15	Now ( R ) on the day that the tabernacle was raised up , the cloud ( S ) covered the tabernacle , the tent of the Testimony ; ( T ) from evening until morning it was above the tabernacle like the appearance of fire .
NKJV	Numbers	9	16	So it was always : the cloud covered it by day , and the appearance of fire by night .
NKJV	Numbers	9	17	Whenever the cloud ( U ) was [ h ] taken up from above the tabernacle , after that the children of Israel would journey ; and in the place where the cloud settled , there the children of Israel would pitch their tents .
NKJV	Numbers	9	18	At the [ i ] command of the Lord the children of Israel would journey , and at the command of the Lord they would camp ; ( V ) as long as the cloud stayed above the tabernacle they remained encamped .
NKJV	Numbers	9	19	Even when the cloud continued long , many days above the tabernacle , the children of Israel ( W ) kept the charge of the Lord and did not journey .
NKJV	Numbers	9	20	So it was , when the cloud was above the tabernacle a few days : according to the command of the Lord they would remain encamped , and according to the command of the Lord they would journey .
NKJV	Numbers	9	21	So it was , when the cloud remained only from evening until morning : when the cloud was taken up in the morning , then they would journey ; whether by day or by night , whenever the cloud was taken up , they would journey .
NKJV	Numbers	9	22	Whether it was two days , a month , or a year that the cloud remained above the tabernacle , the children of Israel ( X ) would remain encamped and not journey ; but when it was taken up , they would journey .
NKJV	Numbers	9	23	At the command of the Lord they remained encamped , and at the command of the Lord they journeyed ; they ( Y ) kept the charge of the Lord , at the command of the Lord by the hand of Moses .

NKJV	Numbers	10	10	Also ( M ) in the day of your gladness , in your appointed feasts , and at the beginning of your months , you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings ; and they shall be ( N ) a memorial for you before your God : I am the Lord your God. ” Departure from Sinai
NKJV	Numbers	10	2	“ Make two silver trumpets for yourself ; you shall make them of hammered work ; you shall use them for ( A ) calling the congregation and for directing the movement of the camps .
NKJV	Numbers	10	3	When ( B ) they blow both of them , all the congregation shall gather before you at the door of the tabernacle of meeting .
NKJV	Numbers	10	4	But if they blow only one , then the leaders , the ( C ) heads of the divisions of Israel , shall gather to you .
NKJV	Numbers	10	5	When you sound the ( D ) advance , ( E ) the camps that lie on the east side shall then begin their journey .
NKJV	Numbers	10	6	When you sound the advance the second time , then the camps that lie ( F ) on the south side shall begin their journey ; they shall sound the call for them to begin their journeys .
NKJV	Numbers	10	7	And when the assembly is to be gathered together , ( G ) you shall blow , but not ( H ) sound the advance .
NKJV	Numbers	10	8	( I ) The sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow the trumpets ; and these shall be to you as an [ a ] ordinance forever throughout your generations .
NKJV	Numbers	10	9	( J ) “ When you go to war in your land against the enemy who ( K ) oppresses you , then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets , and you will be ( L ) remembered before the Lord your God , and you will be saved from your enemies .
NKJV	Numbers	10	11	Now it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cloud ( O ) was taken up from above the tabernacle of the Testimony .
NKJV	Numbers	10	12	And the children of Israel set out from the ( P ) Wilderness of Sinai on ( Q ) their journeys ; then the cloud settled down in the ( R ) Wilderness of Paran .
NKJV	Numbers	10	13	So they started out for the first time ( S ) according to the command of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
NKJV	Numbers	10	14	The [ b ] standard of the camp of the children of Judah ( T ) set out first according to their armies ; over their army was ( U ) Nahshon the son of Amminadab .
NKJV	Numbers	10	15	Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar .
NKJV	Numbers	10	16	And over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon .
NKJV	Numbers	10	17	Then ( V ) the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out , ( W ) carrying the tabernacle .
NKJV	Numbers	10	18	And ( X ) the standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their armies ; over their army was Elizur the son of Shedeur .
NKJV	Numbers	10	19	Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai .
NKJV	Numbers	10	20	And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel .
NKJV	Numbers	10	21	Then the Kohathites set out , carrying the ( Y ) holy things . ( The tabernacle would be [ c ] prepared for their arrival . )
NKJV	Numbers	10	22	And ( Z ) the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set out according to their armies ; over their army was Elishama the son of Ammihud .
NKJV	Numbers	10	23	Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur .
NKJV	Numbers	10	24	And over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni .
NKJV	Numbers	10	25	Then ( AA ) the standard of the camp of the children of Dan ( the rear guard of all the camps ) set out according to their armies ; over their army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai .
NKJV	Numbers	10	26	Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran .
NKJV	Numbers	10	27	And over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan .
NKJV	Numbers	10	28	( AB ) Thus was the order of march of the children of Israel , according to their armies , when they began their journey .
NKJV	Numbers	10	29	Now Moses said to ( AC ) Hobab the son of ( AD ) Reuel [ d ] the Midianite , Moses ’ father-in-law , “ We are setting out for the place of which the Lord said , ( AE ) ‘ I will give it to you. ’ Come with us , and ( AF ) we will treat you well ; for ( AG ) the Lord has promised good things to Israel. ”
NKJV	Numbers	10	30	And he said to him , “ I will not go , but I will depart to my own land and to my relatives. ”
NKJV	Numbers	10	31	So Moses said , “ Please do not leave , inasmuch as you know how we are to camp in the wilderness , and you can [ e ] be our ( AH ) eyes .
NKJV	Numbers	10	32	And it shall be , if you go with us—indeed it shall be—that ( AI ) whatever good the Lord will do to us , the same we will do to you. ”
NKJV	Numbers	10	33	So they departed from ( AJ ) the mountain of the Lord on a journey of three days ; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord ( AK ) went before them for the three days ’ journey , to search out a resting place for them .
NKJV	Numbers	10	34	And ( AL ) the cloud of the Lord was above them by day when they went out from the camp .
NKJV	Numbers	10	35	So it was , whenever the ark set out , that Moses said : ( AM ) “ Rise up , O Lord ! Let Your enemies be scattered , And let those who hate You flee before You. ”
NKJV	Numbers	10	36	And when it rested , he said : “ Return , O Lord , To the many thousands of Israel. ” Footnotes - Numbers 10:8 statute - Numbers 10:14 banner - Numbers 10:21 Prepared by the Gershonites and the Merarites - Numbers 10:29 Jethro , Ex . 3:1 ; LXX Raguel - Numbers 10:31 Act as our guide Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Numbers	11	11	( O ) So Moses said to the Lord , “ Why have You afflicted Your servant ? And why have I not found favor in Your sight , that You have laid the [ d ] burden of all these people on me ?
NKJV	Numbers	11	2	Then the people ( D ) cried out to Moses , and when Moses ( E ) prayed to the Lord , the fire was [ a ] quenched .
NKJV	Numbers	11	3	So he called the name of the place [ b ] Taberah , because the fire of the Lord had burned among them .
NKJV	Numbers	11	4	Now the ( F ) mixed multitude who were among them [ c ] yielded to ( G ) intense craving ; so the children of Israel also wept again and said : ( H ) “ Who will give us meat to eat ?
NKJV	Numbers	11	5	( I ) We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt , the cucumbers , the melons , the leeks , the onions , and the garlic ;
NKJV	Numbers	11	6	but now ( J ) our whole being is dried up ; there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	11	7	Now ( K ) the manna was like coriander seed , and its color like the color of bdellium .
NKJV	Numbers	11	8	The people went about and gathered it , ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar , cooked it in pans , and made cakes of it ; and ( L ) its taste was like the taste of pastry prepared with oil .
NKJV	Numbers	11	9	And ( M ) when the dew fell on the camp in the night , the manna fell on it .
NKJV	Numbers	11	10	Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families , everyone at the door of his tent ; and ( N ) the anger of the Lord was greatly aroused ; Moses also was displeased .
NKJV	Numbers	11	12	Did I conceive all these people ? Did I beget them , that You should say to me , ( P ) ‘ Carry them in your bosom , as a ( Q ) guardian carries a nursing child , ’ to the land which You ( R ) swore [ e ] to their fathers ?
NKJV	Numbers	11	13	( S ) Where am I to get meat to give to all these people ? For they weep all over me , saying , ‘ Give us meat , that we may eat. ’
NKJV	Numbers	11	14	( T ) I am not able to bear all these people alone , because the burden is too heavy for me .
NKJV	Numbers	11	15	If You treat me like this , please kill me here and now—if I have found favor in Your sight—and ( U ) do not let me see my wretchedness ! ” The Seventy Elders
NKJV	Numbers	11	16	So the Lord said to Moses : “ Gather to Me ( V ) seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom you know to be the elders of the people and ( W ) officers over them ; bring them to the tabernacle of meeting , that they may stand there with you .
NKJV	Numbers	11	17	Then I will come down and talk with you there . ( X ) I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put the same upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you , that you may not bear it yourself alone .
NKJV	Numbers	11	18	Then you shall say to the people , [ f ] ‘ Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow , and you shall eat meat ; for you have wept ( Y ) in the hearing of the Lord , saying , “ Who will give us meat to eat ? For it was well with us in Egypt. ” Therefore the Lord will give you meat , and you shall eat .
NKJV	Numbers	11	19	You shall eat , not one day , nor two days , nor five days , nor ten days , nor twenty days ,
NKJV	Numbers	11	20	( Z ) but for a whole month , until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you , because you have ( AA ) despised the Lord who is among you , and have wept before Him , saying , ( AB ) “ Why did we ever come up out of Egypt ? ” ’ ”
NKJV	Numbers	11	21	And Moses said , ( AC ) “ The people whom I am among are six hundred thousand men on foot ; yet You have said , ‘ I will give them meat , that they may eat for a whole month. ’
NKJV	Numbers	11	22	( AD ) Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them , to provide enough for them ? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to provide enough for them ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	11	23	And the Lord said to Moses , ( AE ) “ Has [ g ] the Lord ’ s arm been shortened ? Now you shall see whether ( AF ) what I say will happen to you or not. ”
NKJV	Numbers	11	24	So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord , and he ( AG ) gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tabernacle .
NKJV	Numbers	11	25	Then the Lord came down in the cloud , and spoke to him , and took of the Spirit that was upon him , and placed the same upon the seventy elders ; and it happened , ( AH ) when the Spirit rested upon them , that ( AI ) they prophesied , [ h ] although they never did so again .
NKJV	Numbers	11	26	But two men had remained in the camp : the name of one was Eldad , and the name of the other Medad . And the Spirit rested upon them . Now they were among those listed , but who ( AJ ) had not gone out to the tabernacle ; yet they prophesied in the camp .
NKJV	Numbers	11	27	And a young man ran and told Moses , and said , “ Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp. ”
NKJV	Numbers	11	28	So Joshua the son of Nun , Moses ’ assistant , one of his choice men , answered and said , “ Moses my lord , ( AK ) forbid them ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	11	29	Then Moses said to him , “ Are you [ i ] zealous for my sake ? ( AL ) Oh , that all the Lord ’ s people were prophets and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	11	30	And Moses returned to the camp , he and the elders of Israel . The Lord Sends Quail
NKJV	Numbers	11	31	Now a ( AM ) wind went out from the Lord , and it brought quail from the sea and left them fluttering near the camp , about a day ’ s journey on this side and about a day ’ s journey on the other side , all around the camp , and about two cubits above the surface of the ground .
NKJV	Numbers	11	32	And the people stayed up all that day , all night , and all the next day , and gathered the quail ( he who gathered least gathered ten ( AN ) homers ) ; and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp .
NKJV	Numbers	11	33	But while the ( AO ) meat was still between their teeth , before it was chewed , the wrath of the Lord was aroused against the people , and the Lord struck the people with a very great plague .
NKJV	Numbers	11	34	So he called the name of that place [ j ] Kibroth Hattaavah , because there they buried the people who had yielded to craving .
NKJV	Numbers	11	35	( AP ) From Kibroth Hattaavah the people moved to Hazeroth , and camped at Hazeroth . Footnotes - Numbers 11:2 extinguished - Numbers 11:3 Lit .

NKJV	Numbers	12	12	Please ( U ) do not let her be as one dead , whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother ’ s womb ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	12	2	So they said , “ Has the Lord indeed spoken only through ( D ) Moses ? ( E ) Has He not spoken through us also ? ” And the Lord ( F ) heard it .
NKJV	Numbers	12	3	( Now the man Moses was very humble , more than all men who were on the face of the earth . )
NKJV	Numbers	12	4	( G ) Suddenly the Lord said to Moses , Aaron , and Miriam , “ Come out , you three , to the tabernacle of meeting ! ” So the three came out .
NKJV	Numbers	12	5	( H ) Then the Lord came down in the pillar of cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam . And they both went forward .
NKJV	Numbers	12	6	Then He said , “ Hear now My words : If there is a prophet among you , I , the Lord , make Myself known to him ( I ) in a vision ; I speak to him ( J ) in a dream .
NKJV	Numbers	12	7	Not so with ( K ) My servant Moses ; ( L ) He is faithful in all ( M ) My house .
NKJV	Numbers	12	8	I speak with him ( N ) face to face , Even ( O ) plainly , [ c ] and not in [ d ] dark sayings ; And he sees ( P ) the form of the Lord . Why then ( Q ) were you not afraid To speak against My servant Moses ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	12	9	So the anger of the Lord was aroused against them , and He departed .
NKJV	Numbers	12	10	And when the cloud departed from above the tabernacle , ( R ) suddenly Miriam became ( S ) leprous , as white as snow . Then Aaron turned toward Miriam , and there she was , a leper .
NKJV	Numbers	12	11	So Aaron said to Moses , “ Oh , my lord ! Please ( T ) do not lay [ e ] this sin on us , in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned .
NKJV	Numbers	12	13	So Moses cried out to the Lord , saying , “ Please ( V ) heal her , O God , I pray ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	12	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ If her father had but ( W ) spit in her face , would she not be shamed seven days ? Let her be ( X ) shut [ f ] out of the camp seven days , and afterward she may be received again. ”
NKJV	Numbers	12	15	( Y ) So Miriam was shut out of the camp seven days , and the people did not journey till Miriam was brought in again .
NKJV	Numbers	12	16	And afterward the people moved from ( Z ) Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran .

NKJV	Numbers	13	3	So Moses sent them ( C ) from the Wilderness of Paran according to the command of the Lord , all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	13	4	Now these were their names : from the tribe of Reuben , Shammua the son of Zaccur ;

NKJV	Numbers	13	15	from the tribe of Gad , Geuel the son of Machi .
NKJV	Numbers	13	16	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to [ b ] spy out the land . And Moses called ( F ) Hoshea [ c ] the son of Nun , Joshua .
NKJV	Numbers	13	17	Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said to them , “ Go up this way into the South , and go up to ( G ) the mountains ,
NKJV	Numbers	13	18	and see what the land is like : whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak , few or many ;
NKJV	Numbers	13	19	whether the land they dwell in is good or bad ; whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds ;
NKJV	Numbers	13	20	whether the land is [ d ] rich or poor ; and whether there are forests there or not . ( H ) Be of good courage . And bring some of the fruit of the land. ” Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes .
NKJV	Numbers	13	21	So they went up and spied out the land ( I ) from the Wilderness of Zin as far as ( J ) Rehob , near the entrance of ( K ) Hamath .
NKJV	Numbers	13	22	And they went up through the South and came to ( L ) Hebron ; Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the descendants of ( M ) Anak , were there . ( Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
NKJV	Numbers	13	23	( N ) Then they came to the [ e ] Valley of Eshcol , and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes ; they carried it between two of them on a pole . They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs .
NKJV	Numbers	13	24	The place was called the Valley of [ f ] Eshcol , because of the cluster which the men of Israel cut down there .
NKJV	Numbers	13	25	And they returned from spying out the land after forty days .
NKJV	Numbers	13	26	Now they departed and came back to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran , at ( O ) Kadesh ; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation , and showed them the fruit of the land .
NKJV	Numbers	13	27	Then they told him , and said : “ We went to the land where you sent us . It truly [ g ] flows with ( P ) milk and honey , ( Q ) and this is its fruit .
NKJV	Numbers	13	28	Nevertheless the ( R ) people who dwell in the land are strong ; the cities are fortified and very large ; moreover we saw the descendants of ( S ) Anak there .
NKJV	Numbers	13	29	( T ) The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South ; the Hittites , the Jebusites , and the Amorites dwell in the mountains ; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the banks of the Jordan. ”
NKJV	Numbers	13	30	Then ( U ) Caleb quieted the people before Moses , and said , “ Let us go up at once and take possession , for we are well able to overcome it. ”
NKJV	Numbers	13	31	( V ) But the men who had gone up with him said , “ We are not able to go up against the people , for they are stronger than we. ”
NKJV	Numbers	13	32	And they ( W ) gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out , saying , “ The land through which we have gone as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants , and ( X ) all the people whom we saw in it are men of great stature .

NKJV	Numbers	14	14	and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land . They have ( T ) heard that You , Lord , are among these people ; that You , Lord , are seen face to face and Your cloud stands above them , and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night .
NKJV	Numbers	14	2	( B ) And all the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron , and the whole congregation said to them , “ If only we had died in the land of Egypt ! Or if only we had died in this wilderness !
NKJV	Numbers	14	3	Why has the Lord brought us to this land to [ a ] fall by the sword , that our wives and ( C ) children should become victims ? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	14	4	So they said to one another , ( D ) “ Let us select a leader and ( E ) return to Egypt. ”
NKJV	Numbers	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron [ b ] fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	14	6	But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , who were among those who had spied out the land , tore their clothes ;
NKJV	Numbers	14	7	and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel , saying : ( F ) “ The land we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land .
NKJV	Numbers	14	8	If the Lord ( G ) delights in us , then He will bring us into this land and give it to us , ( H ) ‘ a land which flows with milk and honey. ’
NKJV	Numbers	14	9	Only ( I ) do not rebel against the Lord , ( J ) nor fear the people of the land , for ( K ) they [ c ] are our bread ; their protection has departed from them , ( L ) and the Lord is with us . Do not fear them. ”
NKJV	Numbers	14	10	( M ) And all the congregation said to stone them with stones . Now ( N ) the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of meeting before all the children of Israel . Moses Intercedes for the People
NKJV	Numbers	14	11	Then the Lord said to Moses : “ How long will these people ( O ) reject [ d ] Me ? And how long will they not ( P ) believe Me , with all the [ e ] signs which I have performed among them ?
NKJV	Numbers	14	12	I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them , and I will ( Q ) make of you a nation greater and mightier than they. ”
NKJV	Numbers	14	13	And ( R ) Moses said to the Lord : ( S ) “ Then the Egyptians will hear it , for by Your might You brought these people up from among them ,
NKJV	Numbers	14	15	Now if You kill these people as one man , then the nations which have heard of Your fame will speak , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	14	16	‘ Because the Lord was not ( U ) able to bring this people to the land which He swore to give them , therefore He killed them in the wilderness. ’
NKJV	Numbers	14	17	And now , I pray , let the power of my Lord be great , just as You have spoken , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	14	18	( V ) ‘ The Lord is longsuffering and abundant in mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression ; but He by no means clears the guilty , ( W ) visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation. ’
NKJV	Numbers	14	19	( X ) Pardon the iniquity of this people , I pray , ( Y ) according to the greatness of Your mercy , just ( Z ) as You have forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now. ”
NKJV	Numbers	14	20	Then the Lord said : “ I have pardoned , ( AA ) according to your word ;
NKJV	Numbers	14	21	but truly , as I live , ( AB ) all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord—
NKJV	Numbers	14	22	( AC ) because all these men who have seen My glory and the signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have put Me to the test now ( AD ) these ten times , and have not heeded My voice ,
NKJV	Numbers	14	23	they certainly shall not ( AE ) see the land of which I [ f ] swore to their fathers , nor shall any of those who rejected Me see it .
NKJV	Numbers	14	24	But My servant ( AF ) Caleb , because he has a different spirit in him and ( AG ) has followed Me fully , I will bring into the land where he went , and his descendants shall inherit it .
NKJV	Numbers	14	25	Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley ; tomorrow turn and ( AH ) move out into the wilderness by the Way of the Red Sea. ” Death Sentence on the Rebels
NKJV	Numbers	14	26	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	14	27	( AI ) “ How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who complain against Me ? ( AJ ) I have heard the complaints which the children of Israel make against Me .
NKJV	Numbers	14	28	Say to them , ( AK ) ‘ As I live , ’ says the Lord , ‘ just as you have spoken in My hearing , so I will do to you :
NKJV	Numbers	14	29	The carcasses of you who have complained against Me shall fall in this wilderness , ( AL ) all of you who were numbered , according to your entire number , from twenty years old and above .
NKJV	Numbers	14	30	( AM ) Except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun , you shall by no means enter the land which I [ g ] swore I would make you dwell in .
NKJV	Numbers	14	31	( AN ) But your little ones , whom you said would be victims , I will bring in , and they shall [ h ] know the land which ( AO ) you have despised .
NKJV	Numbers	14	32	But as for you , ( AP ) your [ i ] carcasses shall fall in this wilderness .
NKJV	Numbers	14	33	And your sons shall ( AQ ) be [ j ] shepherds in the wilderness ( AR ) forty years , and ( AS ) bear the brunt of your infidelity , until your carcasses are consumed in the wilderness .
NKJV	Numbers	14	34	( AT ) According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land , ( AU ) forty days , for each day you shall bear your [ k ] guilt one year , namely forty years , ( AV ) and you shall know My [ l ] rejection .
NKJV	Numbers	14	35	( AW ) I the Lord have spoken this . I will surely do so to all ( AX ) this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me . In this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die. ’ ”
NKJV	Numbers	14	36	Now the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land , who returned and made all the congregation complain against him by bringing a bad report of the land ,
NKJV	Numbers	14	37	those very men who brought the evil report about the land , ( AY ) died by the plague before the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	14	38	( AZ ) But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive , of the men who went to spy out the land . A Futile Invasion Attempt ( BA )
NKJV	Numbers	14	39	Then Moses told these words to all the children of Israel , ( BB ) and the people mourned greatly .
NKJV	Numbers	14	40	And they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain , saying , ( BC ) “ Here we are , and we will go up to the place which the Lord has promised , for we have sinned ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	14	41	And Moses said , “ Now why do you [ m ] transgress the command of the Lord ? For this will not succeed .
NKJV	Numbers	14	42	( BD ) Do not go up , lest you be defeated by your enemies , for the Lord is not among you .
NKJV	Numbers	14	43	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you , and you shall fall by the sword ; ( BE ) because you have turned away from the Lord , the Lord will not be with you. ”
NKJV	Numbers	14	44	( BF ) But they presumed to go up to the mountaintop . Nevertheless , neither the ark of the covenant of the Lord nor Moses departed from the camp .
NKJV	Numbers	14	45	Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelt in that mountain came down and attacked them , and drove them back as far as ( BG ) Hormah .

NKJV	Numbers	15	15	( O ) One [ c ] ordinance shall be for you of the assembly and for the stranger who dwells with you , an ordinance forever throughout your generations ; as you are , so shall the stranger be before the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	15	2	( A ) “ Speak to the children of Israel , and say to them : ‘ When you have come into the land you are to inhabit , which I am giving to you ,
NKJV	Numbers	15	3	and you ( B ) make an offering by fire to the Lord , a burnt offering or a sacrifice , ( C ) to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or ( D ) in your appointed feasts , to make a ( E ) sweet [ a ] aroma to the Lord , from the herd or the flock ,
NKJV	Numbers	15	4	then ( F ) he who presents his offering to the Lord shall bring ( G ) a grain offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed ( H ) with one-fourth of a hin of oil ;
NKJV	Numbers	15	5	( I ) and one-fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering you shall prepare with the burnt offering or the sacrifice , for each ( J ) lamb .
NKJV	Numbers	15	6	( K ) Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil ;
NKJV	Numbers	15	7	and as a drink offering you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine as a sweet aroma to the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	15	8	And when you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering , or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow , or as a ( L ) peace offering to the Lord ,
NKJV	Numbers	15	9	then shall be offered ( M ) with the young bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil ;
NKJV	Numbers	15	10	and you shall bring as the drink offering half a hin of wine as an offering made by fire , a sweet aroma to the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	15	11	( N ) ‘ Thus it shall be done for each young bull , for each ram , or for each lamb or young goat .
NKJV	Numbers	15	12	According to the number that you prepare , so you shall do with everyone according to their number .
NKJV	Numbers	15	13	All who are native-born shall do these things in this manner , in presenting an offering made by fire , a sweet aroma to the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	15	14	And if a stranger [ b ] dwells with you , or whoever is among you throughout your generations , and would present an offering made by fire , a sweet aroma to the Lord , just as you do , so shall he do .
NKJV	Numbers	15	16	One law and one custom shall be for you and for the stranger who dwells with you. ’ ”
NKJV	Numbers	15	17	Again the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	15	18	( P ) “ Speak to the children of Israel , and say to them : ‘ When you come into the land to which I bring you ,
NKJV	Numbers	15	19	then it will be , when you eat of ( Q ) the bread of the land , that you shall offer up a heave offering to the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	15	20	( R ) You shall offer up a cake of the first of your ground meal as a heave offering ; as ( S ) a heave offering of the threshing floor , so shall you offer it up .
NKJV	Numbers	15	21	Of the first of your ground meal you shall give to the Lord a heave offering throughout your generations . Laws Concerning Unintentional Sin
NKJV	Numbers	15	22	( T ) ‘ If you sin unintentionally , and do not observe all these commandments which the Lord has spoken to Moses—
NKJV	Numbers	15	23	all that the Lord has commanded you by the hand of Moses , from the day the Lord gave commandment and onward throughout your generations—
NKJV	Numbers	15	24	then it will be , ( U ) if it is unintentionally committed , [ d ] without the knowledge of the congregation , that the whole congregation shall offer one young bull as a burnt offering , as a sweet aroma to the Lord , ( V ) with its grain offering and its drink offering , according to the ordinance , and ( W ) one kid of the goats as a sin offering .
NKJV	Numbers	15	25	( X ) So the priest shall make atonement for the whole congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them , for it was unintentional ; they shall bring their offering , an offering made by fire to the Lord , and their sin offering before the Lord , for their unintended sin .
NKJV	Numbers	15	26	It shall be forgiven the whole congregation of the children of Israel and the stranger who dwells among them , because all the people did it unintentionally .
NKJV	Numbers	15	27	‘ And ( Y ) if a person sins unintentionally , then he shall bring a female goat in its first year as a sin offering .
NKJV	Numbers	15	28	( Z ) So the priest shall make atonement for the person who sins unintentionally , when he sins unintentionally before the Lord , to make atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
NKJV	Numbers	15	29	( AA ) You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally , for him who is native-born among the children of Israel and for the stranger who dwells among them . Law Concerning Presumptuous Sin
NKJV	Numbers	15	30	( AB ) ‘ But the person who does anything [ e ] presumptuously , whether he is native-born or a stranger , that one [ f ] brings reproach on the Lord , and he shall be [ g ] cut off from among his people .
NKJV	Numbers	15	31	Because he has ( AC ) despised the word of the Lord , and has broken His commandment , that person shall be completely cut off ; his [ h ] guilt shall be upon him. ’ ” Penalty for Violating the Sabbath ( AD )
NKJV	Numbers	15	32	Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , ( AE ) they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day .
NKJV	Numbers	15	33	And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron , and to all the congregation .
NKJV	Numbers	15	34	They put him ( AF ) under guard , because it had not been explained what should be done to him .
NKJV	Numbers	15	35	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( AG ) “ The man must surely be put to death ; all the congregation shall ( AH ) stone him with stones outside the camp. ”
NKJV	Numbers	15	36	So , as the Lord commanded Moses , all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones , and he died . Tassels on Garments
NKJV	Numbers	15	37	Again the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	15	38	“ Speak to the children of Israel : Tell ( AI ) them to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations , and to put a blue thread in the tassels of the corners .
NKJV	Numbers	15	39	And you shall have the tassel , that you may look upon it and ( AJ ) remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them , and that you ( AK ) may not ( AL ) follow the harlotry to which your own heart and your own eyes are inclined ,
NKJV	Numbers	15	40	and that you may remember and do all My commandments , and be ( AM ) holy for your God .

NKJV	Numbers	16	16	And Moses said to Korah , “ Tomorrow , you and all your company be present ( T ) before the Lord—you and they , as well as Aaron .
NKJV	Numbers	16	2	and they rose up before Moses with some of the children of Israel , two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation , ( C ) representatives of the congregation , men of renown .
NKJV	Numbers	16	3	( D ) They gathered together against Moses and Aaron , and said to them , “ You [ a ] take too much upon yourselves , for ( E ) all the congregation is holy , every one of them , ( F ) and the Lord is among them . Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the Lord ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	4	So when Moses heard it , he ( G ) fell on his face ;
NKJV	Numbers	16	5	and he spoke to Korah and all his company , saying , “ Tomorrow morning the Lord will show who is ( H ) His and who is ( I ) holy , [ b ] and will cause him to come near to Him . That one whom He chooses He will cause to ( J ) come near to Him .
NKJV	Numbers	16	6	Do this : Take censers , Korah and all your company ;
NKJV	Numbers	16	7	put fire in them and put incense in them before the Lord tomorrow , and it shall be that the man whom the Lord chooses is the holy one . You take too much upon yourselves , you sons of Levi ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	8	Then Moses said to Korah , “ Hear now , you sons of Levi :
NKJV	Numbers	16	9	Is it ( K ) a small thing to you that the God of Israel has ( L ) separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to Himself , to do the work of the tabernacle of the Lord , and to stand before the congregation to serve them ;
NKJV	Numbers	16	10	and that He has brought you near to Himself , you and all your brethren , the sons of Levi , with you ? And are you seeking the priesthood also ?
NKJV	Numbers	16	11	Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the Lord . ( M ) And what is Aaron that you complain against him ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab , but they said , “ We will not come up !
NKJV	Numbers	16	13	Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of ( N ) a land flowing with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , that you should ( O ) keep acting like a prince over us ?
NKJV	Numbers	16	14	Moreover ( P ) you have not brought us into ( Q ) a land flowing with milk and honey , nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards . Will you put out the eyes of these men ? We will not come up ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	15	Then Moses was very angry , and said to the Lord , ( R ) “ Do not [ c ] respect their offering . ( S ) I have not taken one donkey from them , nor have I hurt one of them. ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	17	Let each take his censer and put incense in it , and each of you bring his censer before the Lord , two hundred and fifty censers ; both you and Aaron , each with his censer. ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	18	So every man took his censer , put fire in it , laid incense on it , and stood at the door of the tabernacle of meeting with Moses and Aaron .
NKJV	Numbers	16	19	And Korah gathered all the congregation against them at the door of the tabernacle of meeting . Then ( U ) the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation .
NKJV	Numbers	16	20	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	16	21	( V ) “ Separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may ( W ) consume them in a moment. ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	22	Then they ( X ) fell [ d ] on their faces , and said , “ O God , ( Y ) the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and You be angry with all the ( Z ) congregation ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	23	So the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	16	24	“ Speak to the congregation , saying , ‘ Get away from the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram. ’ ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	25	Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram , and the elders of Israel followed him .
NKJV	Numbers	16	26	And he spoke to the congregation , saying , ( AA ) “ Depart now from the tents of these wicked men ! Touch nothing of theirs , lest you be consumed in all their sins. ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	27	So they got away from around the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram ; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents , with their wives , their sons , and their little ( AB ) children .
NKJV	Numbers	16	28	And Moses said : ( AC ) “ By this you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works , for I have not done them ( AD ) of my own will .
NKJV	Numbers	16	29	If these men die naturally like all men , or if they are ( AE ) visited by the common fate of all men , then the Lord has not sent me .
NKJV	Numbers	16	30	But if the Lord creates ( AF ) a new thing , and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them , and they ( AG ) go down alive into the pit , then you will understand that these men have rejected the Lord. ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	31	( AH ) Now it came to pass , as he finished speaking all these words , that the ground split apart under them ,
NKJV	Numbers	16	32	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up , with their households and ( AI ) all the men with Korah , with all their goods .
NKJV	Numbers	16	33	So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit ; the earth closed over them , and they perished from among the assembly .
NKJV	Numbers	16	34	Then all Israel who were around them fled at their cry , for they said , “ Lest the earth swallow us up also ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	35	And ( AJ ) a fire came out from the Lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense .
NKJV	Numbers	16	36	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Numbers	16	37	“ Tell Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , to pick up the censers out of the blaze , for ( AK ) they are holy , and scatter the fire some distance away .
NKJV	Numbers	16	38	The censers of ( AL ) these men who sinned [ e ] against their own souls , let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar . Because they presented them before the Lord , therefore they are holy ; ( AM ) and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel. ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	39	So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers , which those who were burned up had presented , and they were hammered out as a covering on the altar ,
NKJV	Numbers	16	40	to be a [ f ] memorial to the children of Israel ( AN ) that no outsider , who is not a descendant of Aaron , should come near to offer incense before the Lord , that he might not become like Korah and his companions , just as the Lord had said to him through Moses . Complaints of the People
NKJV	Numbers	16	41	On the next day ( AO ) all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron , saying , “ You have killed the people of the Lord. ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	42	Now it happened , when the congregation had gathered against Moses and Aaron , that they turned toward the tabernacle of meeting ; and suddenly ( AP ) the cloud covered it , and the glory of the Lord appeared .
NKJV	Numbers	16	43	Then Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of meeting .
NKJV	Numbers	16	44	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	16	45	“ Get away from among this congregation , that I may consume them in a moment. ” And they fell on their faces .
NKJV	Numbers	16	46	So Moses said to Aaron , “ Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar , put incense on it , and take it quickly to the congregation and make [ g ] atonement for them ; ( AQ ) for wrath has gone out from the Lord . The plague has begun. ”
NKJV	Numbers	16	47	Then Aaron took it as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the assembly ; and already the plague had begun among the people . So he put in the incense and made atonement for the people .
NKJV	Numbers	16	48	And he stood between the dead and the living ; so ( AR ) the plague was stopped .
NKJV	Numbers	16	49	Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred , besides those who died in the Korah incident .
NKJV	Numbers	16	50	So Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of meeting , for the plague had stopped .

NKJV	Numbers	17	17	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Numbers	17	2	“ Speak to the children of Israel , and get from them a rod from each father ’ s house , all their leaders according to their fathers ’ houses—twelve rods . Write each man ’ s name on his rod .
NKJV	Numbers	17	3	And you shall write Aaron ’ s name on the rod of Levi . For there shall be one rod for the head of each father ’ s house .
NKJV	Numbers	17	4	Then you shall place them in the tabernacle of meeting before ( A ) the Testimony , ( B ) where I meet with you .
NKJV	Numbers	17	5	And it shall be that the rod of the man ( C ) whom I choose will blossom ; thus I will rid Myself of the complaints of the children of Israel , ( D ) which they make against you. ”
NKJV	Numbers	17	6	So Moses spoke to the children of Israel , and each of their leaders gave him a rod apiece , for each leader according to their fathers ’ houses , twelve rods ; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
NKJV	Numbers	17	7	And Moses placed the rods before the Lord in ( E ) the tabernacle of witness .
NKJV	Numbers	17	8	Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses went into the tabernacle of witness , and behold , the ( F ) rod of Aaron , of the house of Levi , had sprouted and put forth buds , had produced blossoms and yielded ripe almonds .
NKJV	Numbers	17	9	Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord to all the children of Israel ; and they looked , and each man took his rod .
NKJV	Numbers	17	10	And the Lord said to Moses , “ Bring ( G ) Aaron ’ s rod back before the Testimony , to be kept ( H ) as a sign against the rebels , ( I ) that you may put their complaints away from Me , lest they die. ”
NKJV	Numbers	17	11	Thus did Moses ; just as the Lord had commanded him , so he did .
NKJV	Numbers	17	12	So the children of Israel spoke to Moses , saying , “ Surely we die , we perish , we all perish !

NKJV	Numbers	18	18	And their flesh shall be yours , just as the ( AH ) wave [ h ] breast and the right thigh are yours .
NKJV	Numbers	18	2	Also bring with you your brethren of the ( C ) tribe of Levi , the tribe of your father , that they may be ( D ) joined with you and serve you while you and your sons are with you before the tabernacle of [ b ] witness .
NKJV	Numbers	18	3	They shall attend to your [ c ] needs and ( E ) all the needs of the tabernacle ; ( F ) but they shall not come near the articles of the sanctuary and the altar , ( G ) lest they die—they and you also .
NKJV	Numbers	18	4	They shall be joined with you and attend to the needs of the tabernacle of meeting , for all the work of the tabernacle ; ( H ) but an outsider shall not come near you .
NKJV	Numbers	18	5	And you shall attend to ( I ) the duties of the sanctuary and the duties of the altar , ( J ) that there may be no more wrath on the children of Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	18	6	Behold , I Myself have ( K ) taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel ; ( L ) they are a gift to you , given by the Lord , to do the work of the tabernacle of meeting .
NKJV	Numbers	18	7	Therefore ( M ) you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything at the altar and ( N ) behind the veil ; and you shall serve . I give your priesthood to you as a ( O ) gift for service , but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death. ” Offerings for Support of the Priests
NKJV	Numbers	18	8	And the Lord spoke to Aaron : “ Here , ( P ) I Myself have also given you [ d ] charge of My heave offerings , all the holy gifts of the children of Israel ; I have given them ( Q ) as a portion to you and your sons , as an ordinance forever .
NKJV	Numbers	18	9	This shall be yours of the most holy things reserved from the fire : every offering of theirs , every ( R ) grain offering and every ( S ) sin offering and every ( T ) trespass offering which they render to Me , shall be most holy for you and your sons .
NKJV	Numbers	18	10	( U ) In a most holy place you shall eat it ; every male shall eat it . It shall be holy to you .
NKJV	Numbers	18	11	“ This also is yours : ( V ) the heave offering of their gift , with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel ; I have given them to you , and your sons and daughters with you , as an ordinance forever . ( W ) Everyone who is [ e ] clean in your house may eat it .
NKJV	Numbers	18	12	( X ) “ All the [ f ] best of the oil , all the best of the new wine and the grain , ( Y ) their firstfruits which they offer to the Lord , I have given them to you .
NKJV	Numbers	18	13	Whatever first ripe fruit is in their land , ( Z ) which they bring to the Lord , shall be yours . Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it .
NKJV	Numbers	18	14	( AA ) “ Every [ g ] devoted thing in Israel shall be yours .
NKJV	Numbers	18	15	“ Everything that first opens ( AB ) the womb of all flesh , which they bring to the Lord , whether man or beast , shall be yours ; nevertheless ( AC ) the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem , and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem .
NKJV	Numbers	18	16	And those redeemed of the devoted things you shall redeem when one month old , ( AD ) according to your valuation , for five shekels of silver , according to the shekel of the sanctuary , which is ( AE ) twenty gerahs .
NKJV	Numbers	18	17	( AF ) But the firstborn of a cow , the firstborn of a sheep , or the firstborn of a goat you shall not redeem ; they are holy . ( AG ) You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar , and burn their fat as an offering made by fire for a sweet aroma to the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	18	19	“ All the heave offerings of the holy things , which the children of Israel offer to the Lord , I have given to you and your sons and daughters with you as an ordinance forever ; ( AI ) it is a covenant of salt forever before the Lord with you and your descendants with you. ”
NKJV	Numbers	18	20	Then the Lord said to Aaron : “ You shall have ( AJ ) no inheritance in their land , nor shall you have any portion among them ; ( AK ) I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel . Tithes for Support of the Levites
NKJV	Numbers	18	21	“ Behold , ( AL ) I have given the children of Levi all the tithes in Israel as [ i ] an inheritance in return for the work which they perform , ( AM ) the work of the tabernacle of meeting .
NKJV	Numbers	18	22	( AN ) Hereafter the children of Israel shall not come near the tabernacle of meeting , ( AO ) lest they bear sin and die .
NKJV	Numbers	18	23	But the Levites shall perform the work of the tabernacle of meeting , and they shall bear their iniquity ; it shall be a statute forever , throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
NKJV	Numbers	18	24	For the tithes of the children of Israel , which they offer up as a heave offering to the Lord , I have given to the Levites [ j ] as an inheritance ; therefore I have said to them , ‘ Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. ’ ” The Tithe of the Levites
NKJV	Numbers	18	25	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	18	26	“ Speak thus to the Levites , and say to them : ‘ When you take from the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them as your inheritance , then you shall offer up a heave offering of it to the Lord , ( AP ) a tenth of the tithe .

NKJV	Numbers	19	2	“ This is the [ a ] ordinance of the law which the Lord has commanded , saying : ‘ Speak to the children of Israel , that they bring you a red heifer without [ b ] blemish , in which there is no ( A ) defect ( B ) and on which a yoke has never come .

NKJV	Numbers	19	8	And the one who burns it shall wash his clothes in water , bathe in water , and shall be unclean until evening .

NKJV	Numbers	19	12	( L ) He shall purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day ; then he will be clean . But if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day , he will not be clean .
NKJV	Numbers	19	13	Whoever touches the body of anyone who has died , and ( M ) does not purify himself , ( N ) defiles the tabernacle of the Lord . That person shall be cut off from Israel .

NKJV	Numbers	19	14	‘ This is the law when a man dies in a tent : All who come into the tent and all who are in the tent shall be unclean seven days ;

NKJV	Numbers	20	20	Then he said , ( AE ) “ You shall not pass through. ” So Edom came out against them with many men and with a strong hand .
NKJV	Numbers	20	2	( E ) Now there was no water for the congregation ; ( F ) so they gathered together against Moses and Aaron .
NKJV	Numbers	20	3	And the people ( G ) contended with Moses and spoke , saying : “ If only we had died ( H ) when our brethren died before the Lord !
NKJV	Numbers	20	4	( I ) Why have you brought up the assembly of the Lord into this wilderness , that we and our animals should die here ?
NKJV	Numbers	20	5	And why have you made us come up out of Egypt , to bring us to this evil place ? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates ; nor is there any water to drink. ”
NKJV	Numbers	20	6	So Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of meeting , and ( J ) they [ a ] fell on their faces . And ( K ) the glory of the Lord appeared to them .
NKJV	Numbers	20	7	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	20	8	( L ) “ Take the rod ; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together . Speak to the rock before their eyes , and it will yield its water ; thus ( M ) you shall bring water for them out of the rock , and give drink to the congregation and their animals. ”
NKJV	Numbers	20	9	So Moses took the rod ( N ) from before the Lord as He commanded him .
NKJV	Numbers	20	10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock ; and he said to them , ( O ) “ Hear now , you rebels ! Must we bring water for you out of this rock ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	20	11	Then Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod ; ( P ) and water came out abundantly , and the congregation and their animals drank .
NKJV	Numbers	20	12	Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , “ Because ( Q ) you did not believe Me , to ( R ) hallow Me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them. ”
NKJV	Numbers	20	13	( S ) This was the water of [ b ] Meribah , because the children of Israel contended with the Lord , and He was hallowed among them . Passage Through Edom Refused
NKJV	Numbers	20	14	( T ) Now Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of ( U ) Edom . ( V ) “ Thus says your brother Israel : ‘ You know all the hardship that has befallen us ,
NKJV	Numbers	20	15	( W ) how our fathers went down to Egypt , ( X ) and we dwelt in Egypt a long time , ( Y ) and the Egyptians [ c ] afflicted us and our fathers .
NKJV	Numbers	20	16	( Z ) When we cried out to the Lord , He heard our voice and ( AA ) sent the Angel and brought us up out of Egypt ; now here we are in Kadesh , a city on the edge of your border .
NKJV	Numbers	20	17	Please ( AB ) let us pass through your country . We will not pass through fields or vineyards , nor will we drink water from wells ; we will go along the King ’ s Highway ; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory. ’ ”
NKJV	Numbers	20	18	Then ( AC ) Edom said to him , “ You shall not pass through my land , lest I come out against you with the sword. ”
NKJV	Numbers	20	19	So the children of Israel said to him , “ We will go by the Highway , and if I or my livestock drink any of your water , ( AD ) then I will pay for it ; let me only pass through on foot , nothing more. ”
NKJV	Numbers	20	21	Thus Edom ( AF ) refused to give Israel passage through his territory ; so Israel ( AG ) turned away from him . Death of Aaron
NKJV	Numbers	20	22	Now the children of Israel , the whole congregation , journeyed from ( AH ) Kadesh ( AI ) and came to Mount Hor .
NKJV	Numbers	20	23	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom , saying :
NKJV	Numbers	20	24	“ Aaron shall [ d ] be ( AJ ) gathered to his people , for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel , because you rebelled against My word at the water of Meribah .
NKJV	Numbers	20	25	( AK ) Take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up to Mount Hor ;
NKJV	Numbers	20	26	and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son ; for Aaron shall be gathered to his people and die there. ”
NKJV	Numbers	20	27	So Moses did just as the Lord commanded , and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation .
NKJV	Numbers	20	28	( AL ) Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son ; and ( AM ) Aaron died there on the top of the mountain . Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain .

NKJV	Numbers	21	21	Then ( W ) Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	21	2	( B ) So Israel made a vow to the Lord , and said , “ If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand , then ( C ) I will utterly destroy their cities. ”
NKJV	Numbers	21	3	And the Lord listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites , and they utterly destroyed them and their cities . So the name of that place was called [ a ] Hormah . The Bronze Serpent
NKJV	Numbers	21	4	Then they journeyed from Mount Hor by the Way of the Red Sea , to ( D ) go around the land of Edom ; and the soul of the people became very [ b ] discouraged on the way .
NKJV	Numbers	21	5	And the people ( E ) spoke against God and against Moses : “ Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ? For there is no food and no water , and our soul [ c ] loathes this worthless bread. ”
NKJV	Numbers	21	6	So ( F ) the Lord sent ( G ) fiery serpents among the people , and they bit the people ; and many of the people of Israel died .
NKJV	Numbers	21	7	( H ) Therefore the people came to Moses , and said , “ We have ( I ) sinned , for we have spoken against the Lord and against you ; ( J ) pray to the Lord that He take away the serpents from us. ” So Moses prayed for the people .
NKJV	Numbers	21	8	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( K ) “ Make a ( L ) fiery serpent , and set it on a pole ; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten , when he looks at it , shall live. ”
NKJV	Numbers	21	9	So ( M ) Moses made a bronze serpent , and put it on a pole ; and so it was , if a serpent had bitten anyone , when he looked at the bronze serpent , he lived . From Mount Hor to Moab
NKJV	Numbers	21	10	Now the children of Israel moved on and ( N ) camped in Oboth .
NKJV	Numbers	21	11	And they journeyed from Oboth and camped at [ d ] Ije Abarim , in the wilderness which is east of Moab , toward the sunrise .
NKJV	Numbers	21	12	( O ) From there they moved and camped in the Valley of Zered .
NKJV	Numbers	21	13	From there they moved and camped on the other side of the Arnon , which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites ; for ( P ) the Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
NKJV	Numbers	21	14	Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lord : [ e ] “ Waheb in Suphah , The brooks of the Arnon ,
NKJV	Numbers	21	15	And the slope of the brooks That reaches to the dwelling of ( Q ) Ar , And lies on the border of Moab. ”
NKJV	Numbers	21	16	From there they went ( R ) to Beer , which is the well where the Lord said to Moses , “ Gather the people together , and I will give them water. ”
NKJV	Numbers	21	17	( S ) Then Israel sang this song : “ Spring up , O well ! All of you sing to it—
NKJV	Numbers	21	18	The well the leaders sank , Dug by the nation ’ s nobles , By the ( T ) lawgiver , with their staves. ” And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah ,
NKJV	Numbers	21	19	from Mattanah to Nahaliel , from Nahaliel to Bamoth ,
NKJV	Numbers	21	20	and from Bamoth , in the valley that is in the [ f ] country of Moab , to the top of Pisgah which looks ( U ) down on the [ g ] wasteland . King Sihon Defeated ( V )
NKJV	Numbers	21	22	( X ) “ Let me pass through your land . We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards ; we will not drink water from wells . We will go by the King ’ s Highway until we have passed through your territory. ”
NKJV	Numbers	21	23	( Y ) But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory . So Sihon gathered all his people together and [ h ] went out against Israel in the wilderness , ( Z ) and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	21	24	Then ( AA ) Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword , and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok , as far as the people of Ammon ; for the border of the people of Ammon was fortified .
NKJV	Numbers	21	25	So Israel took all these cities , and Israel ( AB ) dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon and in all its villages .
NKJV	Numbers	21	26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and had taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon .
NKJV	Numbers	21	27	Therefore those who speak in [ i ] proverbs say : “ Come to Heshbon , let it be built ; Let the city of Sihon be repaired .
NKJV	Numbers	21	28	“ For ( AC ) fire went out from Heshbon , A flame from the city of Sihon ; It consumed ( AD ) Ar of Moab , The lords of the ( AE ) heights of the Arnon .
NKJV	Numbers	21	29	Woe to you , ( AF ) Moab ! You have perished , O people of ( AG ) Chemosh ! He has given his ( AH ) sons as fugitives , And his ( AI ) daughters into captivity , To Sihon king of the Amorites .
NKJV	Numbers	21	30	“ But we have shot at them ; Heshbon has perished ( AJ ) as far as Dibon . Then we laid waste as far as Nophah , Which reaches to ( AK ) Medeba. ”
NKJV	Numbers	21	31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites .
NKJV	Numbers	21	32	Then Moses sent to [ j ] spy out ( AL ) Jazer ; and they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there . King Og Defeated ( AM )
NKJV	Numbers	21	33	( AN ) And they turned and went up by the way to ( AO ) Bashan . So Og king of Bashan went out against them , he and all his people , to battle ( AP ) at Edrei .
NKJV	Numbers	21	34	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( AQ ) “ Do not fear him , for I have [ k ] delivered him into your hand , with all his people and his land ; and ( AR ) you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon. ”

NKJV	Numbers	22	22	Then God ’ s anger was aroused because he went , ( T ) and the Angel of the Lord took His stand in the way as an adversary against him . And he was riding on his donkey , and his two servants were with him .
NKJV	Numbers	22	2	Now ( B ) Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
NKJV	Numbers	22	3	And ( C ) Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people because they were many , and Moab was sick with dread because of the children of Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	22	4	So Moab said to ( D ) the elders of Midian , “ Now this company will [ a ] lick up everything around us , as an ox licks up the grass of the field. ” And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time .
NKJV	Numbers	22	5	Then ( E ) he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at ( F ) Pethor , which is near [ b ] the River in the land of [ c ] the sons of his people , to call him , saying : “ Look , a people has come from Egypt . See , they cover the face of the earth , and are settling next to me !
NKJV	Numbers	22	6	( G ) Therefore please come at once , ( H ) curse this people for me , for they are too mighty for me . Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land , for I know that he whom you bless is blessed , and he whom you curse is cursed. ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	7	So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with ( I ) the diviner ’ s fee in their hand , and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak .
NKJV	Numbers	22	8	And he said to them , ( J ) “ Lodge here tonight , and I will bring back word to you , as the Lord speaks to me. ” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam .
NKJV	Numbers	22	9	( K ) Then God came to Balaam and said , “ Who are these men with you ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	10	So Balaam said to God , “ Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , has sent to me , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	22	11	‘ Look , a people has come out of Egypt , and they cover the face of the earth . Come now , curse them for me ; perhaps I shall be able to overpower them and drive them out. ’ ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	12	And God said to Balaam , “ You shall not go with them ; you shall not curse the people , for ( L ) they are blessed. ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	13	So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak , “ Go back to your land , for the Lord has refused to give me permission to go with you. ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	14	And the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak , and said , “ Balaam refuses to come with us. ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	15	Then Balak again sent princes , more numerous and more [ d ] honorable than they .
NKJV	Numbers	22	16	And they came to Balaam and said to him , “ Thus says Balak the son of Zippor : ‘ Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me ;
NKJV	Numbers	22	17	for I will certainly ( M ) honor you greatly , and I will do whatever you say to me . ( N ) Therefore please come , curse this people for me. ’ ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	18	Then Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak , ( O ) “ Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold , ( P ) I could not go beyond the word of the Lord my God , to do less or more .
NKJV	Numbers	22	19	Now therefore , please , you also ( Q ) stay here tonight , that I may know what more the Lord will say to me. ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	20	( R ) And God came to Balaam at night and said to him , “ If the men come to call you , rise and go with them ; but ( S ) only the word which I speak to you—that you shall do. ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	21	So Balaam rose in the morning , saddled his donkey , and went with the princes of Moab . Balaam , the Donkey , and the Angel
NKJV	Numbers	22	23	Now ( U ) the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand , and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field . So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road .
NKJV	Numbers	22	24	Then the Angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path between the vineyards , with a wall on this side and a wall on that side .
NKJV	Numbers	22	25	And when the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord , she pushed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam ’ s foot against the wall ; so he struck her again .
NKJV	Numbers	22	26	Then the Angel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
NKJV	Numbers	22	27	And when the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord , she lay down under Balaam ; so Balaam ’ s anger was aroused , and he struck the donkey with his staff .
NKJV	Numbers	22	28	Then the Lord ( V ) opened the mouth of the donkey , and she said to Balaam , “ What have I done to you , that you have struck me these three times ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	29	And Balaam said to the donkey , “ Because you have [ e ] abused me . I wish there were a sword in my hand , ( W ) for now I would kill you ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	30	( X ) So the donkey said to Balaam , “ Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden , ever since I became yours , to this day ? Was I ever [ f ] disposed to do this to you ? ” And he said , “ No. ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	31	Then the Lord ( Y ) opened Balaam ’ s eyes , and he saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand ; and he bowed his head and fell flat on his face .
NKJV	Numbers	22	32	And the Angel of the Lord said to him , “ Why have you struck your donkey these three times ? Behold , I have come out [ g ] to stand against you , because your way is ( Z ) perverse [ h ] before Me .
NKJV	Numbers	22	33	The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times . If she had not turned aside from Me , surely I would also have killed you by now , and let her live. ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	34	And Balaam said to the Angel of the Lord , ( AA ) “ I have sinned , for I did not know You stood in the way against me . Now therefore , if it [ i ] displeases You , I will turn back. ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	35	Then the Angel of the Lord said to Balaam , “ Go with the men , ( AB ) but only the word that I speak to you , that you shall speak. ” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
NKJV	Numbers	22	36	Now when Balak heard that Balaam was coming , ( AC ) he went out to meet him at the city of Moab , ( AD ) which is on the border at the Arnon , the boundary of the territory .
NKJV	Numbers	22	37	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Did I not earnestly send to you , calling for you ? Why did you not come to me ? Am I not able ( AE ) to honor you ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	38	And Balaam said to Balak , “ Look , I have come to you ! Now , have I any power at all to say anything ? ( AF ) The word that God puts in my mouth , that I must speak. ”
NKJV	Numbers	22	39	So Balaam went with Balak , and they came to Kirjath Huzoth .
NKJV	Numbers	22	40	Then Balak offered oxen and sheep , and he sent some to Balaam and to the princes who were with him . Balaam ’ s First Prophecy
NKJV	Numbers	22	41	So it was , the next day , that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the ( AG ) high places of Baal , that from there he might observe [ j ] the extent of the people .

NKJV	Numbers	23	23	“ For there is no [ e ] sorcery against Jacob , Nor any [ f ] divination against Israel . It now must be said of Jacob And of Israel , ‘ Oh , ( AA ) what God has done ! ’
NKJV	Numbers	23	2	And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken , and Balak and Balaam ( B ) offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
NKJV	Numbers	23	3	Then Balaam said to Balak , ( C ) “ Stand by your burnt offering , and I will go ; perhaps the Lord will come ( D ) to meet me , and whatever He shows me I will tell you. ” So he went to a desolate height .
NKJV	Numbers	23	4	( E ) And God met Balaam , and he said to Him , “ I have prepared the seven altars , and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram. ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	5	Then the Lord ( F ) put a word in Balaam ’ s mouth , and said , “ Return to Balak , and thus you shall speak. ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	6	So he returned to him , and there he was , standing by his burnt offering , he and all the princes of Moab .
NKJV	Numbers	23	7	And he ( G ) took up his [ a ] oracle and said : “ Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram , From the mountains of the east . ( H ) ‘ Come , curse Jacob for me , And come , ( I ) denounce Israel ! ’
NKJV	Numbers	23	8	“ How ( J ) shall I curse whom God has not cursed ? And how shall I denounce whom the Lord has not denounced ?
NKJV	Numbers	23	9	For from the top of the rocks I see him , And from the hills I behold him ; There ! ( K ) A people dwelling alone , ( L ) Not reckoning itself among the nations .
NKJV	Numbers	23	10	“ Who ( M ) can count the [ b ] dust of Jacob , Or number one-fourth of Israel ? Let me die ( N ) the death of the righteous , And let my end be like his ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	11	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ What have you done to me ? ( O ) I took you to curse my enemies , and look , you have blessed them bountifully ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	12	So he answered and said , ( P ) “ Must I not take heed to speak what the Lord has put in my mouth ? ” Balaam ’ s Second Prophecy
NKJV	Numbers	23	13	Then Balak said to him , “ Please come with me to another place from which you may see them ; you shall see only the outer part of them , and shall not see them all ; curse them for me from there. ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	14	So he brought him to the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , ( Q ) and built seven altars , and offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
NKJV	Numbers	23	15	And he said to Balak , “ Stand here by your burnt offering while I [ c ] meet the Lord over there. ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	16	Then the Lord met Balaam , and ( R ) put a word in his mouth , and said , “ Go back to Balak , and thus you shall speak. ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	17	So he came to him , and there he was , standing by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab were with him . And Balak said to him , “ What has the Lord spoken ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	18	Then he took up his oracle and said : ( S ) “ Rise up , Balak , and hear ! Listen to me , son of Zippor !
NKJV	Numbers	23	19	“ God ( T ) is not a man , that He should lie , Nor a son of man , that He should repent . Has He ( U ) said , and will He not do ? Or has He spoken , and will He not make it good ?
NKJV	Numbers	23	20	Behold , I have received a command to bless ; ( V ) He has blessed , and I can not reverse it .
NKJV	Numbers	23	21	“ He ( W ) has not observed iniquity in Jacob , Nor has He seen [ d ] wickedness in Israel . The Lord his God is with him , ( X ) And the shout of a King is among them .
NKJV	Numbers	23	22	( Y ) God brings them out of Egypt ; He has ( Z ) strength like a wild ox .
NKJV	Numbers	23	24	Look , a people rises ( AB ) like a lioness , And lifts itself up like a lion ; ( AC ) It shall not lie down until it devours the prey , And drinks the blood of the slain. ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	25	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Neither curse them at all , nor bless them at all ! ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	26	So Balaam answered and said to Balak , “ Did I not tell you , saying , ( AD ) ‘ All that the Lord speaks , that I must do ’ ? ” Balaam ’ s Third Prophecy
NKJV	Numbers	23	27	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Please come , I will take you to another place ; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there. ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor , that ( AE ) overlooks the [ g ] wasteland .
NKJV	Numbers	23	29	Then Balaam said to Balak , “ Build for me here seven altars , and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams. ”
NKJV	Numbers	23	30	And Balak did as Balaam had said , and offered a bull and a ram on every altar .

NKJV	Numbers	24	24	But ships shall come from the coasts of ( AA ) Cyprus , [ f ] And they shall afflict Asshur and afflict ( AB ) Eber , And so shall [ g ] Amalek , until he perishes. ”
NKJV	Numbers	24	2	And Balaam raised his eyes , and saw Israel ( B ) encamped according to their tribes ; and ( C ) the Spirit of God came upon him .
NKJV	Numbers	24	3	( D ) Then he took up his oracle and said : “ The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor , The utterance of the man whose eyes are opened ,
NKJV	Numbers	24	4	The utterance of him who hears the words of God , Who sees the vision of the Almighty , Who ( E ) falls down , with eyes wide open :
NKJV	Numbers	24	5	“ How lovely are your tents , O Jacob ! Your dwellings , O Israel !
NKJV	Numbers	24	6	Like valleys that stretch out , Like gardens by the riverside , ( F ) Like aloes ( G ) planted by the Lord , Like cedars beside the waters .

NKJV	Numbers	24	8	“ God ( K ) brings him out of Egypt ; He has strength like a wild ox ; He shall ( L ) consume the nations , his enemies ; He shall ( M ) break their bones And ( N ) pierce them with his arrows .
NKJV	Numbers	24	9	‘ He ( O ) bows down , he lies down as a lion ; And as a lion , who shall rouse him ? ’ ( P ) “ Blessed is he who blesses you , And cursed is he who curses you. ”
NKJV	Numbers	24	10	Then Balak ’ s anger was aroused against Balaam , and he ( Q ) struck his hands together ; and Balak said to Balaam , ( R ) “ I called you to curse my enemies , and look , you have bountifully blessed them these three times !
NKJV	Numbers	24	11	Now therefore , flee to your place . ( S ) I said I would greatly honor you , but in fact , the Lord has kept you back from honor. ”
NKJV	Numbers	24	12	So Balaam said to Balak , “ Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	24	13	‘ If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold , I could not go beyond the word of the Lord , to do good or bad of my own will . What the Lord says , that I must speak ’ ?
NKJV	Numbers	24	14	And now , indeed , I am going to my people . Come , ( T ) I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the ( U ) latter days. ” Balaam ’ s Fourth Prophecy
NKJV	Numbers	24	15	So he took up his oracle and said : “ The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor , And the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened ;
NKJV	Numbers	24	16	The utterance of him who hears the words of God , And has the knowledge of the Most High , Who sees the vision of the Almighty , Who falls down , with eyes wide open :
NKJV	Numbers	24	17	“ I ( V ) see Him , but not now ; I behold Him , but not near ; ( W ) A Star shall come out of Jacob ; ( X ) A Scepter shall rise out of Israel , And [ b ] batter the brow of Moab , And destroy all the sons of [ c ] tumult .
NKJV	Numbers	24	18	“ And ( Y ) Edom shall be a possession ; Seir also , his enemies , shall be a possession , While Israel does [ d ] valiantly .
NKJV	Numbers	24	19	( Z ) Out of Jacob One [ e ] shall have dominion , And destroy the remains of the city. ”
NKJV	Numbers	24	20	Then he looked on Amalek , and he took up his oracle and said : “ Amalek was first among the nations , But shall be last until he perishes. ”
NKJV	Numbers	24	21	Then he looked on the Kenites , and he took up his oracle and said : “ Firm is your dwelling place , And your nest is set in the rock ;
NKJV	Numbers	24	22	Nevertheless Kain shall be burned . How long until Asshur carries you away captive ? ”
NKJV	Numbers	24	23	Then he took up his oracle and said : “ Alas ! Who shall live when God does this ?

NKJV	Numbers	25	25	Now Israel remained in ( A ) Acacia Grove , [ a ] and the ( B ) people began to commit harlotry with the women of Moab .
NKJV	Numbers	25	2	( C ) They invited the people to ( D ) the sacrifices of their gods , and the people ate and ( E ) bowed down to their gods .
NKJV	Numbers	25	3	So Israel was joined to Baal of Peor , and ( F ) the anger of the Lord was aroused against Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	25	4	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( G ) “ Take all the leaders of the people and hang the offenders before the Lord , out in the sun , ( H ) that the fierce anger of the Lord may turn away from Israel. ”
NKJV	Numbers	25	5	So Moses said to ( I ) the judges of Israel , ( J ) “ Every one of you kill his men who were joined to Baal of Peor. ”
NKJV	Numbers	25	6	And indeed , one of the children of Israel came and presented to his brethren a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel , ( K ) who were weeping at the door of the tabernacle of meeting .
NKJV	Numbers	25	7	Now ( L ) when Phinehas ( M ) the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he rose from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand ;
NKJV	Numbers	25	8	and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through , the man of Israel , and the woman through her body . So ( N ) the plague was ( O ) stopped among the children of Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	25	9	And ( P ) those who died in the plague were twenty-four thousand .
NKJV	Numbers	25	10	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Numbers	25	11	( Q ) “ Phinehas the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , has turned back My wrath from the children of Israel , because he was zealous with My zeal among them , so that I did not consume the children of Israel in ( R ) My zeal .
NKJV	Numbers	25	12	Therefore say , ( S ) ‘ Behold , I give to him My ( T ) covenant of peace ;
NKJV	Numbers	25	13	and it shall be to him and ( U ) his descendants after him a covenant of ( V ) an everlasting priesthood , because he was ( W ) zealous for his God , and ( X ) made [ b ] atonement for the children of Israel. ’ ”
NKJV	Numbers	25	14	Now the name of the Israelite who was killed , who was killed with the Midianite woman , was Zimri the son of Salu , a leader of a father ’ s house among the Simeonites .
NKJV	Numbers	25	15	And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of ( Y ) Zur ; he was head of the people of a father ’ s house in Midian .
NKJV	Numbers	25	16	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Numbers	25	17	( Z ) “ Harass the Midianites , and [ c ] attack them ;
NKJV	Numbers	25	18	for they harassed you with their ( AA ) schemes [ d ] by which they seduced you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi , the daughter of a leader of Midian , their sister , who was killed in the day of the plague because of Peor. ” Footnotes - Numbers 25:1 Heb .

NKJV	Numbers	27	3	“ Our father ( B ) died in the wilderness ; but he was not in the company of those who gathered together against the Lord , ( C ) in company with Korah , but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
NKJV	Numbers	27	4	Why should the name of our father be ( D ) removed [ a ] from among his family because he had no son ? ( E ) Give us a [ b ] possession among our father ’ s brothers. ”
NKJV	Numbers	27	5	So Moses ( F ) brought their case before the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	27	6	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Numbers	27	7	“ The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right ; ( G ) you shall surely give them a possession of inheritance among their father ’ s brothers , and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them .

NKJV	Numbers	27	11	And if his father has no brothers , then you shall give his inheritance to the relative closest to him in his family , and he shall possess it. ’ ” And it shall be to the children of Israel ( H ) a statute of judgment , just as the Lord commanded Moses .

NKJV	Numbers	27	15	Then Moses spoke to the Lord , saying :
NKJV	Numbers	27	16	“ Let the Lord , ( N ) the God of the spirits of all flesh , set a man over the congregation ,
NKJV	Numbers	27	17	( O ) who may go out before them and go in before them , who may lead them out and bring them in , that the congregation of the Lord may not be ( P ) like sheep which have no shepherd. ”
NKJV	Numbers	27	18	And the Lord said to Moses : “ Take Joshua the son of Nun with you , a man ( Q ) in whom is the Spirit , and ( R ) lay your hand on him ;
NKJV	Numbers	27	19	set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation , and ( S ) inaugurate [ d ] him in their sight .
NKJV	Numbers	27	20	And ( T ) you shall give some of your authority to him , that all the congregation of the children of Israel ( U ) may be obedient .
NKJV	Numbers	27	21	( V ) He shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall inquire before the Lord for him ( W ) by the judgment of the Urim . ( X ) At his word they shall go out , and at his word they shall come in , he and all the children of Israel with him—all the congregation. ”
NKJV	Numbers	27	22	So Moses did as the Lord commanded him . He took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation .
NKJV	Numbers	27	23	And he laid his hands on him ( Y ) and [ e ] inaugurated him , just as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses .

NKJV	Numbers	30	30	Then Moses spoke to ( A ) the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel , saying , “ This is the thing which the Lord has commanded :
NKJV	Numbers	30	2	( B ) If a man makes a vow to the Lord , or ( C ) swears an oath to bind himself by some agreement , he shall not break his word ; he shall ( D ) do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth .
NKJV	Numbers	30	3	“ Or if a woman makes a vow to the Lord , and binds herself by some agreement while in her father ’ s house in her youth ,
NKJV	Numbers	30	4	and her father hears her vow and the agreement by which she has bound herself , and her father [ a ] holds his peace , then all her vows shall stand , and every agreement with which she has bound herself shall stand .
NKJV	Numbers	30	5	But if her father overrules her on the day that he hears , then none of her vows nor her agreements by which she has bound herself shall stand ; and the Lord will release her , because her father overruled her .
NKJV	Numbers	30	6	“ If indeed she takes a husband , while bound by her vows or by a rash utterance from her lips by which she bound herself ,
NKJV	Numbers	30	7	and her husband hears it , and makes no response to her on the day that he hears , then her vows shall stand , and her agreements by which she bound herself shall stand .
NKJV	Numbers	30	8	But if her husband ( E ) overrules her on the day that he hears it , he shall make void her vow which she took and what she uttered with her lips , by which she bound herself , and the Lord will release her .
NKJV	Numbers	30	9	“ Also any vow of a widow or a divorced woman , by which she has bound herself , shall stand against her .
NKJV	Numbers	30	10	“ If she vowed in her husband ’ s house , or bound herself by an agreement with an oath ,
NKJV	Numbers	30	11	and her husband heard it , and made no response to her and did not overrule her , then all her vows shall stand , and every agreement by which she bound herself shall stand .
NKJV	Numbers	30	12	But if her husband truly made them void on the day he heard them , then whatever proceeded from her lips concerning her vows or concerning the agreement binding her , it shall not stand ; her husband has made them [ b ] void , and the Lord will release her .
NKJV	Numbers	30	13	Every vow and every binding oath to afflict her soul , her husband may confirm it , or her husband may make it void .
NKJV	Numbers	30	14	Now if her husband makes no response whatever to her from day to day , then he confirms all her vows or all the agreements that bind her ; he confirms them , because he made no response to her on the day that he heard them .
NKJV	Numbers	30	15	But if he does make them void after he has heard them , then he shall bear her guilt. ”
NKJV	Numbers	30	16	These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , and between a father and his daughter in her youth in her father ’ s house .

NKJV	Numbers	31	31	So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses .
NKJV	Numbers	31	2	( A ) “ Take vengeance on the Midianites for the children of Israel . Afterward you shall ( B ) be gathered to your people. ”
NKJV	Numbers	31	3	So Moses spoke to the people , saying , “ Arm some of yourselves for war , and let them go against the Midianites to take vengeance for the Lord on ( C ) Midian .
NKJV	Numbers	31	4	A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war. ”
NKJV	Numbers	31	5	So there were recruited from the divisions of Israel one thousand from each tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
NKJV	Numbers	31	6	Then Moses sent them to the war , one thousand from each tribe ; he sent them to the war with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , with the holy articles and ( D ) the signal trumpets in his hand .
NKJV	Numbers	31	7	And they warred against the Midianites , just as the Lord commanded Moses , and ( E ) they killed all the ( F ) males .
NKJV	Numbers	31	8	They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of those who were killed— ( G ) Evi , Rekem , ( H ) Zur , Hur , and Reba , the five kings of Midian . ( I ) Balaam the son of Beor they also killed with the sword .
NKJV	Numbers	31	9	And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captive , with their little ones , and took as spoil all their cattle , all their flocks , and all their goods .

NKJV	Numbers	31	12	Then they brought the captives , the booty , and the spoil to Moses , to Eleazar the priest , and to the congregation of the children of Israel , to the camp in the plains of Moab by the Jordan , across from Jericho .
NKJV	Numbers	31	13	And Moses , Eleazar the priest , and all the leaders of the congregation , went to meet them outside the camp .
NKJV	Numbers	31	14	But Moses was angry with the officers of the army , with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds , who had come from the battle .
NKJV	Numbers	31	15	And Moses said to them : “ Have you kept ( K ) all the women alive ?
NKJV	Numbers	31	16	Look , ( L ) these women caused the children of Israel , through the ( M ) counsel of Balaam , to trespass against the Lord in the incident of Peor , and ( N ) there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	31	17	Now therefore , ( O ) kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known a man intimately .
NKJV	Numbers	31	18	But keep alive ( P ) for yourselves all the young girls who have not known a man intimately .
NKJV	Numbers	31	19	And as for you , ( Q ) remain outside the camp seven days ; whoever has killed any person , and ( R ) whoever has touched any slain , purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day .
NKJV	Numbers	31	20	Purify every garment , everything made of leather , everything woven of goats ’ hair , and everything made of wood. ”
NKJV	Numbers	31	21	Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to the battle , “ This is the [ a ] ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses :

NKJV	Numbers	31	23	everything that can endure fire , you shall put through the fire , and it shall be clean ; and it shall be purified ( S ) with the water of purification . But all that can not endure fire you shall put through water .
NKJV	Numbers	31	24	( T ) And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean , and afterward you may come into the camp. ” Division of the Plunder
NKJV	Numbers	31	25	Now the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
NKJV	Numbers	31	26	“ Count up the plunder that was [ b ] taken—of man and beast—you and Eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation ;
NKJV	Numbers	31	27	and ( U ) divide the plunder into two parts , between those who took part in the war , who went out to battle , and all the congregation .
NKJV	Numbers	31	28	And levy a [ c ] tribute for the Lord on the men of war who went out to battle : ( V ) one of every five hundred of the persons , the cattle , the donkeys , and the sheep ;
NKJV	Numbers	31	29	take it from their half , and ( W ) give it to Eleazar the priest as a heave offering to the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	31	30	And from the children of Israel ’ s half you shall take ( X ) one of every fifty , drawn from the persons , the cattle , the donkeys , and the sheep , from all the livestock , and give them to the Levites ( Y ) who [ d ] keep charge of the tabernacle of the Lord. ”
NKJV	Numbers	31	32	The booty remaining from the plunder , which the men of war had taken , was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep ,
NKJV	Numbers	31	33	seventy-two thousand cattle ,
NKJV	Numbers	31	34	sixty-one thousand donkeys ,
NKJV	Numbers	31	35	and thirty-two thousand persons in all , of women who had not known a man intimately .
NKJV	Numbers	31	36	And the half , the portion for those who had gone out to war , was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep ;
NKJV	Numbers	31	37	and the Lord ’ s [ e ] tribute of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five .
NKJV	Numbers	31	38	The cattle were thirty-six thousand , of which the Lord ’ s tribute was seventy-two .
NKJV	Numbers	31	39	The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred , of which the Lord ’ s tribute was sixty-one .
NKJV	Numbers	31	40	The persons were sixteen thousand , of which the Lord ’ s tribute was thirty-two persons .
NKJV	Numbers	31	41	So Moses gave the tribute which was the Lord ’ s heave offering to Eleazar the priest , ( Z ) as the Lord commanded Moses .
NKJV	Numbers	31	42	And from the children of Israel ’ s half , which Moses separated from the men who fought—
NKJV	Numbers	31	43	now the half belonging to the congregation was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep ,
NKJV	Numbers	31	44	thirty-six thousand cattle ,
NKJV	Numbers	31	45	thirty thousand five hundred donkeys ,
NKJV	Numbers	31	46	and sixteen thousand persons—
NKJV	Numbers	31	47	and ( AA ) from the children of Israel ’ s half Moses took one of every fifty , drawn from man and beast , and gave them to the Levites , who kept charge of the tabernacle of the Lord , as the Lord commanded Moses .
NKJV	Numbers	31	48	Then the officers who were over thousands of the army , the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds , came near to Moses ;
NKJV	Numbers	31	49	and they said to Moses , “ Your servants have taken a count of the men of war who are under our command , and not a man of us is missing .
NKJV	Numbers	31	50	Therefore we have brought an offering for the Lord , what every man found of ornaments of gold : armlets and bracelets and signet rings and earrings and necklaces , ( AB ) to make [ f ] atonement for ourselves before the Lord. ”
NKJV	Numbers	31	51	So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from them , all the fashioned ornaments .
NKJV	Numbers	31	52	And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the Lord , from the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels .
NKJV	Numbers	31	53	( AC ) ( The men of war had taken spoil , every man for himself . )
NKJV	Numbers	31	54	And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tabernacle of meeting ( AD ) as a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord .

NKJV	Numbers	32	32	We will cross over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan , but the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us on this side of the Jordan. ”
NKJV	Numbers	32	2	the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses , to Eleazar the priest , and to the leaders of the congregation , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	32	3	“ Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , ( D ) Nimrah , ( E ) Heshbon , Elealeh , ( F ) Shebam , Nebo , and ( G ) Beon ,
NKJV	Numbers	32	4	the country ( H ) which the Lord defeated before the congregation of Israel , is a land for livestock , and your servants have livestock. ”
NKJV	Numbers	32	5	Therefore they said , “ If we have found favor in your sight , let this land be given to your servants as a possession . Do not take us over the Jordan. ”
NKJV	Numbers	32	6	And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben : “ Shall your brethren go to war while you sit here ?
NKJV	Numbers	32	7	Now why will you ( I ) discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord has given them ?
NKJV	Numbers	32	8	Thus your fathers did ( J ) when I sent them away from Kadesh Barnea ( K ) to see the land .
NKJV	Numbers	32	9	For ( L ) when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , so that they did not go into the land which the Lord had given them .
NKJV	Numbers	32	10	( M ) So the Lord ’ s anger was aroused on that day , and He swore an oath , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	32	11	‘ Surely none of the men who came up from Egypt , ( N ) from twenty years old and above , shall see the land of which I swore to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , because ( O ) they have not wholly followed Me ,
NKJV	Numbers	32	12	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh , the Kenizzite , and Joshua the son of Nun , ( P ) for they have wholly followed the Lord. ’
NKJV	Numbers	32	13	So the Lord ’ s anger was aroused against Israel , and He made them ( Q ) wander in the wilderness forty years , until ( R ) all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was gone .
NKJV	Numbers	32	14	And look ! You have risen in your fathers ’ place , a brood of sinful men , to increase still more the ( S ) fierce anger of the Lord against Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	32	15	For if you ( T ) turn away from following Him , He will once again leave them in the wilderness , and you will destroy all these people. ”
NKJV	Numbers	32	16	Then they came near to him and said : “ We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock , and cities for our little ones ,
NKJV	Numbers	32	17	but ( U ) we ourselves will be armed , ready to go before the children of Israel until we have brought them to their place ; and our little ones will dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
NKJV	Numbers	32	18	( V ) We will not return to our homes until every one of the children of Israel has [ a ] received his inheritance .
NKJV	Numbers	32	19	For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond , ( W ) because our inheritance has fallen to us on this eastern side of the Jordan. ”
NKJV	Numbers	32	20	Then ( X ) Moses said to them : “ If you do this thing , if you arm yourselves before the Lord for the war ,
NKJV	Numbers	32	21	and all your armed men cross over the Jordan before the Lord until He has driven out His enemies from before Him ,
NKJV	Numbers	32	22	and ( Y ) the land is subdued before the Lord , then afterward ( Z ) you may return and be blameless before the Lord and before Israel ; and ( AA ) this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
NKJV	Numbers	32	23	But if you do not do so , then take note , you have sinned against the Lord ; and be sure ( AB ) your sin will find you out .
NKJV	Numbers	32	24	( AC ) Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep , and do [ b ] what has proceeded out of your mouth. ”
NKJV	Numbers	32	25	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses , saying : “ Your servants will do as my lord commands .
NKJV	Numbers	32	26	( AD ) Our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our livestock will be there in the cities of Gilead ;
NKJV	Numbers	32	27	( AE ) but your servants will cross over , every man armed for war , before the Lord to battle , just as my lord says. ”
NKJV	Numbers	32	28	So Moses gave command ( AF ) concerning them to Eleazar the priest , to Joshua the son of Nun , and to the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	32	29	And Moses said to them : “ If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you , every man armed for battle before the Lord , and the land is subdued before you , then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession .
NKJV	Numbers	32	30	But if they do not cross over armed with you , they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan. ”
NKJV	Numbers	32	31	Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying : “ As the Lord has said to your servants , so we will do .
NKJV	Numbers	32	33	So ( AG ) Moses gave to the children of Gad , to the children of Reuben , and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , ( AH ) the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land with its cities within the borders , the cities of the surrounding country .
NKJV	Numbers	32	34	And the children of Gad built ( AI ) Dibon and Ataroth and ( AJ ) Aroer ,
NKJV	Numbers	32	35	Atroth and Shophan and ( AK ) Jazer and Jogbehah ,
NKJV	Numbers	32	36	( AL ) Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran , ( AM ) fortified cities , and folds for sheep .
NKJV	Numbers	32	37	And the children of Reuben built ( AN ) Heshbon and Elealeh and Kirjathaim ,
NKJV	Numbers	32	38	( AO ) Nebo and ( AP ) Baal Meon ( AQ ) ( their names being changed ) and Shibmah ; and they gave other names to the cities which they built .
NKJV	Numbers	32	39	And the children of ( AR ) Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it , and [ c ] dispossessed the Amorites who were in it .
NKJV	Numbers	32	40	So Moses ( AS ) gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh , and he dwelt in it .
NKJV	Numbers	32	41	Also ( AT ) Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns , and called them ( AU ) Havoth Jair . [ d ]

NKJV	Numbers	33	39	Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor .

NKJV	Numbers	35	35	And the Lord spoke to Moses in ( A ) the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho , saying :
NKJV	Numbers	35	2	( B ) “ Command the children of Israel that they give the Levites cities to dwell in from the inheritance of their possession , and you shall also give the Levites ( C ) common-land around the cities .
NKJV	Numbers	35	3	They shall have the cities to dwell in ; and their common-land shall be for their cattle , for their herds , and for all their animals .
NKJV	Numbers	35	4	The common-land of the cities which you will give the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around .
NKJV	Numbers	35	5	And you shall measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits , on the south side two thousand cubits , on the west side two thousand cubits , and on the north side two thousand cubits . The city shall be in the middle . This shall belong to them as common-land for the cities .
NKJV	Numbers	35	6	“ Now among the cities which you will give to the Levites you shall appoint ( D ) six cities of refuge , to which a manslayer may flee . And to these you shall add forty-two cities .
NKJV	Numbers	35	7	So all the cities you will give to the Levites shall be ( E ) forty-eight ; these you shall give with their common-land .
NKJV	Numbers	35	8	And the cities which you will give shall be ( F ) from the possession of the children of Israel ; ( G ) from the larger tribe you shall give many , from the smaller you shall give few . Each shall give some of its cities to the Levites , in proportion to the inheritance that each receives. ” Cities of Refuge ( H )
NKJV	Numbers	35	9	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
NKJV	Numbers	35	10	“ Speak to the children of Israel , and say to them : ( I ) ‘ When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
NKJV	Numbers	35	11	then ( J ) you shall appoint cities to be cities of refuge for you , that the manslayer who kills any person accidentally may flee there .
NKJV	Numbers	35	12	( K ) They shall be cities of refuge for you from the avenger , that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation in judgment .
NKJV	Numbers	35	13	And of the cities which you give , you shall have ( L ) six cities of refuge .
NKJV	Numbers	35	14	( M ) You shall appoint three cities on this side of the Jordan , and three cities you shall appoint in the land of Canaan , which will be cities of refuge .
NKJV	Numbers	35	15	These six cities shall be for refuge for the children of Israel , ( N ) for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them , that anyone who kills a person accidentally may flee there .
NKJV	Numbers	35	16	( O ) ‘ But if he strikes him with an iron implement , so that he dies , he is a murderer ; the murderer shall surely be put to death .
NKJV	Numbers	35	17	And if he strikes him with a stone in the hand , by which one could die , and he does die , he is a murderer ; the murderer shall surely be put to death .
NKJV	Numbers	35	18	Or if he strikes him with a wooden hand weapon , by which one could die , and he does die , he is a murderer ; the murderer shall surely be put to death .
NKJV	Numbers	35	19	( P ) The [ a ] avenger of blood himself shall put the murderer to death ; when he meets him , he shall put him to death .
NKJV	Numbers	35	20	( Q ) If he pushes him out of hatred or , ( R ) while lying in wait , hurls something at him so that he dies ,
NKJV	Numbers	35	21	or in enmity he strikes him with his hand so that he dies , the one who struck him shall surely be put to death . He is a murderer . The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him .
NKJV	Numbers	35	22	‘ However , if he pushes him suddenly ( S ) without enmity , or throws anything at him without lying in wait ,
NKJV	Numbers	35	23	or uses a stone , by which a man could die , throwing it at him without seeing him , so that he dies , while he was not his enemy or seeking his harm ,
NKJV	Numbers	35	24	then ( T ) the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments .
NKJV	Numbers	35	25	So the congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood , and the congregation shall return him to the city of refuge where he had fled , and ( U ) he shall remain there until the death of the high priest ( V ) who was anointed with the holy oil .
NKJV	Numbers	35	26	But if the manslayer at any time goes outside the limits of the city of refuge where he fled ,
NKJV	Numbers	35	27	and the avenger of blood finds him outside the limits of his city of refuge , and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer , he shall not be guilty of [ b ] blood ,
NKJV	Numbers	35	28	because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest . But after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession .
NKJV	Numbers	35	29	‘ And these things shall be ( W ) a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
NKJV	Numbers	35	30	Whoever kills a person , the murderer shall be put to death on the ( X ) testimony of witnesses ; but one witness is not sufficient testimony against a person for the death penalty .
NKJV	Numbers	35	31	Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death , but he shall surely be put to death .

NKJV	Numbers	36	36	Now the chief fathers of the families of the ( A ) children of Gilead the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near and ( B ) spoke before Moses and before the leaders , the chief fathers of the children of Israel .
NKJV	Numbers	36	2	And they said : ( C ) “ The Lord commanded my lord Moses to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel , and ( D ) my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters .
NKJV	Numbers	36	3	Now if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel , then their inheritance will be ( E ) taken from the inheritance of our fathers , and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry ; so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance .
NKJV	Numbers	36	4	And when ( F ) the Jubilee of the children of Israel comes , then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry ; so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. ”
NKJV	Numbers	36	5	Then Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord , saying : ( G ) “ What the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks is right .
NKJV	Numbers	36	6	This is what the Lord commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , ‘ Let them [ a ] marry whom they think best , ( H ) but they may marry only within the family of their father ’ s tribe. ’
NKJV	Numbers	36	7	So the inheritance of the children of Israel shall not change hands from tribe to tribe , for every one of the children of Israel shall ( I ) keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
NKJV	Numbers	36	8	And ( J ) every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be the wife of one of the family of her father ’ s tribe , so that the children of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers .
NKJV	Numbers	36	9	Thus no inheritance shall change hands from one tribe to another , but every tribe of the children of Israel shall keep its own inheritance. ”
NKJV	Numbers	36	10	Just as the Lord commanded Moses , so did the daughters of Zelophehad ;
NKJV	Numbers	36	11	( K ) for Mahlah , Tirzah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Noah , the daughters of Zelophehad , were married to the sons of their father ’ s brothers .
NKJV	Numbers	36	12	They were married into the families of the children of Manasseh the son of Joseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father ’ s family .
NKJV	Numbers	36	13	These are the commandments and the judgments which the Lord commanded the children of Israel by the hand of Moses ( L ) in the plains of Moab by the Jordan , across from Jericho .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	1	These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel ( A ) on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness , in the [ a ] plain opposite [ b ] Suph , between Paran , Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	2	It is eleven days ’ journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir ( B ) to Kadesh Barnea .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	3	Now it came to pass ( C ) in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the Lord had given him as commandments to them ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	4	( D ) after he had killed Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt in Heshbon , and Og king of Bashan , who dwelt at Ashtaroth ( E ) in [ c ] Edrei .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	5	On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab , Moses began to explain this law , saying ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	6	“ The Lord our God spoke to us ( F ) in Horeb , saying : ‘ You have dwelt long ( G ) enough at this mountain .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	7	Turn and take your journey , and go to the mountains of the Amorites , to all the neighboring places in the [ d ] plain , in the mountains and in the lowland , in the South and on the seacoast , to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon , as far as the great river , the River Euphrates .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	8	See , I have set the land before you ; go in and possess the land which the Lord [ e ] swore to your fathers—to ( H ) Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob—to give to them and their descendants after them. ’ Tribal Leaders Appointed ( I )
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	9	“ And ( J ) I spoke to you at that time , saying : ‘ I [ f ] alone am not able to bear you .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	10	The Lord your God has multiplied you , ( K ) and here you are today , as the stars of heaven in multitude .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	11	( L ) May the Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times more numerous than you are , and bless you ( M ) as He has promised you !
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	12	( N ) How can I alone bear your problems and your burdens and your complaints ?
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	13	Choose wise , understanding , and knowledgeable men from among your tribes , and I will make them [ g ] heads over you. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	14	And you answered me and said , ‘ The thing which you have told us to do is good. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	15	So I took ( O ) the heads of your tribes , wise and knowledgeable men , and [ h ] made them heads over you , leaders of thousands , leaders of hundreds , leaders of fifties , leaders of tens , and officers for your tribes .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	16	“ Then I commanded your judges at that time , saying , ‘ Hear the cases between your brethren , and ( P ) judge righteously between a man and his ( Q ) brother or the stranger who is with him .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	17	( R ) You shall not show partiality in judgment ; you shall hear the small as well as the great ; you shall not be afraid in any man ’ s presence , for ( S ) the judgment is God ’ s . The case that is too hard for you , ( T ) bring to me , and I will hear it. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	18	And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do . Israel ’ s Refusal to Enter the Land ( U )
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	19	“ So we departed from Horeb , ( V ) and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the mountains of the Amorites , as the Lord our God had commanded us . Then ( W ) we came to Kadesh Barnea .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	20	And I said to you , ‘ You have come to the mountains of the Amorites , which the Lord our God is giving us .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	21	Look , the Lord your God has set the land before you ; go up and possess it , as the Lord God of your fathers has spoken to you ; ( X ) do not fear or be discouraged. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	22	“ And every one of you came near to me and said , ‘ Let us send men before us , and let them search out the land for us , and bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up , and of the cities into which we shall come. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	23	“ The plan pleased me well ; so ( Y ) I took twelve of your men , one man from each tribe .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	24	( Z ) And they departed and went up into the mountains , and came to the Valley of Eshcol , and spied it out .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	25	They also took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us ; and they brought back word to us , saying , ‘ It is a ( AA ) good land which the Lord our God is giving us. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	26	( AB ) “ Nevertheless you would not go up , but rebelled against the command of the Lord your God ;
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	27	and you ( AC ) complained in your tents , and said , ‘ Because the Lord ( AD ) hates us , He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	28	Where can we go up ? Our brethren have [ i ] discouraged our hearts , saying , ( AE ) “ The people are greater and taller than we ; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven ; moreover we have seen the sons of the ( AF ) Anakim there. ” ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	29	“ Then I said to you , ‘ Do not be terrified , ( AG ) or afraid of them .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	34	“ And the Lord heard the sound of your words , and was angry , ( AN ) and took an oath , saying ,

NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	36	( AP ) except Caleb the son of Jephunneh ; he shall see it , and to him and his children I am giving the land on which he walked , because ( AQ ) he [ k ] wholly followed the Lord. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	37	( AR ) The Lord was also angry with me for your sakes , saying , ‘ Even you shall not go in there .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	40	( AY ) But as for you , turn and take your journey into the wilderness by the Way of the Red Sea. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	41	“ Then you answered and said to me , ( AZ ) ‘ We have sinned against the Lord ; we will go up and fight , just as the Lord our God commanded us. ’ And when everyone of you had girded on his weapons of war , you were ready to go up into the mountain .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	1	43	So I spoke to you ; yet you would not listen , but ( BB ) rebelled against the command of the Lord , and ( BC ) presumptuously [ l ] went up into the mountain .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	4	And command the people , saying , ( D ) “ You are about to pass through the territory of ( E ) your brethren , the descendants of Esau , who live in Seir ; and they will be afraid of you . Therefore watch yourselves carefully .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	5	Do not meddle with them , for I will not give you any of their land , no , not so much as one footstep , ( F ) because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	6	You shall buy food from them with money , that you may eat ; and you shall also buy water from them with money , that you may drink .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	7	“ For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand . He knows your [ b ] trudging through this great wilderness . ( G ) These forty years the Lord your God has been with you ; you have lacked nothing. ” ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	8	“ And when we passed beyond our brethren , the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir , away from the road of the plain , away from ( H ) Elath and Ezion Geber , we ( I ) turned and passed by way of the Wilderness of Moab .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	9	Then the Lord said to me , ‘ Do not harass Moab , nor contend with them in battle , for I will not give you any of their land as a possession , because I have given ( J ) Ar to ( K ) the descendants of Lot as a possession. ’ ”
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	10	( L ) ( The Emim had dwelt there in times past , a people as great and numerous and tall as ( M ) the Anakim .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	12	( N ) The Horites formerly dwelt in Seir , but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them , and dwelt in their [ d ] place , just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the Lord gave them . )
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	13	“ ‘ Now rise and cross over ( O ) the [ e ] Valley of the Zered. ’ So we crossed over the Valley of the Zered .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	14	And the time we took to come ( P ) from Kadesh Barnea until we crossed over the Valley of the Zered was thirty-eight years , ( Q ) until all the generation of the men of war [ f ] was consumed from the midst of the camp , ( R ) just as the Lord had sworn to them .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	15	For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them , to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they [ g ] were consumed .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	16	“ So it was , when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	17	that the Lord spoke to me , saying :
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	18	‘ This day you are to cross over at Ar , the boundary of Moab .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	19	And when you come near the people of Ammon , do not harass them or meddle with them , for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession , because I have given it to ( S ) the descendants of Lot as a possession. ’ ”

NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	32	( AN ) Then Sihon and all his people came out against us to fight at Jahaz .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	33	And ( AO ) the Lord our God delivered him [ k ] over to us ; so ( AP ) we defeated him , his sons , and all his people .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	2	34	We took all his cities at that time , and we ( AQ ) utterly destroyed the men , women , and little ones of every city ; we left none remaining .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	3	4	And we took all his cities at that time ; there was not a city which we did not take from them : sixty cities , ( E ) all the region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	9	6	Therefore understand that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness , for you are a ( K ) stiff-necked [ b ] people .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	9	18	And I ( AD ) fell [ e ] down before the Lord , as at the first , forty days and forty nights ; I neither ate bread nor drank water , because of all your sin which you committed in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord , to provoke Him to anger .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	9	19	( AE ) For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the Lord was angry with you , to destroy you . ( AF ) But the Lord listened to me at that time also .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	9	20	And the Lord was very angry with Aaron and would have destroyed him ; so I prayed for Aaron also at the same time .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	9	21	Then I took your sin , the calf which you had made , and burned it with fire and crushed it and ground it very small , until it was as fine as dust ; and I ( AG ) threw its dust into the brook that descended from the mountain .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	9	22	“ Also at ( AH ) Taberah and ( AI ) Massah and ( AJ ) Kibroth Hattaavah you [ f ] provoked the Lord to wrath .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	9	23	Likewise , ( AK ) when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea , saying , ‘ Go up and possess the land which I have given you , ’ then you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God , and ( AL ) you did not believe Him nor obey His voice .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	9	25	( AN ) “ Thus I [ g ] prostrated myself before the Lord ; forty days and forty nights I kept prostrating myself , because the Lord had said He would destroy you .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	9	26	Therefore I prayed to the Lord , and said : ‘ O Lord God , do not destroy Your people and ( AO ) Your inheritance whom You have redeemed through Your greatness , whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	10	“ As at the first time , ( O ) I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights ; ( P ) the Lord also heard me at that time , and the Lord chose not to destroy you .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	2	And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets , which you broke ; and ( C ) you shall put them in the ark. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	3	“ So I made an ark of acacia wood , hewed two tablets of stone like the first , and went up the mountain , having the two tablets in my hand .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	4	And He wrote on the tablets according to the first writing , the Ten [ b ] Commandments , ( D ) which the Lord had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly ; and the Lord gave them to me .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	5	Then I turned and ( E ) came down from the mountain , and ( F ) put the tablets in the ark which I had made ; ( G ) and there they are , just as the Lord commanded me. ”
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	6	( Now the children of Israel journeyed from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah , where Aaron ( H ) died , and where he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his [ c ] stead .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	7	( I ) From there they journeyed to Gudgodah , and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah , a land of [ d ] rivers of water .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	8	At that time ( J ) the Lord [ e ] separated the tribe of Levi ( K ) to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord , ( L ) to stand before the Lord to minister to Him and ( M ) to bless in His name , to this day .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	13	and to keep the commandments of the Lord and His statutes which I command you today ( T ) for your [ f ] good ?
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	14	Indeed heaven and the highest heavens belong to the ( U ) Lord your God , also the earth with all that is in it .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	15	The Lord delighted only in your fathers , to love them ; and He chose their [ g ] descendants after them , you above all peoples , as it is this day .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	16	Therefore circumcise the foreskin of your ( V ) heart , and be ( W ) stiff-necked [ h ] no longer .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	17	For the Lord your God is ( X ) God of gods and ( Y ) Lord of lords , the great God , ( Z ) mighty and awesome , who ( AA ) shows no partiality nor takes a bribe .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	10	18	( AB ) He administers justice for the fatherless and the widow , and loves the stranger , giving him food and clothing .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	15	9	Beware lest there be a wicked thought in your heart , saying , ‘ The seventh year , the year of release , is at hand , ’ and your ( G ) eye be evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing , and ( H ) he cry out to the Lord against you , and ( I ) it become sin among you .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	15	10	You shall surely give to him , and ( J ) your heart should not be grieved when you give to him , because ( K ) for this thing the Lord your God will bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	30	( AI ) “ You shall betroth a wife , but another man shall lie with her ; ( AJ ) you shall build a house , but you shall not dwell in it ; ( AK ) you shall plant a vineyard , but shall not gather its grapes .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	55	so that he will not give any of them the flesh of his children whom he will eat , because he has nothing left in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you at all your gates .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	56	The [ q ] tender and [ r ] delicate woman among you , who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground because of her delicateness and sensitivity , [ s ] will refuse to the husband of her bosom , and to her son and her daughter ,

NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	58	“ If you do not carefully observe all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear ( BK ) this glorious and awesome name , THE LORD YOUR GOD ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	59	then the Lord will bring upon you and your descendants ( BL ) extraordinary plagues—great and prolonged plagues—and serious and prolonged sicknesses .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	60	Moreover He will bring back on you all ( BM ) the diseases of Egypt , of which you were afraid , and they shall cling to you .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	61	Also every sickness and every plague , which is not written in this Book of the Law , will the Lord bring upon you until you are destroyed .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	62	You ( BN ) shall be left few in number , whereas you were ( BO ) as the stars of heaven in multitude , because you would not obey the voice of the Lord your God .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	63	And it shall be , that just as the Lord ( BP ) rejoiced over you to do you good and multiply you , so the Lord ( BQ ) will rejoice over you to destroy you and bring you to nothing ; and you shall be ( BR ) plucked [ u ] from off the land which you go to possess .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	64	“ Then the Lord ( BS ) will scatter you among all peoples , from one end of the earth to the other , and ( BT ) there you shall serve other gods , which neither you nor your fathers have known—wood and stone .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	65	And ( BU ) among those nations you shall find no rest , nor shall the sole of your foot have a resting place ; ( BV ) but there the Lord will give you a [ v ] trembling heart , failing eyes , and ( BW ) anguish of soul .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	28	67	( BX ) In the morning you shall say , ‘ Oh , that it were evening ! ’ And at evening you shall say , ‘ Oh , that it were morning ! ’ because of the fear which terrifies your heart , and ( BY ) because of the sight which your eyes see .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	2	Now Moses called all Israel and said to them : ( B ) “ You have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt , to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land—
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	3	( C ) the great trials which your eyes have seen , the signs , and those great wonders .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	4	Yet ( D ) the Lord has not given you a heart to [ a ] perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear , to this very day .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	5	( E ) And I have led you forty years in the wilderness . ( F ) Your clothes have not worn out on you , and your sandals have not worn out on your feet .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	6	( G ) You have not eaten bread , nor have you drunk wine or similar drink , that you may know that I am the Lord your God .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	7	And when you came to this place , ( H ) Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us to battle , and we conquered them .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	8	We took their land and ( I ) gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites , to the Gadites , and to half the tribe of Manasseh .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	9	Therefore ( J ) keep the words of this covenant , and do them , that you may ( K ) prosper in all that you do .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	10	“ All of you stand today before the Lord your God : your leaders and your tribes and your elders and your officers , all the men of Israel ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	11	your little ones and your wives—also the stranger who is in your camp , from ( L ) the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water—
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	12	that you may enter into covenant with the Lord your God , and ( M ) into His oath , which the Lord your God makes with you today ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	13	that He may ( N ) establish you today as a people for Himself , and that He may be God to you , ( O ) just as He has spoken to you , and ( P ) just as He has sworn to your fathers , to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	14	“ I make this covenant and this oath , ( Q ) not with you alone ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	15	but with him who stands here with us today before the Lord our God , ( R ) as well as with him who is not here with us today
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	16	( for you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we came through the nations which you passed by ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	17	and you saw their [ b ] abominations and their idols which were among them—wood and stone and silver and gold ) ;
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	18	so that there may not be among you man or woman or family or tribe , ( S ) whose heart turns away today from the Lord our God , to go and serve the gods of these nations , ( T ) and that there may not be among you a root bearing ( U ) bitterness or wormwood ;
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	19	and so it may not happen , when he hears the words of this curse , that he blesses himself in his heart , saying , ‘ I shall have peace , even though I [ c ] follow the ( V ) dictates of my heart ’ — ( W ) as though the drunkard could be included with the sober .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	20	( X ) “ The Lord would not spare him ; for then ( Y ) the anger of the Lord and ( Z ) His jealousy would burn against that man , and every curse that is written in this book would settle on him , and the Lord ( AA ) would blot out his name from under heaven .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	21	And the Lord ( AB ) would separate him from all the tribes of Israel for adversity , according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the ( AC ) Law ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	22	so that the coming generation of your children who rise up after you , and the foreigner who comes from a far land , would say , when they ( AD ) see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the Lord has laid on it :
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	23	‘ The whole land is brimstone , ( AE ) salt , and burning ; it is not sown , nor does it bear , nor does any grass grow there , ( AF ) like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboiim , which the Lord overthrew in His anger and His wrath. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	24	All nations would say , ( AG ) ‘ Why has the Lord done so to this land ? What does the heat of this great anger mean ? ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	25	Then people would say : ‘ Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers , which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt ;
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	26	for they went and served other gods and worshiped them , gods that they did not know and that He had not given to them .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	27	Then the anger of the Lord was aroused against this land , ( AH ) to bring on it every curse that is written in this book .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	29	28	And the Lord ( AI ) uprooted them from their land in anger , in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day. ’

NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	30	“ Now ( A ) it shall come to pass , when ( B ) all these things come upon you , the blessing and the ( C ) curse which I have set before you , and ( D ) you [ a ] call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God drives you ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	2	and you ( E ) return to the Lord your God and obey His voice , according to all that I command you today , you and your children , with all your heart and with all your soul ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	3	( F ) that the Lord your God will bring you back from captivity , and have compassion on you , and ( G ) gather you again from all the nations where the Lord your God has scattered you .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	4	( H ) If any of you are driven out to the farthest parts under heaven , from there the Lord your God will gather you , and from there He will bring you .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	5	Then the Lord your God will bring you to the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it . He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	6	And ( I ) the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants , to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul , that you may live .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	7	“ Also the Lord your God will put all these ( J ) curses on your enemies and on those who hate you , who persecuted you .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	8	And you will ( K ) again obey the voice of the Lord and do all His commandments which I command you today .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	9	( L ) The Lord your God will make you abound in all the work of your hand , in the [ b ] fruit of your body , in the increase of your livestock , and in the produce of your land for good . For the Lord will again ( M ) rejoice over you for good as He rejoiced over your fathers ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	10	if you obey the voice of the Lord your God , to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this Book of the Law , and if you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul . The Choice of Life or Death
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	11	“ For this commandment which I command you today ( N ) is [ c ] not too mysterious for you , nor is it far off .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	12	( O ) It is not in heaven , that you should say , ‘ Who will ascend into heaven for us and bring it to us , that we may hear it and do it ? ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	13	Nor is it beyond the sea , that you should say , ‘ Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us , that we may hear it and do it ? ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	14	But the word is very near you , ( P ) in your mouth and in your heart , that you may do it .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	15	“ See , ( Q ) I have set before you today life and good , death and evil ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	16	in that I command you today to love the Lord your God , to walk in His ways , and to keep His commandments , His statutes , and His judgments , that you may live and multiply ; and the Lord your God will bless you in the land which you go to possess .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	17	But if your heart turns away so that you do not hear , and are drawn away , and worship other gods and serve them ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	18	( R ) I announce to you today that you shall surely perish ; you shall not prolong your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to go in and possess .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	19	( S ) I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you , that ( T ) I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing ; therefore choose life , that both you and your descendants may live ;
NKJV	Deuteronomy	30	20	that you may love the Lord your God , that you may obey His voice , and that you may cling to Him , for He is your ( U ) life and the length of your days ; and that you may dwell in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers , to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give them. ” Footnotes - Deuteronomy 30:1 Lit . cause them to return to your heart - Deuteronomy 30:9 offspring - Deuteronomy 30:11 not hidden from Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	31	Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	2	And he said to them : “ I ( B ) am one hundred and twenty years old today . I can no longer ( C ) go out and come in . Also the Lord has said to me , ( D ) ‘ You shall not cross over this Jordan. ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	3	The Lord your God ( E ) Himself crosses over before you ; He will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dispossess them . ( F ) Joshua himself crosses over before you , just ( G ) as the Lord has said .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	4	( H ) And the Lord will do to them ( I ) as He did to Sihon and Og , the kings of the Amorites and their land , when He destroyed them .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	5	( J ) The Lord will give them over to you , that you may do to them according to every commandment which I have commanded you .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	6	( K ) Be strong and of good courage , ( L ) do not fear nor be afraid of them ; for the Lord your God , ( M ) He is the One who goes with you . ( N ) He will not leave you nor forsake you. ”
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	7	Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel , ( O ) “ Be strong and of good courage , for you must go with this people to the land which the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them , and you shall cause them to inherit it .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	8	And the Lord , ( P ) He is the One who goes before you . ( Q ) He will be with you , He will not leave you nor forsake you ; do not fear nor be dismayed. ” The Law to Be Read Every Seven Years
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	9	So Moses wrote this law ( R ) and delivered it to the priests , the sons of Levi , ( S ) who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and to all the elders of Israel .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	10	And Moses commanded them , saying : “ At the end of every seven years , at the appointed time in the ( T ) year of release , ( U ) at the Feast of Tabernacles ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	11	when all Israel comes to ( V ) appear before the Lord your God in the ( W ) place which He chooses , ( X ) you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	12	( Y ) Gather the people together , men and women and little ones , and the stranger who is within your gates , that they may hear and that they may learn to fear the Lord your God and carefully observe all the words of this law ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	13	and that their children , ( Z ) who have not known it , ( AA ) may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land which you cross the Jordan to possess. ” Prediction of Israel ’ s Rebellion
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( AB ) “ Behold , the days approach when you must die ; call Joshua , and present yourselves in the tabernacle of meeting , that ( AC ) I may [ a ] inaugurate him. ” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of meeting .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	15	Now ( AD ) the Lord appeared at the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud , and the pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tabernacle .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	16	And the Lord said to Moses : “ Behold , you will [ b ] rest with your fathers ; and this people will ( AE ) rise and ( AF ) play the harlot with the gods of the foreigners of the land , where they go to be among them , and they will ( AG ) forsake Me and ( AH ) break My covenant which I have made with them .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	17	Then My anger shall be ( AI ) aroused against them in that day , and ( AJ ) I will forsake them , and I will ( AK ) hide My face from them , and they shall be [ c ] devoured . And many evils and troubles shall befall them , so that they will say in that day , ( AL ) ‘ Have not these evils come upon us because our God is ( AM ) not among us ? ’
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	18	And ( AN ) I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they have done , in that they have turned to other gods .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	19	“ Now therefore , write down this song for yourselves , and teach it to the children of Israel ; put it in their mouths , that this song may be ( AO ) a witness for Me against the children of Israel .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	20	When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey , of which I swore to their fathers , and they have eaten and filled themselves ( AP ) and grown fat , ( AQ ) then they will turn to other gods and serve them ; and they will provoke Me and break My covenant .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	21	Then it shall be , ( AR ) when many evils and troubles have come upon them , that this song will testify against them as a witness ; for it will not be forgotten in the mouths of their descendants , for ( AS ) I know the inclination ( AT ) of their behavior today , even before I have brought them to the land of which I swore to give them. ”
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	22	Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day , and taught it to the children of Israel .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	23	( AU ) Then He inaugurated Joshua the son of Nun , and said , ( AV ) “ Be strong and of good courage ; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of which I swore to them , and I will be with you. ”
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	24	So it was , when Moses had completed writing the words of this law in a book , when they were finished ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	25	that Moses commanded the Levites , who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord , saying :
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	26	“ Take this Book of the Law , ( AW ) and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God , that it may be there ( AX ) as a witness against you ;
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	27	( AY ) for I know your rebellion and your ( AZ ) stiff neck . If today , while I am yet alive with you , you have been rebellious against the Lord , then how much more after my death ?
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	28	Gather to me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their hearing ( BA ) and call heaven and earth to witness against them .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	29	For I know that after my death you will ( BB ) become utterly corrupt , and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you . And ( BC ) evil will befall you ( BD ) in the latter days , because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands. ” The Song of Moses
NKJV	Deuteronomy	31	30	Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song until they were ended : Footnotes - Deuteronomy 31:14 commission - Deuteronomy 31:16 Die and join your ancestors - Deuteronomy 31:17 consumed Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	4	He is ( G ) the Rock , ( H ) His work is perfect ; For all His ways are justice , ( I ) A God of truth and ( J ) without injustice ; Righteous and upright is He .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	5	“ They ( K ) have corrupted themselves ; They are not His children , Because of their blemish : A ( L ) perverse and crooked generation .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	6	Do you thus ( M ) deal [ b ] with the Lord , O foolish and unwise people ? Is He not ( N ) your Father , who ( O ) bought you ? Has He not ( P ) made you and established you ?
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	7	“ Remember ( Q ) the days of old , Consider the years of many generations . ( R ) Ask your father , and he will show you ; Your elders , and they will tell you :
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	8	When the Most High ( S ) divided their inheritance to the nations , When He ( T ) separated the sons of Adam , He set the boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the [ c ] children of Israel .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	9	For ( U ) the Lord ’ s portion is His people ; Jacob is the place of His inheritance .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	10	“ He found him ( V ) in a desert land And in the wasteland , a howling wilderness ; He encircled him , He instructed him , He ( W ) kept him as the [ d ] apple of His eye .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	11	( X ) As an eagle stirs up its nest , Hovers over its young , Spreading out its wings , taking them up , Carrying them on its wings ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	12	So the Lord alone led him , And there was no foreign god with him .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	13	“ He ( Y ) made him ride in the heights of the earth , That he might eat the produce of the fields ; He made him draw honey from the rock , And oil from the flinty rock ;
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	14	Curds from the cattle , and milk of the flock , ( Z ) With fat of lambs ; And rams of the breed of Bashan , and goats , With the choicest wheat ; And you drank wine , the ( AA ) blood of the grapes .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	20	And He said : ‘ I will hide My face from them , I will see what their end will be , For they are a perverse generation , ( AK ) Children in whom is no faith .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	21	( AL ) They have provoked Me to jealousy by what is not God ; They have moved Me to anger ( AM ) by their [ f ] foolish idols . But ( AN ) I will provoke them to jealousy by those who are not a nation ; I will move them to anger by a foolish nation .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	22	For ( AO ) a fire is kindled in My anger , And shall burn to the [ g ] lowest [ h ] hell ; It shall consume the earth with her increase , And set on fire the foundations of the mountains .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	31	For their rock is not like our Rock , ( AX ) Even our enemies themselves being judges .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	33	Their wine is ( AZ ) the poison of serpents , And the cruel ( BA ) venom of cobras .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	44	So Moses came with [ k ] Joshua the son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	45	Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel ,
NKJV	Deuteronomy	32	46	and he said to them : ( BP ) “ Set your hearts on all the words which I testify among you today , which you shall command your ( BQ ) children to be careful to observe—all the words of this law .

NKJV	Deuteronomy	34	34	Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab ( A ) to Mount Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , which is across from Jericho . And the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan ,

NKJV	Deuteronomy	34	5	( E ) So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of the Lord .
NKJV	Deuteronomy	34	6	And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab , opposite Beth Peor ; but ( F ) no one knows his grave to this day .

NKJV	Joshua	1	1	After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord , it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun , Moses ’ ( A ) assistant , saying :
NKJV	Joshua	1	2	( B ) “ Moses My servant is dead . Now therefore , arise , go over this Jordan , you and all this people , to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	1	3	( C ) Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you , as I said to Moses .
NKJV	Joshua	1	4	( D ) From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river , the River Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your territory .
NKJV	Joshua	1	5	( E ) No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life ; ( F ) as I was with Moses , so ( G ) I will be with you . ( H ) I will not leave you nor forsake you .
NKJV	Joshua	1	6	( I ) Be strong and of good courage , for to this people you shall [ a ] divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them .
NKJV	Joshua	1	7	Only be strong and very courageous , that you may observe to do according to all the law ( J ) which Moses My servant commanded you ; ( K ) do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left , that you may [ b ] prosper wherever you go .
NKJV	Joshua	1	8	( L ) This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth , but ( M ) you [ c ] shall meditate in it day and night , that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it . For then you will make your way prosperous , and then you will have good success .
NKJV	Joshua	1	9	( N ) Have I not commanded you ? Be strong and of good courage ; ( O ) do not be afraid , nor be dismayed , for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. ” The Order to Cross the Jordan
NKJV	Joshua	1	10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people , saying ,
NKJV	Joshua	1	11	“ Pass through the camp and command the people , saying , ‘ Prepare provisions for yourselves , for ( P ) within three days you will cross over this Jordan , to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess. ’ ”
NKJV	Joshua	1	12	And to the Reubenites , the Gadites , and half the tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke , saying ,
NKJV	Joshua	1	13	“ Remember ( Q ) the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , saying , ‘ The Lord your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land. ’
NKJV	Joshua	1	14	Your wives , your little ones , and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan . But you shall [ d ] pass before your brethren armed , all your mighty men of valor , and help them ,
NKJV	Joshua	1	15	until the Lord has given your brethren rest , as He gave you , and they also have taken possession of the land which the Lord your God is giving them . ( R ) Then you shall return to the land of your possession and enjoy it , which Moses the Lord ’ s servant gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise. ”
NKJV	Joshua	1	16	So they answered Joshua , saying , “ All that you command us we will do , and wherever you send us we will go .
NKJV	Joshua	1	17	Just as we heeded Moses in all things , so we will heed you . Only the Lord your God ( S ) be with you , as He was with Moses .
NKJV	Joshua	1	18	Whoever rebels against your command and does not heed your words , in all that you command him , shall be put to death .

NKJV	Joshua	2	2	And ( E ) it was told the king of Jericho , saying , “ Behold , men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the country. ”
NKJV	Joshua	2	3	So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab , saying , “ Bring out the men who have come to you , who have entered your house , for they have come to search out all the country. ”
NKJV	Joshua	2	4	( F ) Then the woman took the two men and hid them . So she said , “ Yes , the men came to me , but I did not know where they were from .
NKJV	Joshua	2	5	And it happened as the gate was being shut , when it was dark , that the men went out . Where the men went I do not know ; pursue them quickly , for you may overtake them. ”
NKJV	Joshua	2	6	( But ( G ) she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order on the roof . )
NKJV	Joshua	2	7	Then the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan , to the fords . And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out , they shut the gate .
NKJV	Joshua	2	8	Now before they lay down , she came up to them on the roof ,
NKJV	Joshua	2	9	and said to the men : ( H ) “ I know that the Lord has given you the land , that ( I ) the terror of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land ( J ) are fainthearted because of you .
NKJV	Joshua	2	10	For we have heard how the Lord ( K ) dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt , and ( L ) what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan , Sihon and Og , whom you ( M ) utterly destroyed .
NKJV	Joshua	2	11	And as soon as we ( N ) heard these things , ( O ) our hearts melted ; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you , for ( P ) the Lord your God , He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath .
NKJV	Joshua	2	12	Now therefore , I beg you , ( Q ) swear to me by the Lord , since I have shown you kindness , that you also will show kindness to ( R ) my father ’ s house , and ( S ) give me [ c ] a true token ,
NKJV	Joshua	2	13	and ( T ) spare my father , my mother , my brothers , my sisters , and all that they have , and deliver our lives from death. ”
NKJV	Joshua	2	14	So the men answered her , “ Our lives for yours , if none of you tell this business of ours . And it shall be , when the Lord has given us the land , that ( U ) we will deal kindly and truly with you. ”
NKJV	Joshua	2	15	Then she ( V ) let them down by a rope through the window , for her house was on the city wall ; she dwelt on the wall .
NKJV	Joshua	2	16	And she said to them , “ Get to the mountain , lest the pursuers meet you . Hide there three days , until the pursuers have returned . Afterward you may go your way. ”
NKJV	Joshua	2	17	So the men said to her : “ We will be ( W ) blameless [ d ] of this oath of yours which you have made us swear ,
NKJV	Joshua	2	18	( X ) unless , when we come into the land , you bind this line of scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down , ( Y ) and unless you [ e ] bring your father , your mother , your brothers , and all your father ’ s household to your own home .
NKJV	Joshua	2	19	So it shall be that whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street , his blood shall be on his own head , and we will be [ f ] guiltless . And whoever is with you in the house , ( Z ) his [ g ] blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him .
NKJV	Joshua	2	20	And if you tell this business of ours , then we will be [ h ] free from your oath which you made us swear. ”
NKJV	Joshua	2	21	Then she said , “ According to your words , so be it. ” And she sent them away , and they departed . And she bound the scarlet cord in the window .
NKJV	Joshua	2	22	They departed and went to the mountain , and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned . The pursuers sought them all along the way , but did not find them .
NKJV	Joshua	2	23	So the two men returned , descended from the mountain , and crossed over ; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun , and told him all that had befallen them .
NKJV	Joshua	2	24	And they said to Joshua , “ Truly ( AA ) the Lord has delivered all the land into our hands , for indeed all the inhabitants of the country are fainthearted because of us. ” Footnotes - Joshua 2:1 Heb .

NKJV	Joshua	3	3	and they commanded the people , saying , ( C ) “ When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God , ( D ) and the priests , the Levites , [ b ] bearing it , then you shall set out from your place and go after it .
NKJV	Joshua	3	2	So it was , ( B ) after three days , that the officers went through the camp ;
NKJV	Joshua	3	4	( E ) Yet there shall be a space between you and it , about two thousand cubits by measure . Do not come near it , that you may know the way by which you must go , for you have not passed this way before. ”
NKJV	Joshua	3	5	And Joshua said to the people , ( F ) “ Sanctify [ c ] yourselves , for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you. ”
NKJV	Joshua	3	6	Then Joshua spoke to the priests , saying , ( G ) “ Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people. ” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people .
NKJV	Joshua	3	7	And the Lord said to Joshua , “ This day I will begin to ( H ) exalt [ d ] you in the sight of all Israel , that they may know that , ( I ) as I was with Moses , so I will be with you .
NKJV	Joshua	3	8	You shall command ( J ) the priests who bear the ark of the covenant , saying , ‘ When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan , ( K ) you shall stand in the Jordan. ’ ”
NKJV	Joshua	3	9	So Joshua said to the children of Israel , “ Come here , and hear the words of the Lord your God. ”
NKJV	Joshua	3	10	And Joshua said , “ By this you shall know that ( L ) the living God is among you , and that He will without fail ( M ) drive out from before you the ( N ) Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites :
NKJV	Joshua	3	11	Behold , the ark of the covenant of ( O ) the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan .
NKJV	Joshua	3	12	Now therefore , ( P ) take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel , one man from every tribe .
NKJV	Joshua	3	13	And it shall come to pass , ( Q ) as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the Lord , ( R ) the Lord of all the earth , shall rest in the waters of the Jordan , that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off , the waters that come down from upstream , and they ( S ) shall stand as a heap. ”
NKJV	Joshua	3	14	So it was , when the people set out from their camp to cross over the Jordan , with the priests bearing the ( T ) ark of the covenant before the people ,
NKJV	Joshua	3	15	and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan , and ( U ) the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water ( for the ( V ) Jordan overflows all its banks ( W ) during the whole time of harvest ) ,
NKJV	Joshua	3	16	that the waters which came down from upstream stood still , and rose in a heap very far away [ e ] at Adam , the city that is beside ( X ) Zaretan . So the waters that went down ( Y ) into the Sea of the Arabah , ( Z ) the Salt Sea , failed , and were cut off ; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho .

NKJV	Joshua	4	4	Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel , one man from every tribe ;
NKJV	Joshua	4	2	( B ) “ Take for yourselves twelve men from the people , one man from every tribe ,
NKJV	Joshua	4	3	and command them , saying , ‘ Take for yourselves twelve stones from here , out of the midst of the Jordan , from the place where ( C ) the priests ’ feet stood firm . You shall carry them over with you and leave them in ( D ) the lodging place where you lodge tonight. ’ ”
NKJV	Joshua	4	5	and Joshua said to them : “ Cross over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan , and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder , according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel ,
NKJV	Joshua	4	6	that this may be ( E ) a sign among you ( F ) when your children ask in time to come , saying , ‘ What do these stones mean to you ? ’
NKJV	Joshua	4	7	Then you shall answer them that ( G ) the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord ; when it crossed over the Jordan , the waters of the Jordan were cut off . And these stones shall be for ( H ) a memorial to the children of Israel forever. ”
NKJV	Joshua	4	8	And the children of Israel did so , just as Joshua commanded , and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan , as the Lord had spoken to Joshua , according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel , and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged , and laid them down there .
NKJV	Joshua	4	9	Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
NKJV	Joshua	4	10	So the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak to the people , according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua ; and the people hurried and crossed over .
NKJV	Joshua	4	11	Then it came to pass , when all the people had completely crossed over , that the ( I ) ark of the Lord and the priests crossed over in the presence of the people .
NKJV	Joshua	4	12	And ( J ) the men of Reuben , the men of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses had spoken to them .
NKJV	Joshua	4	13	About forty thousand [ a ] prepared for war crossed over before the Lord for battle , to the plains of Jericho .
NKJV	Joshua	4	14	On that day the Lord ( K ) exalted [ b ] Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they had feared Moses , all the days of his life .
NKJV	Joshua	4	15	Then the Lord spoke to Joshua , saying ,
NKJV	Joshua	4	16	“ Command the priests who bear ( L ) the ark of the Testimony to come up from the Jordan. ”
NKJV	Joshua	4	17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests , saying , “ Come up from the Jordan. ”
NKJV	Joshua	4	18	And it came to pass , when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord had come from the midst of the Jordan , and the soles of the priests ’ feet touched the dry land , that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place ( M ) and overflowed all its banks as before .
NKJV	Joshua	4	19	Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and they camped ( N ) in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho .
NKJV	Joshua	4	20	And ( O ) those twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan , Joshua set up in Gilgal .
NKJV	Joshua	4	21	Then he spoke to the children of Israel , saying : ( P ) “ When your children ask their fathers in time to come , saying , ‘ What are these stones ? ’
NKJV	Joshua	4	22	then you shall let your children know , saying , ( Q ) ‘ Israel crossed over this Jordan on ( R ) dry land ’ ;
NKJV	Joshua	4	23	for the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over , as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea , ( S ) which He dried up before us until we had crossed over ,
NKJV	Joshua	4	24	( T ) that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the Lord , that it is ( U ) mighty , that you may ( V ) fear the Lord your God [ c ] forever. ” Footnotes - Joshua 4:13 equipped - Joshua 4:14 made Joshua great - Joshua 4:24 Lit . all days Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Joshua	5	5	For all the people who came out had been circumcised , but all the people born in the wilderness , on the way as they came out of Egypt , had not been circumcised .
NKJV	Joshua	5	2	At that time the Lord said to Joshua , “ Make ( D ) flint knives for yourself , and circumcise the sons of Israel again the second time. ”
NKJV	Joshua	5	3	So Joshua made flint knives for himself , and circumcised the sons of Israel at [ c ] the hill of the foreskins .
NKJV	Joshua	5	4	And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them : ( E ) All the people who came out of Egypt who were males , all the men of war , had died in the wilderness on the way , after they had come out of Egypt .
NKJV	Joshua	5	6	For the children of Israel walked ( F ) forty years in the wilderness , till all the people who were men of war , who came out of Egypt , were [ d ] consumed , because they did not obey the voice of the Lord—to whom the Lord swore that ( G ) He would not show them the land which the Lord had sworn to their fathers that He would give us , ( H ) “ a land flowing with milk and honey. ”
NKJV	Joshua	5	7	Then Joshua circumcised ( I ) their sons whom He raised up in their place ; for they were uncircumcised , because they had not been circumcised on the way .
NKJV	Joshua	5	8	So it was , when they had finished circumcising all the people , that they stayed in their places in the camp ( J ) till they were healed .
NKJV	Joshua	5	9	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ This day I have rolled away ( K ) the reproach of Egypt from you. ” Therefore the name of the place is called ( L ) Gilgal [ e ] to this day .
NKJV	Joshua	5	10	Now the children of Israel camped in Gilgal , and kept the Passover ( M ) on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight on the plains of Jericho .
NKJV	Joshua	5	11	And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover , unleavened bread and [ f ] parched grain , on the very same day .
NKJV	Joshua	5	12	Then ( N ) the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land ; and the children of Israel no longer had manna , but they ate the food of the land of Canaan that year . The Commander of the Army of the Lord
NKJV	Joshua	5	13	And it came to pass , when Joshua was by Jericho , that he lifted his eyes and looked , and behold , ( O ) a Man stood opposite him ( P ) with His sword drawn in His hand . And Joshua went to Him and said to Him , “ Are You for us or for our adversaries ? ”
NKJV	Joshua	5	14	So He said , “ No , but as Commander of the army of the Lord I have now come. ” And Joshua ( Q ) fell on his face to the earth and ( R ) worshiped , and said to Him , “ What does my Lord say to His servant ? ”
NKJV	Joshua	5	15	Then the Commander of the Lord ’ s army said to Joshua , ( S ) “ Take your sandal off your foot , for the place where you stand is holy. ” And Joshua did so .

NKJV	Joshua	6	6	Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them , “ Take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams ’ horns before the ark of the Lord. ”
NKJV	Joshua	6	2	And the Lord said to Joshua : “ See ! ( B ) I have given Jericho into your hand , its ( C ) king , and the mighty men of valor .
NKJV	Joshua	6	3	You shall march around the city , all you men of war ; you shall go all around the city once . This you shall do six days .
NKJV	Joshua	6	4	And seven priests shall bear seven ( D ) trumpets of rams ’ horns before the ark . But the seventh day you shall march around the city ( E ) seven times , and ( F ) the priests shall blow the trumpets .
NKJV	Joshua	6	5	It shall come to pass , when they make a long blast with the ram ’ s horn , and when you hear the sound of the trumpet , that all the people shall shout with a great shout ; then the wall of the city will fall down flat . And the people shall go up every man straight before him. ”
NKJV	Joshua	6	7	And he said to the people , “ Proceed , and march around the city , and let him who is armed advance before the ark of the Lord. ”
NKJV	Joshua	6	8	So it was , when Joshua had spoken to the people , that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ’ horns before the Lord advanced and blew the trumpets , and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them .
NKJV	Joshua	6	9	The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets , ( G ) and the rear guard came after the ark , while the priests continued blowing the trumpets .
NKJV	Joshua	6	10	Now Joshua had commanded the people , saying , “ You shall not shout or make any noise with your voice , nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth , until the day I say to you , ‘ Shout ! ’ Then you shall shout. ”
NKJV	Joshua	6	11	So he had ( H ) the ark of the Lord circle the city , going around it once . Then they came into the camp and [ a ] lodged in the camp .
NKJV	Joshua	6	12	And Joshua rose early in the morning , ( I ) and the priests took up the ark of the Lord .
NKJV	Joshua	6	13	Then seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams ’ horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets . And the armed men went before them . But the rear guard came after the ark of the Lord , while the priests continued blowing the trumpets .
NKJV	Joshua	6	14	And the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp . So they did six days .
NKJV	Joshua	6	15	But it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early , about the dawning of the day , and marched around the city seven times in the same manner . On that day only they marched around the city seven times .
NKJV	Joshua	6	16	And the seventh time it happened , when the priests blew the trumpets , that Joshua said to the people : “ Shout , for the Lord has given you the city !
NKJV	Joshua	6	17	Now the city shall be ( J ) doomed by the Lord to destruction , it and all who are in it . Only ( K ) Rahab the harlot shall live , she and all who are with her in the house , because ( L ) she hid the messengers that we sent .
NKJV	Joshua	6	18	And you , ( M ) by all means abstain from the accursed things , lest you become accursed when you take of the accursed things , and make the camp of Israel a curse , ( N ) and trouble it .
NKJV	Joshua	6	19	But all the silver and gold , and vessels of bronze and iron , are [ b ] consecrated to the Lord ; they [ c ] shall come into the treasury of the Lord. ”
NKJV	Joshua	6	20	So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets . And it happened when the people heard the sound of the trumpet , and the people shouted with a great shout , that ( O ) the wall fell down flat . Then the people went up into the city , every man straight before him , and they took the city .
NKJV	Joshua	6	21	And they ( P ) utterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , young and old , ox and sheep and donkey , with the edge of the sword .
NKJV	Joshua	6	22	But Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the country , “ Go into the harlot ’ s house , and from there bring out the woman and all that she has , ( Q ) as you swore to her. ”
NKJV	Joshua	6	23	And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab , ( R ) her father , her mother , her brothers , and all that she had . So they brought out all her relatives and left them outside the camp of Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	6	24	But they burned the city and all that was in it with fire . Only the silver and gold , and the vessels of bronze and iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord .
NKJV	Joshua	6	25	And Joshua spared Rahab the harlot , her father ’ s household , and all that she had . So ( S ) she dwells in Israel to this day , because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
NKJV	Joshua	6	26	Then Joshua [ d ] charged them at that time , saying , ( T ) “ Cursed be the man before the Lord who rises up and builds this city Jericho ; he shall lay its foundation with his firstborn , and with his youngest he shall set up its gates. ”
NKJV	Joshua	6	27	So the Lord was with Joshua , and his fame spread throughout all the country . Footnotes - Joshua 6:11 spent the night - Joshua 6:19 set apart - Joshua 6:19 shall go - Joshua 6:26 warned Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Joshua	7	7	And Joshua said , “ Alas , Lord [ e ] God , ( H ) why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all—to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us ? Oh , that we had been content , and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan !
NKJV	Joshua	7	2	Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is beside Beth Aven , on the east side of Bethel , and spoke to them , saying , “ Go up and spy out the country. ” So the men went up and spied out Ai .
NKJV	Joshua	7	3	And they returned to Joshua and said to him , “ Do not let all the people go up , but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai . Do not weary all the people there , for the people of Ai are few. ”
NKJV	Joshua	7	4	So about three thousand men went up there from the people , ( D ) but they fled before the men of Ai .
NKJV	Joshua	7	5	And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men , for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim , and struck them down on the descent ; therefore ( E ) the [ d ] hearts of the people melted and became like water .
NKJV	Joshua	7	6	Then Joshua ( F ) tore his clothes , and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord until evening , he and the elders of Israel ; and they ( G ) put dust on their heads .
NKJV	Joshua	7	8	O Lord , what shall I say when Israel turns its [ f ] back before its enemies ?
NKJV	Joshua	7	9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear it , and surround us , and ( I ) cut off our name from the earth . Then ( J ) what will You do for Your great name ? ” The Sin of Achan
NKJV	Joshua	7	10	So the Lord said to Joshua : “ Get up ! Why do you lie thus on your face ?
NKJV	Joshua	7	11	Israel has sinned , and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them . ( K ) For they have even taken some of the [ g ] accursed things , and have both stolen and ( L ) deceived ; and they have also put it among their own stuff .
NKJV	Joshua	7	12	( M ) Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies , but turned their backs before their enemies , because ( N ) they have become doomed to destruction . Neither will I be with you anymore , unless you destroy the accursed from among you .
NKJV	Joshua	7	13	Get up , ( O ) sanctify [ h ] the people , and say , ( P ) ‘ Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow , because thus says the Lord God of Israel : “ There is an accursed thing in your midst , O Israel ; you can not stand before your enemies until you take away the accursed thing from among you. ”
NKJV	Joshua	7	14	In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes . And it shall be that the tribe which ( Q ) the Lord takes shall come according to families ; and the family which the Lord takes shall come by households ; and the household which the Lord takes shall come man by man .
NKJV	Joshua	7	15	( R ) Then it shall be that he who is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire , he and all that he has , because he has ( S ) transgressed [ i ] the covenant of the Lord , and because he ( T ) has done a disgraceful thing in Israel. ’ ”
NKJV	Joshua	7	16	So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes , and the tribe of Judah was taken .
NKJV	Joshua	7	17	He brought the clan of Judah , and he took the family of the Zarhites ; and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man , and Zabdi was taken .
NKJV	Joshua	7	18	Then he brought his household man by man , and Achan the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , ( U ) was taken .
NKJV	Joshua	7	19	Now Joshua said to Achan , “ My son , I beg you , ( V ) give glory to the Lord God of Israel , ( W ) and make confession to Him , and ( X ) tell me now what you have done ; do not hide it from me. ”
NKJV	Joshua	7	20	And Achan answered Joshua and said , “ Indeed ( Y ) I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel , and this is what I have done :
NKJV	Joshua	7	21	When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment , two hundred shekels of silver , and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels , I [ j ] coveted them and took them . And there they are , hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent , with the silver under it. ”
NKJV	Joshua	7	22	So Joshua sent messengers , and they ran to the tent ; and there it was , hidden in his tent , with the silver under it .
NKJV	Joshua	7	23	And they took them from the midst of the tent , brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
NKJV	Joshua	7	24	Then Joshua , and all Israel with him , took Achan the son of Zerah , the silver , the garment , the wedge of gold , his sons , his daughters , his oxen , his donkeys , his sheep , his tent , and ( Z ) all that he had , and they brought them to ( AA ) the Valley of Achor .
NKJV	Joshua	7	25	And Joshua said , ( AB ) “ Why have you troubled us ? The Lord will trouble you this day. ” ( AC ) So all Israel stoned him with stones ; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones .
NKJV	Joshua	7	26	Then they ( AD ) raised over him a great heap of stones , still there to this day . So ( AE ) the Lord turned from the fierceness of His anger . Therefore the name of that place has been called ( AF ) the Valley of [ k ] Achor to this day . Footnotes - Joshua 7:1 acted unfaithfully - Joshua 7:1 devoted - Joshua 7:1 Zimri ,

NKJV	Joshua	8	8	And it will be , when you have taken the city , that you shall set the city on fire . According to the commandment of the Lord you shall do . ( G ) See , I have commanded you. ”
NKJV	Joshua	8	2	And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to ( C ) Jericho and its king . Only ( D ) its spoil and its cattle you shall take as booty for yourselves . Lay an ambush for the city behind it. ”
NKJV	Joshua	8	3	So Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up against Ai ; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them away by night .
NKJV	Joshua	8	4	And he commanded them , saying : “ Behold , ( E ) you shall lie in ambush against the city , behind the city . Do not go very far from the city , but all of you be ready .
NKJV	Joshua	8	5	Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city ; and it will come about , when they come out against us as at the first , that ( F ) we shall flee before them .
NKJV	Joshua	8	6	For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city , for they will say , ‘ They are fleeing before us as at the first. ’ Therefore we will flee before them .
NKJV	Joshua	8	7	Then you shall rise from the ambush and seize the city , for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand .
NKJV	Joshua	8	9	Joshua therefore sent them out ; and they went to lie in ambush , and stayed between Bethel and Ai , on the west side of Ai ; but Joshua lodged that night among the people .
NKJV	Joshua	8	10	Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people , and went up , he and the elders of Israel , before the people to Ai .
NKJV	Joshua	8	11	( H ) And all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near ; and they came before the city and camped on the north side of Ai . Now a valley lay between them and Ai .
NKJV	Joshua	8	12	So he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai , on the west side of [ a ] the city .
NKJV	Joshua	8	13	And when they had set the people , all the army that was on the north of the city , and its rear guard on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
NKJV	Joshua	8	14	Now it happened , when the king of Ai saw it , that the men of the city hurried and rose early and went out against Israel to battle , he and all his people , at an appointed place before the plain . But he ( I ) did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city .
NKJV	Joshua	8	15	And Joshua and all Israel ( J ) made as if they were beaten before them , and fled by the way of the wilderness .
NKJV	Joshua	8	16	So all the people who were in Ai were called together to pursue them . And they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city .
NKJV	Joshua	8	17	There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel . So they left the city open and pursued Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	8	18	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai , for I will give it into your hand. ” And Joshua stretched out the spear that was in his hand toward the city .
NKJV	Joshua	8	19	So those in ambush arose quickly out of their place ; they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and they entered the city and took it , and hurried to set the city on fire .
NKJV	Joshua	8	20	And when the men of Ai looked behind them , they saw , and behold , the smoke of the city ascended to heaven . So they had no power to flee this way or that way , and the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers .
NKJV	Joshua	8	21	Now when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended , they turned back and struck down the men of Ai .
NKJV	Joshua	8	22	Then the others came out of the city against them ; so they were caught in the midst of Israel , some on this side and some on that side . And they struck them down , so that they ( K ) let none of them remain or escape .
NKJV	Joshua	8	23	But the king of Ai they took alive , and brought him to Joshua .
NKJV	Joshua	8	24	And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field , in the wilderness where they pursued them , and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed , that all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword .
NKJV	Joshua	8	25	So it was that all who fell that day , both men and women , were twelve thousand—all the people of Ai .
NKJV	Joshua	8	26	For Joshua did not draw back his hand , with which he stretched out the spear , until he had ( L ) utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
NKJV	Joshua	8	27	( M ) Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves , according to the word of the Lord which He had ( N ) commanded Joshua .
NKJV	Joshua	8	28	So Joshua burned Ai and made it ( O ) a heap forever , a desolation to this day .
NKJV	Joshua	8	29	( P ) And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening . ( Q ) And as soon as the sun was down , Joshua commanded that they should take his corpse down from the tree , cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city , and ( R ) raise over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day . Joshua Renews the Covenant ( S )
NKJV	Joshua	8	30	Now Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel ( T ) in Mount Ebal ,
NKJV	Joshua	8	31	as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses : ( U ) “ an altar of whole stones over which no man has wielded an iron tool. ” And ( V ) they offered on it burnt offerings to the Lord , and sacrificed peace offerings .
NKJV	Joshua	8	32	And there , in the presence of the children of Israel , ( W ) he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he had written .
NKJV	Joshua	8	33	Then all Israel , with their elders and officers and judges , stood on either side of the ark before the priests , the Levites , ( X ) who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord , ( Y ) the stranger as well as he who was born among them . Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal , ( Z ) as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before , that they should bless the people of Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	8	34	And afterward ( AA ) he read all the words of the law , ( AB ) the blessings and the cursings , according to all that is written in the ( AC ) Book of the Law .
NKJV	Joshua	8	35	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel , ( AD ) with the women , the little ones , ( AE ) and the strangers who were living among them .

NKJV	Joshua	9	9	So they said to him : ( K ) “ From a very far country your servants have come , because of the name of the Lord your God ; for we have ( L ) heard of His fame , and all that He did in Egypt ,
NKJV	Joshua	9	2	that they ( D ) gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one [ a ] accord .
NKJV	Joshua	9	3	But when the inhabitants of ( E ) Gibeon ( F ) heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai ,
NKJV	Joshua	9	4	they worked craftily , and went and [ b ] pretended to be ambassadors . And they took old sacks on their donkeys , old wineskins torn and [ c ] mended ,
NKJV	Joshua	9	5	old and patched sandals on their feet , and old garments on themselves ; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy .
NKJV	Joshua	9	6	And they went to Joshua , ( G ) to the camp at Gilgal , and said to him and to the men of Israel , “ We have come from a far country ; now therefore , make a [ d ] covenant with us. ”
NKJV	Joshua	9	7	Then the men of Israel said to the ( H ) Hivites , “ Perhaps you dwell among us ; so ( I ) how can we make a covenant with you ? ”
NKJV	Joshua	9	8	But they said to Joshua , ( J ) “ We are your servants. ” And Joshua said to them , “ Who are you , and where do you come from ? ”
NKJV	Joshua	9	10	and ( M ) all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan—to Sihon king of Heshbon , and Og king of Bashan , who was at Ashtaroth .
NKJV	Joshua	9	11	Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us , saying , ‘ Take provisions with you for the journey , and go to meet them , and say to them , “ We are your servants ; now therefore , make a covenant with us. ” ’
NKJV	Joshua	9	12	This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you . But now look , it is dry and moldy .
NKJV	Joshua	9	13	And these wineskins which we filled were new , and see , they are torn ; and these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey. ”
NKJV	Joshua	9	14	Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions ; ( N ) but they [ e ] did not ask counsel of the Lord .
NKJV	Joshua	9	15	So Joshua ( O ) made peace with them , and made a covenant with them to let them live ; and the rulers of the congregation swore to them .
NKJV	Joshua	9	16	And it happened at the end of three days , after they had made a covenant with them , that they heard that they were their neighbors who dwelt near them .
NKJV	Joshua	9	17	Then the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day . Now their cities were ( P ) Gibeon , Chephirah , Beeroth , and Kirjath Jearim .
NKJV	Joshua	9	18	But the children of Israel did not [ f ] attack them , ( Q ) because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel . And all the congregation complained against the rulers .
NKJV	Joshua	9	19	Then all the rulers said to all the congregation , “ We have sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel ; now therefore , we may not touch them .
NKJV	Joshua	9	20	This we will do to them : We will let them live , lest ( R ) wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them. ”
NKJV	Joshua	9	21	And the rulers said to them , “ Let them live , but let them be ( S ) woodcutters and water carriers for all the congregation , as the rulers had ( T ) promised them. ”
NKJV	Joshua	9	22	Then Joshua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying , “ Why have you deceived us , saying , ( U ) ‘ We are very far from you , ’ when ( V ) you dwell near us ?
NKJV	Joshua	9	23	Now therefore , you are ( W ) cursed , and none of you shall be freed from being slaves—woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God. ”
NKJV	Joshua	9	24	So they answered Joshua and said , “ Because your servants were clearly told that the Lord your God ( X ) commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land , and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you ; therefore ( Y ) we were very much afraid for our lives because of you , and have done this thing .
NKJV	Joshua	9	25	And now , here we are , ( Z ) in your hands ; do with us as it seems good and right to do to us. ”
NKJV	Joshua	9	26	So he did to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , so that they did not kill them .
NKJV	Joshua	9	27	And that day Joshua made them ( AA ) woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord , ( AB ) in the place which He would choose , even to this day .

NKJV	Joshua	10	10	So the Lord ( O ) routed them before Israel , killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , chased them along the road that goes ( P ) to Beth Horon , and struck them down as far as ( Q ) Azekah and Makkedah .
NKJV	Joshua	10	2	that they ( F ) feared greatly , because Gibeon was a great city , like one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than Ai , and all its men were mighty .
NKJV	Joshua	10	3	Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron , Piram king of Jarmuth , Japhia king of Lachish , and Debir king of Eglon , saying ,
NKJV	Joshua	10	4	“ Come up to me and help me , that we may attack Gibeon , for ( G ) it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. ”
NKJV	Joshua	10	5	Therefore the five kings of the ( H ) Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon , ( I ) gathered together and went up , they and all their armies , and camped before Gibeon and made war against it .
NKJV	Joshua	10	6	And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp ( J ) at Gilgal , saying , “ Do not forsake your servants ; come up to us quickly , save us and help us , for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us. ”
NKJV	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua ascended from Gilgal , he and ( K ) all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valor .
NKJV	Joshua	10	8	And the Lord said to Joshua , ( L ) “ Do not fear them , for I have delivered them into your hand ; ( M ) not a man of them shall ( N ) stand before you. ”
NKJV	Joshua	10	9	Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly , having marched all night from Gilgal .
NKJV	Joshua	10	11	And it happened , as they fled before Israel and were on the descent of Beth Horon , ( R ) that the Lord cast down large hailstones from heaven on them as far as Azekah , and they died . There were more who died from the hailstones than the children of Israel killed with the sword .
NKJV	Joshua	10	12	Then Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel , and he said in the sight of Israel : ( S ) “ Sun , stand still over Gibeon ; And Moon , in the Valley of ( T ) Aijalon. ”
NKJV	Joshua	10	13	So the sun stood still , And the moon stopped , Till the people had revenge Upon their enemies . ( U ) Is this not written in the Book of Jasher ? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven , and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day .
NKJV	Joshua	10	14	And there has been ( V ) no day like that , before it or after it , that the Lord heeded the voice of a man ; for ( W ) the Lord fought for Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	10	15	( X ) Then Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to the camp at Gilgal . The Amorite Kings Executed
NKJV	Joshua	10	16	But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah .
NKJV	Joshua	10	17	And it was told Joshua , saying , “ The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah. ”
NKJV	Joshua	10	18	So Joshua said , “ Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave , and set men by it to guard them .
NKJV	Joshua	10	19	And do not stay there yourselves , but pursue your enemies , and attack their rear guard . Do not allow them to enter their cities , for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hand. ”
NKJV	Joshua	10	20	Then it happened , while Joshua and the children of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter , till they had finished , that those who escaped entered fortified cities .
NKJV	Joshua	10	21	And all the people returned to the camp , to Joshua at Makkedah , in peace . ( Y ) No one [ a ] moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	10	22	Then Joshua said , “ Open the mouth of the cave , and bring out those five kings to me from the cave. ”
NKJV	Joshua	10	23	And they did so , and brought out those five kings to him from the cave : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
NKJV	Joshua	10	24	So it was , when they brought out those kings to Joshua , that Joshua called for all the men of Israel , and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him , “ Come near , put your feet on the necks of these kings. ” And they drew near and ( Z ) put their feet on their necks .
NKJV	Joshua	10	25	Then Joshua said to [ b ] them , ( AA ) “ Do not be afraid , nor be dismayed ; be strong and of good courage , for ( AB ) thus the Lord will do to all your enemies against whom you fight. ”
NKJV	Joshua	10	26	And afterward Joshua struck [ c ] them and killed them , and hanged them on five trees ; and they ( AC ) were hanging on the trees until evening .
NKJV	Joshua	10	27	So it was at the time of the going down of the sun that Joshua commanded , and they ( AD ) took them down from the trees , cast them into the cave where they had been hidden , and laid large stones against the cave ’ s mouth , which remain until this very day . Conquest of the Southland
NKJV	Joshua	10	28	On that day Joshua took Makkedah , and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword . He utterly ( AE ) destroyed [ d ] them—all the people who were in it . He let none remain . He also did to the king of Makkedah ( AF ) as he had done to the king of Jericho .
NKJV	Joshua	10	29	Then Joshua passed from Makkedah , and all Israel with him , to ( AG ) Libnah ; and they fought against Libnah .
NKJV	Joshua	10	30	And the Lord also delivered it and its king into the hand of Israel ; he struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword . He let none remain in it , but did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho .
NKJV	Joshua	10	31	Then Joshua passed from Libnah , and all Israel with him , to Lachish ; and they encamped against it and fought against it .
NKJV	Joshua	10	32	And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel , who took it on the second day , and struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
NKJV	Joshua	10	33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish ; and Joshua struck him and his people , until he left him none remaining .
NKJV	Joshua	10	34	From Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon , and all Israel with him ; and they encamped against it and fought against it .
NKJV	Joshua	10	35	They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword ; all the people who were in it he utterly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
NKJV	Joshua	10	36	So Joshua went up from Eglon , and all Israel with him , to ( AH ) Hebron ; and they fought against it .
NKJV	Joshua	10	37	And they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword—its king , all its cities , and all the people who were in it ; he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon , but utterly destroyed it and all the people who were in it .
NKJV	Joshua	10	38	Then Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to ( AI ) Debir ; and they fought against it .
NKJV	Joshua	10	39	And he took it and its king and all its cities ; they struck them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the people who were in it . He left none remaining ; as he had done to Hebron , so he did to Debir and its king , as he had done also to Libnah and its king .
NKJV	Joshua	10	40	So Joshua conquered all the land : the ( AJ ) mountain country and the [ e ] South and the lowland and the wilderness slopes , and ( AK ) all their kings ; he left none remaining , but ( AL ) utterly destroyed all that breathed , as the Lord God of Israel had commanded .
NKJV	Joshua	10	41	And Joshua conquered them from ( AM ) Kadesh Barnea as far as ( AN ) Gaza , ( AO ) and all the country of Goshen , even as far as Gibeon .
NKJV	Joshua	10	42	All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time , ( AP ) because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	10	43	Then Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to the camp at Gilgal .

NKJV	Joshua	11	11	And they struck all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword , ( N ) utterly destroying them . There was none left ( O ) breathing . Then he burned Hazor with fire .
NKJV	Joshua	11	2	and to the kings who were from the north , in the mountains , in the plain south of ( C ) Chinneroth , in the lowland , and in the heights ( D ) of Dor on the west ,
NKJV	Joshua	11	3	to the Canaanites in the east and in the west , the ( E ) Amorite , the Hittite , the Perizzite , the Jebusite in the mountains , ( F ) and the Hivite below ( G ) Hermon ( H ) in the land of Mizpah .
NKJV	Joshua	11	4	So they went out , they and all their armies with them , as many people ( I ) as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude , with very many horses and chariots .
NKJV	Joshua	11	5	And when all these kings had [ a ] met together , they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	11	6	But the Lord said to Joshua , ( J ) “ Do not be afraid because of them , for tomorrow about this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel . You shall ( K ) hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire. ”
NKJV	Joshua	11	7	So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom , and they attacked them .
NKJV	Joshua	11	8	And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel , who defeated them and chased them to [ b ] Greater ( L ) Sidon , to the [ c ] Brook ( M ) Misrephoth , and to the Valley of Mizpah eastward ; they attacked them until they left none of them remaining .
NKJV	Joshua	11	9	So Joshua did to them as the Lord had told him : he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire .
NKJV	Joshua	11	10	Joshua turned back at that time and took Hazor , and struck its king with the sword ; for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms .
NKJV	Joshua	11	12	So all the cities of those kings , and all their kings , Joshua took and struck with the edge of the sword . He utterly destroyed them , ( P ) as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded .
NKJV	Joshua	11	13	But as for the cities that stood on their [ d ] mounds , Israel burned none of them , except Hazor only , which Joshua burned .
NKJV	Joshua	11	14	And all the ( Q ) spoil of these cities and the livestock , the children of Israel took as booty for themselves ; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them , and they left none breathing .
NKJV	Joshua	11	15	( R ) As the Lord had commanded Moses His servant , so ( S ) Moses commanded Joshua , and ( T ) so Joshua did . [ e ] He left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses . Summary of Joshua ’ s Conquests
NKJV	Joshua	11	16	Thus Joshua took all this land : ( U ) the mountain country , all the South , ( V ) all the land of Goshen , the lowland , and the Jordan [ f ] plain—the mountains of Israel and its lowlands ,
NKJV	Joshua	11	17	( W ) from [ g ] Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir , even as far as Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon . He captured ( X ) all their kings , and struck them down and killed them .
NKJV	Joshua	11	18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings .
NKJV	Joshua	11	19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , except ( Y ) the Hivites , the inhabitants of Gibeon . All the others they took in battle .
NKJV	Joshua	11	20	For ( Z ) it was of the Lord [ h ] to harden their hearts , that they should come against Israel in battle , that He might utterly destroy them , and that they might receive no mercy , but that He might destroy them , ( AA ) as the Lord had commanded Moses .
NKJV	Joshua	11	21	And at that time Joshua came and cut off ( AB ) the Anakim from the mountains : from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , from all the mountains of Judah , and from all the mountains of Israel ; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities .
NKJV	Joshua	11	22	None of the Anakim were left in the land of the children of Israel ; they remained only ( AC ) in Gaza , in Gath , ( AD ) and in Ashdod .
NKJV	Joshua	11	23	So Joshua took the whole land , ( AE ) according to all that the Lord had said to Moses ; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel ( AF ) according to their divisions by their tribes .

NKJV	Joshua	13	13	Nevertheless the children of Israel ( V ) did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maachathites , but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day .

NKJV	Joshua	14	14	( X ) Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day , because he ( Y ) wholly followed the Lord God of Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	14	2	Their inheritance was ( B ) by lot , as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses , for the nine tribes and the half-tribe .
NKJV	Joshua	14	3	( C ) For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe on the other side of the Jordan ; but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them .
NKJV	Joshua	14	4	For ( D ) the children of Joseph were two tribes : Manasseh and Ephraim . And they gave no part to the Levites in the land , except ( E ) cities to dwell in , with their common-lands for their livestock and their property .
NKJV	Joshua	14	5	( F ) As the Lord had commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did ; and they divided the land . Caleb Inherits Hebron
NKJV	Joshua	14	6	Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal . And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the ( G ) Kenizzite said to him : “ You know ( H ) the word which the Lord said to Moses the man of God concerning ( I ) you and me in Kadesh Barnea .
NKJV	Joshua	14	7	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord ( J ) sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land , and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart .
NKJV	Joshua	14	8	Nevertheless ( K ) my brethren who went up with me made the [ a ] heart of the people melt , but I wholly ( L ) followed the Lord my God .
NKJV	Joshua	14	9	So Moses swore on that day , saying , ( M ) ‘ Surely the land ( N ) where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and your children ’ s forever , because you have wholly followed the Lord my God. ’
NKJV	Joshua	14	10	And now , behold , the Lord has kept me ( O ) alive , ( P ) as He said , these forty-five years , ever since the Lord spoke this word to Moses while Israel [ b ] wandered in the wilderness ; and now , here I am this day , eighty-five years old .
NKJV	Joshua	14	11	( Q ) As yet I am as strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me ; just as my strength was then , so now is my strength for war , both ( R ) for going out and for coming in .
NKJV	Joshua	14	12	Now therefore , give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day ; for you heard in that day how ( S ) the Anakim were there , and that the cities were great and fortified . ( T ) It may be that the Lord will be with me , and ( U ) I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said. ”
NKJV	Joshua	14	13	And Joshua ( V ) blessed him , ( W ) and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance .

NKJV	Joshua	17	17	And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—saying , “ You are a great people and have great power ; you shall not have only one [ f ] lot ,
NKJV	Joshua	17	2	And there was a lot for ( D ) the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families : ( E ) for the children of [ a ] Abiezer , the children of Helek , ( F ) the children of Asriel , the children of Shechem , ( G ) the children of Hepher , and the children of Shemida ; these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families .
NKJV	Joshua	17	3	But ( H ) Zelophehad the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but only daughters . And these are the names of his daughters : Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
NKJV	Joshua	17	4	And they came near before ( I ) Eleazar the priest , before Joshua the son of Nun , and before the rulers , saying , ( J ) “ The Lord commanded Moses to give us an [ b ] inheritance among our brothers. ” Therefore , according to the commandment of the Lord , he gave them an inheritance among their father ’ s brothers .
NKJV	Joshua	17	5	Ten shares fell to ( K ) Manasseh , besides the land of Gilead and Bashan , which were on the other side of the Jordan ,
NKJV	Joshua	17	6	because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons ; and the rest of Manasseh ’ s sons had the land of Gilead .
NKJV	Joshua	17	7	And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to ( L ) Michmethath , that lies east of Shechem ; and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah .
NKJV	Joshua	17	8	Manasseh had the land of Tappuah , but ( M ) Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim .
NKJV	Joshua	17	9	And the [ c ] border descended to the [ d ] Brook Kanah , southward to the brook . ( N ) These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh . The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook ; and it ended at the sea .
NKJV	Joshua	17	10	Southward it was Ephraim ’ s , northward it was Manasseh ’ s , and the sea was its border . Manasseh ’ s territory was adjoining Asher on the north and Issachar on the east .
NKJV	Joshua	17	11	And in Issachar and in Asher , ( O ) Manasseh had ( P ) Beth Shean and its towns , Ibleam and its towns , the inhabitants of Dor and its towns , the inhabitants of En Dor and its towns , the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns—three hilly regions .
NKJV	Joshua	17	12	Yet ( Q ) the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities , but the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land .
NKJV	Joshua	17	13	And it happened , when the children of Israel grew strong , that they put the Canaanites to ( R ) forced labor , but did not utterly drive them out . More Land for Ephraim and Manasseh
NKJV	Joshua	17	14	( S ) Then the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua , saying , “ Why have you given us only ( T ) one [ e ] lot and one share to inherit , since we are ( U ) a great people , inasmuch as the Lord has blessed us until now ? ”
NKJV	Joshua	17	15	So Joshua answered them , “ If you are a great people , then go up to the forest country and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the giants , since the mountains of Ephraim are too confined for you. ”
NKJV	Joshua	17	16	But the children of Joseph said , “ The mountain country is not enough for us ; and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have ( V ) chariots of iron , both those who are of Beth Shean and its towns and those who are ( W ) of the Valley of Jezreel. ”
NKJV	Joshua	17	18	but the mountain country shall be yours . Although it is wooded , you shall cut it down , and its [ g ] farthest extent shall be yours ; for you shall drive out the Canaanites , ( X ) though they have iron chariots and are strong. ” Footnotes - Joshua 17:2 Jeezer , Num . 26:30 - Joshua 17:4 possession - Joshua 17:9 boundary - Joshua 17:9 Wadi - Joshua 17:14 allotment - Joshua 17:17 allotment - Joshua 17:18 Lit . goings out Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Joshua	18	18	Then it passed along toward the north side of [ g ] Arabah , and went down to Arabah .
NKJV	Joshua	18	2	But there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance .
NKJV	Joshua	18	3	Then Joshua said to the children of Israel : ( C ) “ How long will you neglect to go and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers has given you ?
NKJV	Joshua	18	4	Pick out from among you three men for each tribe , and I will send them ; they shall rise and go through the land , survey it according to their inheritance , and come back to me .
NKJV	Joshua	18	5	And they shall divide it into seven parts . ( D ) Judah shall remain in their territory on the south , and the ( E ) house of Joseph shall remain in their territory on the north .
NKJV	Joshua	18	6	You shall therefore [ a ] survey the land in seven parts and bring the survey here to me , ( F ) that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord our God .
NKJV	Joshua	18	7	( G ) But the Levites have no part among you , for the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance . ( H ) And Gad , Reuben , and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan on the east , which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them. ”
NKJV	Joshua	18	8	Then the men arose to go away ; and Joshua charged those who went to [ b ] survey the land , saying , “ Go , walk ( I ) through the land , survey it , and come back to me , that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord in Shiloh. ”
NKJV	Joshua	18	9	So the men went , passed through the land , and [ c ] wrote the survey in a book in seven parts by cities ; and they came to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh .
NKJV	Joshua	18	10	Then Joshua cast ( J ) lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord , and there ( K ) Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their [ d ] divisions . The Land of Benjamin

NKJV	Joshua	18	14	Then the border extended around the west side to the south , from the hill that lies before Beth Horon southward ; and [ e ] it ended at ( P ) Kirjath Baal ( which is Kirjath Jearim ) , a city of the children of Judah . This was the west side .

NKJV	Joshua	20	4	And when he flees to one of those cities , and stands at the entrance of the gate of the city , and [ b ] declares his case in the hearing of the elders of that city , they shall take him into the city as one of them , and give him a place , that he may dwell among them .
NKJV	Joshua	20	5	( C ) Then if the avenger of blood pursues him , they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand , because he struck his neighbor unintentionally , but did not hate him beforehand .
NKJV	Joshua	20	6	And he shall dwell in that city ( D ) until he stands before the congregation for judgment , and until the death of the one who is high priest in those days . Then the slayer may return and come to his own city and his own house , to the city from which he fled. ’ ”
NKJV	Joshua	20	7	So they appointed ( E ) Kedesh in Galilee , in the mountains of Naphtali , ( F ) Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim , and ( G ) Kirjath Arba ( which is Hebron ) in ( H ) the mountains of Judah .
NKJV	Joshua	20	8	And on the other side of the Jordan , by Jericho eastward , they assigned ( I ) Bezer in the wilderness on the plain , from the tribe of Reuben , ( J ) Ramoth in Gilead , from the tribe of Gad , and ( K ) Golan in Bashan , from the tribe of Manasseh .
NKJV	Joshua	20	9	( L ) These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel and for the stranger who [ c ] dwelt among them , that whoever killed a person accidentally might flee there , and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood ( M ) until he stood before the congregation .

NKJV	Joshua	21	21	For they gave them ( AE ) Shechem with its common-land in the mountains of Ephraim ( a city of refuge for the slayer ) , ( AF ) Gezer with its common-land ,
NKJV	Joshua	21	2	And they spoke to them at ( D ) Shiloh in the land of Canaan , saying , ( E ) “ The Lord commanded through Moses to give us cities to dwell in , with their common-lands for our livestock. ”
NKJV	Joshua	21	3	So the children of Israel gave to the Levites from their inheritance , at the commandment of the Lord , these cities and their common-lands :
NKJV	Joshua	21	4	Now the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites . And ( F ) the children of Aaron the priest , who were of the Levites , ( G ) had thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah , from the tribe of Simeon , and from the tribe of Benjamin .

NKJV	Joshua	21	8	( K ) And the children of Israel gave these cities with their common-lands by lot to the Levites , ( L ) as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses .
NKJV	Joshua	21	9	So they gave from the tribe of the children of Judah and from the tribe of the children of Simeon these cities which are [ a ] designated by name ,
NKJV	Joshua	21	10	which were for the children of Aaron , one of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi ; for the lot was theirs first .
NKJV	Joshua	21	11	( M ) And they gave them [ b ] Kirjath Arba ( Arba was the father of ( N ) Anak ) , ( O ) which is Hebron , in the mountains of Judah , with the common-land surrounding it .

NKJV	Joshua	21	40	So all the cities for the children of Merari according to their families , the rest of the families of the Levites , were by their lot twelve cities .
NKJV	Joshua	21	41	( AN ) All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities with their common-lands .
NKJV	Joshua	21	42	Every one of these cities had its common-land surrounding it ; thus were all these cities . The Promise Fulfilled
NKJV	Joshua	21	43	So the Lord gave to Israel ( AO ) all the land of which He had sworn to give to their fathers , and they ( AP ) took possession of it and dwelt in it .
NKJV	Joshua	21	44	( AQ ) The Lord gave them ( AR ) rest all around , according to all that He had sworn to their fathers . And ( AS ) not a man of all their enemies stood against them ; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand .

NKJV	Joshua	22	22	“ The Lord ( V ) God of gods , the Lord God of gods , He ( W ) knows , and let Israel itself know—if it is in rebellion , or if in treachery against the Lord , do not save us this day .
NKJV	Joshua	22	2	and said to them : “ You have kept ( A ) all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , ( B ) and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you .
NKJV	Joshua	22	3	You have not [ a ] left your brethren these many days , up to this day , but have kept the charge of the commandment of the Lord your God .
NKJV	Joshua	22	4	And now the Lord your God has given ( C ) rest to your brethren , as He promised them ; now therefore , return and go to your tents and to the land of your possession , ( D ) which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the other side of the Jordan .
NKJV	Joshua	22	5	But ( E ) take [ b ] careful heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , ( F ) to love the Lord your God , to walk in all His ways , to keep His commandments , to hold fast to Him , and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul. ”
NKJV	Joshua	22	6	So Joshua ( G ) blessed them and sent them away , and they went to their tents .
NKJV	Joshua	22	7	Now to half the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan , ( H ) but to the other half of it Joshua gave a possession among their brethren on this side of the Jordan , westward . And indeed , when Joshua sent them away to their tents , he blessed them ,
NKJV	Joshua	22	8	and spoke to them , saying , “ Return with much riches to your tents , with very much livestock , with silver , with gold , with bronze , with iron , and with very much clothing . ( I ) Divide the [ c ] spoil of your enemies with your brethren. ”
NKJV	Joshua	22	9	So the children of Reuben , the children of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh returned , and departed from the children of Israel at Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan , to go to ( J ) the country of Gilead , to the land of their possession , which they had obtained according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses . An Altar by the Jordan
NKJV	Joshua	22	10	And when they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben , the children of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan—a great , impressive altar .
NKJV	Joshua	22	11	Now the children of Israel ( K ) heard someone say , “ Behold , the children of Reuben , the children of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the [ d ] frontier of the land of Canaan , in the region of the Jordan—on the children of Israel ’ s side. ”
NKJV	Joshua	22	12	And when the children of Israel heard of it , ( L ) the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered together at Shiloh to go to war against them .
NKJV	Joshua	22	13	Then the children of Israel ( M ) sent ( N ) Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the children of Reuben , to the children of Gad , and to half the tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead ,
NKJV	Joshua	22	14	and with him ten rulers , one ruler each from the chief house of every tribe of Israel ; and ( O ) each one was the head of the house of his father among the [ e ] divisions of Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	22	15	Then they came to the children of Reuben , to the children of Gad , and to half the tribe of Manasseh , to the land of Gilead , and they spoke with them , saying ,
NKJV	Joshua	22	16	“ Thus says the whole congregation of the Lord : ‘ What ( P ) treachery [ f ] is this that you have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that you have built for yourselves an altar , ( Q ) that you might rebel this day against the Lord ?
NKJV	Joshua	22	17	Is the iniquity ( R ) of Peor not enough for us , from which we are not cleansed till this day , although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord ,
NKJV	Joshua	22	18	but that you must turn away this day from following the Lord ? And it shall be , if you rebel today against the Lord , that tomorrow ( S ) He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	22	19	[ g ] Nevertheless , if the land of your possession is unclean , then cross over to the land of the possession of the Lord , ( T ) where the Lord ’ s tabernacle stands , and take possession among us ; but do not rebel against the Lord , nor rebel against us , by building yourselves an altar besides the altar of the Lord our God .
NKJV	Joshua	22	20	( U ) Did not Achan the son of Zerah [ h ] commit a trespass in the [ i ] accursed thing , and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel ? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity. ’ ”
NKJV	Joshua	22	21	Then the children of Reuben , the children of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the [ j ] divisions of Israel :
NKJV	Joshua	22	23	If we have built ourselves an altar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer on it burnt offerings or grain offerings , or if to offer peace offerings on it , let the Lord Himself ( X ) require an account .
NKJV	Joshua	22	24	But in fact we have done it [ k ] for fear , for a reason , saying , ‘ In time to come your descendants may speak to our descendants , saying , “ What have you to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
NKJV	Joshua	22	25	For the Lord has made the Jordan a border between you and us , you children of Reuben and children of Gad . You have no part in the Lord. ” So your descendants would make our descendants cease fearing the Lord. ’
NKJV	Joshua	22	26	Therefore we said , ‘ Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar , not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice ,
NKJV	Joshua	22	27	but that it may be ( Y ) a [ l ] witness between you and us and our generations after us , that we may ( Z ) perform the service of the Lord before Him with our burnt offerings , with our sacrifices , and with our peace offerings ; that your descendants may not say to our descendants in time to come , “ You have no part in the Lord. ” ’
NKJV	Joshua	22	28	Therefore we said that it will be , when they say this to us or to our generations in time to come , that we may say , ‘ Here is the replica of the altar of the Lord which our fathers made , though not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices ; but it is a witness between you and us. ’
NKJV	Joshua	22	29	Far be it from us that we should rebel against the Lord , and turn from following the Lord this day , ( AA ) to build an altar for burnt offerings , for grain offerings , or for sacrifices , besides the altar of the Lord our God which is before His tabernacle. ”
NKJV	Joshua	22	30	Now when Phinehas the priest and the rulers of the congregation , the heads of the [ m ] divisions of Israel who were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben , the children of Gad , and the children of Manasseh spoke , it pleased them .
NKJV	Joshua	22	31	Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben , the children of Gad , and the children of Manasseh , “ This day we perceive that the Lord is ( AB ) among us , because you have not committed this treachery against the Lord . Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord. ”
NKJV	Joshua	22	32	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the rulers , returned from the children of Reuben and the children of Gad , from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought back word to them .
NKJV	Joshua	22	33	So the thing pleased the children of Israel , and the children of Israel ( AC ) blessed God ; they spoke no more of going against them in battle , to destroy the land where the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt .
NKJV	Joshua	22	34	The children of Reuben and the children of [ n ] Gad called the altar , Witness , “ For it is a witness between us that the Lord is God. ” Footnotes - Joshua 22:3 forsaken - Joshua 22:5 be very careful to do - Joshua 22:8 plunder - Joshua 22:11 Lit . front - Joshua 22:14 Lit . thousands - Joshua 22:16 unfaithful act - Joshua 22:19 However - Joshua 22:20 act unfaithfully - Joshua 22:20 devoted thing - Joshua 22:21 Lit . thousands - Joshua 22:24 Lit . from fear - Joshua 22:27 testimony - Joshua 22:30 Lit . thousands - Joshua 22:34 LXX adds and half the tribe of Manasseh Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Joshua	23	23	Now it came to pass , a long time after the Lord ( A ) had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about , that Joshua ( B ) was old , advanced in age .
NKJV	Joshua	23	2	And Joshua ( C ) called for all Israel , for their elders , for their heads , for their judges , and for their officers , and said to them : “ I am old , advanced in age .
NKJV	Joshua	23	3	You have seen all that the ( D ) Lord your God has done to all these nations because of you , for the ( E ) Lord your God is He who has fought for you .
NKJV	Joshua	23	4	See , ( F ) I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain , to be an inheritance for your tribes , from the Jordan , with all the nations that I have cut off , as far as the Great Sea westward .
NKJV	Joshua	23	5	And the Lord your God ( G ) will expel them from before you and drive them out of your sight . So you shall possess their land , ( H ) as the Lord your God promised you .
NKJV	Joshua	23	6	( I ) Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses , ( J ) lest you turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left ,
NKJV	Joshua	23	7	and lest you ( K ) go [ a ] among these nations , these who remain among you . You shall not ( L ) make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause anyone to ( M ) swear by them ; you shall not ( N ) serve them nor bow down to them ,
NKJV	Joshua	23	8	but you shall ( O ) hold fast to the Lord your God , as you have done to this day .
NKJV	Joshua	23	9	( P ) For the Lord has [ b ] driven out from before you great and strong nations ; but as for you , no one has been able to stand against you to this day .
NKJV	Joshua	23	10	( Q ) One man of you shall chase a thousand , for the Lord your God is He who fights for you , ( R ) as He promised you .
NKJV	Joshua	23	11	( S ) Therefore take careful heed to yourselves , that you love the Lord your God .
NKJV	Joshua	23	12	Or else , if indeed you do ( T ) go back , and cling to the remnant of these nations—these that remain among you—and ( U ) make marriages with them , and go in to them and they to you ,
NKJV	Joshua	23	13	know for certain that ( V ) the Lord your God will no longer drive out these nations from before you . ( W ) But they shall be snares and traps to you , and scourges on your sides and thorns in your eyes , until you perish from this good land which the Lord your God has given you .
NKJV	Joshua	23	14	“ Behold , this day ( X ) I [ c ] am going the way of all the earth . And you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that ( Y ) not one thing has failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spoke concerning you . All have come to pass for you ; not one word of them has failed .
NKJV	Joshua	23	15	( Z ) Therefore it shall come to pass , that as all the good things have come upon you which the Lord your God promised you , so the Lord will bring upon you ( AA ) all harmful things , until He has destroyed you from this good land which the Lord your God has given you .
NKJV	Joshua	23	16	[ d ] When you have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God , which He commanded you , and have gone and served other gods , and bowed down to them , then the ( AB ) anger of the Lord will burn against you , and you shall perish quickly from the good land which He has given you. ” Footnotes - Joshua 23:7 associate with - Joshua 23:9 dispossessed - Joshua 23:14 I am going to die . - Joshua 23:16 Or if ever Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Joshua	24	24	And the people ( AT ) said to Joshua , “ The Lord our God we will serve , and His voice we will obey ! ”
NKJV	Joshua	24	2	And Joshua said to all the people , “ Thus says the Lord God of Israel : ( E ) ‘ Your fathers , including Terah , the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor , dwelt on the other side of [ a ] the River in old times ; and ( F ) they served other gods .
NKJV	Joshua	24	3	( G ) Then I took your father Abraham from the other side of [ b ] the River , led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his [ c ] descendants and ( H ) gave him Isaac .
NKJV	Joshua	24	4	To Isaac I gave ( I ) Jacob and Esau . To ( J ) Esau I gave the mountains of Seir to possess , ( K ) but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt .
NKJV	Joshua	24	5	( L ) Also I sent Moses and Aaron , and ( M ) I plagued Egypt , according to what I did among them . Afterward I brought you out .
NKJV	Joshua	24	6	‘ Then I ( N ) brought your fathers out of Egypt , and you came to the sea ; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea .
NKJV	Joshua	24	7	So they cried out to the Lord ; and He put ( O ) darkness between you and the Egyptians , brought the sea upon them , and covered them . And ( P ) your eyes saw what I did in Egypt . Then you dwelt in the wilderness ( Q ) a long time .
NKJV	Joshua	24	8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites , who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan , ( R ) and they fought with you . But I gave them into your hand , that you might possess their land , and I destroyed them from before you .
NKJV	Joshua	24	9	Then ( S ) Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , arose to make war against Israel , and ( T ) sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you .
NKJV	Joshua	24	10	( U ) But I would not listen to Balaam ; ( V ) therefore he continued to bless you . So I delivered you out of his hand .
NKJV	Joshua	24	11	Then ( W ) you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho . And ( X ) the men of Jericho fought against you—also the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites . But I delivered them into your hand .
NKJV	Joshua	24	12	( Y ) I sent the hornet before you which drove them out from before you , also the two kings of the Amorites , but ( Z ) not with your sword or with your bow .
NKJV	Joshua	24	13	I have given you a land for which you did not labor , and ( AA ) cities which you did not build , and you dwell in them ; you eat of the vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant. ’
NKJV	Joshua	24	14	( AB ) “ Now therefore , fear the Lord , serve Him in ( AC ) sincerity and in truth , and ( AD ) put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of [ d ] the River and ( AE ) in Egypt . Serve the Lord !
NKJV	Joshua	24	15	And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord , ( AF ) choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve , whether ( AG ) the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of [ e ] the River , or ( AH ) the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you dwell . ( AI ) But as for me and my house , we will serve the Lord. ”
NKJV	Joshua	24	16	So the people answered and said : “ Far be it from us that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods ;
NKJV	Joshua	24	17	for the Lord our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage , who did those great signs in our sight , and preserved us in all the way that we went and among all the people through whom we passed .
NKJV	Joshua	24	18	And the Lord drove out from before us all the people , including the Amorites who dwelt in the land . ( AJ ) We also will serve the Lord , for He is our God. ”
NKJV	Joshua	24	19	But Joshua said to the people , ( AK ) “ You can not serve the Lord , for He is a ( AL ) holy God . He is ( AM ) a jealous God ; ( AN ) He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins .
NKJV	Joshua	24	20	( AO ) If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods , ( AP ) then He will turn and do you harm and consume you , after He has done you good. ”
NKJV	Joshua	24	21	And the people said to Joshua , “ No , but we will serve the Lord ! ”
NKJV	Joshua	24	22	So Joshua said to the people , “ You are witnesses against yourselves that ( AQ ) you have chosen the Lord for yourselves , to serve Him. ” And they said , “ We are witnesses ! ”
NKJV	Joshua	24	23	“ Now therefore , ” he said , ( AR ) “ put away the foreign gods which are among you , and ( AS ) incline your heart to the Lord God of Israel. ”
NKJV	Joshua	24	25	So Joshua ( AU ) made [ f ] a covenant with the people that day , and made for them a statute and an ordinance ( AV ) in Shechem .
NKJV	Joshua	24	26	Then Joshua ( AW ) wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God . And he took ( AX ) a large stone , and ( AY ) set it up there ( AZ ) under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord .
NKJV	Joshua	24	27	And Joshua said to all the people , “ Behold , this stone shall be ( BA ) a witness to us , for ( BB ) it has heard all the words of the Lord which He spoke to us . It shall therefore be a witness to you , lest you deny your God. ”
NKJV	Joshua	24	28	So ( BC ) Joshua let the people depart , each to his own inheritance . Death of Joshua and Eleazar
NKJV	Joshua	24	29	( BD ) Now it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being one hundred and ten years old .
NKJV	Joshua	24	30	And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at ( BE ) Timnath Serah , which is in the mountains of Ephraim , on the north side of Mount Gaash .
NKJV	Joshua	24	31	( BF ) Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , who had ( BG ) known all the works of the Lord which He had done for Israel .
NKJV	Joshua	24	32	( BH ) The bones of Joseph , which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt , they buried at Shechem , in the plot of ground ( BI ) which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred [ g ] pieces of silver , and which had become an inheritance of the children of Joseph .
NKJV	Joshua	24	33	And ( BJ ) Eleazar the son of Aaron died . They buried him in a hill belonging to ( BK ) Phinehas his son , which was given to him in the mountains of Ephraim .

NKJV	Judges	1	1	Now after the ( B ) death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel ( C ) asked the Lord , saying , “ Who shall be first to go up for us against the ( D ) Canaanites to fight against them ? ”
NKJV	Judges	1	2	And the Lord said , ( E ) “ Judah shall go up . Indeed I have delivered the land into his hand. ”
NKJV	Judges	1	3	So Judah said to ( F ) Simeon his brother , “ Come up with me to my allotted territory , that we may fight against the Canaanites ; and ( G ) I will likewise go with you to your allotted territory. ” And Simeon went with him .
NKJV	Judges	1	4	Then Judah went up , and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand ; and they killed ten thousand men at ( H ) Bezek .
NKJV	Judges	1	5	And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek , and fought against him ; and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
NKJV	Judges	1	6	Then Adoni-Bezek fled , and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes .
NKJV	Judges	1	7	And Adoni-Bezek said , “ Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table ; ( I ) as I have done , so God has repaid me. ” Then they brought him to Jerusalem , and there he died .
NKJV	Judges	1	8	Now ( J ) the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it ; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire .
NKJV	Judges	1	9	( K ) And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains , in the [ a ] South , and in the lowland .
NKJV	Judges	1	10	Then Judah [ b ] went against the Canaanites who dwelt in ( L ) Hebron . ( Now the name of Hebron was formerly ( M ) Kirjath Arba . ) And they killed Sheshai , Ahiman , and Talmai .
NKJV	Judges	1	11	( N ) From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir . ( The name of Debir was formerly Kirjath Sepher . )
NKJV	Judges	1	12	( O ) Then Caleb said , “ Whoever attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it , to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife. ”
NKJV	Judges	1	13	And Othniel the son of Kenaz , ( P ) Caleb ’ s younger brother , took it ; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife .
NKJV	Judges	1	14	( Q ) Now it happened , when she came to him , that [ c ] she urged him to ask her father for a field . And she dismounted from her donkey , and Caleb said to her , “ What do you wish ? ”
NKJV	Judges	1	15	So she said to him , ( R ) “ Give me a blessing ; since you have given me land in the South , give me also springs of water. ” And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
NKJV	Judges	1	16	( S ) Now the children of the Kenite , Moses ’ father-in-law , went up ( T ) from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah , which lies in the South near ( U ) Arad ; ( V ) and they went and dwelt among the people .
NKJV	Judges	1	17	( W ) And Judah went with his brother Simeon , and they attacked the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath , and utterly destroyed it . So the name of the city was called ( X ) Hormah .
NKJV	Judges	1	18	Also Judah took ( Y ) Gaza with its territory , Ashkelon with its territory , and Ekron with its territory .
NKJV	Judges	1	19	So the Lord was with Judah . And they drove out the mountaineers , but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland , because they had ( Z ) chariots of iron .
NKJV	Judges	1	20	( AA ) And they gave Hebron to Caleb , as Moses had said . Then he [ d ] expelled from there the ( AB ) three sons of Anak .
NKJV	Judges	1	21	( AC ) But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem ; so the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day .
NKJV	Judges	1	22	And the [ e ] house of Joseph also went up against Bethel , ( AD ) and the Lord was with them .
NKJV	Judges	1	23	So the [ f ] house of Joseph ( AE ) sent men to spy out Bethel . ( The name of the city was formerly ( AF ) Luz . )
NKJV	Judges	1	24	And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city , they said to him , “ Please show us the entrance to the city , and ( AG ) we will show you mercy. ”
NKJV	Judges	1	25	So he showed them the entrance to the city , and they struck the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let the man and all his family go .
NKJV	Judges	1	26	And the man went to the land of the Hittites , built a city , and called its name Luz , which is its name to this day . Incomplete Conquest of the Land
NKJV	Judges	1	27	( AH ) However , Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its villages , or ( AI ) Taanach and its villages , or the inhabitants of ( AJ ) Dor and its villages , or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages , or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages ; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land .
NKJV	Judges	1	28	And it came to pass , when Israel was strong , that they put the Canaanites [ g ] under tribute , but did not completely drive them out .
NKJV	Judges	1	29	( AK ) Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer ; so the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them .
NKJV	Judges	1	30	Nor did ( AL ) Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol ; so the Canaanites dwelt among them , and [ h ] were put under tribute .
NKJV	Judges	1	31	( AM ) Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon , or of Ahlab , Achzib , Helbah , Aphik , or Rehob .
NKJV	Judges	1	32	So the Asherites ( AN ) dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
NKJV	Judges	1	33	( AO ) Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath ; but they dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land . Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put under tribute to them .
NKJV	Judges	1	34	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains , for they would not allow them to come down to the valley ;
NKJV	Judges	1	35	and the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres , ( AP ) in Aijalon , and in [ i ] Shaalbim ; yet when the strength of the house of Joseph became greater , they [ j ] were put under tribute .
NKJV	Judges	1	36	Now the boundary of the Amorites was ( AQ ) from the Ascent of Akrabbim , from Sela , and upward . Footnotes - Judges 1:9 Heb .

NKJV	Judges	2	2	And ( D ) you shall make no [ a ] covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; ( E ) you shall tear down their altars. ’ ( F ) But you have not obeyed My voice . Why have you done this ?
NKJV	Judges	2	3	Therefore I also said , ‘ I will not drive them out before you ; but they shall be ( G ) thorns [ b ] in your side , and ( H ) their gods shall [ c ] be a ( I ) snare to you. ’ ”
NKJV	Judges	2	4	So it was , when the Angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voices and wept .
NKJV	Judges	2	5	Then they called the name of that place [ d ] Bochim ; and they sacrificed there to the Lord .
NKJV	Judges	2	6	And when ( J ) Joshua had dismissed the people , the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land . Death of Joshua ( K )
NKJV	Judges	2	7	( L ) So the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord which He had done for Israel .
NKJV	Judges	2	8	Now ( M ) Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died when he was one hundred and ten years old .
NKJV	Judges	2	9	( N ) And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at ( O ) Timnath Heres , in the mountains of Ephraim , on the north side of Mount Gaash .
NKJV	Judges	2	10	When all that generation had [ e ] been gathered to their fathers , another generation arose after them who ( P ) did not know the Lord nor the work which He had done for Israel . Israel ’ s Unfaithfulness
NKJV	Judges	2	11	Then the children of Israel did ( Q ) evil in the sight of the Lord , and served the Baals ;
NKJV	Judges	2	12	and they ( R ) forsook the Lord God of their fathers , who had brought them out of the land of Egypt ; and they followed ( S ) other gods from among the gods of the people who were all around them , and they ( T ) bowed down to them ; and they provoked the Lord to anger .
NKJV	Judges	2	13	They forsook the Lord ( U ) and served [ f ] Baal and the [ g ] Ashtoreths .
NKJV	Judges	2	14	( V ) And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel . So He ( W ) delivered them into the hands of plunderers who despoiled them ; and ( X ) He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around , so that they ( Y ) could no longer stand before their enemies .
NKJV	Judges	2	15	Wherever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for calamity , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had ( Z ) sworn to them . And they were greatly distressed .
NKJV	Judges	2	16	Nevertheless , ( AA ) the Lord raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them .
NKJV	Judges	2	17	Yet they would not listen to their judges , but they ( AB ) played the harlot with other gods , and bowed down to them . They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers walked , in obeying the commandments of the Lord ; they did not do so .
NKJV	Judges	2	18	And when the Lord raised up judges for them , ( AC ) the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge ; ( AD ) for the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and harassed them .
NKJV	Judges	2	19	And it came to pass , ( AE ) when the judge was dead , that they reverted and behaved more corruptly than their fathers , by following other gods , to serve them and bow down to them . They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way .
NKJV	Judges	2	20	Then the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel ; and He said , “ Because this nation has ( AF ) transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers , and has not heeded My voice ,
NKJV	Judges	2	21	I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua ( AG ) left when he died ,
NKJV	Judges	2	22	so ( AH ) that through them I may ( AI ) test Israel , whether they will keep the ways of the Lord , to walk in them as their fathers kept them , or not. ”
NKJV	Judges	2	23	Therefore the Lord left those nations , without driving them out immediately ; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua .

NKJV	Judges	3	3	namely , ( B ) five lords of the Philistines , all the Canaanites , the Sidonians , and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon , from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath .
NKJV	Judges	3	2	( this was only so that the generations of the children of Israel might be taught to know war , at least those who had not formerly known it ) ,
NKJV	Judges	3	4	And they were left , that He might test Israel by them , to [ b ] know whether they would obey the commandments of the Lord , which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses .
NKJV	Judges	3	5	( C ) Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
NKJV	Judges	3	6	And ( D ) they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their daughters to their sons ; and they served their gods . Othniel
NKJV	Judges	3	7	So the children of Israel did ( E ) evil in the sight of the Lord . They ( F ) forgot the Lord their God , and served the Baals and [ c ] Asherahs .
NKJV	Judges	3	8	Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and He ( G ) sold them into the hand of ( H ) Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia ; and the children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years .
NKJV	Judges	3	9	When the children of Israel ( I ) cried out to the Lord , the Lord ( J ) raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel , who delivered them : ( K ) Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s younger brother .
NKJV	Judges	3	10	( L ) The Spirit of the Lord came upon him , and he judged Israel . He went out to war , and the Lord delivered Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim .
NKJV	Judges	3	11	So the land had rest for forty years . Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died . Ehud
NKJV	Judges	3	12	( M ) And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord . So the Lord strengthened ( N ) Eglon king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord .
NKJV	Judges	3	13	Then he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and ( O ) Amalek , went and [ d ] defeated Israel , and took possession of ( P ) the City of Palms .
NKJV	Judges	3	14	So the children of Israel ( Q ) served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years .
NKJV	Judges	3	15	But when the children of Israel ( R ) cried out to the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliverer for them : Ehud the son of Gera , the Benjamite , a ( S ) left-handed man . By him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab .
NKJV	Judges	3	16	Now Ehud made himself a dagger ( it was double-edged and a cubit in length ) and fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh .
NKJV	Judges	3	17	So he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab . ( Now Eglon was a very fat man . )
NKJV	Judges	3	18	And when he had finished presenting the tribute , he sent away the people who had carried the tribute .
NKJV	Judges	3	19	But he himself turned back ( T ) from the [ e ] stone images that were at Gilgal , and said , “ I have a secret message for you , O king. ” He said , “ Keep silence ! ” And all who attended him went out from him .
NKJV	Judges	3	20	So Ehud came to him ( now he was sitting upstairs in his cool private chamber ) . Then Ehud said , “ I have a message from God for you. ” So he arose from his seat .
NKJV	Judges	3	21	Then Ehud reached with his left hand , took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly .
NKJV	Judges	3	22	Even the [ f ] hilt went in after the blade , and the fat closed over the blade , for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and his entrails came out .
NKJV	Judges	3	23	Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them .
NKJV	Judges	3	24	When he had gone out , [ g ] Eglon ’ s servants came to look , and to their surprise , the doors of the upper room were locked . So they said , “ He is probably ( U ) attending [ h ] to his needs in the cool chamber. ”
NKJV	Judges	3	25	So they waited till they were ( V ) embarrassed , and still he had not opened the doors of the upper room . Therefore they took the key and opened them . And there was their master , fallen dead on the floor .
NKJV	Judges	3	26	But Ehud had escaped while they delayed , and passed beyond the [ i ] stone images and escaped to Seirah .
NKJV	Judges	3	27	And it happened , when he arrived , that ( W ) he blew the trumpet in the ( X ) mountains of Ephraim , and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountains ; and [ j ] he led them .
NKJV	Judges	3	28	Then he said to them , “ Follow me , for ( Y ) the Lord has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. ” So they went down after him , seized the ( Z ) fords of the Jordan leading to Moab , and did not allow anyone to cross over .
NKJV	Judges	3	29	And at that time they killed about ten thousand men of Moab , all stout men of valor ; not a man escaped .
NKJV	Judges	3	30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel . And ( AA ) the land had rest for eighty years . Shamgar
NKJV	Judges	3	31	After him was ( AB ) Shamgar the son of Anath , who killed six hundred men of the Philistines ( AC ) with an ox goad ; ( AD ) and he also delivered ( AE ) Israel .

NKJV	Judges	4	4	Now Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lapidoth , was judging Israel at that time .
NKJV	Judges	4	2	So the Lord ( C ) sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan , who reigned in ( D ) Hazor . The commander of his army was ( E ) Sisera , who dwelt in ( F ) Harosheth Hagoyim .
NKJV	Judges	4	3	And the children of Israel cried out to the Lord ; for Jabin had nine hundred ( G ) chariots of iron , and for twenty years ( H ) he had harshly oppressed the children of Israel .
NKJV	Judges	4	5	( I ) And she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim . And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
NKJV	Judges	4	6	Then she sent and called for ( J ) Barak the son of Abinoam from ( K ) Kedesh in Naphtali , and said to him , “ Has not the Lord God of Israel commanded , ‘ Go and [ a ] deploy troops at Mount ( L ) Tabor ; take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun ;
NKJV	Judges	4	7	and against you ( M ) I will deploy Sisera , the commander of Jabin ’ s army , with his chariots and his multitude at the ( N ) River Kishon ; and I will [ b ] deliver him into your hand ’ ? ”
NKJV	Judges	4	8	And Barak said to her , “ If you will go with me , then I will go ; but if you will not go with me , I will not go ! ”
NKJV	Judges	4	9	So she said , “ I will surely go with you ; nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking , for the Lord will ( O ) sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. ” Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh .
NKJV	Judges	4	10	And Barak called ( P ) Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh ; he went up with ten thousand men ( Q ) under [ c ] his command , and Deborah went up with him .
NKJV	Judges	4	11	Now Heber ( R ) the Kenite , of the children of ( S ) Hobab the father-in-law of Moses , had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanaim , ( T ) which is beside Kedesh .
NKJV	Judges	4	12	And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor .
NKJV	Judges	4	13	So Sisera gathered together all his chariots , nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon .
NKJV	Judges	4	14	Then Deborah said to Barak , [ d ] “ Up ! For this is the day in which the Lord has delivered Sisera into your hand . ( U ) Has not the Lord gone out before you ? ” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him .
NKJV	Judges	4	15	And the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak ; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot .
NKJV	Judges	4	16	But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim , and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword ; not a man was ( V ) left .
NKJV	Judges	4	17	However , Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of ( W ) Jael , the wife of Heber the Kenite ; for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
NKJV	Judges	4	18	And Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said to him , “ Turn aside , my lord , turn aside to me ; do not fear. ” And when he had turned aside with her into the tent , she covered him with a [ e ] blanket .
NKJV	Judges	4	19	Then he said to her , “ Please give me a little water to drink , for I am thirsty. ” So she opened ( X ) a jug of milk , gave him a drink , and covered him .
NKJV	Judges	4	20	And he said to her , “ Stand at the door of the tent , and if any man comes and inquires of you , and says , ‘ Is there any man here ? ’ you shall say , ‘ No. ’ ”
NKJV	Judges	4	21	Then Jael , Heber ’ s wife , ( Y ) took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand , and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple , and it went down into the ground ; for he was fast asleep and weary . So he died .
NKJV	Judges	4	22	And then , as Barak pursued Sisera , Jael came out to meet him , and said to him , “ Come , I will show you the man whom you seek. ” And when he went into her tent , there lay Sisera , dead with the peg in his temple .
NKJV	Judges	4	23	So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan in the presence of the children of Israel .
NKJV	Judges	4	24	And the hand of the children of Israel grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .

NKJV	Judges	5	6	“ In the days of ( J ) Shamgar , son of Anath , In the days of ( K ) Jael , ( L ) The highways were deserted , And the travelers walked along the byways .
NKJV	Judges	5	7	Village life ceased , it ceased in Israel , Until I , Deborah , arose , Arose a mother in Israel .
NKJV	Judges	5	8	They chose ( M ) new gods ; Then there was war in the gates ; Not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel .
NKJV	Judges	5	9	My heart is with the rulers of Israel Who offered themselves willingly with the people . Bless the Lord !

NKJV	Judges	5	12	“ Awake , ( O ) awake , Deborah ! Awake , awake , sing a song ! Arise , Barak , and lead your captives away , O son of Abinoam !
NKJV	Judges	5	13	“ Then the survivors came down , the people against the nobles ; The Lord came down for me against the mighty .
NKJV	Judges	5	14	From Ephraim were those whose roots were in ( P ) Amalek . After you , Benjamin , with your peoples , From Machir rulers came down , And from Zebulun those who bear the recruiter ’ s staff .
NKJV	Judges	5	15	And [ d ] the princes of Issachar were with Deborah ; As Issachar , so was Barak Sent into the valley [ e ] under his command ; Among the divisions of Reuben There were great resolves of heart .
NKJV	Judges	5	16	Why did you sit among the sheepfolds , To hear the pipings for the flocks ? The divisions of Reuben have great searchings of heart .
NKJV	Judges	5	17	( Q ) Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan , And why did Dan remain [ f ] on ships ? ( R ) Asher continued at the seashore , And stayed by his inlets .
NKJV	Judges	5	18	( S ) Zebulun is a people who jeopardized their lives to the point of death , Naphtali also , on the heights of the battlefield .
NKJV	Judges	5	19	“ The kings came and fought , Then the kings of Canaan fought In ( T ) Taanach , by the waters of Megiddo ; They took no spoils of silver .
NKJV	Judges	5	20	They fought from the heavens ; The stars from their courses fought against Sisera .
NKJV	Judges	5	21	( U ) The torrent of Kishon swept them away , That ancient torrent , the torrent of Kishon . O my soul , march on in strength !
NKJV	Judges	5	22	Then the horses ’ hooves pounded , The galloping , galloping of his steeds .

NKJV	Judges	5	27	At her feet he sank , he fell , he lay still ; At her feet he sank , he fell ; Where he sank , there he fell ( W ) dead .

NKJV	Judges	6	6	So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites , and the children of Israel ( G ) cried out to the Lord .
NKJV	Judges	6	2	and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel . Because of the Midianites , the children of Israel made for themselves the dens , ( C ) the caves , and the strongholds which are in the mountains .
NKJV	Judges	6	3	So it was , whenever Israel had sown , Midianites would come up ; also Amalekites and the ( D ) people of the East would come up against them .
NKJV	Judges	6	4	Then they would encamp against them and ( E ) destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza , and leave no sustenance for Israel , neither sheep nor ox nor ( F ) donkey .
NKJV	Judges	6	5	For they would come up with their livestock and their tents , coming in as numerous as locusts ; both they and their camels were [ a ] without number ; and they would enter the land to destroy it .
NKJV	Judges	6	7	And it came to pass , when the children of Israel cried out to the Lord because of the Midianites ,
NKJV	Judges	6	8	that the Lord sent a prophet to the children of Israel , who said to them , “ Thus says the Lord God of Israel : ‘ I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the ( H ) house of [ b ] bondage ;
NKJV	Judges	6	9	and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you , and ( I ) drove them out before you and gave you their land .
NKJV	Judges	6	10	Also I said to you , “ I am the Lord your God ; ( J ) do not fear the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you dwell. ” But you have not obeyed My ( K ) voice. ’ ” Gideon
NKJV	Judges	6	11	Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah , which belonged to Joash ( L ) the Abiezrite , while his son ( M ) Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress , in order to hide it from the Midianites .
NKJV	Judges	6	12	And the ( N ) Angel of the Lord appeared to him , and said to him , “ The Lord is ( O ) with you , you mighty man of valor ! ”
NKJV	Judges	6	13	Gideon said to Him , “ O [ c ] my lord , if the Lord is with us , why then has all this happened to us ? And ( P ) where are all His miracles ( Q ) which our fathers told us about , saying , ‘ Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt ? ’ But now the Lord has ( R ) forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	14	Then the Lord turned to him and said , ( S ) “ Go in this might of yours , and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites . ( T ) Have I not sent you ? ”
NKJV	Judges	6	15	So he said to Him , “ O [ d ] my Lord , how can I save Israel ? Indeed ( U ) my clan is the weakest in Manasseh , and I am the least in my father ’ s house. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	16	And the Lord said to him , ( V ) “ Surely I will be with you , and you shall [ e ] defeat the Midianites as one man. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	17	Then he said to Him , “ If now I have found favor in Your sight , then ( W ) show me a sign that it is You who talk with me .
NKJV	Judges	6	18	( X ) Do not depart from here , I pray , until I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You. ” And He said , “ I will wait until you come back. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	19	( Y ) So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat , and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour . The meat he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot ; and he brought them out to Him under the terebinth tree and presented them .
NKJV	Judges	6	20	The Angel of God said to him , “ Take the meat and the unleavened bread and ( Z ) lay them on this rock , and ( AA ) pour out the broth. ” And he did so .
NKJV	Judges	6	21	Then the Angel of the Lord put out the end of the staff that was in His hand , and touched the meat and the unleavened bread ; and ( AB ) fire rose out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread . And the Angel of the Lord departed out of his sight .
NKJV	Judges	6	22	Now Gideon ( AC ) perceived that He was the Angel of the Lord . So Gideon said , “ Alas , O Lord God ! ( AD ) For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	23	Then the Lord said to him , ( AE ) “ Peace be with you ; do not fear , you shall not die. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	24	So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord , and called it [ f ] The-Lord-Is-Peace . To this day it is still ( AF ) in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
NKJV	Judges	6	25	Now it came to pass the same night that the Lord said to him , “ Take your father ’ s young bull , the second bull of seven years old , and ( AG ) tear down the altar of ( AH ) Baal that your father has , and ( AI ) cut down the [ g ] wooden image that is beside it ;
NKJV	Judges	6	26	and build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this [ h ] rock in the proper arrangement , and take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the image which you shall cut down. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	27	So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the Lord had said to him . But because he feared his father ’ s household and the men of the city too much to do it by day , he did it by night . Gideon Destroys the Altar of Baal
NKJV	Judges	6	28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning , there was the altar of Baal , torn down ; and the wooden image that was beside it was cut down , and the second bull was being offered on the altar which had been built .
NKJV	Judges	6	29	So they said to one another , “ Who has done this thing ? ” And when they had inquired and asked , they said , “ Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	30	Then the men of the city said to Joash , “ Bring out your son , that he may die , because he has torn down the altar of Baal , and because he has cut down the wooden image that was beside it. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	31	But Joash said to all who stood against him , “ Would you [ i ] plead for Baal ? Would you save him ? Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning ! If he is a god , let him plead for himself , because his altar has been torn down ! ”
NKJV	Judges	6	32	Therefore on that day he called him ( AJ ) Jerubbaal , [ j ] saying , “ Let Baal plead against him , because he has torn down his altar. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	33	Then all ( AK ) the Midianites and Amalekites , the people of the East , gathered together ; and they crossed over and encamped in ( AL ) the Valley of Jezreel .
NKJV	Judges	6	34	But ( AM ) the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon ; then he ( AN ) blew the trumpet , and the Abiezrites gathered behind him .
NKJV	Judges	6	35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh , who also gathered behind him . He also sent messengers to ( AO ) Asher , ( AP ) Zebulun , and Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them . The Sign of the Fleece
NKJV	Judges	6	36	So Gideon said to God , “ If You will save Israel by my hand as You have said—
NKJV	Judges	6	37	( AQ ) look , I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor ; if there is dew on the fleece only , and it is dry on all the ground , then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand , as You have said. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	38	And it was so . When he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together , he wrung the dew out of the fleece , a bowlful of water .
NKJV	Judges	6	39	Then Gideon said to God , ( AR ) “ Do not be angry with me , but let me speak just once more : Let me test , I pray , just once more with the fleece ; let it now be dry only on the fleece , but on all the ground let there be dew. ”
NKJV	Judges	6	40	And God did so that night . It was dry on the fleece only , but there was dew on all the ground .

NKJV	Judges	7	7	Then the Lord said to Gideon , ( D ) “ By the three hundred men who lapped I will save you , and deliver the Midianites into your hand . Let all the other people go , every man to his [ a ] place. ”
NKJV	Judges	7	2	And the Lord said to Gideon , “ The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands , lest Israel ( B ) claim glory for itself against Me , saying , ‘ My own hand has saved me. ’
NKJV	Judges	7	3	Now therefore , proclaim in the hearing of the people , saying , ( C ) ‘ Whoever is fearful and afraid , let him turn and depart at once from Mount Gilead. ’ ” And twenty-two thousand of the people returned , and ten thousand remained .
NKJV	Judges	7	4	But the Lord said to Gideon , “ The people are still too many ; bring them down to the water , and I will test them for you there . Then it will be , that of whom I say to you , ‘ This one shall go with you , ’ the same shall go with you ; and of whomever I say to you , ‘ This one shall not go with you , ’ the same shall not go. ”
NKJV	Judges	7	5	So he brought the people down to the water . And the Lord said to Gideon , “ Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue , as a dog laps , you shall set apart by himself ; likewise everyone who gets down on his knees to drink. ”
NKJV	Judges	7	6	And the number of those who lapped , putting their hand to their mouth , was three hundred men ; but all the rest of the people got down on their knees to drink water .
NKJV	Judges	7	8	So the people took provisions and their trumpets in their hands . And he sent away all the rest of Israel , every man to his tent , and retained those three hundred men . Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley .
NKJV	Judges	7	9	It happened on the same ( E ) night that the Lord said to him , “ Arise , go down against the camp , for I have delivered it into your hand .
NKJV	Judges	7	10	But if you are afraid to go down , go down to the camp with Purah your servant ,
NKJV	Judges	7	11	and you shall ( F ) hear what they say ; and afterward [ b ] your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp. ” Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outpost of the armed men who were in the camp .
NKJV	Judges	7	12	Now the Midianites and Amalekites , ( G ) all the people of the East , were lying in the valley ( H ) as numerous as locusts ; and their camels were [ c ] without number , as the sand by the seashore in multitude .
NKJV	Judges	7	13	And when Gideon had come , there was a man telling a dream to his companion . He said , “ I have had a dream : To my surprise , a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian ; it came to a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned , and the tent collapsed. ”
NKJV	Judges	7	14	Then his companion answered and said , “ This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash , a man of Israel ! Into his hand ( I ) God has delivered Midian and the whole camp. ”
NKJV	Judges	7	15	And so it was , when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation , that he worshiped . He returned to the camp of Israel , and said , “ Arise , for the Lord has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand. ”
NKJV	Judges	7	16	Then he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trumpet into every man ’ s hand , with empty pitchers , and torches inside the pitchers .
NKJV	Judges	7	17	And he said to them , “ Look at me and do likewise ; watch , and when I come to the edge of the camp you shall do as I do :
NKJV	Judges	7	18	When I blow the trumpet , I and all who are with me , then you also blow the trumpets on every side of the whole camp , and say , ‘ The sword of the Lord and of Gideon ! ’ ”
NKJV	Judges	7	19	So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outpost of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch , just as they had posted the watch ; and they blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands .
NKJV	Judges	7	20	Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers—they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing—and they cried , “ The sword of the Lord and of Gideon ! ”
NKJV	Judges	7	21	And ( J ) every man stood in his place all around the camp ; ( K ) and the whole army ran and cried out and fled .
NKJV	Judges	7	22	When the three hundred ( L ) blew the trumpets , ( M ) the Lord set ( N ) every man ’ s sword against his companion throughout the whole camp ; and the army fled to [ d ] Beth Acacia , toward Zererah , as far as the border of ( O ) Abel Meholah , by Tabbath .
NKJV	Judges	7	23	And the men of Israel gathered together from ( P ) Naphtali , Asher , and all Manasseh , and pursued the Midianites .
NKJV	Judges	7	24	Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the ( Q ) mountains of Ephraim , saying , “ Come down against the Midianites , and seize from them the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan. ” Then all the men of Ephraim gathered together and ( R ) seized the watering places as far as ( S ) Beth Barah and the Jordan .
NKJV	Judges	7	25	And they captured ( T ) two princes of the Midianites , ( U ) Oreb and Zeeb . They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb , and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb . They pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the ( V ) other side of the Jordan .

NKJV	Judges	8	8	Then he went up from there ( K ) to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way . And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered .
NKJV	Judges	8	2	So he said to them , “ What have I done now in comparison with you ? Is not the [ a ] gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than [ b ] the vintage of ( B ) Abiezer ?
NKJV	Judges	8	3	( C ) God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb . And what was I able to do in comparison with you ? ” Then their ( D ) anger toward him subsided when he said that .
NKJV	Judges	8	4	When Gideon came ( E ) to the Jordan , he and ( F ) the three hundred men who were with him crossed over , exhausted but still in pursuit .
NKJV	Judges	8	5	Then he said to the men of ( G ) Succoth , “ Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me , for they are exhausted , and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna , kings of Midian. ”
NKJV	Judges	8	6	And the leaders of Succoth said , ( H ) “ Are [ c ] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand , that ( I ) we should give bread to your army ? ”
NKJV	Judges	8	7	So Gideon said , “ For this cause , when the Lord has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand , ( J ) then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers ! ”
NKJV	Judges	8	9	So he also spoke to the men of Penuel , saying , “ When I ( L ) come back in peace , ( M ) I will tear down this tower ! ”
NKJV	Judges	8	10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor , and their armies with them , about fifteen thousand , all who were left of ( N ) all the army of the people of the East ; for ( O ) one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen .
NKJV	Judges	8	11	Then Gideon went up by the road of those who dwell in tents on the east of ( P ) Nobah and Jogbehah ; and he [ d ] attacked the army while the camp felt ( Q ) secure .
NKJV	Judges	8	12	When Zebah and Zalmunna fled , he pursued them ; and he ( R ) took the two kings of Midian , Zebah and Zalmunna , and routed the whole army .
NKJV	Judges	8	13	Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle , from the Ascent of Heres .
NKJV	Judges	8	14	And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth and interrogated him ; and he wrote down for him the leaders of Succoth and its elders , seventy-seven men .
NKJV	Judges	8	15	Then he came to the men of Succoth and said , “ Here are Zebah and Zalmunna , about whom you ( S ) ridiculed me , saying , ‘ Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand , that we should give bread to your weary men ? ’ ”
NKJV	Judges	8	16	( T ) And he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he [ e ] taught the men of Succoth .
NKJV	Judges	8	17	( U ) Then he tore down the tower of ( V ) Penuel and killed the men of the city .
NKJV	Judges	8	18	And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna , “ What kind of men were they whom you killed at ( W ) Tabor ? ” So they answered , “ As you are , so were they ; each one resembled the son of a king. ”
NKJV	Judges	8	19	Then he said , “ They were my brothers , the sons of my mother . As the Lord lives , if you had let them live , I would not kill you. ”
NKJV	Judges	8	20	And he said to Jether his firstborn , “ Rise , kill them ! ” But the youth would not draw his sword ; for he was afraid , because he was still a youth .
NKJV	Judges	8	21	So Zebah and Zalmunna said , “ Rise yourself , and kill us ; for as a man is , so is his strength. ” So Gideon arose and ( X ) killed Zebah and Zalmunna , and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels ’ necks . Gideon ’ s Ephod
NKJV	Judges	8	22	Then the men of Israel said to Gideon , ( Y ) “ Rule over us , both you and your son , and your grandson also ; for you have ( Z ) delivered us from the hand of Midian. ”
NKJV	Judges	8	23	But Gideon said to them , “ I will not rule over you , nor shall my son rule over you ; ( AA ) the Lord shall rule over you. ”
NKJV	Judges	8	24	Then Gideon said to them , “ I would like to [ f ] make a request of you , that each of you would give me the earrings from his plunder. ” For they had golden earrings , ( AB ) because they were Ishmaelites .
NKJV	Judges	8	25	So they answered , “ We will gladly give them. ” And they spread out a garment , and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder .
NKJV	Judges	8	26	Now the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold , besides the crescent ornaments , pendants , and purple robes which were on the kings of Midian , and besides the chains that were around their camels ’ necks .
NKJV	Judges	8	27	Then Gideon ( AC ) made it into an ephod and set it up in his city , ( AD ) Ophrah . And all Israel ( AE ) played the harlot with it there . It became ( AF ) a snare to Gideon and to his house .
NKJV	Judges	8	28	Thus Midian was subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted their heads no more . ( AG ) And the country was quiet for forty years in the days of Gideon . Death of Gideon
NKJV	Judges	8	29	Then ( AH ) Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house .
NKJV	Judges	8	30	Gideon had ( AI ) seventy sons who were his own offspring , for he had many wives .
NKJV	Judges	8	31	( AJ ) And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son , whose name he called Abimelech .
NKJV	Judges	8	32	Now Gideon the son of Joash died ( AK ) at a good old age , and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father , ( AL ) in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
NKJV	Judges	8	33	So it was , ( AM ) as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel again ( AN ) played the harlot with the Baals , ( AO ) and made Baal-Berith their god .
NKJV	Judges	8	34	Thus the children of Israel ( AP ) did not remember the Lord their God , who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side ;
NKJV	Judges	8	35	( AQ ) nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal ( Gideon ) in accordance with the good he had done for Israel .

NKJV	Judges	9	9	But the olive tree said to them , ‘ Should I cease giving my oil , ( L ) With which they honor God and men , And go to sway over trees ? ’
NKJV	Judges	9	2	“ Please speak in the hearing of all the men of Shechem : ‘ Which is better for you , that all ( B ) seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal reign over you , or that one reign over you ? ’ Remember that I am your own flesh and ( C ) bone. ”
NKJV	Judges	9	3	And his mother ’ s brothers spoke all these words concerning him in the hearing of all the men of Shechem ; and their heart was inclined to follow Abimelech , for they said , “ He is our ( D ) brother. ”
NKJV	Judges	9	4	So they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of ( E ) Baal-Berith , with which Abimelech hired ( F ) worthless and reckless men ; and they followed him .
NKJV	Judges	9	5	Then he went to his father ’ s house ( G ) at Ophrah and ( H ) killed his brothers , the seventy sons of Jerubbaal , on one stone . But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left , because he hid himself .
NKJV	Judges	9	6	And all the men of Shechem gathered together , all of Beth Millo , and they went and made Abimelech king beside the terebinth tree at the pillar that was in Shechem . The Parable of the Trees
NKJV	Judges	9	7	Now when they told Jotham , he went and stood on top of ( I ) Mount Gerizim , and lifted his voice and cried out . And he said to them : “ Listen to me , you men of Shechem , That God may listen to you !
NKJV	Judges	9	8	“ The ( J ) trees once went forth to anoint a king over them . And they said to the olive tree , ( K ) ‘ Reign over us ! ’
NKJV	Judges	9	10	“ Then the trees said to the fig tree , ‘ You come and reign over us ! ’
NKJV	Judges	9	11	But the fig tree said to them , ‘ Should I cease my sweetness and my good fruit , And go to sway over trees ? ’
NKJV	Judges	9	12	“ Then the trees said to the vine , ‘ You come and reign over us ! ’
NKJV	Judges	9	13	But the vine said to them , ‘ Should I cease my new wine , ( M ) Which cheers both God and men , And go to sway over trees ? ’
NKJV	Judges	9	14	“ Then all the trees said to the bramble , ‘ You come and reign over us ! ’
NKJV	Judges	9	15	And the bramble said to the trees , ‘ If in truth you anoint me as king over you , Then come and take shelter in my ( N ) shade ; But if not , ( O ) let fire come out of the bramble And devour the ( P ) cedars of Lebanon ! ’
NKJV	Judges	9	16	“ Now therefore , if you have acted in truth and sincerity in making Abimelech king , and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done to him ( Q ) as [ a ] he deserves—
NKJV	Judges	9	17	for my ( R ) father fought for you , risked his life , and ( S ) delivered you out of the hand of Midian ;
NKJV	Judges	9	18	( T ) but you have risen up against my father ’ s house this day , and killed his seventy sons on one stone , and made Abimelech , the son of his ( U ) female servant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother—
NKJV	Judges	9	19	if then you have acted in truth and sincerity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then ( V ) rejoice in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you .
NKJV	Judges	9	20	But if not , ( W ) let fire come from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and Beth Millo ; and let fire come from the men of Shechem and from Beth Millo and devour Abimelech ! ”
NKJV	Judges	9	21	And Jotham ran away and fled ; and he went to ( X ) Beer and dwelt there , for fear of Abimelech his brother . Downfall of Abimelech
NKJV	Judges	9	22	After Abimelech had reigned over Israel three years ,
NKJV	Judges	9	23	( Y ) God sent a ( Z ) spirit of ill will between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem ( AA ) dealt treacherously with Abimelech ,
NKJV	Judges	9	24	( AB ) that the crime done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be settled and their ( AC ) blood be laid on Abimelech their brother , who killed them , and on the men of Shechem , who aided him in the killing of his brothers .
NKJV	Judges	9	25	And the men of Shechem set [ b ] men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all who passed by them along that way ; and it was told Abimelech .
NKJV	Judges	9	26	Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem ; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him .
NKJV	Judges	9	27	So they went out into the fields , and gathered grapes from their vineyards and trod them , and [ c ] made merry . And they went into ( AD ) the house of their god , and ate and drank , and cursed Abimelech .
NKJV	Judges	9	28	Then Gaal the son of Ebed said , ( AE ) “ Who is Abimelech , and who is Shechem , that we should serve him ? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal , and is not Zebul his officer ? Serve the men of ( AF ) Hamor the father of Shechem ; but why should we serve him ?
NKJV	Judges	9	29	( AG ) If only this people were under my [ d ] authority ! Then I would remove Abimelech. ” So [ e ] he said to Abimelech , “ Increase your army and come out ! ”
NKJV	Judges	9	30	When Zebul , the ruler of the city , heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , his anger was aroused .
NKJV	Judges	9	31	And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly , saying , “ Take note ! Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem ; and here they are , fortifying the city against you .
NKJV	Judges	9	32	Now therefore , get up by night , you and the people who are with you , and [ f ] lie in wait in the field .
NKJV	Judges	9	33	And it shall be , as soon as the sun is up in the morning , that you shall rise early and rush upon the city ; and when he and the people who are with him come out against you , you may then do to them [ g ] as you find opportunity. ”
NKJV	Judges	9	34	So Abimelech and all the people who were with him rose by night , and [ h ] lay in wait against Shechem in four companies .
NKJV	Judges	9	35	When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate , Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from lying in wait .
NKJV	Judges	9	36	And when Gaal saw the people , he said to Zebul , “ Look , people are coming down from the tops of the mountains ! ” But Zebul said to him , “ You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men. ”
NKJV	Judges	9	37	So Gaal spoke again and said , “ See , people are coming down from the center of the land , and another company is coming from the [ i ] Diviners ’ Terebinth Tree. ”
NKJV	Judges	9	38	Then Zebul said to him , “ Where indeed is your mouth now , with which you ( AH ) said , ‘ Who is Abimelech , that we should serve him ? ’ Are not these the people whom you despised ? Go out , if you will , and fight with them now. ”
NKJV	Judges	9	39	So Gaal went out , leading the men of Shechem , and fought with Abimelech .
NKJV	Judges	9	40	And Abimelech chased him , and he fled from him ; and many fell wounded , to the very entrance of the gate .
NKJV	Judges	9	41	Then Abimelech dwelt at Arumah , and Zebul [ j ] drove out Gaal and his brothers , so that they would not dwell in Shechem .
NKJV	Judges	9	42	And it came about on the next day that the people went out into the field , and they told Abimelech .
NKJV	Judges	9	43	So he took his people , divided them into three companies , and lay in wait in the field . And he looked , and there were the people , coming out of the city ; and he rose against them and [ k ] attacked them .
NKJV	Judges	9	44	Then Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city ; and the other two companies rushed upon all who were in the fields and killed them .
NKJV	Judges	9	45	So Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; ( AI ) he took the city and killed the people who were in it ; and he ( AJ ) demolished the city and sowed it with salt .
NKJV	Judges	9	46	Now when all the men of the tower of Shechem had heard that , they entered the [ l ] stronghold of the temple ( AK ) of the god Berith .
NKJV	Judges	9	47	And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together .
NKJV	Judges	9	48	Then Abimelech went up to Mount ( AL ) Zalmon , he and all the people who were with him . And Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees , and took it and laid it on his shoulder ; then he said to the people who were with him , “ What you have seen me do , make haste and do as I have done. ”
NKJV	Judges	9	49	So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech , put them against the [ m ] stronghold , and set the stronghold on fire above them , so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died , about a thousand men and women .
NKJV	Judges	9	50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez , and he [ n ] encamped against Thebez and took it .
NKJV	Judges	9	51	But there was a strong tower in the city , and all the men and women—all the people of the city—fled there and shut themselves in ; then they went up to the top of the tower .
NKJV	Judges	9	52	So Abimelech came as far as the tower and fought against it ; and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
NKJV	Judges	9	53	But a certain woman ( AM ) dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech ’ s head and crushed his skull .
NKJV	Judges	9	54	Then ( AN ) he called quickly to the young man , his armorbearer , and said to him , “ Draw your sword and kill me , lest men say of me , ‘ A woman killed him. ’ ” So his young man thrust him through , and he died .
NKJV	Judges	9	55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , they departed , every man to his [ o ] place .
NKJV	Judges	9	56	( AO ) Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech , which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers .

NKJV	Judges	10	10	( L ) And the children of Israel cried out to the Lord , saying , “ We have ( M ) sinned against You , because we have both forsaken our God and served the Baals ! ”
NKJV	Judges	10	2	He judged Israel twenty-three years ; and he died and was buried in Shamir . Jair
NKJV	Judges	10	3	After him arose Jair , a Gileadite ; and he judged Israel twenty-two years .
NKJV	Judges	10	4	Now he had thirty sons who ( B ) rode on thirty donkeys ; they also had thirty towns , ( C ) which are called [ a ] “ Havoth Jair ” to this day , which are in the land of Gilead .
NKJV	Judges	10	5	And Jair died and was buried in Camon . Israel Oppressed Again
NKJV	Judges	10	6	Then ( D ) the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord , and ( E ) served the Baals and the Ashtoreths , ( F ) the gods of Syria , the gods of ( G ) Sidon , the gods of Moab , the gods of the people of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines ; and they forsook the Lord and did not serve Him .
NKJV	Judges	10	7	So the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel ; and He ( H ) sold them into the hands of the ( I ) Philistines and into the hands of the people of ( J ) Ammon .
NKJV	Judges	10	8	From that year they [ b ] harassed and oppressed the children of Israel for eighteen years—all the children of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan in the ( K ) land of the Amorites , in Gilead .
NKJV	Judges	10	9	Moreover the people of Ammon crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah also , against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim , so that Israel was severely distressed .
NKJV	Judges	10	11	So the Lord said to the children of Israel , “ Did I not deliver you ( N ) from the Egyptians and ( O ) from the Amorites and ( P ) from the people of Ammon and ( Q ) from the Philistines ?
NKJV	Judges	10	12	Also ( R ) the Sidonians ( S ) and Amalekites and [ c ] Maonites ( T ) oppressed you ; and you cried out to Me , and I delivered you from their hand .
NKJV	Judges	10	13	( U ) Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods . Therefore I will deliver you no more .
NKJV	Judges	10	14	“ Go and ( V ) cry out to the gods which you have chosen ; let them deliver you in your time of distress. ”
NKJV	Judges	10	15	And the children of Israel said to the Lord , “ We have sinned ! ( W ) Do to us whatever seems best to You ; only deliver us this day , we pray. ”
NKJV	Judges	10	16	( X ) So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the Lord . And ( Y ) His soul could no longer endure the misery of Israel .
NKJV	Judges	10	17	Then the people of Ammon gathered together and encamped in Gilead . And the children of Israel assembled together and encamped in ( Z ) Mizpah .
NKJV	Judges	10	18	And the people , the leaders of Gilead , said to one another , “ Who is the man who will begin the fight against the people of Ammon ? He shall ( AA ) be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. ” Footnotes - Judges 10:4 Lit . Towns of Jair , Num . 32:41 ; Deut . 3:14 - Judges 10:8 Lit . shattered - Judges 10:12 LXX mss .

NKJV	Judges	11	11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him ( L ) head and commander over them ; and Jephthah spoke all his words ( M ) before the Lord in Mizpah .
NKJV	Judges	11	2	Gilead ’ s wife bore sons ; and when his wife ’ s sons grew up , they drove Jephthah out , and said to him , “ You shall have ( C ) no inheritance in our father ’ s house , for you are the son of another woman. ”
NKJV	Judges	11	3	Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of ( D ) Tob ; and ( E ) worthless men banded together with Jephthah and went out raiding with him .
NKJV	Judges	11	4	It came to pass after a time that the ( F ) people of Ammon made war against Israel .
NKJV	Judges	11	5	And so it was , when the people of Ammon made war against Israel , that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob .
NKJV	Judges	11	6	Then they said to Jephthah , “ Come and be our commander , that we may fight against the people of Ammon. ”
NKJV	Judges	11	7	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , ( G ) “ Did you not hate me , and expel me from my father ’ s house ? Why have you come to me now when you are in [ a ] distress ? ”
NKJV	Judges	11	8	( H ) And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , “ That is why we have ( I ) turned [ b ] again to you now , that you may go with us and fight against the people of Ammon , and be ( J ) our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. ”
NKJV	Judges	11	9	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , “ If you take me back home to fight against the people of Ammon , and the Lord delivers them to me , shall I be your head ? ”
NKJV	Judges	11	10	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , ( K ) “ The Lord will be a witness between us , if we do not do according to your words. ”
NKJV	Judges	11	12	Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon , saying , ( N ) “ What do you have against me , that you have come to fight against me in my land ? ”
NKJV	Judges	11	13	And the king of the people of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah , ( O ) “ Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt , from ( P ) the Arnon as far as ( Q ) the Jabbok , and to the Jordan . Now therefore , restore those lands peaceably. ”
NKJV	Judges	11	14	So Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon ,
NKJV	Judges	11	15	and said to him , “ Thus says Jephthah : ( R ) ‘ Israel did not take away the land of Moab , nor the land of the people of Ammon ;
NKJV	Judges	11	16	for when Israel came up from Egypt , they walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and ( S ) came to Kadesh .
NKJV	Judges	11	17	Then ( T ) Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom , saying , “ Please let me pass through your land. ” ( U ) But the king of Edom would not heed . And in like manner they sent to the ( V ) king of Moab , but he would not consent . So Israel ( W ) remained in Kadesh .
NKJV	Judges	11	18	And they ( X ) went along through the wilderness and ( Y ) bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab , came to the east side of the land of Moab , and encamped on the other side of the Arnon . But they did not enter the border of Moab , for the Arnon was the border of Moab .
NKJV	Judges	11	19	Then ( Z ) Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , king of Heshbon ; and Israel said to him , “ Please ( AA ) let us pass through your land into our place. ”
NKJV	Judges	11	20	( AB ) But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory . So Sihon gathered all his people together , encamped in Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
NKJV	Judges	11	21	And the Lord God of Israel ( AC ) delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they ( AD ) defeated [ c ] them . Thus Israel gained possession of all the land of the Amorites , who inhabited that country .
NKJV	Judges	11	22	They took possession of ( AE ) all the territory of the Amorites , from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan .
NKJV	Judges	11	23	‘ And now the Lord God of Israel has [ d ] dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel ; should you then possess it ?
NKJV	Judges	11	24	Will you not possess whatever ( AF ) Chemosh your god gives you to possess ? So whatever ( AG ) the Lord our God takes possession of before us , we will possess .
NKJV	Judges	11	25	And now , are you any better than ( AH ) Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? Did he ever strive against Israel ? Did he ever fight against them ?
NKJV	Judges	11	26	While Israel dwelt in ( AI ) Heshbon and its villages , in ( AJ ) Aroer and its villages , and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon , for three hundred years , why did you not recover them within that time ?
NKJV	Judges	11	27	Therefore I have not sinned against you , but you wronged me by fighting against me . May the Lord , ( AK ) the Judge , ( AL ) render judgment this day between the children of Israel and the people of Ammon. ’ ”
NKJV	Judges	11	28	However , the king of the people of Ammon did not heed the words which Jephthah sent him . Jephthah ’ s Vow and Victory
NKJV	Judges	11	29	Then ( AM ) the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah , and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh , and passed through Mizpah of Gilead ; and from Mizpah of Gilead he advanced toward the people of Ammon .
NKJV	Judges	11	30	And Jephthah ( AN ) made a vow to the Lord , and said , “ If You will indeed deliver the people of Ammon into my hands ,
NKJV	Judges	11	31	then it will be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the people of Ammon , ( AO ) shall surely be the Lord ’ s , ( AP ) and I will offer it up as a burnt offering. ”
NKJV	Judges	11	32	So Jephthah advanced toward the people of Ammon to fight against them , and the Lord delivered them into his hands .
NKJV	Judges	11	33	And he [ e ] defeated them from Aroer as far as ( AQ ) Minnith—twenty cities—and to [ f ] Abel Keramim , with a very great slaughter . Thus the people of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel . Jephthah ’ s Daughter
NKJV	Judges	11	34	When Jephthah came to his house at ( AR ) Mizpah , there was ( AS ) his daughter , coming out to meet him with timbrels and dancing ; and she was his only child . Besides her he had neither son nor daughter .
NKJV	Judges	11	35	And it came to pass , when he saw her , that he ( AT ) tore his clothes , and said , “ Alas , my daughter ! You have brought me very low ! You are among those who trouble me ! For I ( AU ) have [ g ] given my word to the Lord , and ( AV ) I can not [ h ] go back on it. ”
NKJV	Judges	11	36	So she said to him , “ My father , if you have given your word to the Lord , ( AW ) do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth , because ( AX ) the Lord has avenged you of your enemies , the people of Ammon. ”
NKJV	Judges	11	37	Then she said to her father , “ Let this thing be done for me : let me alone for two months , that I may go and wander on the mountains and [ i ] bewail my virginity , my [ j ] friends and I. ”
NKJV	Judges	11	38	So he said , “ Go. ” And he sent her away for two months ; and she went with her friends , and bewailed her virginity on the mountains .
NKJV	Judges	11	39	And it was so at the end of two months that she returned to her father , and he ( AY ) carried out his vow with her which he had vowed . She [ k ] knew no man . And it became a custom in Israel
NKJV	Judges	11	40	that the daughters of Israel went four days each year to [ l ] lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite .

NKJV	Judges	12	12	And Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the country of Zebulun .
NKJV	Judges	12	2	And Jephthah said to them , “ My people and I were in a great struggle with the people of Ammon ; and when I called you , you did not deliver me out of their hands .
NKJV	Judges	12	3	So when I saw that you would not deliver me , I ( B ) took my life in my hands and crossed over against the people of Ammon ; and the Lord delivered them into my hand . Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me ? ”
NKJV	Judges	12	4	Now Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim . And the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim , because they said , “ You Gileadites ( C ) are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites. ”
NKJV	Judges	12	5	The Gileadites seized the ( D ) fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites arrived . And when any Ephraimite who escaped said , “ Let me cross over , ” the men of Gilead would say to him , “ Are you an Ephraimite ? ” If he said , “ No , ”
NKJV	Judges	12	6	then they would say to him , “ Then say , ( E ) ‘ Shibboleth ’ ! ” [ b ] And he would say , “ Sibboleth , ” for he could not [ c ] pronounce it right . Then they would take him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan . There fell at that time forty-two thousand Ephraimites .
NKJV	Judges	12	7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years . Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried among the cities of Gilead . Ibzan , Elon , and Abdon
NKJV	Judges	12	8	After him , Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel .
NKJV	Judges	12	9	He had thirty sons . And he gave away thirty daughters in marriage , and brought in thirty daughters from elsewhere for his sons . He judged Israel seven years .
NKJV	Judges	12	10	Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem .
NKJV	Judges	12	11	After him , Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel . He judged Israel ten years .
NKJV	Judges	12	13	After him , Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel .
NKJV	Judges	12	14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons , who ( F ) rode on seventy young donkeys . He judged Israel eight years .
NKJV	Judges	12	15	Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , ( G ) in the mountains of the Amalekites .

NKJV	Judges	13	13	So the Angel of the Lord said to Manoah , “ Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful .
NKJV	Judges	13	2	Now there was a certain man from ( D ) Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren and had no children .
NKJV	Judges	13	3	And the ( E ) Angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her , “ Indeed now , you are barren and have borne no children , but you shall conceive and bear a son .
NKJV	Judges	13	4	Now therefore , please be careful ( F ) not to drink wine or similar drink , and not to eat anything unclean .
NKJV	Judges	13	5	For behold , you shall conceive and bear a son . And no ( G ) razor shall come upon his head , for the child shall be ( H ) a Nazirite to God from the womb ; and he shall ( I ) begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. ”
NKJV	Judges	13	6	So the woman came and told her husband , saying , ( J ) “ A Man of God came to me , and His ( K ) countenance [ a ] was like the countenance of the Angel of God , very awesome ; but I ( L ) did not ask Him where He was from , and He did not tell me His name .
NKJV	Judges	13	7	And He said to me , ‘ Behold , you shall conceive and bear a son . Now drink no wine or similar drink , nor eat anything unclean , for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death. ’ ”
NKJV	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah prayed to the Lord , and said , “ O my Lord , please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the child who will be born. ”
NKJV	Judges	13	9	And God listened to the voice of Manoah , and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field ; but Manoah her husband was not with her .
NKJV	Judges	13	10	Then the woman ran in haste and told her husband , and said to him , “ Look , the Man who came to me the other day has just now appeared to me ! ”
NKJV	Judges	13	11	So Manoah arose and followed his wife . When he came to the Man , he said to Him , “ Are You the Man who spoke to this woman ? ” And He said , “ I am. ”
NKJV	Judges	13	12	Manoah said , “ Now let Your words come to pass ! What will be the boy ’ s rule of life , and his work ? ”
NKJV	Judges	13	14	She may not eat anything that comes from the vine , ( M ) nor may she drink wine or similar drink , nor eat anything unclean . All that I commanded her let her observe. ”
NKJV	Judges	13	15	Then Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord , “ Please ( N ) let us detain You , and we will prepare a young goat for You. ”
NKJV	Judges	13	16	And the Angel of the Lord said to Manoah , “ Though you detain Me , I will not eat your food . But if you offer a burnt offering , you must offer it to the Lord. ” ( For Manoah did not know He was the Angel of the Lord . )
NKJV	Judges	13	17	Then Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord , “ What is Your name , that when Your words come to pass we may honor You ? ”
NKJV	Judges	13	18	And the Angel of the Lord said to him , ( O ) “ Why do you ask My name , seeing it is wonderful ? ”
NKJV	Judges	13	19	So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering , ( P ) and offered it upon the rock to the Lord . And He did a wondrous thing while Manoah and his wife looked on—
NKJV	Judges	13	20	it happened as the flame went up toward heaven from the altar—the Angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar ! When Manoah and his wife saw this , they ( Q ) fell on their faces to the ground .
NKJV	Judges	13	21	When the Angel of the Lord appeared no more to Manoah and his wife , ( R ) then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of the Lord .
NKJV	Judges	13	22	And Manoah said to his wife , ( S ) “ We shall surely die , because we have seen God ! ”
NKJV	Judges	13	23	But his wife said to him , “ If the Lord had desired to kill us , He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands , nor would He have shown us all these things , nor would He have told us such things as these at this time. ”
NKJV	Judges	13	24	So the woman bore a son and called his name ( T ) Samson ; and ( U ) the child grew , and the Lord blessed him .
NKJV	Judges	13	25	( V ) And the Spirit of the Lord began to move upon him at [ b ] Mahaneh Dan ( W ) between Zorah and ( X ) Eshtaol . Footnotes - Judges 13:6 appearance - Judges 13:25 Lit . Camp of Dan , Judg . 18:12 Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Judges	14	14	So he said to them : “ Out of the eater came something to eat , And out of the strong came something sweet. ” Now for three days they could not explain the riddle .
NKJV	Judges	14	2	So he went up and told his father and mother , saying , “ I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines ; now therefore , ( C ) get her for me as a wife. ”
NKJV	Judges	14	3	Then his father and mother said to him , “ Is there no woman among the daughters of ( D ) your brethren , or among all my people , that you must go and get a wife from the ( E ) uncircumcised Philistines ? ” And Samson said to his father , “ Get her for me , for [ a ] she pleases me well. ”
NKJV	Judges	14	4	But his father and mother did not know that it was ( F ) of the Lord—that He was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines . For at that time ( G ) the Philistines had dominion over Israel .
NKJV	Judges	14	5	So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother , and came to the vineyards of Timnah . Now to his surprise , a young lion came roaring against him .
NKJV	Judges	14	6	And ( H ) the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him , and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat , though he had nothing in his hand . But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done .
NKJV	Judges	14	7	Then he went down and talked with the woman ; and she pleased Samson well .
NKJV	Judges	14	8	After some time , when he returned to get her , he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion . And behold , a swarm of bees and honey were in the carcass of the lion .
NKJV	Judges	14	9	He took some of it in his hands and went along , eating . When he came to his father and mother , he gave some to them , and they also ate . But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the ( I ) carcass of the lion .
NKJV	Judges	14	10	So his father went down to the woman . And Samson gave a feast there , for young men used to do so .
NKJV	Judges	14	11	And it happened , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
NKJV	Judges	14	12	Then Samson said to them , “ Let me ( J ) pose a riddle to you . If you can correctly solve and explain it to me ( K ) within the seven days of the feast , then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty ( L ) changes of clothing .
NKJV	Judges	14	13	But if you can not explain it to me , then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. ” And they said to him , ( M ) “ Pose your riddle , that we may hear it. ”
NKJV	Judges	14	15	But it came to pass on the [ b ] seventh day that they said to Samson ’ s wife , ( N ) “ Entice your husband , that he may explain the riddle to us , ( O ) or else we will burn you and your father ’ s house with fire . Have you invited us in order to take what is ours ? Is that not so ? ”
NKJV	Judges	14	16	Then Samson ’ s wife wept on him , and said , ( P ) “ You only hate me ! You do not love me ! You have posed a riddle to the sons of my people , but you have not explained it to me. ” And he said to her , “ Look , I have not explained it to my father or my mother ; so should I explain it to you ? ”
NKJV	Judges	14	17	Now she had wept on him the seven days while their feast lasted . And it happened on the seventh day that he told her , because she pressed him so much . Then she explained the riddle to the sons of her people .
NKJV	Judges	14	18	So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down : “ What is sweeter than honey ? And what is stronger than a lion ? ” And he said to them : “ If you had not plowed with my heifer , You would not have solved my riddle ! ”
NKJV	Judges	14	19	Then ( Q ) the Spirit of the Lord came upon him mightily , and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of their men , took their apparel , and gave the changes of clothing to those who had explained the riddle . So his anger was aroused , and he went back up to his father ’ s house .
NKJV	Judges	14	20	And Samson ’ s wife ( R ) was given to his companion , who had been ( S ) his best man . Footnotes - Judges 14:3 Lit . she is right in my eyes - Judges 14:15 So with MT , Tg. , Vg . ; LXX , Syr . fourth Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Judges	15	15	He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey , reached out his hand and took it , and ( I ) killed a thousand men with it .
NKJV	Judges	15	2	Her father said , “ I really thought that you thoroughly ( B ) hated her ; therefore I gave her to your companion . Is not her younger sister better than she ? Please , take her instead. ”
NKJV	Judges	15	3	And Samson said to them , “ This time I shall be blameless regarding the Philistines if I harm them ! ”
NKJV	Judges	15	4	Then Samson went and caught three hundred foxes ; and he took torches , turned the foxes tail to tail , and put a torch between each pair of tails .
NKJV	Judges	15	5	When he had set the torches on fire , he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines , and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain , as well as the vineyards and olive groves .
NKJV	Judges	15	6	Then the Philistines said , “ Who has done this ? ” And they answered , “ Samson , the son-in-law of the Timnite , because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion. ” ( C ) So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire .
NKJV	Judges	15	7	Samson said to them , “ Since you would do a thing like this , I will surely take revenge on you , and after that I will cease. ”
NKJV	Judges	15	8	So he attacked them hip and thigh with a great slaughter ; then he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of ( D ) Etam .
NKJV	Judges	15	9	Now the Philistines went up , encamped in Judah , and deployed themselves ( E ) against Lehi .
NKJV	Judges	15	10	And the men of Judah said , “ Why have you come up against us ? ” So they answered , “ We have come up to [ a ] arrest Samson , to do to him as he has done to us. ”
NKJV	Judges	15	11	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam , and said to Samson , “ Do you not know that the Philistines ( F ) rule over us ? What is this you have done to us ? ” And he said to them , “ As they did to me , so I have done to them. ”
NKJV	Judges	15	12	But they said to him , “ We have come down to arrest you , that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. ” Then Samson said to them , “ Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves. ”
NKJV	Judges	15	13	So they spoke to him , saying , “ No , but we will tie you securely and deliver you into their hand ; but we will surely not kill you. ” And they bound him with two ( G ) new ropes and brought him up from the rock .
NKJV	Judges	15	14	When he came to Lehi , the Philistines came shouting against him . Then ( H ) the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him ; and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that is burned with fire , and his bonds [ b ] broke loose from his hands .
NKJV	Judges	15	16	Then Samson said : “ With the jawbone of a donkey , Heaps upon heaps , With the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men ! ”
NKJV	Judges	15	17	And so it was , when he had finished speaking , that he threw the jawbone from his hand , and called that place [ c ] Ramath Lehi .
NKJV	Judges	15	18	Then he became very thirsty ; so he cried out to the Lord and said , ( J ) “ You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant ; and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ? ”
NKJV	Judges	15	19	So God split the hollow place that is in [ d ] Lehi , and water came out , and he drank ; and ( K ) his spirit returned , and he revived . Therefore he called its name [ e ] En Hakkore , which is in Lehi to this day .

NKJV	Judges	16	16	And it came to pass , when she pestered him daily with her words and pressed him , so that his soul was [ b ] vexed to death ,
NKJV	Judges	16	2	When the Gazites were told , “ Samson has come here ! ” they ( B ) surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city . They were quiet all night , saying , “ In the morning , when it is daylight , we will kill him. ”
NKJV	Judges	16	3	And Samson lay low till midnight ; then he arose at midnight , took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two gateposts , pulled them up , bar and all , put them on his shoulders , and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron .
NKJV	Judges	16	4	Afterward it happened that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
NKJV	Judges	16	5	And the ( C ) lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her , ( D ) “ Entice him , and find out where his great strength lies , and by what means we may overpower him , that we may bind him to afflict him ; and every one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver. ”
NKJV	Judges	16	6	So Delilah said to Samson , “ Please tell me where your great strength lies , and with what you may be bound to afflict you. ”
NKJV	Judges	16	7	And Samson said to her , “ If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings , not yet dried , then I shall become weak , and be like any other man. ”
NKJV	Judges	16	8	So the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings , not yet dried , and she bound him with them .
NKJV	Judges	16	9	Now men were lying in wait , staying with her in the room . And she said to him , “ The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! ” But he broke the bowstrings as a strand of yarn breaks when it touches fire . So the secret of his strength was not known .
NKJV	Judges	16	10	Then Delilah said to Samson , “ Look , you have mocked me and told me lies . Now , please tell me what you may be bound with. ”
NKJV	Judges	16	11	So he said to her , “ If they bind me securely with ( E ) new ropes [ a ] that have never been used , then I shall become weak , and be like any other man. ”
NKJV	Judges	16	12	Therefore Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them , and said to him , “ The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! ” And men were lying in wait , staying in the room . But he broke them off his arms like a thread .
NKJV	Judges	16	13	Delilah said to Samson , “ Until now you have mocked me and told me lies . Tell me what you may be bound with. ” And he said to her , “ If you weave the seven locks of my head into the web of the loom ” —
NKJV	Judges	16	14	So she wove it tightly with the batten of the loom , and said to him , “ The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! ” But he awoke from his sleep , and pulled out the batten and the web from the loom .
NKJV	Judges	16	15	Then she said to him , ( F ) “ How can you say , ‘ I love you , ’ when your heart is not with me ? You have mocked me these three times , and have not told me where your great strength lies. ”
NKJV	Judges	16	17	that he ( G ) told her all his heart , and said to her , ( H ) “ No razor has ever come upon my head , for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother ’ s womb . If I am shaven , then my strength will leave me , and I shall become weak , and be like any other man. ”
NKJV	Judges	16	18	When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart , she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines , saying , “ Come up once more , for he has told me all his heart. ” So the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand .
NKJV	Judges	16	19	( I ) Then she lulled him to sleep on her knees , and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head . Then [ c ] she began to torment him , and his strength left him .
NKJV	Judges	16	20	And she said , “ The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! ” So he awoke from his sleep , and said , “ I will go out as before , at other times , and shake myself free ! ” But he did not know that the Lord ( J ) had departed from him .
NKJV	Judges	16	21	Then the Philistines took him and [ d ] put out his ( K ) eyes , and brought him down to Gaza . They bound him with bronze fetters , and he became a grinder in the prison .
NKJV	Judges	16	22	However , the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaven . Samson Dies with the Philistines
NKJV	Judges	16	23	Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to ( L ) Dagon their god , and to rejoice . And they said : “ Our god has delivered into our hands Samson our enemy ! ”
NKJV	Judges	16	24	When the people saw him , they ( M ) praised their god ; for they said : “ Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy , The destroyer of our land , And the one who multiplied our dead. ”
NKJV	Judges	16	25	So it happened , when their hearts were ( N ) merry , that they said , “ Call for Samson , that he may perform for us. ” So they called for Samson from the prison , and he performed for them . And they stationed him between the pillars .
NKJV	Judges	16	26	Then Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand , “ Let me feel the pillars which support the temple , so that I can lean on them. ”
NKJV	Judges	16	27	Now the temple was full of men and women . All the lords of the Philistines were there—about three thousand men and women on the ( O ) roof watching while Samson performed .
NKJV	Judges	16	28	Then Samson called to the Lord , saying , “ O Lord God , ( P ) remember me , I pray ! Strengthen me , I pray , just this once , O God , that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes ! ”
NKJV	Judges	16	29	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars which supported the temple , and he braced himself against them , one on his right and the other on his left .
NKJV	Judges	16	30	Then Samson said , “ Let me die with the Philistines ! ” And he pushed with all his might , and the temple fell on the lords and all the people who were in it . So the dead that he killed at his death were more than he had killed in his life .
NKJV	Judges	16	31	And his brothers and all his father ’ s household came down and took him , and brought him up and ( Q ) buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah . He had judged Israel ( R ) twenty years .

NKJV	Judges	17	17	Now there was a man from the mountains of Ephraim , whose name was ( A ) Micah .
NKJV	Judges	17	2	And he said to his mother , “ The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you , and on which you ( B ) put a curse , even saying it in my ears—here is the silver with me ; I took it. ” And his mother said , ( C ) “ May you be blessed by the Lord , my son ! ”
NKJV	Judges	17	3	So when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother , his mother said , “ I had wholly dedicated the silver from my hand to the Lord for my son , to ( D ) make a carved image and a molded image ; now therefore , I will return it to you. ”
NKJV	Judges	17	4	Thus he returned the silver to his mother . Then his mother ( E ) took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the silversmith , and he made it into a carved image and a molded image ; and they were in the house of Micah .
NKJV	Judges	17	5	The man Micah had a ( F ) shrine , and made an ( G ) ephod and ( H ) household [ a ] idols ; and he consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest .
NKJV	Judges	17	6	( I ) In those days there was no king in Israel ; ( J ) everyone did what was right in his own eyes .
NKJV	Judges	17	7	Now there was a young man from ( K ) Bethlehem in Judah , of the family of Judah ; he was a Levite , and ( L ) was staying there .
NKJV	Judges	17	8	The man departed from the city of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could find a place . Then he came to the mountains of Ephraim , to the house of Micah , as he journeyed .
NKJV	Judges	17	9	And Micah said to him , “ Where do you come from ? ” So he said to him , “ I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah , and I am on my way to find a place to stay. ”
NKJV	Judges	17	10	Micah said to him , “ Dwell with me , ( M ) and be a ( N ) father and a priest to me , and I will give you ten shekels of silver per year , a suit of clothes , and your sustenance. ” So the Levite went in .
NKJV	Judges	17	11	Then the Levite was content to dwell with the man ; and the young man became like one of his sons to him .
NKJV	Judges	17	12	So Micah ( O ) consecrated [ b ] the Levite , and the young man ( P ) became his priest , and lived in the house of Micah .
NKJV	Judges	17	13	Then Micah said , “ Now I know that the Lord will be good to me , since I have a Levite as ( Q ) priest ! ” Footnotes - Judges 17:5 Heb . teraphim - Judges 17:12 Lit . filled the hand of Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Judges	18	18	When these went into Micah ’ s house and took the carved image , the ephod , the household idols , and the molded image , the priest said to them , “ What are you doing ? ”
NKJV	Judges	18	2	So the children of Dan sent five men of their family from their territory , men of valor from ( C ) Zorah and Eshtaol , ( D ) to spy out the land and search it . They said to them , “ Go , search the land. ” So they went to the mountains of Ephraim , to the ( E ) house of Micah , and lodged there .
NKJV	Judges	18	3	While they were at the house of Micah , they recognized the voice of the young Levite . They turned aside and said to him , “ Who brought you here ? What are you doing in this place ? What do you have here ? ”
NKJV	Judges	18	4	He said to them , “ Thus and so Micah did for me . He has ( F ) hired me , and I have become his priest. ”
NKJV	Judges	18	5	So they said to him , “ Please ( G ) inquire ( H ) of God , that we may know whether the journey on which we go will be prosperous. ”
NKJV	Judges	18	6	And the priest said to them , ( I ) “ Go in peace . [ a ] The presence of the Lord be with you on your way. ”
NKJV	Judges	18	7	So the five men departed and went to ( J ) Laish . They saw the people who were there , ( K ) how they dwelt safely , in the manner of the Sidonians , quiet and secure . There were no rulers in the land who might put them to shame for anything . They were far from the ( L ) Sidonians , and they had no ties [ b ] with anyone .
NKJV	Judges	18	8	Then the spies came back to their brethren at ( M ) Zorah and Eshtaol , and their brethren said to them , “ What is your report ? ”
NKJV	Judges	18	9	So they said , ( N ) “ Arise , let us go up against them . For we have seen the land , and indeed it is very good . Would you ( O ) do nothing ? Do not hesitate to go , and enter to possess the land .
NKJV	Judges	18	10	When you go , you will come to a ( P ) secure people and a large land . For God has given it into your hands , ( Q ) a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth. ”
NKJV	Judges	18	11	And six hundred men of the family of the Danites went from there , from Zorah and Eshtaol , armed with weapons of war .
NKJV	Judges	18	12	Then they went up and encamped in ( R ) Kirjath Jearim in Judah . ( Therefore they call that place ( S ) Mahaneh Dan [ c ] to this day . There it is , west of Kirjath Jearim . )
NKJV	Judges	18	13	And they passed from there to the mountains of Ephraim , and came to ( T ) the house of Micah .
NKJV	Judges	18	14	( U ) Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brethren , “ Do you know that ( V ) there are in these houses an ephod , household idols , a carved image , and a molded image ? Now therefore , consider what you should do. ”
NKJV	Judges	18	15	So they turned aside there , and came to the house of the young Levite man—to the house of Micah—and greeted him .
NKJV	Judges	18	16	The ( W ) six hundred men armed with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
NKJV	Judges	18	17	Then ( X ) the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up . Entering there , they took ( Y ) the carved image , the ephod , the household idols , and the molded image . The priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men who were armed with weapons of war .
NKJV	Judges	18	19	And they said to him , “ Be quiet , ( Z ) put your hand over your mouth , and come with us ; ( AA ) be a father and a priest to us . Is it better for you to be a priest to the household of one man , or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel ? ”
NKJV	Judges	18	20	So the priest ’ s heart was glad ; and he took the ephod , the household idols , and the carved image , and took his place among the people .
NKJV	Judges	18	21	Then they turned and departed , and put the little ones , the livestock , and the goods in front of them .
NKJV	Judges	18	22	When they were a good way from the house of Micah , the men who were in the houses near Micah ’ s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan .
NKJV	Judges	18	23	And they called out to the children of Dan . So they turned around and said to Micah , ( AB ) “ What ails you , that you have gathered such a company ? ”
NKJV	Judges	18	24	So he said , “ You have ( AC ) taken away my [ d ] gods which I made , and the priest , and you have gone away . Now what more do I have ? How can you say to me , ‘ What ails you ? ’ ”
NKJV	Judges	18	25	And the children of Dan said to him , “ Do not let your voice be heard among us , lest [ e ] angry men fall upon you , and you lose your life , with the lives of your household ! ”
NKJV	Judges	18	26	Then the children of Dan went their way . And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his house . Danites Settle in Laish
NKJV	Judges	18	27	So they took the things Micah had made , and the priest who had belonged to him , and went to Laish , to a people quiet and secure ; ( AD ) and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire .
NKJV	Judges	18	28	There was no deliverer , because it was ( AE ) far from Sidon , and they had no ties with anyone . It was in the valley that belongs ( AF ) to Beth Rehob . So they rebuilt the city and dwelt there .
NKJV	Judges	18	29	And ( AG ) they called the name of the city ( AH ) Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel . However , the name of the city formerly was Laish .
NKJV	Judges	18	30	Then the children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image ; and Jonathan the son of Gershom , the son of [ f ] Manasseh , and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan ( AI ) until the day of the captivity of the land .
NKJV	Judges	18	31	So they set up for themselves Micah ’ s carved image which he made , ( AJ ) all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh . Footnotes - Judges 18:6 Lit .

NKJV	Judges	19	19	although we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys , and bread and wine for myself , for your female servant , and for the young man who is with your servant ; there is no lack of anything. ”
NKJV	Judges	19	2	But his concubine played the harlot against him , and went away from him to her father ’ s house at Bethlehem in Judah , and was there four whole months .
NKJV	Judges	19	3	Then her husband arose and went after her , to ( C ) speak [ a ] kindly to her and bring her back , having his servant and a couple of donkeys with him . So she brought him into her father ’ s house ; and when the father of the young woman saw him , he was glad to meet him .
NKJV	Judges	19	4	Now his father-in-law , the young woman ’ s father , detained him ; and he stayed with him three days . So they ate and drank and lodged there .
NKJV	Judges	19	5	Then it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning , and he stood to depart ; but the young woman ’ s father said to his son-in-law , ( D ) “ Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go your way. ”
NKJV	Judges	19	6	So they sat down , and the two of them ate and drank together . Then the young woman ’ s father said to the man , “ Please be content to stay all night , and let your heart be merry. ”
NKJV	Judges	19	7	And when the man stood to depart , his father-in-law urged him ; so he lodged there again .
NKJV	Judges	19	8	Then he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart , but the young woman ’ s father said , “ Please refresh your heart. ” So they delayed until afternoon ; and both of them ate .
NKJV	Judges	19	9	And when the man stood to depart—he and his concubine and his servant—his father-in-law , the young woman ’ s father , said to him , “ Look , the day is now drawing toward evening ; please spend the night . See , the day is coming to an end ; lodge here , that your heart may be merry . Tomorrow go your way early , so that you may get [ b ] home. ”
NKJV	Judges	19	10	However , the man was not willing to spend that night ; so he rose and departed , and came opposite ( E ) Jebus ( that is , Jerusalem ) . With him were the two saddled donkeys ; his concubine was also with him .
NKJV	Judges	19	11	They were near Jebus , and the day was far spent ; and the servant said to his master , “ Come , please , and let us turn aside into this city ( F ) of the Jebusites and lodge in it. ”
NKJV	Judges	19	12	But his master said to him , “ We will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners , who are not of the children of Israel ; we will go on ( G ) to Gibeah. ”
NKJV	Judges	19	13	So he said to his servant , “ Come , let us draw near to one of these places , and spend the night in Gibeah or in ( H ) Ramah. ”
NKJV	Judges	19	14	And they passed by and went their way ; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah , which belongs to Benjamin .
NKJV	Judges	19	15	They turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah . And when he went in , he sat down in the open square of the city , for no one would ( I ) take them into his house to spend the night .
NKJV	Judges	19	16	Just then an old man came in from ( J ) his work in the field at evening , who also was from the mountains of Ephraim ; he was staying in Gibeah , whereas the men of the place were Benjamites .
NKJV	Judges	19	17	And when he raised his eyes , he saw the traveler in the open square of the city ; and the old man said , “ Where are you going , and where do you come from ? ”
NKJV	Judges	19	18	So he said to him , “ We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the remote mountains of Ephraim ; I am from there . I went to Bethlehem in Judah ; now I am going to ( K ) the house of the Lord . But there is no one who will take me into his house ,
NKJV	Judges	19	20	And the old man said , ( L ) “ Peace be with you ! However , let all your needs be my responsibility ; ( M ) only do not spend the night in the open square. ”
NKJV	Judges	19	21	( N ) So he brought him into his house , and gave fodder to the donkeys . ( O ) And they washed their feet , and ate and drank . Gibeah ’ s Crime
NKJV	Judges	19	22	As they were ( P ) enjoying themselves , suddenly ( Q ) certain men of the city , ( R ) perverted [ c ] men , surrounded the house and beat on the door . They spoke to the master of the house , the old man , saying , ( S ) “ Bring out the man who came to your house , that we may know him carnally ! ”
NKJV	Judges	19	23	But ( T ) the man , the master of the house , went out to them and said to them , “ No , my brethren ! I beg you , do not act so wickedly ! Seeing this man has come into my house , ( U ) do not commit this outrage .
NKJV	Judges	19	24	( V ) Look , here is my virgin daughter and [ d ] the man ’ s concubine ; let me bring them out now . ( W ) Humble them , and do with them as you please ; but to this man do not do such a vile thing ! ”
NKJV	Judges	19	25	But the men would not heed him . So the man took his concubine and brought her out to them . And they ( X ) knew her and abused her all night until morning ; and when the day began to break , they let her go .
NKJV	Judges	19	26	Then the woman came as the day was dawning , and fell down at the door of the man ’ s house where her master was , till it was light .
NKJV	Judges	19	27	When her master arose in the morning , and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way , there was his concubine , fallen at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold .
NKJV	Judges	19	28	And he said to her , “ Get up and let us be going. ” But ( Y ) there was no answer . So the man lifted her onto the donkey ; and the man got up and went to his place .
NKJV	Judges	19	29	When he entered his house he took a knife , laid hold of his concubine , and ( Z ) divided her into twelve pieces , [ e ] limb by limb , and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel .
NKJV	Judges	19	30	And so it was that all who saw it said , “ No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up from the land of Egypt until this day .

NKJV	Judges	20	20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin , and the men of Israel put themselves in battle array to fight against them at Gibeah .
NKJV	Judges	20	2	And the leaders of all the people , all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand foot soldiers ( E ) who drew the sword .
NKJV	Judges	20	3	( Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . ) Then the children of Israel said , “ Tell us , how did this wicked deed happen ? ”
NKJV	Judges	20	4	So the Levite , the husband of the woman who was murdered , answered and said , “ My concubine and ( F ) I went into Gibeah , which belongs to Benjamin , to spend the night .
NKJV	Judges	20	5	( G ) And the men of Gibeah rose against me , and surrounded the house at night because of me . They intended to kill me , ( H ) but instead they ravished my concubine so that she died .
NKJV	Judges	20	6	So ( I ) I took hold of my concubine , cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel , because they ( J ) committed lewdness and outrage in Israel .
NKJV	Judges	20	7	Look ! All of you are children of Israel ; ( K ) give your advice and counsel here and now ! ”
NKJV	Judges	20	8	So all the people arose as one man , saying , “ None of us will go to his tent , nor will any turn back to his house ;
NKJV	Judges	20	9	but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah : We will go up ( L ) against it by lot .
NKJV	Judges	20	10	We will take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel , a hundred out of every thousand , and a thousand out of every ten thousand , to make provisions for the people , that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin , they may repay all the vileness that they have done in Israel. ”
NKJV	Judges	20	11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , united together as one man .
NKJV	Judges	20	12	( M ) Then the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , “ What is this wickedness that has occurred among you ?
NKJV	Judges	20	13	Now therefore , deliver up the men , ( N ) the [ a ] perverted men who are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death and ( O ) remove the evil from Israel ! ” But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren , the children of Israel .
NKJV	Judges	20	14	Instead , the children of Benjamin gathered together from their cities to Gibeah , to go to battle against the children of Israel .
NKJV	Judges	20	15	And from their cities at that time ( P ) the children of Benjamin numbered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword , besides the inhabitants of Gibeah , who numbered seven hundred select men .
NKJV	Judges	20	16	Among all this people were seven hundred select men who were ( Q ) left-handed ; every one could sling a stone at a hair ’ s breadth and not miss .
NKJV	Judges	20	17	Now besides Benjamin , the men of Israel numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword ; all of these were men of war .
NKJV	Judges	20	18	Then the children of Israel arose and ( R ) went up to [ b ] the house of God to ( S ) inquire of God . They said , “ Which of us shall go up first to battle against the children of Benjamin ? ” The Lord said , ( T ) “ Judah first ! ”
NKJV	Judges	20	19	So the children of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah .
NKJV	Judges	20	21	Then ( U ) the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah , and on that day cut down to the ground twenty-two thousand men of the Israelites .
NKJV	Judges	20	22	And the people , that is , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves and again formed the battle line at the place where they had put themselves in array on the first day .
NKJV	Judges	20	23	( V ) Then the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until evening , and asked counsel of the Lord , saying , “ Shall I again draw near for battle against the children of my brother Benjamin ? ” And the Lord said , “ Go up against him. ”
NKJV	Judges	20	24	So the children of Israel approached the children of Benjamin on the second day .
NKJV	Judges	20	25	And ( W ) Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day , and cut down to the ground eighteen thousand more of the children of Israel ; all these drew the sword .
NKJV	Judges	20	26	Then all the children of Israel , that is , all the people , ( X ) went up and came to [ c ] the house of God and wept . They sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening ; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
NKJV	Judges	20	27	So the children of Israel inquired of the Lord ( ( Y ) the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days ,
NKJV	Judges	20	28	( Z ) and Phinehas the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , ( AA ) stood before it in those days ) , saying , “ Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of my brother Benjamin , or shall I cease ? ” And the Lord said , “ Go up , for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand. ”
NKJV	Judges	20	29	Then Israel ( AB ) set men in ambush all around Gibeah .
NKJV	Judges	20	30	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times .
NKJV	Judges	20	31	So the children of Benjamin went out against the people , and were drawn away from the city . They began to strike down and kill some of the people , as at the other times , in the highways ( AC ) ( one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah ) and in the field , about thirty men of Israel .
NKJV	Judges	20	32	And the children of Benjamin said , “ They are defeated before us , as at first. ” But the children of Israel said , “ Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways. ”
NKJV	Judges	20	33	So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar . Then Israel ’ s men in ambush burst forth from their position in the plain of Geba .
NKJV	Judges	20	34	And ten thousand select men from all Israel came against Gibeah , and the battle was fierce . ( AD ) But [ d ] the Benjamites did not know that disaster was upon them .
NKJV	Judges	20	35	The Lord [ e ] defeated Benjamin before Israel . And the children of Israel destroyed that day twenty-five thousand one hundred Benjamites ; all these drew the sword .
NKJV	Judges	20	36	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated . ( AE ) The men of Israel had given ground to the Benjamites , because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah .
NKJV	Judges	20	37	( AF ) And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah ; the men in ambush spread out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword .
NKJV	Judges	20	38	Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of ( AG ) smoke rise up from the city ,
NKJV	Judges	20	39	whereupon the men of Israel would turn in battle . Now Benjamin had begun [ f ] to strike and kill about thirty of the men of Israel . For they said , “ Surely they are defeated before us , as in the first battle. ”
NKJV	Judges	20	40	But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke , the Benjamites ( AH ) looked behind them , and there was the whole city going up in smoke to heaven .
NKJV	Judges	20	41	And when the men of Israel turned back , the men of Benjamin panicked , for they saw that disaster had come upon them .
NKJV	Judges	20	42	Therefore they [ g ] turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness ; but the battle overtook them , and whoever came out of the cities they destroyed in their midst .
NKJV	Judges	20	43	They surrounded the Benjamites , chased them , and easily trampled them down as far as the front of Gibeah toward the east .
NKJV	Judges	20	44	And eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell ; all these were men of valor .
NKJV	Judges	20	45	Then [ h ] they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of ( AI ) Rimmon ; and they cut down five thousand of them on the highways . Then they pursued them relentlessly up to Gidom , and killed two thousand of them .
NKJV	Judges	20	46	So all who fell of Benjamin that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword ; all these were [ i ] men of valor .
NKJV	Judges	20	47	( AJ ) But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon , and they stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months .
NKJV	Judges	20	48	And the men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin , and struck them down with the edge of the sword—from every city , men and beasts , all who were found . They also set fire to all the cities they came to .

NKJV	Judges	21	21	and watch ; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out ( O ) to perform their dances , then come out from the vineyards , and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh ; then go to the land of Benjamin .
NKJV	Judges	21	2	Then the people came ( B ) to [ a ] the house of God , and remained there before God till evening . They lifted up their voices and wept bitterly ,
NKJV	Judges	21	3	and said , “ O Lord God of Israel , why has this come to pass in Israel , that today there should be one tribe missing in Israel ? ”
NKJV	Judges	21	4	So it was , on the next morning , that the people rose early and ( C ) built an altar there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
NKJV	Judges	21	5	The children of Israel said , “ Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to the Lord ? ” ( D ) For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the Lord at Mizpah , saying , “ He shall surely be put to death. ”
NKJV	Judges	21	6	And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother , and said , “ One tribe is cut off from Israel today .
NKJV	Judges	21	7	What shall we do for wives for those who remain , seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters as wives ? ”
NKJV	Judges	21	8	And they said , “ What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord ? ” And , in fact , no one had come to the camp from ( E ) Jabesh Gilead to the assembly .
NKJV	Judges	21	9	For when the people were counted , indeed , not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there .
NKJV	Judges	21	10	So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men , and commanded them , saying , ( F ) “ Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword , including the women and children .
NKJV	Judges	21	11	And this is the thing that you shall do : ( G ) You shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman who has known a man intimately. ”
NKJV	Judges	21	12	So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately ; and they brought them to the camp at ( H ) Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
NKJV	Judges	21	13	Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin ( I ) who were at the rock of Rimmon , and announced peace to them .
NKJV	Judges	21	14	So Benjamin came back at that time , and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead ; and yet they had not found enough for them .
NKJV	Judges	21	15	And the people ( J ) grieved for Benjamin , because the Lord had made a void in the tribes of Israel .
NKJV	Judges	21	16	Then the elders of the congregation said , “ What shall we do for wives for those who remain , since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed ? ”
NKJV	Judges	21	17	And they said , “ There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin , that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel .
NKJV	Judges	21	18	However , we can not give them wives from our daughters , ( K ) for the children of Israel have sworn an oath , saying , ‘ Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin. ’ ”
NKJV	Judges	21	19	Then they said , “ In fact , there is a yearly ( L ) feast of the Lord in ( M ) Shiloh , which is north of Bethel , on the east side of the ( N ) highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem , and south of Lebonah. ”
NKJV	Judges	21	20	Therefore they instructed the children of Benjamin , saying , “ Go , lie in wait in the vineyards ,
NKJV	Judges	21	22	Then it shall be , when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain , that we will say to them , ‘ Be kind to them for our sakes , because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war ; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time , making yourselves guilty of your oath. ’ ”
NKJV	Judges	21	23	And the children of Benjamin did so ; they took enough wives for their number from those who danced , whom they caught . Then they went and returned to their inheritance , and they ( P ) rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them .
NKJV	Judges	21	24	So the children of Israel departed from there at that time , every man to his tribe and family ; they went out from there , every man to his inheritance .

NKJV	Ruth	1	1	Now it came to pass , in the days when ( A ) the judges [ a ] ruled , that there was ( B ) a famine in the land . And a certain man of ( C ) Bethlehem , Judah , went to [ b ] dwell in the country of ( D ) Moab , he and his wife and his two sons .
NKJV	Ruth	1	2	The name of the man was Elimelech , the name of his wife was Naomi , and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion— ( E ) Ephrathites of Bethlehem , Judah . And they went ( F ) to the country of Moab and remained there .
NKJV	Ruth	1	3	Then Elimelech , Naomi ’ s husband , died ; and she was left , and her two sons .
NKJV	Ruth	1	4	Now they took wives of the women of Moab : the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth . And they [ c ] dwelt there about ten years .
NKJV	Ruth	1	5	Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died ; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband . Naomi Returns with Ruth
NKJV	Ruth	1	6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab , for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had ( G ) visited [ d ] His people by ( H ) giving them bread .
NKJV	Ruth	1	7	Therefore she went out from the place where she was , and her two daughters-in-law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah .
NKJV	Ruth	1	8	And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law , ( I ) “ Go , return each to her mother ’ s house . ( J ) The Lord deal kindly with you , as you have dealt ( K ) with the dead and with me .
NKJV	Ruth	1	9	The Lord grant that you may find ( L ) rest , each in the house of her husband. ” So she kissed them , and they lifted up their voices and wept .
NKJV	Ruth	1	10	And they said to her , “ Surely we will return with you to your people. ”
NKJV	Ruth	1	11	But Naomi said , “ Turn back , my daughters ; why will you go with me ? Are there still sons in my womb , ( M ) that they may be your husbands ?
NKJV	Ruth	1	12	Turn back , my daughters , go—for I am too old to have a husband . If I should say I have hope , if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons ,
NKJV	Ruth	1	13	would you wait for them till they were grown ? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands ? No , my daughters ; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that ( N ) the hand of the Lord has gone out against me ! ”
NKJV	Ruth	1	14	Then they lifted up their voices and wept again ; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law , but Ruth ( O ) clung to her .
NKJV	Ruth	1	15	And she said , “ Look , your sister-in-law has gone back to ( P ) her people and to her gods ; ( Q ) return after your sister-in-law. ”
NKJV	Ruth	1	16	But Ruth said : ( R ) “ Entreat [ e ] me not to leave you , Or to turn back from following after you ; For wherever you go , I will go ; And wherever you lodge , I will lodge ; ( S ) Your people shall be my people , And your God , my God .
NKJV	Ruth	1	17	Where you die , I will die , And there will I be buried . ( T ) The Lord do so to me , and more also , If anything but death parts you and me. ”
NKJV	Ruth	1	18	( U ) When she saw that she [ f ] was determined to go with her , she stopped speaking to her .
NKJV	Ruth	1	19	Now the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem . And it happened , when they had come to Bethlehem , that ( V ) all the city was excited because of them ; and the women said , ( W ) “ Is this Naomi ? ”
NKJV	Ruth	1	20	But she said to them , “ Do not call me [ g ] Naomi ; call me [ h ] Mara , for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me .
NKJV	Ruth	1	21	I went out full , ( X ) and the Lord has brought me home again empty . Why do you call me Naomi , since the Lord has testified against me , and [ i ] the Almighty has afflicted me ? ”
NKJV	Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her , who returned from the country of Moab . Now they came to Bethlehem ( Y ) at the beginning of barley harvest . Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Ruth	2	2	So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi , “ Please let me go to the ( D ) field , and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I may find favor. ” And she said to her , “ Go , my daughter. ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	3	Then she left , and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers . And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz , who was of the family of Elimelech .
NKJV	Ruth	2	4	Now behold , Boaz came from ( E ) Bethlehem , and said to the reapers , ( F ) “ The Lord be with you ! ” And they answered him , “ The Lord bless you ! ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	5	Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers , “ Whose young woman is this ? ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	6	So the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered and said , “ It is the young Moabite woman ( G ) who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab .
NKJV	Ruth	2	7	And she said , ‘ Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. ’ So she came and has continued from morning until now , though she rested a little in the house. ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	8	Then Boaz said to Ruth , “ You will listen , my daughter , will you not ? Do not go to glean in another field , nor go from here , but stay close by my young women .
NKJV	Ruth	2	9	Let your eyes be on the field which they reap , and go after them . Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you ? And when you are thirsty , go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn. ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	10	So she ( H ) fell on her face , bowed down to the ground , and said to him , “ Why have I found ( I ) favor in your eyes , that you should take notice of me , since I am a foreigner ? ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	11	And Boaz answered and said to her , “ It has been fully reported to me , ( J ) all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband , and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth , and have come to a people whom you did not know before .
NKJV	Ruth	2	12	( K ) The Lord repay your work , and a full reward be given you by the Lord God of Israel , ( L ) under whose wings you have come for refuge. ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	13	Then she said , ( M ) “ Let me find favor in your sight , my lord ; for you have comforted me , and have spoken [ a ] kindly to your maidservant , ( N ) though I am not like one of your maidservants. ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	14	Now Boaz said to her at mealtime , “ Come here , and eat of the bread , and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar. ” So she sat beside the reapers , and he passed parched grain to her ; and she ate and ( O ) was satisfied , and kept some back .
NKJV	Ruth	2	15	And when she rose up to [ b ] glean , Boaz commanded his young men , saying , “ Let her glean even among the sheaves , and do not [ c ] reproach her .
NKJV	Ruth	2	16	Also let grain from the bundles fall purposely for her ; leave it that she may glean , and do not rebuke her. ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until evening , and beat out what she had gleaned , and it was about an ephah of ( P ) barley .
NKJV	Ruth	2	18	Then she took it up and went into the city , and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned . So she brought out and gave to her ( Q ) what she had kept back after she had been satisfied .
NKJV	Ruth	2	19	And her mother-in-law said to her , “ Where have you gleaned today ? And where did you work ? Blessed be the one who ( R ) took notice of you. ” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked , and said , “ The man ’ s name with whom I worked today is Boaz. ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	20	Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law , ( S ) “ Blessed be he of the Lord , who ( T ) has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead ! ” And Naomi said to her , “ This man is a relation of ours , ( U ) one of [ d ] our close relatives. ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	21	Ruth the Moabitess said , “ He also said to me , ‘ You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest. ’ ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	22	And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law , “ It is good , my daughter , that you go out with his young women , and that people do not [ e ] meet you in any other field. ”
NKJV	Ruth	2	23	So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz , to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest ; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law . Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Ruth	3	3	Therefore wash yourself and ( D ) anoint yourself , put on your best garment and go down to the threshing floor ; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
NKJV	Ruth	3	2	Now Boaz , ( C ) whose young women you were with , is he not our relative ? In fact , he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor .
NKJV	Ruth	3	4	Then it shall be , when he lies down , that you shall notice the place where he lies ; and you shall go in , uncover his feet , and lie down ; and he will tell you what you should do. ”
NKJV	Ruth	3	5	And she said to her , “ All that you say to me I will do. ”
NKJV	Ruth	3	6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law instructed her .
NKJV	Ruth	3	7	And after Boaz had eaten and drunk , and ( E ) his heart was cheerful , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain ; and she came softly , uncovered his feet , and lay down .
NKJV	Ruth	3	8	Now it happened at midnight that the man was startled , and turned himself ; and there , a woman was lying at his feet .
NKJV	Ruth	3	9	And he said , “ Who are you ? ” So she answered , “ I am Ruth , your maidservant . ( F ) Take [ b ] your maidservant under your wing , for you are ( G ) a [ c ] close relative. ”
NKJV	Ruth	3	10	Then he said , ( H ) “ Blessed are you of the Lord , my daughter ! For you have shown more kindness at the end than ( I ) at the beginning , in that you did not go after young men , whether poor or rich .
NKJV	Ruth	3	11	And now , my daughter , do not fear . I will do for you all that you request , for all the people of my town know that you are a ( J ) virtuous woman .
NKJV	Ruth	3	12	Now it is true that I am a ( K ) close relative ; however , ( L ) there is a relative closer than I .
NKJV	Ruth	3	13	Stay this night , and in the morning it shall be that if he will ( M ) perform the duty of a close relative for you—good ; let him do it . But if he does not want to perform the duty for you , then I will perform the duty for you , ( N ) as the Lord lives ! Lie down until morning. ”
NKJV	Ruth	3	14	So she lay at his feet until morning , and she arose before one could recognize another . Then he said , ( O ) “ Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor. ”
NKJV	Ruth	3	15	Also he said , “ Bring the [ d ] shawl that is on you and hold it. ” And when she held it , he measured six ephahs of barley , and laid it on her . Then [ e ] she went into the city .
NKJV	Ruth	3	16	When she came to her mother-in-law , she said , [ f ] “ Is that you , my daughter ? ” Then she told her all that the man had done for her .
NKJV	Ruth	3	17	And she said , “ These six ephahs of barley he gave me ; for he said to me , ‘ Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law. ’ ”
NKJV	Ruth	3	18	Then she said , ( P ) “ Sit still , my daughter , until you know how the matter will turn out ; for the man will not rest until he has concluded the matter this day. ” Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Ruth	4	4	And I thought to [ b ] inform you , saying , ( D ) ‘ Buy it back ( E ) in the presence of the inhabitants and the elders of my people . If you will redeem it , redeem it ; but if [ c ] you will not redeem it , then tell me , that I may know ; ( F ) for there is no one but you to redeem it , and I am next after you. ’ ” And he said , “ I will redeem it. ”
NKJV	Ruth	4	2	And he took ten men of ( B ) the elders of the city , and said , “ Sit down here. ” So they sat down .
NKJV	Ruth	4	3	Then he said to the close relative , “ Naomi , who has come back from the country of Moab , sold the piece of land ( C ) which belonged to our brother Elimelech .
NKJV	Ruth	4	5	Then Boaz said , “ On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi , you must also buy it from Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of the dead , ( G ) to [ d ] perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance. ”
NKJV	Ruth	4	6	( H ) And the close relative said , “ I can not redeem it for myself , lest I ruin my own inheritance . You redeem my right of redemption for yourself , for I can not redeem it. ”
NKJV	Ruth	4	7	( I ) Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging , to confirm anything : one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other , and this was a confirmation in Israel .
NKJV	Ruth	4	8	Therefore the close relative said to Boaz , “ Buy it for yourself. ” So he took off his sandal .
NKJV	Ruth	4	9	And Boaz said to the elders and all the people , “ You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech ’ s , and all that was Chilion ’ s and Mahlon ’ s , from the hand of Naomi .
NKJV	Ruth	4	10	Moreover , Ruth the Moabitess , the widow of Mahlon , I have acquired as my wife , to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance , ( J ) that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from [ e ] his position at the gate . You are witnesses this day. ”
NKJV	Ruth	4	11	And all the people who were at the gate , and the elders , said , “ We are witnesses . ( K ) The Lord make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah , the two who ( L ) built the house of Israel ; and may you prosper in ( M ) Ephrathah and be famous in ( N ) Bethlehem .
NKJV	Ruth	4	12	May your house be like the house of ( O ) Perez , ( P ) whom Tamar bore to Judah , because of ( Q ) the offspring which the Lord will give you from this young woman. ” Descendants of Boaz and Ruth ( R )
NKJV	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz ( S ) took Ruth and she became his wife ; and when he went in to her , ( T ) the Lord gave her conception , and she bore a son .
NKJV	Ruth	4	14	Then ( U ) the women said to Naomi , “ Blessed be the Lord , who has not left you this day without a [ f ] close relative ; and may his name be famous in Israel !
NKJV	Ruth	4	15	And may he be to you a restorer of life and a [ g ] nourisher of your old age ; for your daughter-in-law , who loves you , who is ( V ) better to you than seven sons , has borne him. ”
NKJV	Ruth	4	16	Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom , and became a nurse to him .
NKJV	Ruth	4	17	( W ) Also the neighbor women gave him a name , saying , “ There is a son born to Naomi. ” And they called his name Obed . He is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
NKJV	Ruth	4	18	( X ) Now this is the genealogy of Perez : ( Y ) Perez begot Hezron ;
NKJV	Ruth	4	19	Hezron begot Ram , and Ram begot Amminadab ;
NKJV	Ruth	4	20	Amminadab begot ( Z ) Nahshon , and Nahshon begot ( AA ) Salmon ; [ h ]
NKJV	Ruth	4	21	Salmon begot Boaz , and Boaz begot Obed ;

NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	2	And he had ( D ) two wives : the name of one was Hannah , and the name of the other Peninnah . Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	3	This man went up from his city ( E ) yearly ( F ) to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in ( G ) Shiloh . Also the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , the priests of the Lord , were there .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	4	And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an ( H ) offering , he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	5	But to Hannah he would give a double portion , for he loved Hannah , ( I ) although the Lord had closed her womb .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	6	And her rival also ( J ) provoked her severely , to make her miserable , because the Lord had closed her womb .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	7	So it was , year by year , when she went up to the house of the Lord , that she provoked her ; therefore she wept and did not eat . Hannah ’ s Vow
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	8	Then Elkanah her husband said to her , “ Hannah , why do you weep ? Why do you not eat ? And why is your heart grieved ? Am I not ( K ) better to you than ten sons ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	9	So Hannah arose after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh . Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of ( L ) the [ c ] tabernacle of the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	10	( M ) And she was in bitterness of soul , and prayed to the Lord and [ d ] wept in anguish .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	11	Then she ( N ) made a vow and said , “ O Lord of hosts , if You will indeed ( O ) look on the affliction of Your maidservant and ( P ) remember me , and not forget Your maidservant , but will give Your maidservant a male child , then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life , and ( Q ) no razor shall come upon his head. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	12	And it happened , as she continued praying before the Lord , that Eli watched her mouth .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	13	Now Hannah spoke in her heart ; only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard . Therefore Eli thought she was drunk .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	14	So Eli said to her , “ How long will you be drunk ? Put your wine away from you ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	15	But Hannah answered and said , “ No , my lord , I am a woman of sorrowful spirit . I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink , but have ( R ) poured out my soul before the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	16	Do not consider your maidservant a ( S ) wicked [ e ] woman , for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken until now. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	17	Then Eli answered and said , ( T ) “ Go in peace , and ( U ) the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	18	And she said , ( V ) “ Let your maidservant find favor in your sight. ” So the woman ( W ) went her way and ate , and her face was no longer sad . Samuel Is Born and Dedicated
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	19	Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before the Lord , and returned and came to their house at Ramah . And Elkanah ( X ) knew Hannah his wife , and the Lord ( Y ) remembered her .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	20	So it came to pass in the process of time that Hannah conceived and bore a son , and called his name [ f ] Samuel , saying , “ Because I have asked for him from the Lord. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	21	Now the man Elkanah and all his house ( Z ) went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	22	But Hannah did not go up , for she said to her husband , “ Not until the child is weaned ; then I will ( AA ) take him , that he may appear before the Lord and ( AB ) remain there ( AC ) forever. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	23	So ( AD ) Elkanah her husband said to her , “ Do what seems best to you ; wait until you have weaned him . Only let the Lord [ g ] establish [ h ] His word. ” Then the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	24	Now when she had weaned him , she ( AE ) took him up with her , with [ i ] three bulls , one ephah of flour , and a skin of wine , and brought him to ( AF ) the house of the Lord in Shiloh . And the child was young .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	25	Then they slaughtered a bull , and ( AG ) brought the child to Eli .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	26	And she said , “ O my lord ! ( AH ) As your soul lives , my lord , I am the woman who stood by you here , praying to the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	27	( AI ) For this child I prayed , and the Lord has granted me my petition which I asked of Him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	1	28	Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord ; as long as he lives he shall be [ j ] lent to the Lord. ” So they ( AJ ) worshiped the Lord there . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	5	Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread , And the hungry have ceased to hunger . Even ( L ) the barren has borne seven , And ( M ) she who has many children has become feeble .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	6	“ The ( N ) Lord kills and makes alive ; He brings down to the grave and brings up .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	7	The Lord ( O ) makes poor and makes rich ; ( P ) He brings low and lifts up .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	8	( Q ) He raises the poor from the dust And lifts the beggar from the ash heap , ( R ) To set them among princes And make them inherit the throne of glory . ( S ) “ For the pillars of the earth are the Lord ’ s , And He has set the world upon them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	9	( T ) He will guard the feet of His saints , But the ( U ) wicked shall be silent in darkness . “ For by strength no man shall prevail .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	10	The adversaries of the Lord shall be ( V ) broken in pieces ; ( W ) From heaven He will thunder against them . ( X ) The Lord will judge the ends of the earth .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	11	Then Elkanah went to his house at Ramah . But the child [ d ] ministered to the Lord before Eli the priest . The Wicked Sons of Eli
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	12	Now the sons of Eli were ( AB ) corrupt ; [ e ] ( AC ) they did not know the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	13	And the priests ’ custom with the people was that when any man offered a sacrifice , the priest ’ s servant would come with a three-pronged fleshhook in his hand while the meat was boiling .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	14	Then he would thrust it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; and the priest would take for himself all that the fleshhook brought up . So they did in ( AD ) Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	15	Also , before they ( AE ) burned the fat , the priest ’ s servant would come and say to the man who sacrificed , “ Give meat for roasting to the priest , for he will not take boiled meat from you , but raw. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	16	And if the man said to him , “ They should really burn the fat first ; then you may take as much as your heart desires , ” he would then answer him , “ No , but you must give it now ; and if not , I will take it by force. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	17	Therefore the sin of the young men was very great ( AF ) before the Lord , for men ( AG ) abhorred [ f ] the offering of the Lord . Samuel ’ s Childhood Ministry
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	18	( AH ) But Samuel ministered before the Lord , even as a child , ( AI ) wearing a linen ephod .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	19	Moreover his mother used to make him a little robe , and bring it to him year by year when she ( AJ ) came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	20	And Eli ( AK ) would bless Elkanah and his wife , and say , “ The Lord give you descendants from this woman for the [ g ] loan that was ( AL ) given to the Lord. ” Then they would go to their own home .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	21	And the Lord ( AM ) visited [ h ] Hannah , so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters . Meanwhile the child Samuel ( AN ) grew before the Lord . Prophecy Against Eli ’ s Household
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	22	Now Eli was very old ; and he heard everything his sons did to all Israel , [ i ] and how they lay with ( AO ) the women who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of meeting .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	23	So he said to them , “ Why do you do such things ? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	24	No , my sons ! For it is not a good report that I hear . You make the Lord ’ s people transgress .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	25	If one man sins against another , ( AP ) God [ j ] will judge him . But if a man ( AQ ) sins against the Lord , who will intercede for him ? ” Nevertheless they did not heed the voice of their father , ( AR ) because the Lord desired to kill them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	26	And the child Samuel ( AS ) grew in stature , and ( AT ) in favor both with the Lord and men .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	27	Then a ( AU ) man of God came to Eli and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord : ( AV ) ‘ Did I not clearly reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh ’ s house ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	28	Did I not ( AW ) choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest , to offer upon My altar , to burn incense , and to wear an ephod before Me ? And ( AX ) did I not give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	29	Why do you ( AY ) kick at My sacrifice and My offering which I have commanded in My ( AZ ) dwelling place , and honor your sons more than ( BA ) Me , to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people ? ’
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	30	Therefore the Lord God of Israel says : ( BB ) ‘ I said indeed that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever. ’ But now the Lord says : ( BC ) ‘ Far be it from Me ; for those who honor Me I will honor , and ( BD ) those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	31	Behold , ( BE ) the days are coming that I will cut off your [ k ] arm and the arm of your father ’ s house , so that there will not be an old man in your house .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	32	And you will see an enemy in My dwelling place , despite all the good which God does for Israel . And there shall not be ( BF ) an old man in your house forever .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	33	But any of your men whom I do not cut off from My altar shall consume your eyes and grieve your heart . And all the descendants of your house shall die in the flower of their age .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	34	Now this shall be ( BG ) a sign to you that will come upon your two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas : ( BH ) in one day they shall die , both of them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	35	Then ( BI ) I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who shall do according to what is in My heart and in My mind . ( BJ ) I will build him a sure house , and he shall walk before ( BK ) My anointed forever .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	2	36	( BL ) And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread , and say , “ Please , [ l ] put me in one of the priestly positions , that I may eat a piece of bread. ” ’ ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	3	and before ( D ) the lamp of God went out in the [ a ] tabernacle of the Lord where the ark of God was , and while Samuel was lying down ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	2	And it came to pass at that time , while Eli was lying down in his place , and when his eyes had begun to grow ( C ) so dim that he could not see ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	4	that the Lord called Samuel . And he answered , “ Here I am ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	5	So he ran to Eli and said , “ Here I am , for you called me. ” And he said , “ I did not call ; lie down again. ” And he went and lay down .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	6	Then the Lord called yet again , “ Samuel ! ” So Samuel arose and went to Eli , and said , “ Here I am , for you called me. ” He answered , “ I did not call , my son ; lie down again. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	7	( Now Samuel ( E ) did not yet know the Lord , nor was the word of the Lord yet revealed to him . )
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	8	And the Lord called Samuel again the third time . So he arose and went to Eli , and said , “ Here I am , for you did call me. ” Then Eli perceived that the Lord had called the boy .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	9	Therefore Eli said to Samuel , “ Go , lie down ; and it shall be , if He calls you , that you must say , ( F ) ‘ Speak , Lord , for Your servant hears. ’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	10	Now the Lord came and stood and called as at other times , “ Samuel ! Samuel ! ” And Samuel answered , “ Speak , for Your servant hears. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	11	Then the Lord said to Samuel : “ Behold , I will do something in Israel ( G ) at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	12	In that day I will perform against Eli ( H ) all that I have spoken concerning his house , from beginning to end .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	13	( I ) For I have told him that I will ( J ) judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows , because ( K ) his sons made themselves vile , and he ( L ) did not [ b ] restrain them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	14	And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli ’ s house ( M ) shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	15	So Samuel lay down until [ c ] morning , and opened the doors of the house of the Lord . And Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	16	Then Eli called Samuel and said , “ Samuel , my son ! ” He answered , “ Here I am. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	17	And he said , “ What is the word that the Lord spoke to you ? Please do not hide it from me . ( N ) God do so to you , and more also , if you hide anything from me of all the things that He said to you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	18	Then Samuel told him everything , and hid nothing from him . And he said , ( O ) “ It is the Lord . Let Him do what seems good to Him. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	19	So Samuel ( P ) grew , and ( Q ) the Lord was with him ( R ) and let none of his words [ d ] fall to the ground .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	20	And all Israel ( S ) from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel had been [ e ] established as a prophet of the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	3	21	Then the Lord appeared again in Shiloh . For the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by ( T ) the word of the Lord . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	4	So the people sent to Shiloh , that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts , ( D ) who dwells between ( E ) the cherubim . And the ( F ) two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there with the ark of the covenant of God .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	2	Then the ( B ) Philistines put themselves in battle array against Israel . And when they joined battle , Israel was [ b ] defeated by the Philistines , who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	3	And when the people had come into the camp , the elders of Israel said , “ Why has the Lord defeated us today before the Philistines ? ( C ) Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Shiloh to us , that when it comes among us it may save us from the hand of our enemies. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	5	And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp , all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth shook .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	6	Now when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , “ What does the sound of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean ? ” Then they understood that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	7	So the Philistines were afraid , for they said , “ God has come into the camp ! ” And they said , ( G ) “ Woe to us ! For such a thing has never happened before .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	8	Woe to us ! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods ? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	9	( H ) Be strong and conduct yourselves like men , you Philistines , that you do not become servants of the Hebrews , ( I ) as they have been to you . [ c ] Conduct yourselves like men , and fight ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	10	So the Philistines fought , and ( J ) Israel was [ d ] defeated , and every man fled to his tent . There was a very great slaughter , and there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	11	Also ( K ) the ark of God was captured ; and ( L ) the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , died . Death of Eli
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	12	Then a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line the same day , and ( M ) came to Shiloh with his clothes torn and ( N ) dirt on his head .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	13	Now when he came , there was Eli , sitting on ( O ) a seat [ e ] by the wayside watching , for his heart [ f ] trembled for the ark of God . And when the man came into the city and told it , all the city cried out .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	14	When Eli heard the noise of the outcry , he said , “ What does the sound of this tumult mean ? ” And the man came quickly and told Eli .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	15	Eli was ninety-eight years old , and ( P ) his eyes were so [ g ] dim that he could not see .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	16	Then the man said to Eli , “ I am he who came from the battle . And I fled today from the battle line. ” And he said , ( Q ) “ What happened , my son ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	17	So the messenger answered and said , “ Israel has fled before the Philistines , and there has been a great slaughter among the people . Also your two sons , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead ; and the ark of God has been captured. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	18	Then it happened , when he made mention of the ark of God , that Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate ; and his neck was broken and he died , for the man was old and heavy . And he had judged Israel forty years . Ichabod
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	19	Now his daughter-in-law , Phinehas ’ wife , was with child , due to be delivered ; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured , and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead , she bowed herself and gave birth , for her labor pains came upon her .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	20	And about the time of her death ( R ) the women who stood by her said to her , “ Do not fear , for you have borne a son. ” But she did not answer , nor did she [ h ] regard it .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	4	21	Then she named the child ( S ) Ichabod , [ i ] saying , ( T ) “ The glory has departed from Israel ! ” because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband .

NKJV	1%20Samuel	5	5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon ’ s house ( F ) tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	5	2	When the Philistines took the ark of God , they brought it into the house of ( B ) Dagon [ a ] and set it by Dagon .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	5	3	And when the people of Ashdod arose early in the morning , there was Dagon , ( C ) fallen on its face to the earth before the ark of the Lord . So they took Dagon and ( D ) set it in its place again .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	5	4	And when they arose early the next morning , there was Dagon , fallen on its face to the ground before the ark of the Lord . ( E ) The head of Dagon and both the palms of its hands were broken off on the threshold ; only [ b ] Dagon ’ s torso was left of it .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	5	6	But the ( G ) hand of the Lord was heavy on the people of Ashdod , and He ( H ) ravaged them and struck them with ( I ) tumors , [ c ] both Ashdod and its ( J ) territory .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	5	7	And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was , they said , “ The ark of the ( K ) God of Israel must not remain with us , for His hand is harsh toward us and Dagon our god. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	5	8	Therefore they sent and gathered to themselves all the ( L ) lords of the Philistines , and said , “ What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel ? ” And they answered , “ Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried away to ( M ) Gath. ” So they carried the ark of the God of Israel away .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	5	9	So it was , after they had carried it away , that ( N ) the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction ; and He struck the men of the city , both small and great , [ d ] and tumors broke out on them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	5	10	Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron . So it was , as the ark of God came to Ekron , that the Ekronites cried out , saying , “ They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us , to kill us and our people ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	5	11	So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines , and said , “ Send away the ark of the God of Israel , and let it go back to its own place , so that it does not kill us and our people. ” For there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city ; the hand of God was very heavy there .

NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	6	Why then do you harden your hearts ( I ) as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts ? When He did mighty things among them , ( J ) did they not let the people go , that they might depart ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	2	And the Philistines ( A ) called for the priests and the diviners , saying , “ What shall we do with the ark of the Lord ? Tell us how we should send it to its place. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	3	So they said , “ If you send away the ark of the God of Israel , do not send it ( B ) empty ; but by all means return it to Him with ( C ) a trespass offering . Then you will be healed , and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	4	Then they said , “ What is the trespass offering which we shall return to Him ? ” They answered , ( D ) “ Five golden tumors and five golden rats , according to the number of the lords of the Philistines . For the same plague was on all of [ a ] you and on your lords .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	5	Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your rats that ( E ) ravage the land , and you shall ( F ) give glory to the God of Israel ; perhaps He will ( G ) lighten [ b ] His hand from you , from ( H ) your gods , and from your land .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	7	Now therefore , make ( K ) a new cart , take two milk cows ( L ) which have never been yoked , and hitch the cows to the cart ; and take their calves home , away from them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	8	Then take the ark of the Lord and set it on the cart ; and put ( M ) the articles of gold which you are returning to Him as a trespass offering in a chest by its side . Then send it away , and let it go .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	9	And watch : if it goes up the road to its own territory , to ( N ) Beth Shemesh , then He has done [ c ] us this great evil . But if not , then ( O ) we shall know that it is not His hand that struck us—it happened to us by chance. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	10	Then the men did so ; they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart , and shut up their calves at home .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	11	And they set the ark of the Lord on the cart , and the chest with the gold rats and the images of their tumors .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	12	Then the cows headed straight for the road to Beth Shemesh , and went along the ( P ) highway , lowing as they went , and did not turn aside to the right hand or the left . And the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	13	Now the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping their ( Q ) wheat harvest in the valley ; and they lifted their eyes and saw the ark , and rejoiced to see it .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	14	Then the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh , and stood there ; a large stone was there . So they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	15	The Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest that was with it , in which were the articles of gold , and put them on the large stone . Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices the same day to the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	16	So when ( R ) the five lords of the Philistines had seen it , they returned to Ekron the same day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	17	( S ) These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a trespass offering to the Lord : one for Ashdod , one for Gaza , one for Ashkelon , one for ( T ) Gath , one for Ekron ;
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	18	and the golden rats , according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords , both fortified cities and country villages , even as far as the large stone of Abel on which they set the ark of the Lord , which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	6	19	Then ( U ) He struck the men of Beth Shemesh , because they had looked into the ark of the Lord .

NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	2	So it was that the ark remained in Kirjath Jearim a long time ; it was there twenty years . And all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	3	Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel , saying , “ If you ( D ) return to the Lord with all your hearts , then ( E ) put away the foreign gods and the ( F ) Ashtoreths [ a ] from among you , and ( G ) prepare your hearts for the Lord , and ( H ) serve Him only ; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	4	So the children of Israel put away the ( I ) Baals and the [ b ] Ashtoreths , and served the Lord only .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	5	And Samuel said , ( J ) “ Gather all Israel to Mizpah , and ( K ) I will pray to the Lord for you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	6	So they gathered together at Mizpah , ( L ) drew water , and poured it out before the Lord . And they ( M ) fasted that day , and said there , ( N ) “ We have sinned against the Lord. ” And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	8	So the children of Israel said to Samuel , ( O ) “ Do not cease to cry out to the Lord our God for us , that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	9	And Samuel took a ( P ) suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord . Then ( Q ) Samuel cried out to the Lord for Israel , and the Lord answered him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	10	Now as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel . ( R ) But the Lord thundered with a loud thunder upon the Philistines that day , and so confused them that they were overcome before Israel .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines , and [ c ] drove them back as far as below Beth Car .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	12	Then Samuel ( S ) took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen , and called its name [ d ] Ebenezer , saying , “ Thus far the Lord has helped us. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	13	( T ) So the Philistines were subdued , and they ( U ) did not come anymore into the territory of Israel . And the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	14	Then the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel , from Ekron to Gath ; and Israel recovered its territory from the hands of the Philistines . Also there was peace between Israel and the Amorites .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	15	And Samuel ( V ) judged Israel all the days of his life .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	7	16	He went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel , Gilgal , and Mizpah , and judged Israel in all those places .

NKJV	1%20Samuel	8	2	The name of his firstborn was Joel , and the name of his second , Abijah ; they were judges in Beersheba .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	8	3	But his sons ( D ) did not walk in his ways ; they turned aside ( E ) after dishonest gain , ( F ) took bribes , and perverted justice .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	8	4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	8	5	and said to him , “ Look , you are old , and your sons do not walk in your ways . Now ( G ) make us a king to judge us like all the nations. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	8	6	But the thing ( H ) displeased Samuel when they said , “ Give us a king to judge us. ” So Samuel ( I ) prayed to the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	8	7	And the Lord said to Samuel , “ Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you ; for ( J ) they have not rejected you , but ( K ) they have rejected Me , that I should not reign over them .

NKJV	1%20Samuel	8	11	And he said , ( M ) “ This will be the behavior of the king who will reign over you : He will take your ( N ) sons and appoint them for his own ( O ) chariots and to be his horsemen , and some will run before his chariots .

NKJV	1%20Samuel	8	15	He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage , and give it to his officers and servants .

NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	9	( Formerly in Israel , when a man ( I ) went [ b ] to inquire of God , he spoke thus : “ Come , let us go to the seer ” ; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called ( J ) a seer . )
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	2	And he had a choice and handsome son whose name was Saul . There was not a more handsome person than he among the children of Israel . ( B ) From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	3	Now the donkeys of Kish , Saul ’ s father , were lost . And Kish said to his son Saul , “ Please take one of the servants with you , and arise , go and look for the donkeys. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	4	So he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of ( C ) Shalisha , but they did not find them . Then they passed through the land of Shaalim , and they were not there . Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites , but they did not find them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	5	When they had come to the land of ( D ) Zuph , Saul said to his servant who was with him , “ Come , let ( E ) us return , lest my father cease caring about the donkeys and become worried about us. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	6	And he said to him , “ Look now , there is in this city ( F ) a man of God , and he is an honorable man ; ( G ) all that he says surely comes to pass . So let us go there ; perhaps he can show us the way that we should go. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	7	Then Saul said to his servant , “ But look , if we go , ( H ) what shall we bring the man ? For the bread in our vessels is all gone , and there is no present to bring to the man of God . What do we have ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	8	And the servant answered Saul again and said , “ Look , I have here at hand one-fourth of a shekel of silver . I will give that to the man of God , to tell us our way. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	10	Then Saul said to his servant , [ c ] “ Well said ; come , let us go. ” So they went to the city where the man of God was .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	11	As they went up the hill to the city , ( K ) they met some young women going out to draw water , and said to them , “ Is the seer here ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	12	And they answered them and said , “ Yes , there he is , just ahead of you . Hurry now ; for today he came to this city , because ( L ) there is a sacrifice of the people today ( M ) on the high place .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	13	As soon as you come into the city , you will surely find him before he goes up to the high place to eat . For the people will not eat until he comes , because he must bless the sacrifice ; afterward those who are invited will eat . Now therefore , go up , for about this time you will find him. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	14	So they went up to the city . As they were coming into the city , there was Samuel , coming out toward them on his way up to the high place .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	15	( N ) Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear the day before Saul came , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	16	“ Tomorrow about this time ( O ) I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin , ( P ) and you shall anoint him [ d ] commander over My people Israel , that he may save My people from the hand of the Philistines ; for I have ( Q ) looked upon My people , because their cry has come to Me. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	17	So when Samuel saw Saul , the Lord said to him , ( R ) “ There he is , the man of whom I spoke to you . This one shall reign over My people. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	18	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , “ Please tell me , where is the seer ’ s house ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	19	Samuel answered Saul and said , “ I am the seer . Go up before me to the high place , for you shall eat with me today ; and tomorrow I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	20	But as for ( S ) your donkeys that were lost three days ago , do not be anxious about them , for they have been found . And [ e ] on whom ( T ) is all the desire of Israel ? Is it not on you and on all your father ’ s house ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	21	And Saul answered and said , ( U ) “ Am I not a Benjamite , of the ( V ) smallest of the tribes of Israel , and ( W ) my family the least of all the families of the [ f ] tribe of Benjamin ? Why then do you speak like this to me ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	22	Now Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall , and had them sit in the place of honor among those who were invited ; there were about thirty persons .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	23	And Samuel said to the cook , “ Bring the portion which I gave you , of which I said to you , ‘ Set it apart. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	24	So the cook took up ( X ) the thigh with its upper part and set it before Saul . And Samuel said , “ Here it is , what was kept back . It was set apart for you . Eat ; for until this time it has been kept for you , since I said I invited the people. ” So Saul ate with Samuel that day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	25	When they had come down from the high place into the city , [ g ] Samuel spoke with Saul on ( Y ) the top of the house .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	26	They arose early ; and it was about the dawning of the day that Samuel called to Saul on the top of the house , saying , “ Get up , that I may send you on your way. ” And Saul arose , and both of them went outside , he and Samuel . Saul Anointed King
NKJV	1%20Samuel	9	27	As they were going down to the outskirts of the city , Samuel said to Saul , “ Tell the servant to go on ahead of us. ” And he went on . “ But you stand here [ h ] awhile , that I may announce to you the word of God. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	1	Samuel 10:27 kept silent Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	10	( R ) When they came there to the hill , there was ( S ) a group of prophets to meet him ; then the Spirit of God came upon him , and he prophesied among them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	2	When you have departed from me today , you will find two men by ( E ) Rachel ’ s tomb in the territory of Benjamin ( F ) at Zelzah ; and they will say to you , ‘ The donkeys which you went to look for have been found . And now your father has ceased caring about the donkeys and is worrying about ( G ) you , saying , “ What shall I do about my son ? ” ’
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	3	Then you shall go on forward from there and come to the terebinth tree of Tabor . There three men going up ( H ) to God at Bethel will meet you , one carrying three young goats , another carrying three loaves of bread , and another carrying a skin of wine .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	4	And they will [ b ] greet you and give you two loaves of bread , which you shall receive from their hands .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	5	After that you shall come to the hill of God ( I ) where the Philistine garrison is . And it will happen , when you have come there to the city , that you will meet a group of prophets coming down ( J ) from the high place with a stringed instrument , a tambourine , a flute , and a harp before them ; ( K ) and they will be prophesying .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	6	Then ( L ) the Spirit of the Lord will come upon you , and ( M ) you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	7	And let it be , when these ( N ) signs come to you , that you do as the occasion demands ; for ( O ) God is with you .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	8	You shall go down before me ( P ) to Gilgal ; and surely I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and make sacrifices of peace offerings . ( Q ) Seven days you shall wait , till I come to you and show you what you should do. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	9	So it was , when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , that God [ c ] gave him another heart ; and all those signs came to pass that day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	11	And it happened , when all who knew him formerly saw that he indeed prophesied among the prophets , that the people said to one another , “ What is this that has come upon the son of Kish ? ( T ) Is Saul also among the prophets ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	12	Then a man from there answered and said , “ But ( U ) who is their father ? ” Therefore it became a proverb : “ Is Saul also among the prophets ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	13	And when he had finished prophesying , he went to the high place .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	14	Then Saul ’ s ( V ) uncle said to him and his servant , “ Where did you go ? ” So he said , “ To look for the donkeys . When we saw that they were nowhere to be found , we went to Samuel. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	15	And Saul ’ s uncle said , “ Tell me , please , what Samuel said to you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	16	So Saul said to his uncle , “ He told us plainly that the donkeys had been ( W ) found. ” But about the matter of the kingdom , he did not tell him what Samuel had said . Saul Proclaimed King
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	17	Then Samuel called the people together ( X ) to the Lord ( Y ) at Mizpah ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	18	and said to the children of Israel , ( Z ) “ Thus says the Lord God of Israel : ‘ I brought up Israel out of Egypt , and delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all kingdoms and from those who oppressed you. ’
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	19	( AA ) But you have today rejected your God , who Himself saved you from all your adversities and your tribulations ; and you have said to Him , ‘ No , set a king over us ! ’ Now therefore , present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your [ d ] clans. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	20	And when Samuel had ( AB ) caused all the tribes of Israel to come near , the tribe of Benjamin was chosen .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	21	When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Matri was chosen . And Saul the son of Kish was chosen . But when they sought him , he could not be found .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	22	Therefore they ( AC ) inquired of the Lord further , “ Has the man come here yet ? ” And the Lord answered , “ There he is , hidden among the equipment. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	23	So they ran and brought him from there ; and when he stood among the people , ( AD ) he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	24	And Samuel said to all the people , “ Do you see him ( AE ) whom the Lord has chosen , that there is no one like him among all the people ? ” So all the people shouted and said , ( AF ) “ Long [ e ] live the king ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	25	Then Samuel explained to the people ( AG ) the behavior of royalty , and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the Lord . And Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	26	And Saul also went home ( AH ) to Gibeah ; and valiant men went with him , whose hearts God had touched .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	10	27	( AI ) But some ( AJ ) rebels said , “ How can this man save us ? ” So they despised him , ( AK ) and brought him no presents . But he [ f ] held his peace . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	11	So it was , on the next day , that ( L ) Saul put the people ( M ) in three companies ; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch , and killed Ammonites until the heat of the day . And it happened that those who survived were scattered , so that no two of them were left together .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	2	And Nahash the Ammonite answered them , “ On this condition I will make a covenant with you , that I may put out all your right eyes , and bring ( D ) reproach on all Israel. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	3	Then the elders of Jabesh said to him , “ Hold off for seven days , that we may send messengers to all the territory of Israel . And then , if there is no one to [ b ] save us , we will come out to you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	4	So the messengers came ( E ) to Gibeah of Saul and told the news in the hearing of the people . And ( F ) all the people lifted up their voices and wept .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	5	Now there was Saul , coming behind the herd from the field ; and Saul said , “ What troubles the people , that they weep ? ” And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	6	( G ) Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard this news , and his anger was greatly aroused .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	7	So he took a yoke of oxen and ( H ) cut them in pieces , and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hands of messengers , saying , ( I ) “ Whoever does not go out with Saul and Samuel to battle , so it shall be done to his oxen. ” And the fear of the Lord fell on the people , and they came out [ c ] with one consent .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	8	When he numbered them in ( J ) Bezek , the children ( K ) of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	9	And they said to the messengers who came , “ Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead : ‘ Tomorrow , by the time the sun is hot , you shall have help. ’ ” Then the messengers came and reported it to the men of Jabesh , and they were glad .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said , “ Tomorrow we will come out to you , and you may do with us whatever seems good to you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	12	Then the people said to Samuel , ( N ) “ Who is he who said , ‘ Shall Saul reign over us ? ’ ( O ) Bring the men , that we may put them to death. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	13	But Saul said , ( P ) “ Not a man shall be put to death this day , for today ( Q ) the Lord has accomplished salvation in Israel. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	14	Then Samuel said to the people , “ Come , let us go ( R ) to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	11	15	So all the people went to Gilgal , and there they made Saul king ( S ) before the Lord in Gilgal . ( T ) There they made sacrifices of peace offerings before the Lord , and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	12	And when you saw that ( Z ) Nahash king of the Ammonites came against you , ( AA ) you said to me , ‘ No , but a king shall reign over us , ’ when ( AB ) the Lord your God was your king .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	2	And now here is the king , ( C ) walking before you ; ( D ) and I am old and grayheaded , and look , my sons are with you . I have walked before you from my childhood to this day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	3	Here I am . Witness against me before the Lord and before ( E ) His anointed : ( F ) Whose ox have I taken , or whose donkey have I taken , or whom have I cheated ? Whom have I oppressed , or from whose hand have I received any ( G ) bribe with which to ( H ) blind my eyes ? I will restore it to you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	4	And they said , ( I ) “ You have not cheated us or oppressed us , nor have you taken anything from any man ’ s hand. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	5	Then he said to them , “ The Lord is witness against you , and His anointed is witness this day , ( J ) that you have not found anything ( K ) in my hand. ” And they answered , “ He is witness. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	6	Then Samuel said to the people , ( L ) “ It is the Lord who raised up Moses and Aaron , and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	7	Now therefore , stand still , that I may ( M ) reason with you before the Lord concerning all the ( N ) righteous acts of the Lord which He did to you and your fathers :
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	8	( O ) When Jacob had gone into [ b ] Egypt , and your fathers ( P ) cried out to the Lord , then the Lord ( Q ) sent Moses and Aaron , who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	9	And when they ( R ) forgot the Lord their God , He sold them into the hand of ( S ) Sisera , commander of the army of Hazor , into the hand of the ( T ) Philistines , and into the hand of the king of ( U ) Moab ; and they fought against them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	10	Then they cried out to the Lord , and said , ( V ) ‘ We have sinned , because we have forsaken the Lord ( W ) and served the Baals and [ c ] Ashtoreths ; but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies , and we will serve You. ’
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	11	And the Lord sent [ d ] Jerubbaal , [ e ] Bedan , ( X ) Jephthah , and ( Y ) Samuel , [ f ] and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side ; and you dwelt in safety .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	13	“ Now therefore , ( AC ) here is the king ( AD ) whom you have chosen and whom you have desired . And take note , ( AE ) the Lord has set a king over you .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	14	If you ( AF ) fear the Lord and serve Him and obey His voice , and do not rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then both you and the king who reigns over you will continue following the Lord your God .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	15	However , if you do ( AG ) not obey the voice of the Lord , but ( AH ) rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then the hand of the Lord will be against you , as it was against your fathers .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	16	“ Now therefore , ( AI ) stand and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes :
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	17	Is today not the ( AJ ) wheat harvest ? ( AK ) I will call to the Lord , and He will send thunder and ( AL ) rain , that you may perceive and see that ( AM ) your wickedness is great , which you have done in the sight of the Lord , in asking a king for yourselves. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	18	So Samuel called to the Lord , and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day ; and ( AN ) all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	19	And all the people said to Samuel , ( AO ) “ Pray for your servants to the Lord your God , that we may not die ; for we have added to all our sins the evil of asking a king for ourselves. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	20	Then Samuel said to the people , “ Do not fear . You have done all this wickedness ; ( AP ) yet do not turn aside from following the Lord , but serve the Lord with all your heart .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	21	And ( AQ ) do not turn aside ; ( AR ) for then you would go after empty things which can not profit or deliver , for they are nothing .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	22	For ( AS ) the Lord will not forsake ( AT ) His people , ( AU ) for His great name ’ s sake , because ( AV ) it has pleased the Lord to make you His people .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	23	Moreover , as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord ( AW ) in ceasing to pray for you ; but ( AX ) I will teach you the ( AY ) good and the right way .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	24	( AZ ) Only fear the Lord , and serve Him in truth with all your heart ; for ( BA ) consider what ( BB ) great things He has done for you .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	12	25	But if you still do wickedly , ( BC ) you shall be swept away , ( BD ) both you and your king. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	13	And Samuel said to Saul , ( K ) “ You have done foolishly . ( L ) You have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God , which He commanded you . For now the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	2	Sam . 2:10 ; Acts 13:21 -
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	3	And Jonathan attacked ( D ) the garrison of the Philistines that was in ( E ) Geba , and the Philistines heard of it . Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land , saying , “ Let the Hebrews hear ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	4	Now all Israel heard it said that Saul had attacked a garrison of the Philistines , and that Israel had also become [ b ] an abomination to the Philistines . And the people were called together to Saul at Gilgal .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	5	Then the Philistines gathered together to fight with Israel , [ c ] thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen , and people ( F ) as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude . And they came up and encamped in Michmash , to the east of ( G ) Beth Aven .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people ( H ) hid in caves , in thickets , in rocks , in holes , and in pits .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	7	And some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the ( I ) land of Gad and Gilead . As for Saul , he was still in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	8	( J ) Then he waited seven days , according to the time set by Samuel . But Samuel did not come to Gilgal ; and the people were scattered from him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	9	So Saul said , “ Bring a burnt offering and peace offerings here to me. ” And he offered the burnt offering .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	10	Now it happened , as soon as he had finished presenting the burnt offering , that Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might [ d ] greet him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	11	And Samuel said , “ What have you done ? ” Saul said , “ When I saw that the people were scattered from me , and that you did not come within the days appointed , and that the Philistines gathered together at Michmash ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	12	then I said , ‘ The Philistines will now come down on me at Gilgal , and I have not made supplication to the Lord. ’ Therefore I felt compelled , and offered a burnt offering. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	14	( M ) But now your kingdom shall not continue . ( N ) The Lord has sought for Himself a man ( O ) after His own heart , and the Lord has commanded him to be commander over His people , because you have ( P ) not kept what the Lord commanded you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	15	Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of [ e ] Benjamin . And Saul numbered the people present with him , ( Q ) about six hundred men . No Weapons for the Army
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	16	Saul , Jonathan his son , and the people present with them remained in [ f ] Gibeah of Benjamin . But the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	17	Then raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies . One company turned onto the road to ( R ) Ophrah , to the land of Shual ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	18	another company turned to the road to ( S ) Beth Horon , and another company turned to the road of the border that overlooks the Valley of ( T ) Zeboim toward the wilderness .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	19	Now ( U ) there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel , for the Philistines said , “ Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	20	But all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen each man ’ s plowshare , his mattock , his ax , and his sickle ;
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	21	and the charge for a sharpening was a [ g ] pim for the plowshares , the mattocks , the forks , and the axes , and to set the points of the goads .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	13	22	So it came about , on the day of battle , that ( V ) there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan . But they were found with Saul and Jonathan his son .

NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	14	That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within about [ c ] half an acre of land .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	2	And Saul was sitting in the outskirts of ( A ) Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron . The people who were with him were about six hundred men .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	3	( B ) Ahijah the son of Ahitub , ( C ) Ichabod ’ s brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the Lord ’ s priest in Shiloh , was ( D ) wearing an ephod . But the people did not know that Jonathan had gone .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	4	Between the passes , by which Jonathan sought to go over ( E ) to the Philistines ’ garrison , there was a sharp rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side . And the name of one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	5	The front of one faced northward opposite Michmash , and the other southward opposite Gibeah .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	6	Then Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor , “ Come , let us go over to the garrison of these ( F ) uncircumcised ; it may be that the Lord will work for us . For nothing restrains the Lord ( G ) from saving by many or by few. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	7	So his armorbearer said to him , “ Do all that is in your heart . Go then ; here I am with you , according to your heart. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	8	Then Jonathan said , “ Very well , let us cross over to these men , and we will show ourselves to them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they say thus to us , ‘ Wait until we come to you , ’ then we will stand still in our place and not go up to them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	10	But if they say thus , ‘ Come up to us , ’ then we will go up . For the Lord has delivered them into our hand , and ( H ) this will be a sign to us. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	11	So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines . And the Philistines said , “ Look , the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have ( I ) hidden. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	12	Then the men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armorbearer , and said , “ Come up to us , and we will [ b ] show you something. ” Jonathan said to his armorbearer , “ Come up after me , for the Lord has delivered them into the hand of Israel. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	13	And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and knees with his armorbearer after him ; and they ( J ) fell before Jonathan . And as he came after him , his armorbearer killed them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	15	And ( K ) there was [ d ] trembling in the camp , in the field , and among all the people . The garrison and ( L ) the raiders also trembled ; and the earth quaked , so that it was ( M ) a very great trembling .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	16	Now the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked , and there was the multitude , melting away ; and they ( N ) went here and there .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	17	Then Saul said to the people who were with him , “ Now call the roll and see who has gone from us. ” And when they had called the roll , surprisingly , Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	18	And Saul said to Ahijah , “ Bring the [ e ] ark of God here ” ( for at that time the ark of God was with the children of Israel ) .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	19	Now it happened , while Saul ( O ) talked to the priest , that the noise which was in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase ; so Saul said to the priest , “ Withdraw your hand. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	20	Then Saul and all the people who were with him assembled , and they went to the battle ; and indeed ( P ) every man ’ s sword was against his neighbor , and there was very great confusion .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	21	Moreover the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before that time , who went up with them into the camp from the surrounding country , they also joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	22	Likewise all the men of Israel who ( Q ) had hidden in the mountains of Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , they also followed hard after them in the battle .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	23	( R ) So the Lord saved Israel that day , and the battle shifted ( S ) to Beth Aven . Saul ’ s Rash Oath
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	24	And the men of Israel were distressed that day , for Saul had ( T ) placed the people under oath , saying , “ Cursed is the man who eats any food until evening , before I have taken vengeance on my enemies. ” So none of the people tasted food .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	25	( U ) Now all the people of the land came to a forest ; and there was ( V ) honey on the ground .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	26	And when the people had come into the woods , there was the honey , dripping ; but no one put his hand to his mouth , for the people feared the oath .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	27	But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath ; therefore he stretched out the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his [ f ] countenance brightened .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	28	Then one of the people said , “ Your father strictly charged the people with an oath , saying , ‘ Cursed is the man who eats food this day. ’ ” And the people were faint .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	29	But Jonathan said , “ My father has troubled the land . Look now , how my countenance has brightened because I tasted a little of this honey .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	30	How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found ! For now would there not have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	31	Now they had [ g ] driven back the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon . So the people were very faint .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	32	And the people rushed on the [ h ] spoil , and took sheep , oxen , and calves , and slaughtered them on the ground ; and the people ate them ( W ) with the blood .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	33	Then they told Saul , saying , “ Look , the people are sinning against the Lord by eating with the blood ! ” So he said , “ You have dealt treacherously ; roll a large stone to me this day. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	34	Then Saul said , “ Disperse yourselves among the people , and say to them , ‘ Bring me here every man ’ s ox and every man ’ s sheep , slaughter them here , and eat ; and do not sin against the Lord by eating with the blood. ’ ” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night , and slaughtered it there .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	35	Then Saul ( X ) built an altar to the Lord . This was the first altar that he built to the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	36	Now Saul said , “ Let us go down after the Philistines by night , and plunder them until the morning light ; and let us not leave a man of them. ” And they said , “ Do whatever seems good to you. ” Then the priest said , “ Let us draw near to God here. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	37	So Saul ( Y ) asked counsel of God , “ Shall I go down after the Philistines ? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel ? ” But ( Z ) He did not answer him that day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	38	And Saul said , ( AA ) “ Come over here , all you chiefs of the people , and know and see what this sin was today .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	39	For ( AB ) as the Lord lives , who saves Israel , though it be in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die. ” But not a man among all the people answered him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	40	Then he said to all Israel , “ You be on one side , and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side. ” And the people said to Saul , “ Do what seems good to you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	41	Therefore Saul said to the Lord God of Israel , ( AC ) “ Give [ i ] a perfect lot. ” ( AD ) So Saul and Jonathan were taken , but the people escaped .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	42	And Saul said , “ Cast lots between my son Jonathan and me. ” So Jonathan was taken .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	43	Then Saul said to Jonathan , ( AE ) “ Tell me what you have done. ” And Jonathan told him , and said , ( AF ) “ I only tasted a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand . So now I must die ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	44	Saul answered , ( AG ) “ God do so and more also ; ( AH ) for you shall surely die , Jonathan. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	45	But the people said to Saul , “ Shall Jonathan die , who has accomplished this great deliverance in Israel ? Certainly not ! ( AI ) As the Lord lives , not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground , for he has worked ( AJ ) with God this day. ” So the people rescued Jonathan , and he did not die .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	46	Then Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines , and the Philistines went to their own place . Saul ’ s Continuing Wars
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	47	So Saul established his sovereignty over Israel , and fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , against the people of ( AK ) Ammon , against Edom , against the kings of ( AL ) Zobah , and against the Philistines . Wherever he turned , he [ j ] harassed them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	48	And he gathered an army and ( AM ) attacked [ k ] the Amalekites , and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	49	( AN ) The sons of Saul were Jonathan , [ l ] Jishui , and Malchishua . And the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger ( AO ) Michal .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	50	The name of Saul ’ s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz . And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner , Saul ’ s ( AP ) uncle .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	51	( AQ ) Kish was the father of Saul , and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	14	52	Now there was fierce war with the Philistines all the days of Saul . And when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man , ( AR ) he took him for himself . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	15	And Saul said , “ They have brought them from the Amalekites ; ( T ) for the people spared the best of the sheep and the oxen , to sacrifice to the Lord your God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	2	Thus says the Lord of hosts : ‘ I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel , ( B ) how he ambushed him on the way when he came up from Egypt .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	3	Now go and ( C ) attack [ a ] Amalek , and ( D ) utterly destroy all that they have , and do not spare them . But kill both man and woman , infant and nursing child , ox and sheep , camel and donkey. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	4	So Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim , two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	5	And Saul came to a city of Amalek , and lay in wait in the valley .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	6	Then Saul said to ( E ) the Kenites , ( F ) “ Go , depart , get down from among the Amalekites , lest I destroy you with them . For ( G ) you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. ” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	7	( H ) And Saul attacked the Amalekites , from ( I ) Havilah all the way to ( J ) Shur , which is east of Egypt .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	8	( K ) He also took Agag king of the Amalekites alive , and ( L ) utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	9	But Saul and the people ( M ) spared Agag and the best of the sheep , the oxen , the fatlings , the lambs , and all that was good , and were unwilling to utterly destroy them . But everything despised and worthless , that they utterly destroyed . Saul Rejected as King
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	10	Now the word of the Lord came to Samuel , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	11	( N ) “ I greatly regret that I have set up Saul as king , for he has ( O ) turned back from following Me , ( P ) and has not performed My commandments. ” And it ( Q ) grieved Samuel , and he cried out to the Lord all night .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	12	So when Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul , it was told Samuel , saying , “ Saul went to ( R ) Carmel , and indeed , he set up a monument for himself ; and he has gone on around , passed by , and gone down to Gilgal. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	13	Then Samuel went to Saul , and Saul said to him , ( S ) “ Blessed are you of the Lord ! I have performed the commandment of the Lord. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	14	But Samuel said , “ What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears , and the lowing of the oxen which I hear ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	16	Then Samuel said to Saul , “ Be quiet ! And I will tell you what the Lord said to me last night. ” And he said to him , “ Speak on. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	17	So Samuel said , ( U ) “ When you were little in your own eyes , were you not head of the tribes of Israel ? And did not the Lord anoint you king over Israel ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	18	Now the Lord sent you on a mission , and said , ‘ Go , and utterly destroy the sinners , the Amalekites , and fight against them until they are [ b ] consumed. ’
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	19	Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord ? Why did you swoop down on the [ c ] spoil , and do evil in the sight of the Lord ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	20	And Saul said to Samuel , ( V ) “ But I have obeyed the voice of the Lord , and gone on the mission on which the Lord sent me , and brought back Agag king of Amalek ; I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	21	( W ) But the people took of the plunder , sheep and oxen , the best of the things which should have been utterly destroyed , to sacrifice to the Lord your God in Gilgal. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	22	So Samuel said : ( X ) “ Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices , As in obeying the voice of the Lord ? Behold , ( Y ) to obey is better than sacrifice , And to heed than the fat of rams .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	23	For rebellion is as the sin of [ d ] witchcraft , And stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry . Because you have rejected the word of the Lord , ( Z ) He also has rejected you from being king. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	24	( AA ) Then Saul said to Samuel , “ I have sinned , for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and your words , because I ( AB ) feared the people and obeyed their voice .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	25	Now therefore , please pardon my sin , and return with me , that I may worship the Lord. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	26	But Samuel said to Saul , “ I will not return with you , ( AC ) for you have rejected the word of the Lord , and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	27	And as Samuel turned around to go away , ( AD ) Saul seized the edge of his robe , and it tore .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	28	So Samuel said to him , ( AE ) “ The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today , and has given it to a neighbor of yours , who is better than you .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	29	And also the Strength of Israel ( AF ) will not lie nor relent . For He is not a man , that He should relent. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	30	Then he said , “ I have sinned ; yet ( AG ) honor me now , please , before the elders of my people and before Israel , and return with me , that I may worship the Lord your God. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Samuel turned back after Saul , and Saul worshiped the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	32	Then Samuel said , “ Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me. ” So Agag came to him cautiously . And Agag said , “ Surely the bitterness of death is past. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	33	But Samuel said , ( AH ) “ As your sword has made women childless , so shall your mother be childless among women. ” And Samuel hacked Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	34	Then Samuel went to ( AI ) Ramah , and Saul went up to his house at ( AJ ) Gibeah of Saul .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	15	35	And ( AK ) Samuel went no more to see Saul until the day of his death . Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul , and the Lord regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	1	Samuel 16:17 Lit . Look now for a man for me Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	16	Let our master now command your servants , who are before you , to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp . And it shall be that he will ( V ) play it with his hand when the [ g ] distressing spirit from God is upon you , and you shall be well. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	2	And Samuel said , “ How can I go ? If Saul hears it , he will kill me. ” But the Lord said , “ Take a heifer with you , and say , ( E ) ‘ I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. ’
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	3	Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice , and I will show you what you shall do ; you shall anoint for Me the one I name to you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	4	So Samuel did what the Lord said , and went to Bethlehem . And the elders of the town ( F ) trembled at his coming , and said , ( G ) “ Do you come peaceably ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	5	And he said , “ Peaceably ; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord . ( H ) Sanctify [ b ] yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice. ” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons , and invited them to the sacrifice .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	6	So it was , when they came , that he looked at ( I ) Eliab and ( J ) said , “ Surely the Lord ’ s anointed is before Him ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	7	But the Lord said to Samuel , ( K ) “ Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature , because I have [ c ] refused him . ( L ) For [ d ] the Lord does not see as man sees ; for man ( M ) looks at the outward appearance , but the Lord looks at the ( N ) heart. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	8	So Jesse called Abinadab , and made him pass before Samuel . And he said , “ Neither has the Lord chosen this one. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	9	Then Jesse made Shammah pass by . And he said , “ Neither has the Lord chosen this one. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	10	Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel . And Samuel said to Jesse , “ The Lord has not chosen these. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	11	And Samuel said to Jesse , “ Are all the young men here ? ” Then he said , “ There remains yet the youngest , and there he is , keeping the ( O ) sheep. ” And Samuel said to Jesse , “ Send and bring him . For we will not [ e ] sit down till he comes here. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	12	So he sent and brought him in . Now he was ( P ) ruddy , ( Q ) with [ f ] bright eyes , and good-looking . ( R ) And the Lord said , “ Arise , anoint him ; for this is the one ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers ; and ( S ) the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward . So Samuel arose and went to Ramah . A Distressing Spirit Troubles Saul
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	14	( T ) But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul , and ( U ) a distressing spirit from the Lord troubled him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	15	And Saul ’ s servants said to him , “ Surely , a distressing spirit from God is troubling you .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	17	So Saul said to his servants , [ h ] “ Provide me now a man who can play well , and bring him to me. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	18	Then one of the servants answered and said , “ Look , I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite , who is skillful in playing , a mighty man of valor , a man of war , prudent in speech , and a handsome person ; and ( W ) the Lord is with him. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	19	Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse , and said , “ Send me your son David , who is with the sheep. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	20	And Jesse ( X ) took a donkey loaded with bread , a skin of wine , and a young goat , and sent them by his son David to Saul .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	21	So David came to Saul and ( Y ) stood before him . And he loved him greatly , and he became his armorbearer .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	22	Then Saul sent to Jesse , saying , “ Please let David stand before me , for he has found favor in my sight. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	16	23	And so it was , whenever the spirit from God was upon Saul , that David would take a harp and play it with his hand . Then Saul would become refreshed and well , and the distressing spirit would depart from him . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	17	Then Jesse said to his son David , “ Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dried grain and these ten loaves , and run to your brothers at the camp .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and they encamped in the Valley of Elah , and drew up in battle array against the Philistines .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	3	The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side , and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side , with a valley between them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	4	And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines , named ( B ) Goliath , from ( C ) Gath , whose height was six cubits and a span .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	5	He had a bronze helmet on his head , and he was [ a ] armed with a coat of mail , and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	6	And he had bronze armor on his legs and a bronze javelin between his shoulders .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	7	Now the staff of his spear was like a weaver ’ s beam , and his iron spearhead weighed six hundred shekels ; and a shield-bearer went before him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	8	Then he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel , and said to them , “ Why have you come out to line up for battle ? Am I not a Philistine , and you the ( D ) servants of Saul ? Choose a man for yourselves , and let him come down to me .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	9	If he is able to fight with me and kill me , then we will be your servants . But if I prevail against him and kill him , then you shall be our servants and ( E ) serve us. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	10	And the Philistine said , “ I ( F ) defy the armies of Israel this day ; give me a man , that we may fight together. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	11	When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine , they were dismayed and greatly afraid .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	12	Now David was ( G ) the son of that ( H ) Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah , whose name was Jesse , and who had ( I ) eight sons . And the man was old , advanced in years , in the days of Saul .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	13	The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone to follow Saul to the battle . The ( J ) names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , next to him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	14	David was the youngest . And the three oldest followed Saul .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	15	But David occasionally went and returned from Saul ( K ) to feed his father ’ s sheep at Bethlehem .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	16	And the Philistine drew near and presented himself forty days , morning and evening .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	18	And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand , and ( L ) see how your brothers fare , and bring back news of them. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	19	Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	20	So David rose early in the morning , left the sheep with a keeper , and took the things and went as Jesse had commanded him . And he came to the camp as the army was going out to the fight and shouting for the battle .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	21	For Israel and the Philistines had drawn up in battle array , army against army .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	22	And David left his supplies in the hand of the supply keeper , ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	23	Then as he talked with them , there was the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , coming up from the armies of the Philistines ; and he spoke ( M ) according to the same words . So David heard them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	24	And all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him and were dreadfully afraid .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	25	So the men of Israel said , “ Have you seen this man who has come up ? Surely he has come up to defy Israel ; and it shall be that the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches , ( N ) will give him his daughter , and give his father ’ s house exemption from taxes in Israel. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	26	Then David spoke to the men who stood by him , saying , “ What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away ( O ) the reproach from Israel ? For who is this ( P ) uncircumcised Philistine , that he should ( Q ) defy the armies of ( R ) the living God ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	27	And the people answered him in this manner , saying , ( S ) “ So shall it be done for the man who kills him. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	28	Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men ; and Eliab ’ s ( T ) anger was aroused against David , and he said , “ Why did you come down here ? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness ? I know your pride and the insolence of your heart , for you have come down to see the battle. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	29	And David said , “ What have I done now ? ( U ) Is [ b ] there not a cause ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	30	Then he turned from him toward another and ( V ) said the same thing ; and these people answered him as the first ones did .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	31	Now when the words which David spoke were heard , they reported them to Saul ; and he sent for him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	32	Then David said to Saul , ( W ) “ Let no man ’ s heart fail because of him ; ( X ) your servant will go and fight with this Philistine. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	33	And Saul said to David , ( Y ) “ You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him ; for you are a youth , and he a man of war from his youth. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	34	But David said to Saul , “ Your servant used to keep his father ’ s sheep , and when a ( Z ) lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	35	I went out after it and struck it , and delivered the lamb from its mouth ; and when it arose against me , I caught it by its beard , and struck and killed it .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	36	Your servant has killed both lion and bear ; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them , seeing he has defied the armies of the living God. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	37	Moreover David said , ( AA ) “ The Lord , who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear , He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine. ” And Saul said to David , ( AB ) “ Go , and the Lord be with you ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	38	So Saul clothed David with his [ c ] armor , and he put a bronze helmet on his head ; he also clothed him with a coat of mail .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	39	David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk , for he had not tested them . And David said to Saul , “ I can not walk with these , for I have not tested them. ” So David took them off .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	40	Then he took his staff in his hand ; and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook , and put them in a shepherd ’ s bag , in a pouch which he had , and his sling was in his hand . And he drew near to the Philistine .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	41	So the Philistine came , and began drawing near to David , and the man who bore the shield went before him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	42	And when the Philistine looked about and saw David , he ( AC ) disdained [ d ] him ; for he was only a youth , ( AD ) ruddy and good-looking .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	43	So the Philistine ( AE ) said to David , “ Am I a dog , that you come to me with sticks ? ” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	44	And the Philistine ( AF ) said to David , “ Come to me , and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	45	Then David said to the Philistine , “ You come to me with a sword , with a spear , and with a javelin . ( AG ) But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts , the God of the armies of Israel , whom you have ( AH ) defied .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	46	This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand , and I will strike you and take your head from you . And this day I will give ( AI ) the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth , ( AJ ) that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	47	Then all this assembly shall know that the Lord ( AK ) does not save with sword and spear ; for ( AL ) the battle is the Lord ’ s , and He will give you into our hands. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	48	So it was , when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David , that David hurried and ( AM ) ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	49	Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone ; and he slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead , so that the stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the earth .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a ( AN ) sling and a stone , and struck the Philistine and killed him . But there was no sword in the hand of David .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	51	Therefore David ran and stood over the Philistine , took his ( AO ) sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him , and cut off his head with it . And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , ( AP ) they fled .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	52	Now the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted , and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance of [ e ] the valley and to the gates of Ekron . And the wounded of the Philistines fell along the road to ( AQ ) Shaaraim , even as far as Gath and Ekron .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	53	Then the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines , and they plundered their tents .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	54	And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem , but he put his armor in his tent .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	55	When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine , he said to ( AR ) Abner , the commander of the army , “ Abner , ( AS ) whose son is this youth ? ” And Abner said , “ As your soul lives , O king , I do not know. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	56	So the king said , “ Inquire whose son this young man is. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	57	Then , as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , Abner took him and brought him before Saul ( AT ) with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	17	58	And Saul said to him , “ Whose son are you , young man ? ” So David answered , ( AU ) “ I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	1	Samuel 18:29 all the days Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	18	So David said to Saul , ( X ) “ Who am I , and what is my life or my father ’ s family in Israel , that I should be son-in-law to the king ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	2	Saul took him that day , ( C ) and would not let him go home to his father ’ s house anymore .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	3	Then Jonathan and David made a ( D ) covenant , because he loved him as his own soul .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	4	And Jonathan took off the robe that was on him and gave it to David , with his armor , even to his sword and his bow and his belt .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	5	So David went out wherever Saul sent him , and [ b ] behaved wisely . And Saul set him over the men of war , and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul ’ s servants .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	6	Now it had happened as they were coming home , when David was returning from the slaughter of the [ c ] Philistine , that ( E ) the women had come out of all the cities of Israel , singing and dancing , to meet King Saul , with tambourines , with joy , and with musical instruments .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	7	So the women ( F ) sang as they danced , and said : ( G ) “ Saul has slain his thousands , And David his ten thousands. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	8	Then Saul was very angry , and the saying ( H ) displeased him ; and he said , “ They have ascribed to David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed only thousands . Now what more can he have but ( I ) the kingdom ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	9	So Saul [ d ] eyed David from that day forward .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	10	And it happened on the next day that ( J ) the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul , ( K ) and he prophesied inside the house . So David ( L ) played music with his hand , as at other times ; ( M ) but there was a spear in Saul ’ s hand .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	11	And Saul ( N ) cast the spear , for he said , “ I will pin David to the wall ! ” But David escaped his presence twice .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	12	Now Saul was ( O ) afraid of David , because ( P ) the Lord was with him , but had ( Q ) departed from Saul .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	13	Therefore Saul removed him from [ e ] his presence , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and ( R ) he went out and came in before the people .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	14	And David behaved wisely in all his ways , and ( S ) the Lord was with him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	15	Therefore , when Saul saw that he behaved very wisely , he was afraid of him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	16	But ( T ) all Israel and Judah loved David , because he went out and came in before them . David Marries Michal
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	17	Then Saul said to David , “ Here is my older daughter Merab ; ( U ) I will give her to you as a wife . Only be valiant for me , and fight ( V ) the Lord ’ s battles. ” For Saul thought , ( W ) “ Let my hand not be against him , but let the hand of the Philistines be against him. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	19	But it happened at the time when Merab , Saul ’ s daughter , should have been given to David , that she was given to ( Y ) Adriel the ( Z ) Meholathite as a wife .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	20	( AA ) Now Michal , Saul ’ s daughter , loved David . And they told Saul , and the thing pleased him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	21	So Saul said , “ I will give her to him , that she may [ f ] be a snare to him , and that ( AB ) the hand of the Philistines may be against him. ” Therefore Saul said to David a second time , ( AC ) “ You shall be my son-in-law today. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	22	And Saul commanded his servants , “ Communicate with David secretly , and say , ‘ Look , the king has delight in you , and all his servants love you . Now therefore , become the king ’ s son-in-law. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	23	So Saul ’ s servants spoke those words in the hearing of David . And David said , “ Does it seem to you a light thing to be a king ’ s son-in-law , seeing I am a poor and lightly esteemed man ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	24	And the servants of Saul told him , saying , [ g ] “ In this manner David spoke. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	25	Then Saul said , “ Thus you shall say to David : ‘ The king does not desire any ( AD ) dowry but one hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to take ( AE ) vengeance on the king ’ s enemies. ’ ” But Saul ( AF ) thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	26	So when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to become the king ’ s son-in-law . Now ( AG ) the days had not expired ;
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	27	therefore David arose and went , he and ( AH ) his men , and killed two hundred men of the Philistines . And ( AI ) David brought their foreskins , and they gave them in full count to the king , that he might become the king ’ s son-in-law . Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	28	Thus Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David , and that Michal , Saul ’ s daughter , loved him ;
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	29	and Saul was still more afraid of David . So Saul became David ’ s enemy [ h ] continually .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	18	30	Then the princes of the Philistines ( AJ ) went out to war . And so it was , whenever they went out , that David ( AK ) behaved more wisely than all the servants of Saul , so that his name became highly esteemed . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	19	Now it was told Saul , saying , “ Take note , David is at Naioth in Ramah ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	2	So Jonathan told David , saying , “ My father Saul seeks to kill you . Therefore please be on your guard until morning , and stay in a secret place and hide .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	3	And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will speak with my father about you . Then what I observe , I will tell ( C ) you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	4	Thus Jonathan ( D ) spoke well of David to Saul his father , and said to him , “ Let not the king ( E ) sin against his servant , against David , because he has not sinned against you , and because his works have been very good toward you .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	5	For he took his ( F ) life in his hands and ( G ) killed the Philistine , and ( H ) the Lord brought about a great deliverance for all Israel . You saw it and rejoiced . ( I ) Why then will you ( J ) sin against innocent blood , to kill David without a cause ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	6	So Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan , and Saul swore , “ As the Lord lives , he shall not be killed. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	7	Then Jonathan called David , and Jonathan told him all these things . So Jonathan brought David to Saul , and he was in his presence ( K ) as in times past .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	8	And there was war again ; and David went out and fought with the Philistines , ( L ) and struck them with a mighty blow , and they fled from him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	9	Now ( M ) the distressing spirit from the Lord came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand . And David was playing music with his hand .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	10	Then Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear , but he slipped away from Saul ’ s presence ; and he drove the spear into the wall . So David fled and escaped that night .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	11	( N ) Saul also sent messengers to David ’ s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning . And Michal , David ’ s wife , told him , saying , “ If you do not save your life tonight , tomorrow you will be killed. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	12	So Michal ( O ) let David down through a window . And he went and fled and escaped .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	13	And Michal took [ a ] an image and laid it in the bed , put a cover of goats ’ hair for his head , and covered it with clothes .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	14	So when Saul sent messengers to take David , she said , “ He is sick. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	15	Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David , saying , “ Bring him up to me in the bed , that I may kill him. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	16	And when the messengers had come in , there was the image in the bed , with a cover of goats ’ hair for his head .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	17	Then Saul said to Michal , “ Why have you deceived me like this , and sent my enemy away , so that he has escaped ? ” And Michal answered Saul , “ He said to me , ‘ Let me go ! ( P ) Why should I kill you ? ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	18	So David fled and escaped , and went to ( Q ) Samuel at ( R ) Ramah , and told him all that Saul had done to him . And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	20	Then ( S ) Saul sent messengers to take David . ( T ) And when they saw the group of prophets prophesying , and Samuel standing as leader over them , the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul , and they also ( U ) prophesied .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	21	And when Saul was told , he sent other messengers , and they prophesied likewise . Then Saul sent messengers again the third time , and they prophesied also .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	22	Then he also went to Ramah , and came to the great well that is at Sechu . So he asked , and said , “ Where are Samuel and David ? ” And someone said , “ Indeed they are at Naioth in Ramah. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	23	So he went there to Naioth in Ramah . Then ( V ) the Spirit of God was upon him also , and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	19	24	( W ) And he also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in like manner , and lay down ( X ) naked all that day and all that night . Therefore they say , ( Y ) “ Is Saul also among the prophets ? ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	20	Then I will shoot three arrows to the side , as though I shot at a target ;
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	2	So Jonathan said to him , “ By no means ! You shall not die ! Indeed , my father will do nothing either great or small without first telling me . And why should my father hide this thing from me ? It is not so ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	3	Then David took an oath again , and said , “ Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your eyes , and he has said , ‘ Do not let Jonathan know this , lest he be grieved. ’ But ( A ) truly , as the Lord lives and as your soul lives , there is but a step between me and death. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	4	So Jonathan said to David , “ Whatever you yourself desire , I will do it for you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	5	And David said to Jonathan , “ Indeed tomorrow is the ( B ) New Moon , and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat . But let me go , that I may ( C ) hide in the field until the third day at evening .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	6	If your father misses me at all , then say , ‘ David earnestly asked permission of me that he might run over ( D ) to Bethlehem , his city , for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family. ’
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	7	( E ) If he says thus : ‘ It is well , ’ your servant will be safe . But if he is very angry , be sure that ( F ) evil is determined by him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	8	Therefore you shall ( G ) deal kindly with your servant , for ( H ) you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with you . Nevertheless , ( I ) if there is iniquity in me , kill me yourself , for why should you bring me to your father ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	9	But Jonathan said , “ Far be it from you ! For if I knew certainly that evil was determined by my father to come upon you , then would I not tell you ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	10	Then David said to Jonathan , “ Who will tell me , or what if your father answers you roughly ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	11	And Jonathan said to David , “ Come , let us go out into the field. ” So both of them went out into the field .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	12	Then Jonathan said to David : “ The Lord God of Israel is witness ! When I have [ a ] sounded out my father sometime tomorrow , or the third day , and indeed there is good toward David , and I do not send to you and tell you ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	13	may ( J ) the Lord do so and much more to Jonathan . But if it pleases my father to do you evil , then I will report it to you and send you away , that you may go in safety . And ( K ) the Lord be with you as He has ( L ) been with my father .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	14	And you shall not only show me the kindness of the Lord while I still live , that I may not die ;
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	15	but ( M ) you shall not [ b ] cut off your kindness from my [ c ] house forever , no , not when the Lord has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the [ d ] house of David , saying , ( N ) “ Let the Lord require it at the hand of David ’ s enemies. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	17	Now Jonathan again caused David to vow , because he loved him ; ( O ) for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	18	Then Jonathan said to David , ( P ) “ Tomorrow is the New Moon ; and you will be missed , because your seat will be empty .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	19	And when you have stayed three days , go down quickly and come to ( Q ) the place where you hid on the day of the deed ; and remain by the stone Ezel .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	21	and there I will send a lad , saying , ‘ Go , find the arrows. ’ If I expressly say to the lad , ‘ Look , the arrows are on this side of you ; get them and come ’ —then , ( R ) as the Lord lives , there is safety for you and no harm .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	22	But if I say thus to the young man , ‘ Look , the arrows are beyond you ’ —go your way , for the Lord has sent you away .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	23	And as for ( S ) the matter which you and I have spoken of , indeed the Lord be between you and me forever. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	24	Then David hid in the field . And when the New Moon had come , the king sat down to eat the feast .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	25	Now the king sat on his seat , as at other times , on a seat by the wall . And [ e ] Jonathan arose , and Abner sat by Saul ’ s side , but David ’ s place was empty .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	26	Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day , for he thought , “ Something has happened to him ; he is unclean , surely he is ( T ) unclean. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	27	And it happened the next day , the second day of the month , that David ’ s place was empty . And Saul said to Jonathan his son , “ Why has the son of Jesse not come to eat , either yesterday or today ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	28	So Jonathan ( U ) answered Saul , “ David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	29	And he said , ‘ Please let me go , for our family has a sacrifice in the city , and my brother has commanded me to be there . And now , if I have found favor in your eyes , please let me get away and see my brothers. ’ Therefore he has not come to the king ’ s table. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	30	Then Saul ’ s anger was aroused against Jonathan , and he said to him , “ You son of a perverse , rebellious woman ! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother ’ s nakedness ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth , you shall not be established , nor your kingdom . Now therefore , send and bring him to me , for he [ f ] shall surely die. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	32	And Jonathan answered Saul his father , and said to him , ( V ) “ Why should he be killed ? What has he done ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	33	Then Saul ( W ) cast a spear at him to [ g ] kill him , ( X ) by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to kill David .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	34	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and ate no food the second day of the month , for he was grieved for David , because his father had treated him shamefully .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	35	And so it was , in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little lad was with him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	36	Then he said to his lad , “ Now run , find the arrows which I shoot. ” As the lad ran , he shot an arrow beyond him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	37	When the lad had come to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried out after the lad and said , “ Is not the arrow beyond you ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	38	And Jonathan cried out after the lad , “ Make haste , hurry , do not delay ! ” So Jonathan ’ s lad gathered up the arrows and came back to his master .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	39	But the lad did not know anything . Only Jonathan and David knew of the matter .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	40	Then Jonathan gave his [ h ] weapons to his lad , and said to him , “ Go , carry them to the city. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	41	As soon as the lad had gone , David arose from a place toward the south , fell on his face to the ground , and bowed down three times . And they kissed one another ; and they wept together , but David more so .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	20	42	Then Jonathan said to David , ( Y ) “ Go in peace , since we have both sworn in the name of the Lord , saying , ‘ May the Lord be between you and me , and between your descendants and my descendants , forever. ’ ” So he arose and departed , and Jonathan went into the city .

NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	21	Now David came to Nob , to Ahimelech the priest . And ( A ) Ahimelech was ( B ) afraid when he met David , and said to him , “ Why are you alone , and no one is with you ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	2	So David said to Ahimelech the priest , “ The king has ordered me on some business , and said to me , ‘ Do not let anyone know anything about the business on which I send you , or what I have commanded you. ’ And I have directed my young men to such and such a place .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	3	Now therefore , what have you on hand ? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand , or whatever can be found. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	4	And the priest answered David and said , “ There is no [ a ] common bread on hand ; but there is ( C ) holy [ b ] bread , ( D ) if the young men have at least kept themselves from women. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	5	Then David answered the priest , and said to him , “ Truly , women have been kept from us about three days since I came out . And [ c ] the ( E ) vessels of the young men are holy , and the bread is in effect common , even though it was consecrated ( F ) in the vessel this day. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	6	So the priest ( G ) gave him holy bread ; for there was no bread there but the showbread ( H ) which had been taken from before the Lord , in order to put hot bread in its place on the day when it was taken away .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before the Lord . And his name was ( I ) Doeg , an Edomite , the chief of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	8	And David said to Ahimelech , “ Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword ? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me , because the king ’ s business required haste. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	9	So the priest said , “ The sword of Goliath the Philistine , whom you killed in ( J ) the Valley of Elah , ( K ) there it is , wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod . If you will take that , take it . For there is no other except that one here. ” And David said , “ There is none like it ; give it to me. ” David Flees to Gath
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	10	Then David arose and fled that day from before Saul , and went to Achish the king of Gath .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	11	And ( L ) the servants of Achish said to him , “ Is this not David the king of the land ? Did they not sing of him to one another in dances , saying : ( M ) ‘ Saul has slain his thousands , And David his ten thousands ’ ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	12	Now David ( N ) took these words [ d ] to heart , and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	13	So ( O ) he changed his behavior before them , pretended [ e ] madness in their hands , [ f ] scratched on the doors of the gate , and let his saliva fall down on his beard .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	14	Then Achish said to his servants , “ Look , you see the man is insane . Why have you brought him to me ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	21	15	Have I need of madmen , that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence ? Shall this fellow come into my house ? ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	1	Samuel 22:22 family Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	22	So David said to Abiathar , “ I knew that day , when Doeg the Edomite was there , that he would surely tell Saul . I have caused the death of all the persons of your father ’ s [ c ] house .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	2	( D ) And everyone who was in distress , everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was [ a ] discontented gathered to him . So he became captain over them . And there were about ( E ) four hundred men with him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	3	Then David went from there to Mizpah of ( F ) Moab ; and he said to the king of Moab , “ Please let my father and mother come here with you , till I know what God will do for me. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	4	So he brought them before the king of Moab , and they dwelt with him all the time that David was in the stronghold .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	5	Now the prophet ( G ) Gad said to David , “ Do not stay in the stronghold ; depart , and go to the land of Judah. ” So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth . Saul Murders the Priests
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	6	When Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered—now Saul was staying in ( H ) Gibeah under a tamarisk tree in Ramah , with his spear in his hand , and all his servants standing about him—
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	7	then Saul said to his servants who stood about him , “ Hear now , you Benjamites ! Will the son of Jesse ( I ) give every one of you fields and vineyards , and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	8	All of you have conspired against me , and there is no one who reveals to me that ( J ) my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse ; and there is not one of you who is sorry for me or reveals to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me , to lie in wait , as it is this day. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	9	Then answered ( K ) Doeg the Edomite , who was set over the servants of Saul , and said , “ I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob , to ( L ) Ahimelech the son of ( M ) Ahitub .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	10	( N ) And he inquired of the Lord for him , ( O ) gave him provisions , and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	11	So the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father ’ s house , the priests who were in Nob . And they all came to the king .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	12	And Saul said , “ Hear now , son of Ahitub ! ” He answered , “ Here I am , my lord. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	13	Then Saul said to him , “ Why have you conspired against me , you and the son of Jesse , in that you have given him bread and a sword , and have inquired of God for him , that he should rise against me , to lie in wait , as it is this day ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	14	So Ahimelech answered the king and said , “ And who among all your servants is as ( P ) faithful as David , who is the king ’ s son-in-law , who goes at your bidding , and is honorable in your house ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	15	Did I then begin to inquire of God for him ? Far be it from me ! Let not the king impute anything to his servant , or to any in the house of my father . For your servant knew nothing of all this , little or much. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	16	And the king said , “ You shall surely die , Ahimelech , you and all ( Q ) your father ’ s house ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	17	Then the king said to the guards who stood about him , “ Turn and kill the priests of the Lord , because their hand also is with David , and because they knew when he fled and did not tell it to me. ” But the servants of the king ( R ) would not lift their hands to strike the priests of the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	18	And the king said to Doeg , “ You turn and kill the priests ! ” So Doeg the Edomite turned and [ b ] struck the priests , and ( S ) killed on that day eighty-five men who wore a linen ephod .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	19	( T ) Also Nob , the city of the priests , he struck with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and nursing infants , oxen and donkeys and sheep—with the edge of the sword .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	20	( U ) Now one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub , named Abiathar , ( V ) escaped and fled after David .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	21	And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the Lord ’ s priests .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	22	23	Stay with me ; do not fear . ( W ) For he who seeks my life seeks your life , but with me you shall be safe. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	23	See therefore , and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides ; and come back to me with certainty , and I will go with you . And it shall be , if he is in the land , that I will search for him throughout all the [ e ] clans of Judah. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	2	Therefore David ( B ) inquired of the Lord , saying , “ Shall I go and [ a ] attack these Philistines ? ” And the Lord said to David , “ Go and attack the Philistines , and save Keilah. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	3	But David ’ s men said to him , “ Look , we are afraid here in Judah . How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	4	Then David inquired of the Lord once again . And the Lord answered him and said , “ Arise , go down to Keilah . For I will deliver the Philistines into your hand. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	5	And David and his men went to Keilah and ( C ) fought with the Philistines , struck them with a mighty blow , and took away their livestock . So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	6	Now it happened , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech ( D ) fled to David at Keilah , that he went down with an ephod in his hand .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	7	And Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah . So Saul said , “ God has delivered him into my hand , for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	8	Then Saul called all the people together for war , to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	9	When David knew that Saul plotted evil against him , ( E ) he said to Abiathar the priest , “ Bring the ephod here. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	10	Then David said , “ O Lord God of Israel , Your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah ( F ) to destroy the city for my sake .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand ? Will Saul come down , as Your servant has heard ? O Lord God of Israel , I pray , tell Your servant. ” And the Lord said , “ He will come down. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	12	Then David said , “ Will the men of Keilah [ b ] deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? ” And the Lord said , “ They will deliver you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	13	So David and his men , ( G ) about six hundred , arose and departed from Keilah and went wherever they could go . Then it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah ; so he halted the expedition . David in Wilderness Strongholds
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	14	And David stayed in strongholds in the wilderness , and remained in ( H ) the mountains in the Wilderness of ( I ) Ziph . Saul ( J ) sought him every day , but God did not deliver him into his hand .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	15	So David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life . And David was in the Wilderness of Ziph [ c ] in a forest .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	16	Then Jonathan , Saul ’ s son , arose and went to David in the woods and [ d ] strengthened his hand in God .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	17	And he said to him , ( K ) “ Do not fear , for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you . You shall be king over Israel , and I shall be next to you . ( L ) Even my father Saul knows that. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	18	So the two of them ( M ) made a covenant before the Lord . And David stayed in the woods , and Jonathan went to his own house .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	19	Then the Ziphites ( N ) came up to Saul at Gibeah , saying , “ Is David not hiding with us in strongholds in the woods , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of Jeshimon ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	20	Now therefore , O king , come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down ; and ( O ) our part shall be to deliver him into the king ’ s hand. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	21	And Saul said , “ Blessed are you of the Lord , for you have compassion on me .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	22	Please go and find out for sure , and see the place where his hideout is , and who has seen him there . For I am told he is very crafty .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	24	So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul . But David and his men were in the Wilderness ( P ) of Maon , in the plain on the south of Jeshimon .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	25	When Saul and his men went to seek him , they told David . Therefore he went down [ f ] to the rock , and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon . And when Saul heard that , he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	26	Then Saul went on one side of the mountain , and David and his men on the other side of the mountain . ( Q ) So David made haste to get away from Saul , for Saul and his men ( R ) were encircling David and his men to take them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	27	( S ) But a messenger came to Saul , saying , “ Hurry and come , for the Philistines have invaded the land ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	28	Therefore Saul returned from pursuing David , and went against the Philistines ; so they called that place [ g ] the Rock of Escape .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	23	29	Then David went up from there and dwelt in strongholds at ( T ) En Gedi . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	1	Samuel
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	24	Now it happened , ( A ) when Saul had returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , “ Take note ! David is in the Wilderness of En Gedi. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel , and ( B ) went to seek David and his men on the Rocks of the Wild Goats .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	3	So he came to the sheepfolds by the road , where there was a cave ; and ( C ) Saul went in to ( D ) attend to his needs . ( ( E ) David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave . )
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	4	( F ) Then the men of David said to him , “ This is the day of which the Lord said to you , ‘ Behold , I will deliver your enemy into your hand , that you may do to him as it seems good to you. ’ ” And David arose and secretly cut off a corner of Saul ’ s robe .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	5	Now it happened afterward that ( G ) David ’ s heart troubled him because he had cut Saul ’ s robe .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	6	And he said to his men , ( H ) “ The Lord forbid that I should do this thing to my master , the Lord ’ s anointed , to stretch out my hand against him , seeing he is the anointed of the Lord. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	7	So David ( I ) restrained his servants with these words , and did not allow them to rise against Saul . And Saul got up from the cave and went on his way .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	8	David also arose afterward , went out of the cave , and called out to Saul , saying , “ My lord the king ! ” And when Saul looked behind him , David stooped with his face to the earth , and bowed down .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	9	And David said to Saul : ( J ) “ Why do you listen to the words of men who say , ‘ Indeed David seeks your harm ’ ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	10	Look , this day your eyes have seen that the Lord delivered you today into my hand in the cave , and someone urged me to kill you . But my eye spared you , and I said , ‘ I will not stretch out my hand against my lord , for he is the Lord ’ s anointed. ’
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	11	Moreover , my father , see ! Yes , see the corner of your robe in my hand ! For in that I cut off the corner of your robe , and did not kill you , know and see that there is ( K ) neither evil nor rebellion in my hand , and I have not sinned against you . Yet you ( L ) hunt my life to take it .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	12	( M ) Let the Lord judge between you and me , and let the Lord avenge me on you . But my hand shall not be against you .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	13	As the proverb of the ancients says , ( N ) ‘ Wickedness proceeds from the wicked. ’ But my hand shall not be against you .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	14	After whom has the king of Israel come out ? Whom do you pursue ? ( O ) A dead dog ? ( P ) A flea ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	15	( Q ) Therefore let the Lord be judge , and judge between you and me , and ( R ) see and ( S ) plead my case , and deliver me out of your hand. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	16	So it was , when David had finished speaking these words to Saul , that Saul said , ( T ) “ Is this your voice , my son David ? ” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	17	( U ) Then he said to David : “ You are ( V ) more righteous than I ; for ( W ) you have rewarded me with good , whereas I have rewarded you with evil .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	18	And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me ; for when ( X ) the Lord delivered me into your hand , you did not kill me .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	19	For if a man finds his enemy , will he let him get away safely ? Therefore may the Lord reward you with good for what you have done to me this day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	20	And now ( Y ) I know indeed that you shall surely be king , and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	21	( Z ) Therefore swear now to me by the Lord ( AA ) that you will not cut off my descendants after me , and that you will not destroy my name from my father ’ s house. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	24	22	So David swore to Saul . And Saul went home , but David and his men went up to ( AB ) the stronghold . Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	1	Samuel 25:44 Paltiel ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	25	Please , let not my lord [ g ] regard this scoundrel Nabal . For as his name is , so is he : [ h ] Nabal is his name , and folly is with him ! But I , your maidservant , did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	2	Sam . 3:15 Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	3	The name of the man was Nabal , and the name of his wife Abigail . And she was a woman of good understanding and beautiful appearance ; but the man was harsh and evil in his doings . He was of the house of ( F ) Caleb .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	4	When David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was ( G ) shearing his sheep ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	5	David sent ten young men ; and David said to the young men , “ Go up to Carmel , go to Nabal , and greet him in my name .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	6	And thus you shall say to him who lives in prosperity : ( H ) ‘ Peace be to you , peace to your house , and peace to all that you have !
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	7	Now I have heard that you have shearers . Your shepherds were with us , and we did not hurt them , ( I ) nor was there anything missing from them all the while they were in Carmel .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask your young men , and they will tell you . Therefore [ b ] let my young men find favor in your eyes , for we come on ( J ) a feast day . Please give whatever comes to your hand to your servants and to your son David. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	9	So when David ’ s young men came , they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David , and waited .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	10	Then Nabal answered David ’ s servants , and said , ( K ) “ Who is David , and who is the son of Jesse ? There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	11	( L ) Shall I then take my bread and my water and my [ c ] meat that I have killed for my shearers , and give it to men when I do not know where they are from ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	12	So David ’ s young men turned on their heels and went back ; and they came and told him all these words .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	13	Then David said to his men , “ Every man gird on his sword. ” So every man girded on his sword , and David also girded on his sword . And about four hundred men went with David , and two hundred ( M ) stayed with the supplies .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	14	Now one of the young men told Abigail , Nabal ’ s wife , saying , “ Look , David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master ; and he [ d ] reviled them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	15	But the men were very good to us , and ( N ) we were not hurt , nor did we miss anything as long as we accompanied them , when we were in the fields .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	16	They were ( O ) a wall to us both by night and day , all the time we were with them keeping the sheep .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	17	Now therefore , know and consider what you will do , for ( P ) harm is determined against our master and against all his household . For he is such a ( Q ) scoundrel [ e ] that one can not speak to him. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	18	Then Abigail made haste and ( R ) took two hundred loaves of bread , two skins of wine , five sheep already dressed , five seahs of roasted grain , one hundred clusters of raisins , and two hundred cakes of figs , and loaded them on donkeys .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	19	And she said to her servants , ( S ) “ Go on before me ; see , I am coming after you. ” But she did not tell her husband Nabal .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	20	So it was , as she rode on the donkey , that she went down under cover of the hill ; and there were David and his men , coming down toward her , and she met them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	21	Now David had said , “ Surely in vain I have protected all that this fellow has in the wilderness , so that nothing was missed of all that belongs to him . And he has ( T ) repaid me evil for good .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	22	( U ) May God do so , and more also , to the enemies of David , if I ( V ) leave ( W ) one male of all who belong to him by morning light. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	23	Now when Abigail saw David , she ( X ) dismounted quickly from the donkey , fell on her face before David , and bowed down to the ground .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	24	So she fell at his feet and said : “ On me , my lord , on me let this iniquity be ! And please let your maidservant [ f ] speak in your ears , and hear the words of your maidservant .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	26	Now therefore , my lord , ( Y ) as the Lord lives and as your soul lives , since the Lord has ( Z ) held you back from coming to bloodshed and from ( AA ) avenging [ i ] yourself with your own hand , now then , ( AB ) let your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be as Nabal .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	27	And now ( AC ) this present which your maidservant has brought to my lord , let it be given to the young men who follow my lord .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	28	Please forgive the trespass of your maidservant . For ( AD ) the Lord will certainly make for my lord an enduring house , because my lord ( AE ) fights the battles of the Lord , ( AF ) and evil is not found in you throughout your days .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	29	Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life , but the life of my lord shall be ( AG ) bound in the bundle of the living with the Lord your God ; and the lives of your enemies He shall ( AH ) sling out , as from the pocket of a sling .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	30	And it shall come to pass , when the Lord has done for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you , and has appointed you ( AI ) ruler over Israel ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	31	that this will be no grief to you , nor offense of heart to my lord , either that you have shed blood without cause , or that my lord has avenged himself . But when the Lord has dealt well with my lord , then remember your maidservant. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	32	Then David said to Abigail : ( AJ ) “ Blessed is the Lord God of Israel , who sent you this day to meet me !
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	33	And blessed is your advice and blessed are you , because you have ( AK ) kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	34	For indeed , as the Lord God of Israel lives , who has ( AL ) kept me back from hurting you , unless you had hurried and come to meet me , surely ( AM ) by morning light no males would have been left to Nabal ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	35	So David received from her hand what she had brought him , and said to her , ( AN ) “ Go up in peace to your house . See , I have heeded your voice and ( AO ) respected your person. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	36	Now Abigail went to Nabal , and there he was , ( AP ) holding a feast in his house , like the feast of a king . And Nabal ’ s heart was merry within him , for he was very drunk ; therefore she told him nothing , little or much , until morning light .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	37	So it was , in the morning , when the wine had gone from Nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became like a stone .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	38	Then it happened , after about ten days , that the Lord ( AQ ) struck Nabal , and he died .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	39	So when David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , ( AR ) “ Blessed be the Lord , who has ( AS ) pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal , and has ( AT ) kept His servant from evil ! For the Lord has ( AU ) returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head. ” And David sent and proposed to Abigail , to take her as his wife .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	40	When the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel , they spoke to her saying , “ David sent us to you , to ask you to become his wife. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	41	Then she arose , bowed her face to the earth , and said , “ Here is your maidservant , a servant to ( AV ) wash the feet of the servants of my lord. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	42	So Abigail rose in haste and rode on a donkey , [ j ] attended by five of her maidens ; and she followed the messengers of David , and became his wife .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	43	David also took Ahinoam ( AW ) of Jezreel , ( AX ) and so both of them were his wives .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	25	44	But Saul had given ( AY ) Michal his daughter , David ’ s wife , to [ k ] Palti the son of Laish , who was from ( AZ ) Gallim . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	1	Samuel 26:8 Or one time Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	26	Now the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah , saying , ( A ) “ Is David not hiding in the hill of Hachilah , opposite Jeshimon ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	2	Then Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph , having ( B ) three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	3	And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah , which is opposite Jeshimon , by the road . But David stayed in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	4	David therefore sent out spies , and understood that Saul had indeed come .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	5	So David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped . And David saw the place where Saul lay , and ( C ) Abner the son of Ner , the commander of his army . Now Saul lay within the camp , with the people encamped all around him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	6	Then David answered , and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai ( D ) the son of Zeruiah , brother of ( E ) Joab , saying , “ Who will ( F ) go down with me to Saul in the camp ? ” And ( G ) Abishai said , “ I will go down with you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	7	So David and Abishai came to the people by night ; and there Saul lay sleeping within the camp , with his spear stuck in the ground by his head . And Abner and the people lay all around him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	8	Then Abishai said to David , ( H ) “ God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day . Now therefore , please , let me strike him [ a ] at once with the spear , right to the earth ; and I will not have to strike him a second time ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	9	But David said to Abishai , “ Do not destroy him ; ( I ) for who can stretch out his hand against the Lord ’ s anointed , and be guiltless ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	10	David said furthermore , “ As the Lord lives , ( J ) the Lord shall strike him , or ( K ) his day shall come to die , or he shall ( L ) go out to battle and perish .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	11	( M ) The Lord forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the Lord ’ s anointed . But please , take now the spear and the jug of water that are by his head , and let us go. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and the jug of water by Saul ’ s head , and they got away ; and no man saw or knew it or awoke . For they were all asleep , because ( N ) a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen on them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	13	Now David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of a hill afar off , a great distance being between them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	14	And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner , saying , “ Do you not answer , Abner ? ” Then Abner answered and said , “ Who are you , calling out to the king ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	15	So David said to Abner , “ Are you not a man ? And who is like you in Israel ? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king ? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	16	This thing that you have done is not good . As the Lord lives , you deserve to die , because you have not guarded your master , the Lord ’ s anointed . And now see where the king ’ s spear is , and the jug of water that was by his head. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	17	Then Saul knew David ’ s voice , and said , ( O ) “ Is that your voice , my son David ? ” David said , “ It is my voice , my lord , O king. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	18	And he said , ( P ) “ Why does my lord thus pursue his servant ? For what have I done , or what evil is in my hand ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	19	Now therefore , please , let my lord the king hear the words of his servant : If the Lord has ( Q ) stirred you up against me , let Him accept an offering . But if it is the children of men , may they be cursed before the Lord , ( R ) for they have driven me out this day from sharing in the ( S ) inheritance of the Lord , saying , ‘ Go , serve other gods. ’
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	20	So now , do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord . For the king of Israel has come out to seek ( T ) a flea , as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	21	Then Saul said , ( U ) “ I have sinned . Return , my son David . For I will harm you no more , because my life was precious in your eyes this day . Indeed I have played the fool and erred exceedingly. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	22	And David answered and said , “ Here is the king ’ s spear . Let one of the young men come over and get it .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	23	( V ) May the Lord ( W ) repay every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness ; for the Lord delivered you into my hand today , but I would not stretch out my hand against the Lord ’ s anointed .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	24	And indeed , as your life was valued much this day in my eyes , so let my life be valued much in the eyes of the Lord , and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	26	25	Then Saul said to David , “ May you be blessed , my son David ! You shall both do great things and also still ( X ) prevail. ” So David went on his way , and Saul returned to his place . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	27	And David said in his heart , “ Now I shall perish someday by the hand of Saul . There is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape to the land of the Philistines ; and Saul will [ a ] despair of me , to seek me anymore in any part of Israel . So I shall escape out of his hand. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	2	Then David arose ( A ) and went over with the six hundred men who were with him ( B ) to Achish the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	3	So David dwelt with Achish at Gath , he and his men , each man with his household , and David ( C ) with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal ’ s widow .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	4	And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath ; so he sought him no more .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	5	Then David said to Achish , “ If I have now found favor in your eyes , let them give me a place in some town in the country , that I may dwell there . For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	6	So Achish gave him Ziklag that day . Therefore ( D ) Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	7	Now [ b ] the time that David ( E ) dwelt in the country of the Philistines was one full year and four months .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	8	And David and his men went up and raided ( F ) the Geshurites , ( G ) the [ c ] Girzites , and the ( H ) Amalekites . For those nations were the inhabitants of the land from [ d ] of old , ( I ) as you go to Shur , even as far as the land of Egypt .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	9	Whenever David [ e ] attacked the land , he left neither man nor woman alive , but took away the sheep , the oxen , the donkeys , the camels , and the apparel , and returned and came to Achish .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	10	Then Achish would say , “ Where have you made a raid today ? ” And David would say , “ Against the southern area of Judah , or against the southern area of ( J ) the Jerahmeelites , or against the southern area of ( K ) the Kenites. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	11	David would save neither man nor woman alive , to bring news to Gath , saying , “ Lest they should inform on us , saying , ‘ Thus David did. ’ ” And thus was his behavior all the time he dwelt in the country of the Philistines .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	27	12	So Achish believed David , saying , “ He has made his people Israel utterly abhor him ; therefore he will be my servant forever. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	28	Now ( A ) it happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies together for war , to fight with Israel . And Achish said to David , “ You assuredly know that you will go out with me to battle , you and your men. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	2	So David said to Achish , “ Surely you know what your servant can do. ” And Achish said to David , “ Therefore I will make you one of my chief guardians forever. ” Saul Consults a Medium ( B )
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	3	Now ( C ) Samuel had died , and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in ( D ) Ramah , in his own city . And Saul had put ( E ) the mediums and the spiritists out of the land .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	4	Then the Philistines gathered together , and came and encamped at ( F ) Shunem . So Saul gathered all Israel together , and they encamped at ( G ) Gilboa .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	5	When Saul saw the army of the Philistines , he was ( H ) afraid , and his heart trembled greatly .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	6	And when Saul inquired of the Lord , ( I ) the Lord did not answer him , either by ( J ) dreams or ( K ) by Urim or by the prophets .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	7	Then Saul said to his servants , “ Find me a woman who is a medium , ( L ) that I may go to her and inquire of her. ” And his servants said to him , “ In fact , there is a woman who is a medium at En Dor. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	8	So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes , and he went , and two men with him ; and they came to the woman by night . And ( M ) he said , “ Please conduct a séance for me , and bring up for me the one I shall name to you. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	9	Then the woman said to him , “ Look , you know what Saul has done , how he has ( N ) cut off the mediums and the spiritists from the land . Why then do you lay a snare for my life , to cause me to die ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	10	And Saul swore to her by the Lord , saying , “ As the Lord lives , no punishment shall come upon you for this thing. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	11	Then the woman said , “ Whom shall I bring up for you ? ” And he said , “ Bring up Samuel for me. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	12	When the woman saw Samuel , she cried out with a loud voice . And the woman spoke to Saul , saying , “ Why have you deceived me ? For you are Saul ! ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	13	And the king said to her , “ Do not be afraid . What did you see ? ” And the woman said to Saul , “ I saw ( O ) a [ a ] spirit ascending out of the earth. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	14	So he said to her , “ What is his form ? ” And she said , “ An old man is coming up , and he is covered with ( P ) a mantle. ” And Saul perceived that it was Samuel , and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed down .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	15	Now Samuel said to Saul , “ Why have you ( Q ) disturbed me by bringing me up ? ” And Saul answered , “ I am deeply distressed ; for the Philistines make war against me , and ( R ) God has departed from me and ( S ) does not answer me anymore , neither by prophets nor by dreams . Therefore I have called you , that you may reveal to me what I should do. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	16	Then Samuel said : “ So why do you ask me , seeing the Lord has departed from you and has become your enemy ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	17	And the Lord has done for [ b ] Himself ( T ) as He spoke by me . For the Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor , David .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	18	( U ) Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord nor execute His fierce wrath upon ( V ) Amalek , therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	19	Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines . And tomorrow you and your sons will be with ( W ) me . The Lord will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	20	Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground , and was dreadfully afraid because of the words of Samuel . And there was no strength in him , for he had eaten no food all day or all night .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	21	And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was severely troubled , and said to him , “ Look , your maidservant has obeyed your voice , and I have ( X ) put my life in my hands and heeded the words which you spoke to me .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	22	Now therefore , please , heed also the voice of your maidservant , and let me set a piece of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength when you go on your way. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	23	But he refused and said , “ I will not eat. ” So his servants , together with the woman , urged him ; and he heeded their voice . Then he arose from the ground and sat on the bed .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	24	Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house , and she hastened to kill it . And she took flour and kneaded it , and baked unleavened bread from it .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	28	25	So she brought it before Saul and his servants , and they ate . Then they rose and went away that night . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	29	Then ( A ) the Philistines gathered together all their armies ( B ) at Aphek , and the Israelites encamped by a fountain which is in Jezreel .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	2	And the ( C ) lords of the Philistines [ a ] passed in review by hundreds and by thousands , but ( D ) David and his men passed in review at the rear with Achish .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	3	Then the princes of the Philistines said , “ What are these Hebrews doing here ? ” And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines , “ Is this not David , the servant of Saul king of Israel , who has been with me ( E ) these days , or these years ? And to this day I have ( F ) found no fault in him since he defected to me. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	4	But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him ; so the princes of the Philistines said to him , ( G ) “ Make this fellow return , that he may go back to the place which you have appointed for him , and do not let him go down with us to ( H ) battle , lest ( I ) in the battle he become our adversary . For with what could he reconcile himself to his master , if not with the heads of these ( J ) men ?
NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	5	Is this not David , ( K ) of whom they sang to one another in dances , saying : ( L ) ‘ Saul has slain his thousands , And David his ten thousands ’ ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	6	Then Achish called David and said to him , “ Surely , as the Lord lives , you have been upright , and ( M ) your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight . For to this day ( N ) I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me . Nevertheless the lords do not favor you .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	7	Therefore return now , and go in peace , that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	8	So David said to Achish , “ But what have I done ? And to this day what have you found in your servant as long as I have been with you , that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king ? ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	9	Then Achish answered and said to David , “ I know that you are as good in my sight ( O ) as an angel of God ; nevertheless ( P ) the princes of the Philistines have said , ‘ He shall not go up with us to the battle. ’
NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	10	Now therefore , rise early in the morning with your master ’ s servants ( Q ) who have come with [ b ] you . And as soon as you are up early in the morning and have light , depart. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	29	11	So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning , to return to the land of the Philistines . ( R ) And the Philistines went up to Jezreel . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	30	those who were in ( AB ) Hormah , those who were in [ e ] Chorashan , those who were in Athach ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	2	and had taken captive the ( C ) women and those who were there , from small to great ; they did not kill anyone , but carried them away and went their way .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	3	So David and his men came to the city , and there it was , burned with fire ; and their wives , their sons , and their daughters had been taken captive .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	4	Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	5	And David ’ s two ( D ) wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite , had been taken captive .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	6	Now David was greatly distressed , for ( E ) the people spoke of stoning him , because the soul of all the people was [ a ] grieved , every man for his sons and his daughters . ( F ) But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	7	( G ) Then David said to Abiathar the priest , Ahimelech ’ s son , “ Please bring the ephod here to me. ” And ( H ) Abiathar brought the ephod to David .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	8	( I ) So David inquired of the Lord , saying , “ Shall I pursue this troop ? Shall I overtake them ? ” And He answered him , “ Pursue , for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	9	So David went , he and the six hundred men who were with him , and came to the Brook Besor , where those stayed who were left behind .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	10	But David pursued , he and four hundred men ; ( J ) for two hundred stayed behind , who were so weary that they could not cross the Brook Besor .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	11	Then they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David ; and they gave him bread and he ate , and they let him drink water .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	12	And they gave him a piece of ( K ) a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins . So ( L ) when he had eaten , his strength came back to him ; for he had eaten no bread nor drunk water for three days and three nights .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	13	Then David said to him , “ To whom do you belong , and where are you from ? ” And he said , “ I am a young man from Egypt , servant of an Amalekite ; and my master left me behind , because three days ago I fell sick .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	14	We made an invasion of the southern area of ( M ) the Cherethites , in the territory which belongs to Judah , and of the southern area ( N ) of Caleb ; and we burned Ziklag with fire. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	15	And David said to him , “ Can you take me down to this troop ? ” So he said , “ Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my ( O ) master , and I will take you down to this troop. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	16	And when he had brought him down , there they were , spread out over all the land , ( P ) eating and drinking and dancing , because of all the great spoil which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	17	Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day . Not a man of them escaped , except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	18	So David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away , and David rescued his two wives .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	19	And nothing of theirs was lacking , either small or great , sons or daughters , spoil or anything which they had taken from them ; ( Q ) David recovered all .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	20	Then David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those other livestock , and said , “ This is David ’ s spoil. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	21	Now David came to the ( R ) two hundred men who had been so weary that they could not follow David , whom they also had made to stay at the Brook Besor . So they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him . And when David came near the people , he [ b ] greeted them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	22	Then all the wicked and ( S ) worthless [ c ] men of those who went with David answered and said , “ Because they did not go with us , we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered , except for every man ’ s wife and children , that they may lead them away and depart. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	23	But David said , “ My brethren , you shall not do so with what the Lord has given us , who has preserved us and delivered into our hand the troop that came against us .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	24	For who will heed you in this matter ? But ( T ) as his part is who goes down to the battle , so shall his part be who stays by the supplies ; they shall share alike. ”
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	25	So it was , from that day forward ; he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	30	26	Now when David came to Ziklag , he sent some of the [ d ] spoil to the elders of Judah , to his friends , saying , “ Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the Lord ” —

NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	31	Now ( B ) the Philistines fought against Israel ; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell slain on Mount ( C ) Gilboa .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	2	Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons . And the Philistines killed ( D ) Jonathan , Abinadab , and Malchishua , Saul ’ s sons .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	3	( E ) The battle became fierce against Saul . The archers [ a ] hit him , and he was severely wounded by the archers .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	4	( F ) Then Saul said to his armorbearer , “ Draw your sword , and thrust me through with it , lest ( G ) these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and [ b ] abuse me. ” But his armorbearer would not , ( H ) for he was greatly afraid . Therefore Saul took a sword and ( I ) fell on it .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	5	And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead , he also fell on his sword , and died with him .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	6	So Saul , his three sons , his armorbearer , and all his men died together that same day .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	7	And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley , and those who were on the other side of the Jordan , saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook the cities and fled ; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	8	So it happened the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	9	And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor , and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines , to ( J ) proclaim it in the temple of their idols and among the people .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	10	( K ) Then they put his armor in the temple of the ( L ) Ashtoreths , and ( M ) they fastened his body to the wall of ( N ) Beth [ c ] Shan .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	11	( O ) Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul ,
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	12	( P ) all the valiant men arose and traveled all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan ; and they came to Jabesh and ( Q ) burned them there .
NKJV	1%20Samuel	31	13	Then they took their bones and ( R ) buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh , ( S ) and fasted seven days . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	1	Now it came to pass after the ( A ) death of Saul , when David had returned from ( B ) the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had stayed two days in Ziklag ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	3	And David said to him , “ Where have you come from ? ” So he said to him , “ I have escaped from the camp of Israel. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	4	Then David said to him , ( F ) “ How did the matter go ? Please tell me. ” And he answered , “ The people have fled from the battle , many of the people are fallen and dead , and Saul and ( G ) Jonathan his son are dead also. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	5	So David said to the young man who told him , “ How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	6	Then the young man who told him said , “ As I happened by chance to be on ( H ) Mount Gilboa , there was ( I ) Saul , leaning on his spear ; and indeed the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	7	Now when he looked behind him , he saw me and called to me . And I answered , ‘ Here I am. ’
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	8	And he said to me , ‘ Who are you ? ’ So I answered him , ‘ I am an Amalekite. ’
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	9	He said to me again , ‘ Please stand over me and kill me , for [ b ] anguish has come upon me , but my life still remains in me. ’
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	10	So I stood over him and ( J ) killed him , because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen . And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm , and have brought them here to my lord. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	11	Therefore David took hold of his own clothes and ( K ) tore them , and so did all the men who were with him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	12	And they ( L ) mourned and wept and ( M ) fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son , for the ( N ) people of the Lord and for the house of Israel , because they had fallen by the sword .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	13	Then David said to the young man who told him , “ Where are you from ? ” And he answered , “ I am the son of an alien , an Amalekite. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	14	So David said to him , “ How ( O ) was it you were not ( P ) afraid to ( Q ) put forth your hand to destroy the Lord ’ s anointed ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	15	Then ( R ) David called one of the young men and said , “ Go near , and execute him ! ” And he struck him so that he died .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	16	So David said to him , ( S ) “ Your blood is on your own head , for ( T ) your own mouth has testified against you , saying , ‘ I have killed the Lord ’ s anointed. ’ ” The Song of the Bow
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	17	Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	18	( U ) and he told them to teach the children of Judah the Song of the Bow ; indeed it is written ( V ) in the Book [ c ] of Jasher :
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	19	“ The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places ! ( W ) How the mighty have fallen !
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	20	( X ) Tell it not in Gath , Proclaim it not in the streets of ( Y ) Ashkelon— Lest ( Z ) the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , Lest the daughters of ( AA ) the uncircumcised triumph .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	21	“ O ( AB ) mountains of Gilboa , ( AC ) Let there be no dew nor rain upon you , Nor fields of offerings . For the shield of the mighty is [ d ] cast away there ! The shield of Saul , not ( AD ) anointed with oil .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	22	From the blood of the slain , From the fat of the mighty , ( AE ) The bow of Jonathan did not turn back , And the sword of Saul did not return empty .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	23	“ Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their lives , And in their ( AF ) death they were not divided ; They were swifter than eagles , They were ( AG ) stronger than lions .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	24	“ O daughters of Israel , weep over Saul , Who clothed you in scarlet , with luxury ; Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	25	“ How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle ! Jonathan was slain in your high places .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	1	26	I am distressed for you , my brother Jonathan ; You have been very pleasant to me ; ( AH ) Your love to me was wonderful , Surpassing the love of women .

NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	3	And David brought up ( D ) the men who were with him , every man with his household . So they dwelt in the cities of Hebron .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	4	( E ) Then the men of Judah came , and there they ( F ) anointed David king over the house of Judah . And they told David , saying , ( G ) “ The men of Jabesh Gilead were the ones who buried Saul. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	5	So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead , and said to them , ( H ) “ You are blessed of the Lord , for you have shown this kindness to your lord , to Saul , and have buried him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	6	And now may ( I ) the Lord show kindness and truth to you . I also will repay you this kindness , because you have done this thing .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	7	Now therefore , let your hands be strengthened , and be valiant ; for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them. ” Ishbosheth Made King of Israel
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	8	But ( J ) Abner the son of Ner , commander of Saul ’ s army , took [ a ] Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to ( K ) Mahanaim ;
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	9	and he made him king over ( L ) Gilead , over the ( M ) Ashurites , over ( N ) Jezreel , over Ephraim , over Benjamin , and over all Israel .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	10	Ishbosheth , Saul ’ s son , was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel , and he reigned two years . Only the house of Judah followed David .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	11	And ( O ) the [ b ] time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months . Israel and Judah at War
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	12	Now Abner the son of Ner , and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul , went out from Mahanaim to ( P ) Gibeon .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	13	And ( Q ) Joab the son of Zeruiah , and the servants of David , went out and met them by ( R ) the pool of Gibeon . So they sat down , one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	14	Then Abner said to Joab , “ Let the young men now arise and compete before us. ” And Joab said , “ Let them arise. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	15	So they arose and went over by number , twelve from Benjamin , followers of Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and twelve from the servants of David .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	16	And each one grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent ’ s side ; so they fell down together . Therefore that place was called [ c ] the Field of Sharp Swords , which is in Gibeon .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	17	So there was a very fierce battle that day , and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	18	Now the ( S ) three sons of Zeruiah were there : Joab and Abishai and Asahel . And Asahel was ( T ) as fleet of foot ( U ) as a wild gazelle .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	19	So Asahel pursued Abner , and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	20	Then Abner looked behind him and said , “ Are you Asahel ? ” He answered , “ I am. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	21	And Abner said to him , “ Turn aside to your right hand or to your left , and lay hold on one of the young men and take his armor for yourself. ” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	22	So Abner said again to Asahel , “ Turn aside from following me . Why should I strike you to the ground ? How then could I face your brother Joab ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	23	However , he refused to turn aside . Therefore Abner struck him ( V ) in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear , so that the spear came out of his back ; and he fell down there and died on the spot . So it was that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died , stood ( W ) still .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	24	Joab and Abishai also pursued Abner . And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah , which is before Giah by the road to the Wilderness of Gibeon .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	25	Now the children of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became [ d ] a unit , and took their stand on top of a hill .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	26	Then Abner called to Joab and said , “ Shall the sword devour forever ? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the latter end ? How long will it be then until you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	27	And Joab said , “ As God lives , [ e ] unless ( X ) you had spoken , surely then by morning all the people would have given up pursuing their brethren. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	28	So Joab blew a trumpet ; and all the people stood still and did not pursue Israel anymore , nor did they fight anymore .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	2	29	Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain , crossed over the Jordan , and went through all Bithron ; and they came to Mahanaim .

NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	6	Now it was so , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner was strengthening his hold on the house of Saul .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	7	And Saul had a concubine , whose name was ( G ) Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah . So Ishbosheth said to Abner , “ Why have you ( H ) gone in to my father ’ s concubine ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	8	Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth , and said , “ Am I ( I ) a dog ’ s head that belongs to Judah ? Today I show loyalty to the house of Saul your father , to his brothers , and to his friends , and have not delivered you into the hand of David ; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman ?
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	9	( J ) May God do so to Abner , and more also , if I do not do for David ( K ) as the Lord has sworn to him—
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	10	to transfer the kingdom from the [ b ] house of Saul , and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah , ( L ) from Dan to Beersheba. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	11	And he could not answer Abner another word , because he feared him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	12	Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David , saying , “ Whose is the land ? ” saying also , “ Make your covenant with me , and indeed my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel to you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	13	And David said , “ Good , I will make a covenant with you . But one thing I require of you : ( M ) you shall not see my face unless you first bring ( N ) Michal , Saul ’ s daughter , when you come to see my face. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	14	So David sent messengers to ( O ) Ishbosheth , Saul ’ s son , saying , “ Give me my wife Michal , whom I betrothed to myself ( P ) for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	15	And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband , from [ c ] Paltiel the son of Laish .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	16	Then her husband went along with her to ( Q ) Bahurim , [ d ] weeping behind her . So Abner said to him , “ Go , return ! ” And he returned .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	17	Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel , saying , “ In time past you were seeking for David to be king over you .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	18	Now then , do it ! ( R ) For the Lord has spoken of David , saying , ‘ By the hand of My servant David , [ e ] I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of all their enemies. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	19	And Abner also spoke in the hearing of ( S ) Benjamin . Then Abner also went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	20	So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron . And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	21	Then Abner said to David , “ I will arise and go , and ( T ) gather all Israel to my lord the king , that they may make a covenant with you , and that you may ( U ) reign over all that your heart desires. ” So David sent Abner away , and he went in peace . Joab Murders Abner
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	22	At that moment the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much [ f ] spoil with them . But Abner was not with David in Hebron , for he had sent him away , and he had gone in peace .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	23	When Joab and all the troops that were with him had come , they told Joab , saying , “ Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he sent him away , and he has gone in peace. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	24	Then Joab came to the king and said , “ What have you done ? Look , Abner came to you ; why is it that you sent him away , and he has already gone ?
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	25	Surely you realize that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you , to know ( V ) your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you are doing. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	26	And when Joab had gone from David ’ s presence , he sent messengers after Abner , who brought him back from the well of Sirah . But David did not know it .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	27	Now when Abner had returned to Hebron , Joab ( W ) took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately , and there [ g ] stabbed him ( X ) in the stomach , so that he died for the blood of ( Y ) Asahel his brother .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	28	Afterward , when David heard it , he said , “ My kingdom and I are [ h ] guiltless before the Lord forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	29	( Z ) Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father ’ s house ; and let there never fail to be in the [ i ] house of Joab one ( AA ) who has a discharge or is a leper , who leans on a staff or falls by the sword , or who lacks bread. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	30	So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner , because he had killed their brother ( AB ) Asahel at Gibeon in the battle . David ’ s Mourning for Abner
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	31	Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him , ( AC ) “ Tear your clothes , ( AD ) gird yourselves with sackcloth , and mourn for Abner. ” And King David followed the coffin .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	32	So they buried Abner in Hebron ; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner , and all the people wept .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	33	And the king sang a lament over Abner and said : “ Should Abner die as a ( AE ) fool dies ?
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	34	Your hands were not bound Nor your feet put into fetters ; As a man falls before wicked men , so you fell. ” Then all the people wept over him again .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	35	And when all the people came ( AF ) to persuade David to eat food while it was still day , David took an oath , saying , ( AG ) “ God do so to me , and more also , if I taste bread or anything else ( AH ) till the sun goes down ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	36	Now all the people took note of it , and it pleased them , since whatever the king did pleased all the people .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	37	For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king ’ s intent to kill Abner the son of Ner .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	38	Then the king said to his servants , “ Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel ?
NKJV	2%20Samuel	3	39	And I am weak today , though anointed king ; and these men , the sons of Zeruiah , ( AI ) are too harsh for me . ( AJ ) The Lord shall repay the evildoer according to his wickedness. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	4	9	But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , and said to them , “ As the Lord lives , ( K ) who has redeemed my life from all adversity ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	4	10	when ( L ) someone told me , saying , ‘ Look , Saul is dead , ’ thinking to have brought good news , I arrested him and had him executed in Ziklag—the one who thought I would give him a reward for his news .

NKJV	2%20Samuel	5	7	Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion ( O ) ( that is , the City of David ) .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	5	8	Now David said on that day , “ Whoever climbs up by way of the water shaft and defeats the Jebusites ( the lame and the blind , who are hated by David ’ s soul ) , ( P ) he shall be chief and captain. ” Therefore they say , “ The blind and the lame shall not come into the house. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	5	9	Then David dwelt in the stronghold , and called it ( Q ) the City of David . And David built all around from [ a ] the Millo and inward .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	5	10	So David went on and became great , and ( R ) the Lord God of hosts was with ( S ) him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	5	11	Then ( T ) Hiram ( U ) king of Tyre sent messengers to David , and cedar trees , and carpenters and masons . And they built David a house .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	5	12	So David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel , and that He had ( V ) exalted His kingdom ( W ) for the sake of His people Israel .

NKJV	2%20Samuel	5	20	So David went to ( AF ) Baal Perazim , and David defeated them there ; and he said , “ The Lord has broken through my enemies before me , like a breakthrough of water. ” Therefore he called the name of that place [ d ] Baal Perazim .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	5	21	And they left their [ e ] images there , and David and his men ( AG ) carried them away .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	5	22	( AH ) Then the Philistines went up once again and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim .

NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	4	And they brought it out of ( E ) the house of Abinadab , which was on the hill , accompanying the ark of God ; and Ahio went before the ark .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	5	Then David and all the house of Israel ( F ) played music before the Lord on all kinds of instruments of fir wood , on harps , on stringed instruments , on tambourines , on sistrums , and on cymbals .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	7	Then the anger of the Lord was aroused against Uzzah , and God struck him there for his [ e ] error ; and he died there by the ark of God .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	8	And David became angry because of the Lord ’ s outbreak against Uzzah ; and he called the name of the place [ f ] Perez Uzzah to this day .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	9	( I ) David was afraid of the Lord that day ; and he said , “ How can the ark of the Lord come to me ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	10	So David would not move the ark of the Lord with him into the ( J ) City of David ; but David took it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the ( K ) Gittite .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	11	( L ) The ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months . And the Lord ( M ) blessed Obed-Edom and all his household .

NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	17	So ( U ) they brought the ark of the Lord , and set it in ( V ) its place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it . Then David ( W ) offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	18	And when David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings , ( X ) he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	19	( Y ) Then he distributed among all the people , among the whole multitude of Israel , both the women and the men , to everyone a loaf of bread , a piece of meat , and a cake of raisins . So all the people departed , everyone to his house .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	20	( Z ) Then David returned to bless his household . And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David , and said , “ How glorious was the king of Israel today , ( AA ) uncovering himself today in the eyes of the maids of his servants , as one of the ( AB ) base fellows [ h ] shamelessly uncovers himself ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	21	So David said to Michal , “ It was before the Lord , ( AC ) who chose me instead of your father and all his house , to appoint me ruler over the ( AD ) people of the Lord , over Israel . Therefore I will play music before the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	6	22	And I will be even more undignified than this , and will be humble in my own sight . But as for the maidservants of whom you have spoken , by them I will be held in honor. ”

NKJV	2%20Samuel	9	9	And the king called to Ziba , Saul ’ s servant , and said to him , ( H ) “ I have given to your master ’ s son all that belonged to Saul and to all his house .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	9	3	Then the king said , “ Is there not still someone of the house of Saul , to whom I may show ( C ) the kindness of God ? ” And Ziba said to the king , “ There is still a son of Jonathan who is ( D ) lame in his feet. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	9	4	So the king said to him , “ Where is he ? ” And Ziba said to the king , “ Indeed he is in the house of ( E ) Machir the son of Ammiel , in Lo Debar. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	9	5	Then King David sent and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , from Lo Debar .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	9	6	Now when ( F ) Mephibosheth [ b ] the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , had come to David , he fell on his face and prostrated himself . Then David said , “ Mephibosheth ? ” And he answered , “ Here is your servant ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	9	7	So David said to him , “ Do not fear , for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father ’ s sake , and will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather ; and you shall eat bread at my table continually. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	9	8	Then he bowed himself , and said , “ What is your servant , that you should look upon such ( G ) a dead dog as I ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	9	10	You therefore , and your sons and your servants , shall work the land for him , and you shall bring in the harvest , that your master ’ s son may have food to eat . But Mephibosheth your master ’ s son ( I ) shall eat bread at my table always. ” Now Ziba had ( J ) fifteen sons and twenty servants .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	9	11	Then Ziba said to the king , “ According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant , so will your servant do. ” “ As for Mephibosheth , ” said the king , “ he shall eat at [ c ] my table like one of the king ’ s sons. ”

NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	10	And the rest of the people he put under the command of ( M ) Abishai his brother , that he might set them in battle array against the people of Ammon .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	3	And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun their lord , “ Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you ? Has David not rather sent his servants to you to search the city , to spy it out , and to overthrow it ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	4	Therefore Hanun took David ’ s servants , shaved off half of their beards , cut off their garments in the middle , ( E ) at their buttocks , and sent them away .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	5	When they told David , he sent to meet them , because the men were greatly [ a ] ashamed . And the king said , “ Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown , and then return. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	6	When the people of Ammon saw that they ( F ) had made themselves repulsive to David , the people of Ammon sent and hired ( G ) the Syrians of ( H ) Beth Rehob and the Syrians of Zoba , twenty thousand foot soldiers ; and from the king of ( I ) Maacah one thousand men , and from ( J ) Ish-Tob twelve thousand men .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	7	Now when David heard of it , he sent Joab and all the army of ( K ) the mighty men .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	8	Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array at the entrance of the gate . And ( L ) the Syrians of Zoba , Beth Rehob , Ish-Tob , and Maacah were by themselves in the field .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	9	When Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind , he chose some of Israel ’ s best and put them in battle array against the Syrians .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	11	Then he said , “ If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	12	( N ) Be of good courage , and let us ( O ) be strong for our people and for the cities of our God . And may ( P ) the Lord do what is good in His sight. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	13	So Joab and the people who were with him drew near for the battle against the Syrians , and they fled before him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	14	When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing , they also fled before Abishai , and entered the city . So Joab returned from the people of Ammon and went to ( Q ) Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	15	When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel , they gathered together .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	16	Then [ b ] Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond [ c ] the River , and they came to Helam . And [ d ] Shobach the commander of Hadadezer ’ s army went before them .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	17	When it was told David , he gathered all Israel , crossed over the Jordan , and came to Helam . And the Syrians set themselves in battle array against David and fought with him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	18	Then the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand ( R ) horsemen of the Syrians , and struck Shobach the commander of their army , who died there .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	10	19	And when all the kings who were servants to [ e ] Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel , they made peace with Israel and ( S ) served them . So the Syrians were afraid to help the people of Ammon anymore . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	11	And Uriah said to David , ( L ) “ The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents , and ( M ) my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields . Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink , and to lie with my wife ? As you live , and as your soul lives , I will not do this thing. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	3	So David sent and inquired about the woman . And someone said , “ Is this not [ a ] Bathsheba , the daughter of [ b ] Eliam , the wife ( F ) of Uriah the ( G ) Hittite ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	4	Then David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came to him , and ( H ) he lay with her , for she was ( I ) cleansed from her impurity ; and she returned to her house .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	5	And the woman conceived ; so she sent and told David , and said , “ I am with child. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	6	Then David sent to Joab , saying , “ Send me Uriah the Hittite. ” And Joab sent Uriah to David .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	7	When Uriah had come to him , David asked how Joab was doing , and how the people were doing , and how the war prospered .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	8	And David said to Uriah , “ Go down to your house and ( J ) wash your feet. ” So Uriah departed from the king ’ s house , and a gift of food from the king followed him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	9	But Uriah slept at the ( K ) door of the king ’ s house with all the servants of his lord , and did not go down to his house .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	10	So when they told David , saying , “ Uriah did not go down to his house , ” David said to Uriah , “ Did you not come from a journey ? Why did you not go down to your house ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	12	Then David said to Uriah , “ Wait here today also , and tomorrow I will let you depart. ” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	13	Now when David called him , he ate and drank before him ; and he made him ( N ) drunk . And at evening he went out to lie on his bed ( O ) with the servants of his lord , but he did not go down to his house .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	14	In the morning it happened that David ( P ) wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	15	And he wrote in the letter , saying , “ Set Uriah in the forefront of the [ c ] hottest battle , and retreat from him , that he may ( Q ) be struck down and die. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	16	So it was , while Joab besieged the city , that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there were valiant men .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	17	Then the men of the city came out and fought with Joab . And some of the people of the servants of David fell ; and Uriah the Hittite died also .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	18	Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	19	and charged the messenger , saying , “ When you have finished telling the matters of the war to the king ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	20	if it happens that the king ’ s wrath rises , and he says to you : ‘ Why did you approach so near to the city when you fought ? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall ?
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	21	Who struck ( R ) Abimelech the son of [ d ] Jerubbesheth ? Was it not a woman who cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall , so that he died in Thebez ? Why did you go near the wall ? ’ —then you shall say , ‘ Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	22	So the messenger went , and came and told David all that Joab had sent by him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	23	And the messenger said to David , “ Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field ; then we drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	24	The archers shot from the wall at your servants ; and some of the king ’ s servants are dead , and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	25	Then David said to the messenger , “ Thus you shall say to Joab : ‘ Do not let this thing [ e ] displease you , for the sword devours one as well as another . Strengthen your attack against the city , and overthrow it. ’ So encourage him. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	26	When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead , she mourned for her husband .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	11	27	And when her mourning was over , David sent and brought her to his house , and she ( S ) became his wife and bore him a son . But the thing that David had done ( T ) displeased [ f ] the Lord . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	12	For you did it secretly , ( J ) but I will do this thing before all Israel , before the sun. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	3	But the poor man had nothing , except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished ; and it grew up together with him and with his children . It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom ; and it was like a daughter to him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	4	And a traveler came to the rich man , who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him ; but he took the poor man ’ s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	5	So David ’ s anger was greatly aroused against the man , and he said to Nathan , “ As the Lord lives , the man who has done this [ a ] shall surely die !
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	6	And he shall restore ( C ) fourfold for the lamb , because he did this thing and because he had no pity. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	7	Then Nathan said to David , “ You are the man ! Thus says the Lord God of Israel : ‘ I ( D ) anointed you king over Israel , and I delivered you from the hand of Saul .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	8	I gave you your master ’ s house and your master ’ s wives into your keeping , and gave you the house of Israel and Judah . And if that had been too little , I also would have given you much more !
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	9	( E ) Why have you ( F ) despised the commandment of the Lord , to do evil in His sight ? ( G ) You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword ; you have taken his wife to be your wife , and have killed him with the sword of the people of Ammon .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	10	Now therefore , ( H ) the sword shall never depart from your house , because you have despised Me , and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife. ’
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	11	Thus says the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will raise up adversity against you from your own house ; and I will ( I ) take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor , and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	13	( K ) So David said to Nathan , ( L ) “ I have sinned against the Lord. ” And Nathan said to David , “ The Lord also has ( M ) put away your sin ; you shall not die .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	14	However , because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord ( N ) to blaspheme , the child also who is born to you shall surely die. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	15	Then Nathan departed to his house . The Death of David ’ s Son And the ( O ) Lord struck the child that Uriah ’ s wife bore to David , and it became ill.
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	16	David therefore pleaded with God for the child , and David fasted and went in and ( P ) lay all night on the ground .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	17	So the elders of his house arose and went to him , to raise him up from the ground . But he would not , nor did he eat food with them .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	18	Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died . And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead . For they said , “ Indeed , while the child was alive , we spoke to him , and he would not heed our voice . How can we tell him that the child is dead ? He may do some harm ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	19	When David saw that his servants were whispering , David perceived that the child was dead . Therefore David said to his servants , “ Is the child dead ? ” And they said , “ He is dead. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	20	So David arose from the ground , washed and ( Q ) anointed himself , and changed his clothes ; and he went into the house of the Lord and ( R ) worshiped . Then he went to his own house ; and when he requested , they set food before him , and he ate .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	21	Then his servants said to him , “ What is this that you have done ? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive , but when the child died , you arose and ate food. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	22	And he said , “ While the child was alive , I fasted and wept ; ( S ) for I said , ‘ Who can tell whether [ b ] the Lord will be gracious to me , that the child may live ? ’
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	23	But now he is dead ; why should I fast ? Can I bring him back again ? I shall go ( T ) to him , but ( U ) he shall not return to me. ” Solomon Is Born
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	24	Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife , and went in to her and lay with her . So ( V ) she bore a son , and ( W ) he [ c ] called his name Solomon . Now the Lord loved him ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	25	and He sent word by the hand of Nathan the prophet : So [ d ] he called his name [ e ] Jedidiah , because of the Lord . Rabbah Is Captured ( X )
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	26	Now ( Y ) Joab fought against ( Z ) Rabbah of the people of Ammon , and took the royal city .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	27	And Joab sent messengers to David , and said , “ I have fought against Rabbah , and I have taken the city ’ s water supply .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	28	Now therefore , gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it , lest I take the city and it be called after my name. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	29	So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah , fought against it , and took it .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	30	( AA ) Then he took their king ’ s crown from his head . Its weight was a talent of gold , with precious stones . And it was set on David ’ s head . Also he brought out the [ f ] spoil of the city in great abundance .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	12	31	And he brought out the people who were in it , and put them to work with saws and iron picks and iron axes , and made them cross over to the brick works . So he did to all the cities of the people of Ammon . Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	13	And I , where could I take my shame ? And as for you , you would be like one of the fools in Israel . Now therefore , please speak to the king ; ( J ) for he will not withhold me from you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	3	But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab ( D ) the son of Shimeah , David ’ s brother . Now Jonadab was a very crafty man .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	4	And he said to him , “ Why are you , the king ’ s son , becoming thinner day after day ? Will you not tell me ? ” Amnon said to him , “ I love Tamar , my brother Absalom ’ s sister. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	5	So Jonadab said to him , “ Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you , say to him , ‘ Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food , and prepare the food in my sight , that I may see it and eat it from her hand. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	6	Then Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill ; and when the king came to see him , Amnon said to the king , “ Please let Tamar my sister come and ( E ) make a couple of cakes for me in my sight , that I may eat from her hand. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	7	And David sent home to Tamar , saying , “ Now go to your brother Amnon ’ s house , and prepare food for him. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon ’ s house ; and he was lying down . Then she took flour and kneaded it , made cakes in his sight , and baked the cakes .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	9	And she took the pan and placed them out before him , but he refused to eat . Then Amnon said , ( F ) “ Have everyone go out from me. ” And they all went out from him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	10	Then Amnon said to Tamar , “ Bring the food into the bedroom , that I may eat from your hand. ” And Tamar took the cakes which she had made , and brought them to Amnon her brother in the bedroom .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	11	Now when she had brought them to him to eat , ( G ) he took hold of her and said to her , “ Come , lie with me , my sister. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	12	But she answered him , “ No , my brother , do not [ a ] force me , for ( H ) no such thing should be done in Israel . Do not do this ( I ) disgraceful thing !
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	14	However , he would not heed her voice ; and being stronger than she , he ( K ) forced her and lay with her .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	15	Then Amnon hated her [ b ] exceedingly , so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her . And Amnon said to her , “ Arise , be gone ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	16	So she said to him , “ No , indeed ! This evil of sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me. ” But he would not listen to her .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	17	Then he called his servant who attended him , and said , “ Here ! Put this woman out , away from me , and bolt the door behind her. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	18	Now she had on ( L ) a robe of many colors , for the king ’ s virgin daughters wore such apparel . And his servant put her out and bolted the door behind her .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	19	Then Tamar put ( M ) ashes on her head , and tore her robe of many colors that was on her , and ( N ) laid her hand on her head and went away crying bitterly .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	20	And Absalom her brother said to her , “ Has Amnon your brother been with you ? But now hold your peace , my sister . He is your brother ; do not take this thing to heart. ” So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom ’ s house .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	21	But when King David heard of all these things , he was very angry .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	22	And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon ( O ) neither good nor bad . For Absalom ( P ) hated Amnon , because he had forced his sister Tamar . Absalom Murders Amnon
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	23	And it came to pass , after two full years , that Absalom ( Q ) had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor , which is near Ephraim ; so Absalom invited all the king ’ s sons .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	24	Then Absalom came to the king and said , “ Kindly note , your servant has sheepshearers ; please , let the king and his servants go with your servant. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	25	But the king said to Absalom , “ No , my son , let us not all go now , lest we be a burden to you. ” Then he urged him , but he would not go ; and he blessed him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	26	Then Absalom said , “ If not , please let my brother Amnon go with us. ” And the king said to him , “ Why should he go with you ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	27	But Absalom urged him ; so he let Amnon and all the king ’ s sons go with him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	28	Now Absalom had commanded his servants , saying , “ Watch now , when Amnon ’ s ( R ) heart is merry with wine , and when I say to you , ‘ Strike Amnon ! ’ then kill him . Do not be afraid . Have I not commanded you ? Be courageous and [ c ] valiant. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	29	So the servants of Absalom ( S ) did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded . Then all the king ’ s sons arose , and each one got on ( T ) his mule and fled .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	30	And it came to pass , while they were on the way , that news came to David , saying , “ Absalom has killed all the king ’ s sons , and not one of them is left ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	31	So the king arose and ( U ) tore his garments and ( V ) lay on the ground , and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	32	Then ( W ) Jonadab the son of Shimeah , David ’ s brother , answered and said , “ Let not my lord suppose they have killed all the young men , the king ’ s sons , for only Amnon is dead . For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	33	Now therefore , ( X ) let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king ’ s sons are dead . For only Amnon is dead. ” Absalom Flees to Geshur
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	34	( Y ) Then Absalom fled . And the young man who was keeping watch lifted his eyes and looked , and there , many people were coming from the road on the hillside behind [ d ] him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	35	And Jonadab said to the king , “ Look , the king ’ s sons are coming ; as your servant said , so it is. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	36	So it was , as soon as he had finished speaking , that the king ’ s sons indeed came , and they lifted up their voice and wept . Also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	37	But Absalom fled and went to ( Z ) Talmai the son of Ammihud , king of Geshur . And David mourned for his son every day .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	38	So Absalom fled and went to ( AA ) Geshur , and was there three years .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	13	39	And [ e ] King David [ f ] longed to go to Absalom . For he had been ( AB ) comforted concerning Amnon , because he was dead . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	6	Now your maidservant had two sons ; and the two fought with each other in the field , and there was no one to part them , but the one struck the other and killed him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	7	And now the whole family has risen up against your maidservant , and they said , ‘ Deliver him who struck his brother , that we may execute him ( H ) for the life of his brother whom he killed ; and we will destroy the heir also. ’ So they would extinguish my ember that is left , and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the earth. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	8	Then the king said to the woman , “ Go to your house , and I will give orders concerning you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	9	And the woman of Tekoa said to the king , “ My lord , O king , let ( I ) the [ b ] iniquity be on me and on my father ’ s house , ( J ) and the king and his throne be guiltless. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	10	So the king said , “ Whoever says anything to you , bring him to me , and he shall not touch you anymore. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	11	Then she said , “ Please let the king remember the Lord your God , and do not permit ( K ) the avenger of blood to destroy anymore , lest they destroy my son. ” And he said , ( L ) “ As the Lord lives , not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	12	Therefore the woman said , “ Please , let your maidservant speak another word to my lord the king. ” And he said , “ Say on. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	13	So the woman said : “ Why then have you schemed such a thing against ( M ) the people of God ? For the king speaks this thing as one who is guilty , in that the king does not bring ( N ) his banished one home again .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	15	Now therefore , I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid . And your maidservant said , ‘ I will now speak to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his maidservant .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	16	For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the ( R ) inheritance of God. ’
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	17	Your maidservant said , ‘ The word of my lord the king will now be comforting ; for ( S ) as the angel of God , so is my lord the king in ( T ) discerning good and evil . And may the Lord your God be with you. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	18	Then the king answered and said to the woman , “ Please do not hide from me anything that I ask you. ” And the woman said , “ Please , let my lord the king speak. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	19	So the king said , “ Is the hand of Joab with you in all this ? ” And the woman answered and said , “ As you live , my lord the king , no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken . For your servant Joab commanded me , and ( U ) he put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	20	To bring about this change of affairs your servant Joab has done this thing ; but my lord is wise , ( V ) according to the wisdom of the angel of God , to know everything that is in the earth. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	21	And the king said to Joab , “ All right , I have granted this thing . Go therefore , bring back the young man Absalom. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	22	Then Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself , and [ d ] thanked the king . And Joab said , “ Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight , my lord , O king , in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	23	So Joab arose ( W ) and went to Geshur , and brought Absalom to Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	24	And the king said , “ Let him return to his own house , but ( X ) do not let him see my face. ” So Absalom returned to his own house , but did not see the king ’ s face . David Forgives Absalom
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	25	Now in all Israel there was no one who was praised as much as Absalom for his good looks . ( Y ) From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	26	And when he cut the hair of his head—at the end of every year he cut it because it was heavy on him—when he cut it , he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels according to the king ’ s standard .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	27	( Z ) To Absalom were born three sons , and one daughter whose name was Tamar . She was a woman of beautiful appearance .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	28	And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem , ( AA ) but did not see the king ’ s face .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	29	Therefore Absalom sent for Joab , to send him to the king , but he would not come to him . And when he sent again the second time , he would not come .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	30	So he said to his servants , “ See , Joab ’ s field is near mine , and he has barley there ; go and set it on fire. ” And Absalom ’ s servants set the field on fire .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	31	Then Joab arose and came to Absalom ’ s house , and said to him , “ Why have your servants set my field on fire ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	32	And Absalom answered Joab , “ Look , I sent to you , saying , ‘ Come here , so that I may send you to the king , to say , “ Why have I come from Geshur ? It would be better for me to be there still. ” ’ Now therefore , let me see the king ’ s face ; but ( AB ) if there is iniquity in me , let him execute me. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	14	33	So Joab went to the king and told him . And when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king . Then the king ( AC ) kissed Absalom . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	15	And the king ’ s servants said to the king , “ We are your servants , ready to do whatever my lord the king commands. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	3	Then Absalom would say to him , “ Look , your [ b ] case is good and right ; but there is no [ c ] deputy of the king to hear you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	4	Moreover Absalom would say , ( D ) “ Oh , that I were made judge in the land , and everyone who has any suit or cause would come to me ; then I would give him justice. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	5	And so it was , whenever anyone came near to bow down to him , that he would put out his hand and take him and ( E ) kiss him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	6	In this manner Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment . ( F ) So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	7	Now it came to pass ( G ) after [ d ] forty years that Absalom said to the king , “ Please , let me go to ( H ) Hebron and pay the vow which I made to the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	8	( I ) For your servant ( J ) took a vow ( K ) while I dwelt at Geshur in Syria , saying , ‘ If the Lord indeed brings me back to Jerusalem , then I will serve the Lord. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	9	And the king said to him , “ Go in peace. ” So he arose and went to Hebron .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	10	Then Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , “ As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet , then you shall say , ‘ Absalom ( L ) reigns in Hebron ! ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	11	And with Absalom went two hundred men ( M ) invited from Jerusalem , and they ( N ) went along innocently and did not know anything .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	12	Then Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , ( O ) David ’ s counselor , from his city—from ( P ) Giloh—while he offered sacrifices . And the conspiracy grew strong , for the people with Absalom ( Q ) continually increased in number . David Escapes from Jerusalem
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	13	Now a messenger came to David , saying , ( R ) “ The hearts of the men of Israel are [ e ] with Absalom. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	14	So David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem , “ Arise , and let us ( S ) flee , or we shall not escape from Absalom . Make haste to depart , lest he overtake us suddenly and bring disaster upon us , and strike the city with the edge of the sword. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	16	Then ( T ) the king went out with all his household after him . But the king left ( U ) ten women , concubines , to keep the house .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	17	And the king went out with all the people after him , and stopped at the outskirts .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	18	Then all his servants passed [ f ] before him ; ( V ) and all the Cherethites , all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , ( W ) six hundred men who had followed him from Gath , passed before the king .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	19	Then the king said to ( X ) Ittai the Gittite , “ Why are you also going with us ? Return and remain with the king . For you are a foreigner and also an exile from your own place .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	20	In fact , you came only yesterday . Should I make you wander up and down with us today , since I go ( Y ) I know not where ? Return , and take your brethren back . Mercy and truth be with you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	21	But Ittai answered the king and said , ( Z ) “ As the Lord lives , and as my lord the king lives , surely in whatever place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , even there also your servant will be. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	22	So David said to Ittai , “ Go , and cross over. ” Then Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones who were with him crossed over .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	23	And all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people crossed over . The king himself also crossed over the Brook Kidron , and all the people crossed over toward the way of the ( AA ) wilderness .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	24	There was ( AB ) Zadok also , and all the Levites with him , bearing the ( AC ) ark of the covenant of God . And they set down the ark of God , and ( AD ) Abiathar went up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	25	Then the king said to Zadok , “ Carry the ark of God back into the city . If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord , He ( AE ) will bring me back and show me both it and ( AF ) His dwelling place .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	26	But if He says thus : ‘ I have no ( AG ) delight in you , ’ here I am , ( AH ) let Him do to me as seems good to Him. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	27	The king also said to Zadok the priest , “ Are you not a ( AI ) seer ? [ g ] Return to the city in peace , and ( AJ ) your two sons with you , Ahimaaz your son , and Jonathan the son of Abiathar .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	28	See , ( AK ) I will wait in the plains of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	29	Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem . And they remained there .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	30	So David went up by the Ascent of the Mount of Olives , and wept as he went up ; and he ( AL ) had his head covered and went ( AM ) barefoot . And all the people who were with him ( AN ) covered their heads and went up , ( AO ) weeping as they went up .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	31	Then someone told David , saying , ( AP ) “ Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. ” And David said , “ O Lord , I pray , ( AQ ) turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	32	Now it happened when David had come to the top of the mountain , where he worshiped God—there was Hushai the ( AR ) Archite coming to meet him ( AS ) with his robe torn and dust on his head .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	33	David said to him , “ If you go on with me , then you will become ( AT ) a burden to me .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	34	But if you return to the city , and say to Absalom , ( AU ) ‘ I will be your servant , O king ; as I was your father ’ s servant previously , so I will now also be your servant , ’ then you may defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	35	And do you not have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there ? Therefore it will be that whatever you hear from the king ’ s house , you shall tell to ( AV ) Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	36	Indeed they have there ( AW ) with them their two sons , Ahimaaz , Zadok ’ s son , and Jonathan , Abiathar ’ s son ; and by them you shall send me everything you hear. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	15	37	So Hushai , ( AX ) David ’ s friend , went into the city . ( AY ) And Absalom came into Jerusalem . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	16	And so it was , when Hushai the Archite , ( U ) David ’ s friend , came to Absalom , that ( V ) Hushai said to Absalom , “ Long live the king ! Long live the king ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	3	Then the king said , “ And where is your ( D ) master ’ s son ? ” ( E ) And Ziba said to the king , “ Indeed he is staying in Jerusalem , for he said , ‘ Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	4	So the king said to Ziba , “ Here , all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours. ” And Ziba said , “ I humbly bow before you , that I may find favor in your sight , my lord , O king ! ” Shimei Curses David
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	5	Now when King David came to ( F ) Bahurim , there was a man from the family of the house of Saul , whose name was ( G ) Shimei the son of Gera , coming from there . He came out , cursing continuously as he came .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	6	And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David . And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	7	Also Shimei said thus when he cursed : “ Come out ! Come out ! You [ a ] bloodthirsty man , ( H ) you [ b ] rogue !
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	8	The Lord has ( I ) brought upon you all ( J ) the blood of the house of Saul , in whose place you have reigned ; and the Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son . So now you are caught in your own evil , because you are a [ c ] bloodthirsty man ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	9	Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king , “ Why should this ( K ) dead dog ( L ) curse my lord the king ? Please , let me go over and take off his head ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	10	But the king said , ( M ) “ What have I to do with you , you sons of Zeruiah ? So let him curse , because ( N ) the Lord has said to him , ‘ Curse David. ’ ( O ) Who then shall say , ‘ Why have you done so ? ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	11	And David said to Abishai and all his servants , “ See how ( P ) my son who ( Q ) came from my own body seeks my life . How much more now may this Benjamite ? Let him alone , and let him curse ; for so the Lord has ordered him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	12	It may be that the Lord will look on [ d ] my affliction , and that the Lord will ( R ) repay me with ( S ) good for his cursing this day. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	13	And as David and his men went along the road , Shimei went along the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went , threw stones at him and [ e ] kicked up dust .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	14	Now the king and all the people who were with him became weary ; so they refreshed themselves there . The Advice of Ahithophel
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	15	Meanwhile ( T ) Absalom and all the people , the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem ; and Ahithophel was with him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	17	So Absalom said to Hushai , “ Is this your loyalty to your friend ? ( W ) Why did you not go with your friend ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	18	And Hushai said to Absalom , “ No , but whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel choose , his I will be , and with him I will remain .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	19	Furthermore , ( X ) whom should I serve ? Should I not serve in the presence of his son ? As I have served in your father ’ s presence , so will I be in your presence. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	20	Then Absalom said to ( Y ) Ahithophel , “ Give advice as to what we should do. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	21	And Ahithophel said to Absalom , “ Go in to your father ’ s ( Z ) concubines , whom he has left to keep the house ; and all Israel will hear that you ( AA ) are abhorred by your father . Then ( AB ) the hands of all who are with you will be strong. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the top of the house , and Absalom went in to his father ’ s concubines ( AC ) in the sight of all Israel .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	16	23	Now the advice of Ahithophel , which he gave in those days , was as if one had inquired at the oracle of God . So was all the advice of Ahithophel ( AD ) both with David and with Absalom . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	17	( M ) Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz ( N ) stayed at ( O ) En Rogel , for they dared not be seen coming into the city ; so a female servant would come and tell them , and they would go and tell King David .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	3	Then I will bring back all the people to you . When all return except the man whom you seek , all the people will be at peace. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	4	And the saying pleased Absalom and all the ( C ) elders of Israel . The Advice of Hushai
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	5	Then Absalom said , “ Now call Hushai the Archite also , and let us hear what he ( D ) says too. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	6	And when Hushai came to Absalom , Absalom spoke to him , saying , “ Ahithophel has spoken in this manner . Shall we do as he says ? If not , speak up. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	7	So Hushai said to Absalom : “ The advice that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	8	For , ” said Hushai , “ you know your father and his men , that they are mighty men , and they are enraged in their minds , like ( E ) a bear robbed of her cubs in the field ; and your father is a man of war , and will not camp with the people .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	9	Surely by now he is hidden in some pit , or in some other place . And it will be , when some of them are overthrown at the first , that whoever hears it will say , ‘ There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom. ’
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	10	And even he who is valiant , whose heart is like the heart of a lion , will ( F ) melt completely . For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man , and those who are with him are valiant men .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	11	Therefore I advise that all Israel be fully gathered to you , ( G ) from Dan to Beersheba , ( H ) like the sand that is by the sea for multitude , and that you go to battle in person .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	12	So we will come upon him in some place where he may be found , and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground . And of him and all the men who are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	13	Moreover , if he has withdrawn into a city , then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city ; and we will ( I ) pull it into the river , until there is not one small stone found there. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	14	So Absalom and all the men of Israel said , “ The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than the advice of Ahithophel. ” For ( J ) the Lord had purposed to defeat the good advice of Ahithophel , to the intent that the Lord might bring disaster on Absalom . Hushai Warns David to Escape
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	15	( K ) Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests , “ Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel , and thus and so I have advised .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	16	Now therefore , send quickly and tell David , saying , ‘ Do not spend this night ( L ) in the plains of the wilderness , but speedily cross over , lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	18	Nevertheless a lad saw them , and told Absalom . But both of them went away quickly and came to a man ’ s house ( P ) in Bahurim , who had a well in his court ; and they went down into it .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	19	( Q ) Then the woman took and spread a covering over the well ’ s mouth , and spread ground grain on it ; and the thing was not known .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	20	And when Absalom ’ s servants came to the woman at the house , they said , “ Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? ” So ( R ) the woman said to them , “ They have gone over the water brook. ” And when they had searched and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	21	Now it came to pass , after they had departed , that they came up out of the well and went and told King David , and said to David , ( S ) “ Arise and cross over the water quickly . For thus has Ahithophel advised against you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	22	So David and all the people who were with him arose and crossed over the Jordan . By morning light not one of them was left who had not gone over the Jordan .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	23	Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed , he saddled a donkey , and arose and went home to ( T ) his house , to his city . Then he [ b ] put his ( U ) household in order , and ( V ) hanged himself , and died ; and he was buried in his father ’ s tomb .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	24	Then David went to ( W ) Mahanaim . And Absalom crossed over the Jordan , he and all the men of Israel with him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	25	And Absalom made ( X ) Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab . This Amasa was the son of a man whose name was [ c ] Jithra , an [ d ] Israelite , who had gone in to ( Y ) Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister of Zeruiah , Joab ’ s mother .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	26	So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	27	Now it happened , when David had come to Mahanaim , that ( Z ) Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the people of Ammon , ( AA ) Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar , and ( AB ) Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	28	brought beds and basins , earthen vessels and wheat , barley and flour , parched grain and beans , lentils and parched seeds ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	17	29	honey and curds , sheep and cheese of the herd , for David and the people who were with him to eat . For they said , “ The people are hungry and weary and thirsty ( AC ) in the wilderness. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up a [ c ] pillar for himself , which is in ( K ) the King ’ s Valley . For he said , ( L ) “ I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. ” He called the pillar after his own name . And to this day it is called Absalom ’ s Monument . David Hears of Absalom ’ s Death
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	3	( D ) But the people answered , “ You shall not go out ! For if we flee away , they will not care about us ; nor if half of us die , will they care about us . But you are worth ten thousand of us now . For you are now more help to us in the city. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	4	Then the king said to them , “ Whatever seems best to you I will do. ” So the king stood beside the gate , and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	5	Now the king had commanded Joab , Abishai , and Ittai , saying , “ Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom. ” ( E ) And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains orders concerning Absalom .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	6	So the people went out into the field of battle against Israel . And the battle was in the ( F ) woods of Ephraim .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	7	The people of Israel were overthrown there before the servants of David , and a great slaughter of twenty thousand took place there that day .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	8	For the battle there was scattered over the face of the whole countryside , and the woods devoured more people that day than the sword devoured .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	9	Then Absalom met the servants of David . Absalom rode on a mule . The mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth tree , and ( G ) his head caught in the terebinth ; so he was left hanging between heaven and earth . And the mule which was under him went on .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	10	Now a certain man saw it and told Joab , and said , “ I just saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth tree ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	11	So Joab said to the man who told him , “ You just saw him ! And why did you not strike him there to the ground ? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a belt. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	12	But the man said to Joab , “ Though I were to receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand , I would not raise my hand against the king ’ s son . ( H ) For in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai , saying , [ b ] ‘ Beware lest anyone touch the young man Absalom ! ’
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	13	Otherwise I would have dealt falsely against my own life . For there is nothing hidden from the king , and you yourself would have set yourself against me. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	14	Then Joab said , “ I can not linger with you. ” And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through Absalom ’ s heart , while he was still alive in the midst of the terebinth tree .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	15	And ten young men who bore Joab ’ s armor surrounded Absalom , and struck and killed him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	16	So Joab blew the trumpet , and the people returned from pursuing Israel . For Joab held back the people .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	17	And they took Absalom and cast him into a large pit in the woods , and ( I ) laid a very large heap of stones over him . Then all Israel ( J ) fled , everyone to his tent .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	19	Then ( M ) Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said , “ Let me run now and take the news to the king , how the Lord has [ d ] avenged him of his enemies. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	20	And Joab said to him , “ You shall not take the news this day , for you shall take the news another day . But today you shall take no news , because the king ’ s son is dead. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	21	Then Joab said to the Cushite , “ Go , tell the king what you have seen. ” So the Cushite bowed himself to Joab and ran .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	22	And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab , “ But [ e ] whatever happens , please let me also run after the Cushite. ” So Joab said , “ Why will you run , my son , since you have no news ready ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	23	“ But whatever happens , ” he said , “ let me run. ” So he said to him , “ Run. ” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain , and outran the Cushite .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	24	Now David was sitting between the ( N ) two gates . And the watchman went up to the roof over the gate , to the wall , lifted his eyes and looked , and there was a man , running alone .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	25	Then the watchman cried out and told the king . And the king said , “ If he is alone , there is news in his mouth. ” And he came rapidly and drew near .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	26	Then the watchman saw another man running , and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said , “ There is another man , running alone ! ” And the king said , “ He also brings news. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	27	So the watchman said , [ f ] “ I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. ” And the king said , “ He is a good man , and comes with ( O ) good news. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	28	So Ahimaaz called out and said to the king , [ g ] “ All is well ! ” Then he bowed down with his face to the earth before the king , and said , ( P ) “ Blessed be the Lord your God , who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	29	The king said , “ Is the young man Absalom safe ? ” Ahimaaz answered , “ When Joab sent the king ’ s servant and me your servant , I saw a great tumult , but I did not know what it was about. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	30	And the king said , “ Turn aside and stand here. ” So he turned aside and stood still .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	31	Just then the Cushite came , and the Cushite said , “ There is good news , my lord the king ! For the Lord has avenged you this day of all those who rose against you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	32	And the king said to the Cushite , “ Is the young man Absalom safe ? ” So the Cushite answered , “ May the enemies of my lord the king , and all who rise against you to do harm , be like that young man ! ” David ’ s Mourning for Absalom
NKJV	2%20Samuel	18	33	Then the king was deeply moved , and went up to the chamber over the gate , and wept . And as he went , he said thus : ( Q ) “ O my son Absalom—my son , my son Absalom—if only I had died in your place ! O Absalom my son , ( R ) my son ! ” Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	19	Then he said to the king , ( V ) “ Do not let my lord [ e ] impute iniquity to me , or remember what ( W ) wrong your servant did on the day that my lord the king left Jerusalem , that the king should ( X ) take it to heart .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	3	And the people [ a ] stole back ( C ) into the city that day , as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	4	But the king ( D ) covered his face , and the king cried out with a loud voice , ( E ) “ O my son Absalom ! O Absalom , my son , my son ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	5	Then ( F ) Joab came into the house to the king , and said , “ Today you have disgraced all your servants who today have saved your life , the lives of your sons and daughters , the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	6	in that you love your enemies and hate your friends . For you have declared today that you [ b ] regard neither princes nor servants ; for today I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died today , then it would have pleased you well .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	7	Now therefore , arise , go out and speak [ c ] comfort to your servants . For I swear by the Lord , if you do not go out , not one will stay with you this night . And that will be worse for you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth until now. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	8	Then the king arose and sat in the ( G ) gate . And they told all the people , saying , “ There is the king , sitting in the gate. ” So all the people came before the king . For everyone of Israel had ( H ) fled to his tent . David Returns to Jerusalem
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	9	Now all the people were in a dispute throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , “ The king saved us from the hand of our ( I ) enemies , he delivered us from the hand of the ( J ) Philistines , and now he has ( K ) fled from the land because of Absalom .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	10	But Absalom , whom we anointed over us , has died in battle . Now therefore , why do you say nothing about bringing back the king ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	11	So King David sent to ( L ) Zadok and Abiathar the priests , saying , “ Speak to the elders of Judah , saying , ‘ Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house , since the words of all Israel have come to the king , to his very house ?
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	12	You are my brethren , you are ( M ) my bone and my flesh . Why then are you the last to bring back the king ? ’
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	13	( N ) And say to Amasa , ‘ Are you not my bone and my flesh ? ( O ) God do so to me , and more also , if you are not commander of the army before me [ d ] continually in place of Joab. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	14	So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah , ( P ) just as the heart of one man , so that they sent this word to the king : “ Return , you and all your servants ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	15	Then the king returned and came to the Jordan . And Judah came to ( Q ) Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to escort the king ( R ) across the Jordan .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	16	And ( S ) Shimei the son of Gera , a Benjamite , who was from Bahurim , hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	17	There were a thousand men of ( T ) Benjamin with him , and ( U ) Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over the Jordan before the king .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	18	Then a ferryboat went across to carry over the king ’ s household , and to do what he thought good . David ’ s Mercy to Shimei Now Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he had crossed the Jordan .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	20	For I , your servant , know that I have sinned . Therefore here I am , the first to come today of all ( Y ) the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	21	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said , “ Shall not Shimei be put to death for this , ( Z ) because he ( AA ) cursed the Lord ’ s anointed ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	22	And David said , ( AB ) “ What have I to do with you , you sons of Zeruiah , that you should be adversaries to me today ? ( AC ) Shall any man be put to death today in Israel ? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	23	Therefore ( AD ) the king said to Shimei , “ You shall not die. ” And the king swore to him . David and Mephibosheth Meet
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	24	Now ( AE ) Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king . And he had not cared for his feet , nor trimmed his mustache , nor washed his clothes , from the day the king departed until the day he returned in peace .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	25	So it was , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , ( AF ) “ Why did you not go with me , Mephibosheth ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	26	And he answered , “ My lord , O king , my servant deceived me . For your servant said , ‘ I will saddle a donkey for myself , that I may ride on it and go to the king , ’ because your servant is lame .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	27	And ( AG ) he has slandered your servant to my lord the king , ( AH ) but my lord the king is like the angel of God . Therefore do what is good in your eyes .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	28	For all my father ’ s house were but dead men before my lord the king . ( AI ) Yet you set your servant among those who eat at your own table . Therefore what right have I still to [ f ] cry out anymore to the king ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	29	So the king said to him , “ Why do you speak anymore of your matters ? I have said , ‘ You and Ziba divide the land. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	30	Then Mephibosheth said to the king , “ Rather , let him take it all , inasmuch as my lord the king has come back in peace to his own house. ” David ’ s Kindness to Barzillai
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	31	And ( AJ ) Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and went across the Jordan with the king , to escort him across the Jordan .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	32	Now Barzillai was a very aged man , eighty years old . And ( AK ) he had provided the king with supplies while he stayed at Mahanaim , for he was a very rich man .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	33	And the king said to Barzillai , “ Come across with me , and I will provide for you while you are with me in Jerusalem. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	34	But Barzillai said to the king , “ How long have I to live , that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem ?
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	35	I am today ( AL ) eighty years old . Can I discern between the good and bad ? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink ? Can I hear any longer the voice of singing men and singing women ? Why then should your servant be a further burden to my lord the king ?
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	36	Your servant will go a little way across the Jordan with the king . And why should the king repay me with such a reward ?
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	37	Please let your servant turn back again , that I may die in my own city , near the grave of my father and mother . But here is your servant ( AM ) Chimham ; let him cross over with my lord the king , and do for him what seems good to you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	38	And the king answered , “ Chimham shall cross over with me , and I will do for him what seems good to you . Now whatever you request of me , I will do for you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	39	Then all the people went over the Jordan . And when the king had crossed over , the king ( AN ) kissed Barzillai and blessed him , and he returned to his own place . The Quarrel About the King
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	40	Now the king went on to Gilgal , and [ g ] Chimham went on with him . And all the people of Judah escorted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	41	Just then all the men of Israel came to the king , and said to the king , “ Why have our brethren , the men of Judah , stolen you away and ( AO ) brought the king , his household , and all David ’ s men with him across the Jordan ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	42	So all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel , “ Because the king is ( AP ) a close relative of ours . Why then are you angry over this matter ? Have we ever eaten at the king ’ s expense ? Or has he given us any gift ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	19	43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah , and said , “ We have ( AQ ) ten shares in the king ; therefore we also have more right to David than you . Why then do you despise us—were we not the first to advise bringing back our king ? ” Yet ( AR ) the words of the men of Judah were [ h ] fiercer than the words of the men of Israel . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	20	And Joab answered and said , “ Far be it , far be it from me , that I should swallow up or destroy !
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	3	Now David came to his house at Jerusalem . And the king took the ten women , ( D ) his concubines whom he had left to keep the house , and put them in seclusion and supported them , but did not go in to them . So they were shut up to the day of their death , living in widowhood .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	4	And the king said to Amasa , ( E ) “ Assemble the men of Judah for me within three days , and be present here yourself. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	5	So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah . But he delayed longer than the set time which David had appointed him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	6	And David said to ( F ) Abishai , “ Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom . Take ( G ) your lord ’ s servants and pursue him , lest he find for himself fortified cities , and escape us. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	7	So Joab ’ s men , with the ( H ) Cherethites , the Pelethites , and ( I ) all the mighty men , went out after him . And they went out of Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	8	When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon , Amasa came before them . Now Joab was dressed in battle armor ; on it was a belt with a sword fastened in its sheath at his hips ; and as he was going forward , it fell out .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	9	Then Joab said to Amasa , “ Are you in health , my brother ? ” ( J ) And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	10	But Amasa did not notice the sword that was in Joab ’ s hand . And ( K ) he struck him with it ( L ) in the stomach , and his entrails poured out on the ground ; and he did not strike him again . Thus he died . Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	11	Meanwhile one of Joab ’ s men stood near Amasa , and said , “ Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David—follow Joab ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	12	But Amasa wallowed in his blood in the middle of the highway . And when the man saw that all the people stood still , he moved Amasa from the highway to the field and threw a garment over him , when he saw that everyone who came upon him halted .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	13	When he was removed from the highway , all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	14	And he went through all the tribes of Israel to ( M ) Abel and Beth Maachah and all the Berites . So they were gathered together and also went after [ b ] Sheba .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	15	Then they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah ; and they ( N ) cast up a siege mound against the city , and it stood by the rampart . And all the people who were with Joab battered the wall to throw it down .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	16	Then a wise woman cried out from the city , “ Hear , hear ! Please say to Joab , ‘ Come nearby , that I may speak with you. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	17	When he had come near to her , the woman said , “ Are you Joab ? ” He answered , “ I am. ” Then she said to him , “ Hear the words of your maidservant. ” And he answered , “ I am listening. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	18	So she spoke , saying , “ They used to talk in former times , saying , ‘ They shall surely seek guidance at Abel , ’ and so they would end disputes .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	19	I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel . You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel . Why would you swallow up ( O ) the inheritance of the Lord ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	21	That is not so . But a man from the mountains of Ephraim , Sheba the son of Bichri by name , has raised his hand against the king , against David . Deliver him only , and I will depart from the city. ” So the woman said to Joab , “ Watch , his head will be thrown to you over the wall. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	22	Then the woman ( P ) in her wisdom went to all the people . And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri , and threw it out to Joab . Then he blew a trumpet , and they withdrew from the city , every man to his tent . So Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem . David ’ s Government Officers
NKJV	2%20Samuel	20	23	And ( Q ) Joab was over all the army of Israel ; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ;

NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	21	So when he ( AB ) defied Israel , Jonathan the son of [ j ] Shimea , David ’ s brother , killed him .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	3	Therefore David said to the Gibeonites , “ What shall I do for you ? And with what shall I make atonement , that you may bless ( D ) the inheritance of the Lord ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	4	And the Gibeonites said to him , “ We will have no silver or gold from Saul or from his house , nor shall you kill any man in Israel for us. ” So he said , “ Whatever you say , I will do for you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	5	Then they answered the king , “ As for the man who consumed us and plotted against us , that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the territories of Israel ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	6	let seven men of his descendants be delivered ( E ) to us , and we will hang them before the Lord ( F ) in Gibeah of Saul , ( G ) whom the Lord chose. ” And the king said , “ I will give them. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	7	But the king spared ( H ) Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , because of ( I ) the Lord ’ s oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	8	So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth , the two sons of ( J ) Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bore to Saul , and the five sons of [ b ] Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she [ c ] brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite ;
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	9	and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites , and they hanged them on the hill ( K ) before the Lord . So they fell , all seven together , and were put to death in the days of harvest , in the first days , in the beginning of barley harvest .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	10	Now ( L ) Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock , ( M ) from the beginning of harvest until the late rains poured on them from heaven . And she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	11	And David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , the concubine of Saul , had done .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	12	Then David went and took the bones of Saul , and the bones of Jonathan his son , from the men of ( N ) Jabesh Gilead who had stolen them from the street of [ d ] Beth Shan , where the ( O ) Philistines had hung them up , after the Philistines had struck down Saul in Gilboa .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	13	So he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there ; and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	14	They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in ( P ) Zelah , in the tomb of Kish his father . So they performed all that the king commanded . And after that ( Q ) God heeded the prayer for the land . Philistine Giants Destroyed ( R )
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	15	When the Philistines were at war again with Israel , David and his servants with him went down and fought against the Philistines ; and David grew faint .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	16	Then Ishbi-Benob , who was one of the sons of [ e ] the ( S ) giant , the weight of whose bronze spear was three hundred shekels , who was bearing a new sword , thought he could kill David .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	17	But ( T ) Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid , and struck the Philistine and killed him . Then the men of David swore to him , saying , ( U ) “ You shall go out no more with us to battle , lest you quench the ( V ) lamp of Israel. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	18	( W ) Now it happened afterward that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob . Then ( X ) Sibbechai the Hushathite killed [ f ] Saph , who was one of the sons of [ g ] the giant .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	19	Again there was war at Gob with the Philistines , where ( Y ) Elhanan the son of [ h ] Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed ( Z ) the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver ’ s beam .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	21	20	Yet again ( AA ) there was war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot , twenty-four in number ; and he also was born to [ i ] the giant .

NKJV	2%20Samuel	22	40	For You have ( AZ ) armed me with strength for the battle ; You have [ l ] subdued under me ( BA ) those who rose against me .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	22	41	You have also [ m ] given me the ( BB ) necks of my enemies , So that I destroyed those who hated me .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	22	42	They looked , but there was none to save ; Even ( BC ) to the Lord , but He did not answer them .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	22	43	Then I beat them as fine ( BD ) as the dust of the earth ; I trod them ( BE ) like dirt in the streets , And I [ n ] spread them out .

NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	23	He was more honored than the thirty , but he did not attain to the first three . And David appointed him ( V ) over his guard .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	3	The God of Israel said , ( D ) The Rock of Israel spoke to me : ‘ He who rules over men must be just , Ruling ( E ) in the fear of God .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	4	And ( F ) he shall be like the light of the morning when the sun rises , A morning without clouds , Like the tender grass springing out of the earth , By clear shining after rain. ’

NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	7	But the man who touches them Must be [ a ] armed with iron and the shaft of a spear , And they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place. ” David ’ s Mighty Men ( H )
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	8	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had : [ b ] Josheb-Basshebeth the Tachmonite , chief among [ c ] the captains . He was called Adino the Eznite , because he had killed eight hundred men at one time .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	9	And after him was ( I ) Eleazar the son of [ d ] Dodo , the Ahohite , one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle , and the men of Israel had retreated .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	10	He arose and attacked the Philistines until his hand was ( J ) weary , and his hand stuck to the sword . The Lord brought about a great victory that day ; and the people returned after him only to ( K ) plunder .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	11	And after him was ( L ) Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite . ( M ) The Philistines had gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of lentils . So the people fled from the Philistines .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	12	But he stationed himself in the middle of the field , defended it , and killed the Philistines . So the Lord brought about a great victory .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	13	Then ( N ) three of the thirty chief men went down at harvest time and came to David at ( O ) the cave of Adullam . And the troop of Philistines encamped in ( P ) the Valley of Rephaim .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	14	David was then in ( Q ) the stronghold , and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	15	And David said with longing , “ Oh , that someone would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	16	So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines , drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate , and took it and brought it to David . Nevertheless he would not drink it , but poured it out to the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	17	And he said , “ Far be it from me , O Lord , that I should do this ! Is this not ( R ) the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives ? ” Therefore he would not drink it . These things were done by the three mighty men .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	18	Now ( S ) Abishai the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of [ e ] another three . He lifted his spear against three hundred men , killed them , and won a name among these three .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	19	Was he not the most honored of three ? Therefore he became their captain . However , he did not attain to the first three .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	20	Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man from ( T ) Kabzeel , [ f ] who had done many deeds . ( U ) He had killed two lion-like heroes of Moab . He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	23	21	And he killed an Egyptian , [ g ] a spectacular man . The Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; so he went down to him with a staff , wrested the spear out of the Egyptian ’ s hand , and killed him with his own spear .

NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	2	Samuel 24:16 Ornan ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	24	Then the king said to Araunah , “ No , but I will surely buy it from you for a price ; nor will I offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God with that which costs me nothing. ” So ( AH ) David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	3	And Joab said to the king , “ Now may the Lord your God ( F ) add to the people a hundred times more than there are , and may the eyes of my lord the king see it . But why does my lord the king desire this thing ? ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	4	Nevertheless the king ’ s word [ b ] prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the army . Therefore Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	5	And they crossed over the Jordan and camped in ( G ) Aroer , on the right side of the town which is in the midst of the ravine of Gad , and toward ( H ) Jazer .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	6	Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi ; they came to ( I ) Dan Jaan and around to ( J ) Sidon ;
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	7	and they came to the stronghold of ( K ) Tyre and to all the cities of the ( L ) Hivites and the Canaanites . Then they went out to South Judah as far as Beersheba .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	8	So when they had gone through all the land , they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	9	Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king . ( M ) And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword , and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men . The Judgment on David ’ s Sin ( N )
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	10	And ( O ) David ’ s heart condemned him after he had numbered the people . So ( P ) David said to the Lord , ( Q ) “ I have sinned greatly in what I have done ; but now , I pray , O Lord , take away the iniquity of Your servant , for I have ( R ) done very foolishly. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	11	Now when David arose in the morning , the word of the Lord came to the prophet ( S ) Gad , David ’ s ( T ) seer , saying ,
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	12	“ Go and tell David , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ I offer you three things ; choose one of them for yourself , that I may do it to you. ” ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	13	So Gad came to David and told him ; and he said to him , “ Shall ( U ) seven [ c ] years of famine come to you in your land ? Or shall you flee three months before your enemies , while they pursue you ? Or shall there be three days ’ plague in your land ? Now consider and see what answer I should take back to Him who sent me. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	14	And David said to Gad , “ I am in great distress . Please let us fall into the hand of the Lord , ( V ) for His mercies are great ; but ( W ) do not let me fall into the hand of man. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	15	So ( X ) the Lord sent a plague upon Israel from the morning till the appointed time . From Dan to Beersheba seventy thousand men of the people died .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	16	( Y ) And when the [ d ] angel stretched out His hand over Jerusalem to destroy it , ( Z ) the Lord relented from the destruction , and said to the angel who was destroying the people , “ It is enough ; now restrain your hand. ” And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of [ e ] Araunah the Jebusite .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	17	Then David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel who was striking the people , and said , “ Surely ( AA ) I have sinned , and I have done wickedly ; but these sheep , what have they done ? Let Your hand , I pray , be against me and against my father ’ s house. ” The Altar on the Threshing Floor ( AB )
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	18	And Gad came that day to David and said to him , ( AC ) “ Go up , erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	19	So David , according to the word of Gad , went up as the Lord commanded .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	20	Now Araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming toward him . So Araunah went out and bowed before the king with his face to the ground .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	21	Then Araunah said , “ Why has my lord the king come to his servant ? ” ( AD ) And David said , “ To buy the threshing floor from you , to build an altar to the Lord , that ( AE ) the plague may be withdrawn from the people. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	22	Now Araunah said to David , “ Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever seems good to him . ( AF ) Look , here are oxen for burnt sacrifice , and threshing implements and the yokes of the oxen for wood .
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	23	All these , O king , Araunah has given to the king. ” And Araunah said to the king , “ May the Lord your God ( AG ) accept you. ”
NKJV	2%20Samuel	24	25	And David built there an altar to the Lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . ( AI ) So the Lord heeded the prayers for the land , and ( AJ ) the plague was withdrawn from Israel . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	1	2	Therefore his servants said to him , “ Let a young woman , a virgin , be sought for our lord the king , and let her [ b ] stand before the king , and let her care for him ; and let her lie in your bosom , that our lord the king may be warm. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	3	So they sought for a lovely young woman throughout all the territory of Israel , and found ( B ) Abishag the ( C ) Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	4	The young woman was very lovely ; and she cared for the king , and served him ; but the king did not know her .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	5	Then ( D ) Adonijah the [ c ] son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , “ I will [ d ] be king ” ; and ( E ) he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	6	( And his father had not [ e ] rebuked him at any time by saying , “ Why have you done so ? ” He was also very good-looking . ( F ) His mother had borne him after Absalom . )
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	7	Then he conferred with ( G ) Joab the son of Zeruiah and with ( H ) Abiathar the priest , and ( I ) they followed and helped Adonijah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	8	But ( J ) Zadok the priest , ( K ) Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , ( L ) Nathan the prophet , ( M ) Shimei , Rei , and ( N ) the mighty men who belonged to David were not with Adonijah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	9	And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fattened cattle by the stone of [ f ] Zoheleth , which is by ( O ) En Rogel ; [ g ] he also invited all his brothers , the king ’ s sons , and all the men of Judah , the king ’ s servants .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	10	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet , Benaiah , the mighty men , or ( P ) Solomon his brother .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	11	So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon , saying , “ Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of ( Q ) Haggith has become king , and David our lord does not know it ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	12	Come , please , let me now give you advice , that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	13	Go immediately to King David and say to him , ‘ Did you not , my lord , O king , swear to your maidservant , saying , ( R ) “ Assuredly your son Solomon shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ” ? Why then has Adonijah become king ? ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	14	Then , while you are still talking there with the king , I also will come in after you and confirm your words. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	15	So Bathsheba went into the chamber to the king . ( Now the king was very old , and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king . )
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	16	And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king . Then the king said , “ What is your wish ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	17	Then she said to him , “ My lord , ( S ) you swore by the Lord your God to your maidservant , saying , ‘ Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	18	So now , look ! Adonijah has become king ; and now , my lord the king , you do not know about it .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	19	( T ) He has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance , and has invited all the sons of the king , Abiathar the priest , and Joab the commander of the army ; but Solomon your servant he has not invited .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	20	And as for you , my lord , O king , the eyes of all Israel are on you , that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	21	Otherwise it will happen , when my lord the king ( U ) rests with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	22	And just then , while she was still talking with the king , Nathan the prophet also came in .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	23	So they told the king , saying , “ Here is Nathan the prophet. ” And when he came in before the king , he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	24	And Nathan said , “ My lord , O king , have you said , ‘ Adonijah shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ’ ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	25	( V ) For he has gone down today , and has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance , and has invited all the king ’ s sons , and the commanders of the army , and Abiathar the priest ; and look ! They are eating and drinking before him ; and they say , ( W ) ‘ Long [ h ] live King Adonijah ! ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	26	But he has not invited me—me your servant—nor Zadok the priest , nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , nor your servant Solomon .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	27	Has this thing been done by my lord the king , and you have not told your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ? ” David Proclaims Solomon King ( X )
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	28	Then King David answered and said , “ Call Bathsheba to me. ” So she came into the king ’ s presence and stood before the king .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	29	And the king took an oath and said , ( Y ) “ As the Lord lives , who has redeemed my life from every distress ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	30	( Z ) just as I swore to you by the Lord God of Israel , saying , ‘ Assuredly Solomon your son shall be king after me , and he shall sit on my throne in my place , ’ so I certainly will do this day. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	31	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth , and paid homage to the king , and said , ( AA ) “ Let my lord King David live forever ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	32	And King David said , “ Call to me Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. ” So they came before the king .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	33	The king also said to them , ( AB ) “ Take with you the servants of your lord , and have Solomon my son ride on my own ( AC ) mule , and take him down to ( AD ) Gihon . [ i ]
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	34	There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet ( AE ) anoint him king over Israel ; and ( AF ) blow the horn , and say , [ j ] ‘ Long live King Solomon ! ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	35	Then you shall come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my throne , and he shall be king in my place . For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	36	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said , ( AG ) “ Amen ! May the Lord God of my lord the king say so too .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	37	( AH ) As the Lord has been with my lord the king , even so may He be with Solomon , and ( AI ) make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	38	So Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , ( AJ ) Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the ( AK ) Cherethites , and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David ’ s mule , and took him to Gihon .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	39	Then Zadok the priest took a horn of ( AL ) oil from the tabernacle and ( AM ) anointed Solomon . And they blew the horn , ( AN ) and all the people said , [ k ] “ Long live King Solomon ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	40	And all the people went up after him ; and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth seemed to split with their sound .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	41	Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished eating . And when Joab heard the sound of the horn , he said , “ Why is the city in such a noisy uproar ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	42	While he was still speaking , there came ( AO ) Jonathan , the son of Abiathar the priest . And Adonijah said to him , “ Come in , for ( AP ) you are a prominent man , and bring good news. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	43	Then Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah , “ No ! Our lord King David has made Solomon king .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	44	The king has sent with him Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the Cherethites , and the Pelethites ; and they have made him ride on the king ’ s mule .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	45	So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon ; and they have gone up from there rejoicing , so that the city is in an uproar . This is the noise that you have heard .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	46	Also Solomon ( AQ ) sits on the throne of the kingdom .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	47	And moreover the king ’ s servants have gone to bless our lord King David , saying , ( AR ) ‘ May God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and may He make his throne greater than your throne. ’ ( AS ) Then the king bowed himself on the bed .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	48	Also the king said thus , ‘ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who has ( AT ) given one to sit on my throne this day , while my eyes see ( AU ) it ! ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	49	So all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid , and arose , and each one went his way .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	50	Now Adonijah was afraid of Solomon ; so he arose , and went and ( AV ) took hold of the horns of the altar .
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	51	And it was told Solomon , saying , “ Indeed Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon ; for look , he has taken hold of the horns of the altar , saying , ‘ Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	52	Then Solomon said , “ If he proves himself a worthy man , ( AW ) not one hair of him shall fall to the earth ; but if wickedness is found in him , he shall die. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	1	53	So King Solomon sent them to bring him down from the altar . And he came and fell down before King Solomon ; and Solomon said to him , “ Go to your house. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	2	2	( B ) “ I go the way of all the earth ; ( C ) be strong , therefore , and prove yourself a man .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	3	And keep the charge of the Lord your God : to walk in His ways , to keep His statutes , His commandments , His judgments , and His testimonies , as it is written in the Law of Moses , that you may ( D ) prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	4	that the Lord may ( E ) fulfill His word which He spoke concerning me , saying , ( F ) ‘ If your sons take heed to their way , to ( G ) walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul , ’ He said , ( H ) ‘ you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	5	“ Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah ( I ) did to me , and what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel , to ( J ) Abner the son of Ner and ( K ) Amasa the son of Jether , whom he killed . And he shed the blood of war in peacetime , and put the blood of war on his belt that was around his waist , and on his sandals that were on his feet .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	6	Therefore do ( L ) according to your wisdom , and do not let his gray hair go down to the grave in peace .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	7	“ But show kindness to the sons of ( M ) Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be among those who ( N ) eat at your table , for so ( O ) they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother .

But ( Q ) he came down to meet me at the Jordan , and ( R ) I swore to him by the Lord , saying , ‘ I will not put you to death with the sword. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	9	Now therefore , ( S ) do not hold him guiltless , for you are a wise man and know what you ought to do to him ; but ( T ) bring his gray hair down to the grave with blood. ” Death of David ( U )
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	10	So ( V ) David [ b ] rested with his fathers , and was buried in ( W ) the City of David .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	11	The period that David ( X ) reigned over Israel was forty years ; seven years he reigned in Hebron , and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	12	( Y ) Then Solomon sat on the throne of his father David ; and his kingdom was ( Z ) firmly established . Solomon Executes Adonijah
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	13	Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon . So she said , ( AA ) “ Do you come peaceably ? ” And he said , “ Peaceably. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	14	Moreover he said , “ I have something to say to you. ” And she said , “ Say it. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	15	Then he said , “ You know that the kingdom was ( AB ) mine , and all Israel had set their expectations on me , that I should reign . However , the kingdom has been turned over , and has become my brother ’ s ; for ( AC ) it was his from the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	16	Now I ask one petition of you ; do not [ c ] deny me. ” And she said to him , “ Say it. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	17	Then he said , “ Please speak to King Solomon , for he will not refuse you , that he may give me ( AD ) Abishag the Shunammite as wife. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	18	So Bathsheba said , “ Very well , I will speak for you to the king. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	19	Bathsheba therefore went to King Solomon , to speak to him for Adonijah . And the king rose up to meet her and ( AE ) bowed down to her , and sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the king ’ s mother ; ( AF ) so she sat at his right hand .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	20	Then she said , “ I desire one small petition of you ; do not [ d ] refuse me. ” And the king said to her , “ Ask it , my mother , for I will not refuse you. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	21	So she said , “ Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	22	And King Solomon answered and said to his mother , “ Now why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah ? Ask for him the kingdom also—for he is my ( AG ) older brother—for him , and for ( AH ) Abiathar the priest , and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	23	Then King Solomon swore by the Lord , saying , ( AI ) “ May God do so to me , and more also , if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life !
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	24	Now therefore , as the Lord lives , who has confirmed me and set me on the throne of David my father , and who has established a [ e ] house for me , as He ( AJ ) promised , Adonijah shall be put to death today ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	25	So King Solomon sent by the hand of ( AK ) Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he struck him down , and he died . Abiathar Exiled , Joab Executed
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	26	And to Abiathar the priest the king said , “ Go to ( AL ) Anathoth , to your own fields , for [ f ] you are deserving of death ; but I will not put you to death at this time , ( AM ) because you carried the ark of the Lord God before my father David , and because you were afflicted every time my father was afflicted. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	27	So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the Lord , that he might ( AN ) fulfill the word of the Lord which He spoke concerning the house of Eli at Shiloh .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	28	Then news came to Joab , for Joab ( AO ) had defected to Adonijah , though he had not defected to Absalom . So Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord , and ( AP ) took hold of the horns of the altar .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	29	And King Solomon was told , “ Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the Lord ; there he is , by the altar. ” Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , “ Go , ( AQ ) strike him down. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	30	So Benaiah went to the tabernacle of the Lord , and said to him , “ Thus says the king , ( AR ) ‘ Come out ! ’ ” And he said , “ No , but I will die here. ” And Benaiah brought back word to the king , saying , “ Thus said Joab , and thus he answered me. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	31	Then the king said to him , ( AS ) “ Do as he has said , and strike him down and bury him , ( AT ) that you may take away from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood which Joab shed .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	32	So the Lord ( AU ) will return his [ g ] blood on his head , because he struck down two men more righteous ( AV ) and better than he , and killed them with the sword— ( AW ) Abner the son of Ner , the commander of the army of Israel , and ( AX ) Amasa the son of Jether , the commander of the army of Judah—though my father David did not know it .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	33	Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab and ( AY ) upon the head of his descendants forever . ( AZ ) But upon David and his descendants , upon his house and his throne , there shall be peace forever from the Lord. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	34	So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck and killed him ; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	35	The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army , and the king put ( BA ) Zadok the priest in the place of ( BB ) Abiathar . Shimei Executed
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	36	Then the king sent and called for ( BC ) Shimei , and said to him , “ Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there , and do not go out from there anywhere .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	37	For it shall be , on the day you go out and cross ( BD ) the Brook Kidron , know for certain you shall surely die ; ( BE ) your [ h ] blood shall be on your own head. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	38	And Shimei said to the king , “ The saying is good . As my lord the king has said , so your servant will do. ” So Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	39	Now it happened at the end of three years , that two slaves of Shimei ran away to ( BF ) Achish the son of Maachah , king of Gath . And they told Shimei , saying , “ Look , your slaves are in Gath ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	40	So Shimei arose , saddled his donkey , and went to Achish at Gath to seek his slaves . And Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	41	And Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come back .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	42	Then the king sent and called for Shimei , and said to him , “ Did I not make you swear by the Lord , and warn you , saying , ‘ Know for certain that on the day you go out and travel anywhere , you shall surely die ’ ? And you said to me , ‘ The word I have heard is good. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	43	Why then have you not kept the oath of the Lord and the commandment that I gave you ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	44	The king said moreover to Shimei , “ You know , as your heart acknowledges , ( BG ) all the wickedness that you did to my father David ; therefore the Lord will ( BH ) return your wickedness on your own head .
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	45	But King Solomon shall be blessed , and ( BI ) the throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	2	46	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he went out and struck him down , and he died . Thus the ( BJ ) kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	3	3	And Solomon ( H ) loved the Lord , ( I ) walking in the statutes of his father David , except that he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	2	( G ) Meanwhile the people sacrificed at the high places , because there was no house built for the name of the Lord until those days .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	4	Now ( J ) the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there , ( K ) for that was the great high place : Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	5	( L ) At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon ( M ) in a dream by night ; and God said , “ Ask ! What shall I give you ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	6	( N ) And Solomon said : “ You have shown great mercy to Your servant David my father , because he ( O ) walked before You in truth , in righteousness , and in uprightness of heart with You ; You have continued this great kindness for him , and You ( P ) have given him a son to sit on his throne , as it is this day .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	7	Now , O Lord my God , You have made Your servant king instead of my father David , but I am a ( Q ) little child ; I do not know how ( R ) to go out or come in .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	8	And Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You ( S ) have chosen , a great people , ( T ) too numerous to be numbered or counted .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	9	( U ) Therefore give to Your servant an [ b ] understanding heart ( V ) to judge Your people , that I may ( W ) discern between good and evil . For who is able to judge this great people of Yours ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	10	The speech pleased the Lord , that Solomon had asked this thing .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	11	Then God said to him : “ Because you have asked this thing , and have ( X ) not asked long life for yourself , nor have asked riches for yourself , nor have asked the life of your enemies , but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	12	( Y ) behold , I have done according to your words ; ( Z ) see , I have given you a wise and understanding heart , so that there has not been anyone like you before you , nor shall any like you arise after you .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	13	And I have also ( AA ) given you what you have not asked : both ( AB ) riches and honor , so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	14	So ( AC ) if you walk in My ways , to keep My statutes and My commandments , ( AD ) as your father David walked , then I will ( AE ) lengthen [ c ] your days. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	15	Then Solomon ( AF ) awoke ; and indeed it had been a dream . And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord , offered up burnt offerings , offered peace offerings , and ( AG ) made a feast for all his servants . Solomon ’ s Wise Judgment
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	16	Now two women who were harlots came to the king , and ( AH ) stood before him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	17	And one woman said , “ O my lord , this woman and I dwell in the same house ; and I gave birth while she was in the house .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	18	Then it happened , the third day after I had given birth , that this woman also gave birth . And we were together ; [ d ] no one was with us in the house , except the two of us in the house .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	19	And this woman ’ s son died in the night , because she lay on him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	20	So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from my side , while your maidservant slept , and laid him in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	21	And when I rose in the morning to nurse my son , there he was , dead . But when I had examined him in the morning , indeed , he was not my son whom I had borne. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	22	Then the other woman said , “ No ! But the living one is my son , and the dead one is your son. ” And the first woman said , “ No ! But the dead one is your son , and the living one is my son. ” Thus they spoke before the king .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	23	And the king said , “ The one says , ‘ This is my son , who lives , and your son is the dead one ’ ; and the other says , ‘ No ! But your son is the dead one , and my son is the living one. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	24	Then the king said , “ Bring me a sword. ” So they brought a sword before the king .
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	25	And the king said , “ Divide the living child in two , and give half to one , and half to the other. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	26	Then the woman whose son was living spoke to the king , for ( AI ) she yearned with compassion for her son ; and she said , “ O my lord , give her the living child , and by no means kill him ! ” But the other said , “ Let him be neither mine nor yours , but divide him. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	27	So the king answered and said , “ Give the first woman the living child , and by no means kill him ; she is his mother. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	3	28	And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered ; and they feared the king , for they saw that the ( AJ ) wisdom of God was in him to administer justice . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	4	13	[ f ] Ben-Geber , in Ramoth Gilead ; to him belonged ( H ) the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh , in Gilead ; to him also belonged ( I ) the region of Argob in Bashan—sixty large cities with walls and bronze gate-bars ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo , in Mahanaim ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	15	( J ) Ahimaaz , in Naphtali ; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife ;

NKJV	1%20Kings	4	19	Geber the son of Uri , in the land of Gilead , in ( M ) the country of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan . He was the only governor who was in the land . Prosperity and Wisdom of Solomon ’ s Reign
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	20	Judah and Israel were as numerous ( N ) as the sand by the sea in multitude , ( O ) eating and drinking and rejoicing .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	21	So ( P ) Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from ( Q ) the [ g ] River to the land of the Philistines , as far as the border of Egypt . ( R ) They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	22	( S ) Now Solomon ’ s [ h ] provision for one day was thirty [ i ] kors of fine flour , sixty kors of meal ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	23	ten fatted oxen , twenty oxen from the pastures , and one hundred sheep , besides deer , gazelles , roebucks , and fatted fowl .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	24	For he had dominion over all the region on this side of [ j ] the River from Tiphsah even to Gaza , namely over ( T ) all the kings on this side of the River ; and ( U ) he had peace on every side all around him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	25	And Judah and Israel ( V ) dwelt [ k ] safely , ( W ) each man under his vine and his fig tree , ( X ) from Dan as far as Beersheba , all the days of Solomon .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	26	( Y ) Solomon had [ l ] forty thousand stalls of ( Z ) horses for his chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	27	And ( AA ) these governors , each man in his month , provided food for King Solomon and for all who came to King Solomon ’ s table . There was no lack in their supply .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	28	They also brought barley and straw to the proper place , for the horses and steeds , each man according to his charge .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	29	And ( AB ) God gave Solomon wisdom and exceedingly great understanding , and largeness of heart like the sand on the seashore .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	30	Thus Solomon ’ s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the men ( AC ) of the East and all ( AD ) the wisdom of Egypt .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	31	For he was ( AE ) wiser than all men— ( AF ) than Ethan the Ezrahite , ( AG ) and Heman , Chalcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol ; and his fame was in all the surrounding nations .
NKJV	1%20Kings	4	32	( AH ) He spoke three thousand proverbs , and his ( AI ) songs were one thousand and five .

NKJV	1%20Kings	5	2	Then ( D ) Solomon sent to Hiram , saying :
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	3	( E ) You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the Lord his God ( F ) because of the wars which were fought against him on every side , until the Lord put [ a ] his foes under the soles of his feet .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	4	But now the Lord my God has given me ( G ) rest [ b ] on every side ; there is neither adversary nor [ c ] evil occurrence .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	6	Now therefore , command that they cut down ( J ) cedars for me from Lebanon ; and my servants will be with your servants , and I will pay you wages for your servants according to whatever you say . For you know there is none among us who has skill to cut timber like the Sidonians .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	7	So it was , when Hiram heard the words of Solomon , that he rejoiced greatly and said , Blessed be the Lord this day , for He has given David a wise son over this great people !
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	8	Then Hiram sent to Solomon , saying : I have considered the message which you sent me , and I will do all you desire concerning the cedar and cypress logs .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	9	My servants shall bring them down ( K ) from Lebanon to the sea ; I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you indicate to me , and will have them broken apart there ; then you can take them away . And you shall fulfill my desire ( L ) by giving food for my household .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	10	Then Hiram gave Solomon cedar and cypress logs according to all his desire .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	11	( M ) And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand [ e ] kors of wheat as food for his household , and [ f ] twenty kors of pressed oil . Thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	12	So the Lord gave Solomon wisdom , ( N ) as He had promised him ; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon , and the two of them made a treaty together .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	13	Then King Solomon raised up a labor force out of all Israel ; and the labor force was thirty thousand men .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	14	And he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month in shifts : they were one month in Lebanon and two months at home ; ( O ) Adoniram was in charge of the labor force .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	15	( P ) Solomon had seventy thousand who carried burdens , and eighty thousand who quarried stone in the mountains ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	16	besides three thousand [ g ] three hundred from the ( Q ) chiefs of Solomon ’ s deputies , who supervised the people who labored in the work .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	17	And the king commanded them to quarry large stones , costly stones , and ( R ) hewn stones , to lay the foundation of the [ h ] temple .
NKJV	1%20Kings	5	18	So Solomon ’ s builders , Hiram ’ s builders , and the Gebalites quarried them ; and they prepared timber and stones to build the [ i ] temple . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	6	6	The lowest chamber was five cubits wide , the middle was six cubits wide , and the third was seven cubits wide ; for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the temple , so that the support beams would not be fastened into the walls of the [ i ] temple .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	2	Now ( D ) the house which King Solomon built for the Lord , its length was sixty cubits , its width twenty , and its height thirty cubits .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	3	The vestibule in front of the [ c ] sanctuary of the house was [ d ] twenty cubits long across the width of the house , and the width of [ e ] the vestibule extended [ f ] ten cubits from the front of the house .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	4	And he made for the house ( E ) windows with beveled frames .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	5	Against the wall of the [ g ] temple he built ( F ) chambers all around , against the walls of the temple , all around the sanctuary ( G ) and the [ h ] inner sanctuary . Thus he made side chambers all around it .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	7	And ( H ) the temple , when it was being built , was built with stone finished at the quarry , so that no hammer or chisel or any iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	8	The doorway for the [ j ] middle story was on the right side of the temple . They went up by stairs to the middle story , and from the middle to the third .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	9	( I ) So he built the [ k ] temple and finished it , and he paneled the temple with beams and boards of cedar .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	10	And he built side chambers against the entire temple , each five cubits high ; they were attached to the temple with cedar beams .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	11	Then the word of the Lord came to Solomon , saying :
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	12	“ Concerning this [ l ] temple which you are building , ( J ) if you walk in My statutes , execute My judgments , keep all My commandments , and walk in them , then I will perform My [ m ] word with you , ( K ) which I spoke to your father David .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	13	And ( L ) I will dwell among the children of Israel , and will not ( M ) forsake My people Israel. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	14	So Solomon built the temple and finished it .

NKJV	1%20Kings	6	17	And in front of it the temple sanctuary was forty cubits long .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	18	The inside of the temple was cedar , carved with ornamental buds and open flowers . All was cedar ; there was no stone to be seen .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	19	And he prepared the [ n ] inner sanctuary inside the temple , to set the ark of the covenant of the Lord there .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	20	The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long , twenty cubits wide , and twenty cubits high . He overlaid it with pure gold , and overlaid the altar of cedar .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	21	So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold . He stretched gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary , and overlaid it with gold .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	22	The whole temple he overlaid with gold , until he had finished all the temple ; also he overlaid with gold ( O ) the entire altar that was by the inner sanctuary .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	23	Inside the inner sanctuary ( P ) he made two cherubim of olive wood , each ten cubits high .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	24	One wing of the cherub was five cubits , and the other wing of the cherub five cubits : ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	25	And the other cherub was ten cubits ; both cherubim were of the same size and shape .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	26	The height of one cherub was ten cubits , and so was the other cherub .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	27	Then he set the cherubim inside the inner [ o ] room ; and ( Q ) they stretched out the wings of the cherubim so that the wing of the one touched one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall . And their wings touched each other in the middle of the room .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	28	Also he overlaid the cherubim with gold .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	29	Then he carved all the walls of the temple all around , both the inner and outer sanctuaries , with carved ( R ) figures of cherubim , palm trees , and open flowers .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	30	feet -
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	31	For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood ; the lintel and doorposts were [ p ] one-fifth of the wall .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	32	The two doors were of olive wood ; and he carved on them figures of cherubim , palm trees , and open flowers , and overlaid them with gold ; and he spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	33	So for the door of the [ q ] sanctuary he also made doorposts of olive wood , [ r ] one-fourth of the wall .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	34	And the two doors were of cypress wood ; ( S ) two panels comprised one folding door , and two panels comprised the other folding door .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	35	Then he carved cherubim , palm trees , and open flowers on them , and overlaid them with gold applied evenly on the carved work .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	36	And he built the ( T ) inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams .
NKJV	1%20Kings	6	37	( U ) In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid , in the month of [ s ] Ziv .

NKJV	1%20Kings	7	9	All these were of costly stones cut to size , trimmed with saws , inside and out , from the foundation to the eaves , and also on the outside to the great court .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	10	The foundation was of costly stones , large stones , some ten cubits and some eight cubits .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	11	And above were costly stones , hewn to size , and cedar wood .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	12	The great court was enclosed with three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams . So were the ( D ) inner court of the house of the Lord ( E ) and the vestibule of the temple . Hiram the Craftsman
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	13	Now King Solomon sent and brought [ d ] Huram from Tyre .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	14	-
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	15	And he [ e ] cast ( J ) two pillars of bronze , each one eighteen cubits high , and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of each .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	16	Then he made two capitals of cast bronze , to set on the tops of the pillars . The height of one capital was five cubits , and the height of the other capital was five cubits .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	17	He made a lattice network , with wreaths of chainwork , for the capitals which were on top of the pillars : seven chains for one capital and seven for the other capital .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	18	So he made the pillars , and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals that were on top ; and thus he did for the other capital .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	19	The capitals which were on top of the pillars in the hall were in the shape of lilies , four cubits .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	20	The capitals on the two pillars also had pomegranates above , by the convex surface which was next to the network ; and there were ( K ) two hundred such pomegranates in rows on each of the capitals all around .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	21	( L ) Then he set up the pillars by the vestibule of the temple ; he set up the pillar on the right and called its name [ f ] Jachin , and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name [ g ] Boaz .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	22	The tops of the pillars were in the shape of lilies . So the work of the pillars was finished . The Sea and the Oxen
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	23	And he made ( M ) the Sea of cast bronze , ten cubits from one brim to the other ; it was completely round . Its height was five cubits , and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	24	Below its brim were ornamental buds encircling it all around , ten to a cubit , ( N ) all the way around the Sea . The ornamental buds were cast in two rows when it was cast .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	25	It stood on ( O ) twelve oxen : three looking toward the north , three looking toward the west , three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; the Sea was set upon them , and all their back parts pointed inward .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	26	It was a handbreadth thick ; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup , like a lily blossom . It contained [ h ] two thousand baths . The Carts and the Lavers
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	27	He also made ten [ i ] carts of bronze ; four cubits was the length of each cart , four cubits its width , and three cubits its height .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	28	And this was the design of the carts : They had panels , and the panels were between frames ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	29	on the panels that were between the frames were lions , oxen , and cherubim . And on the frames was a pedestal on top . Below the lions and oxen were wreaths of plaited work .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	30	Every cart had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze , and its four feet had supports . Under the laver were supports of cast bronze beside each wreath .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	31	Its opening inside the crown at the top was one cubit in diameter ; and the opening was round , shaped like a pedestal , one and a half cubits in outside diameter ; and also on the opening were engravings , but the panels were square , not round .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	32	Under the panels were the four wheels , and the axles of the wheels were joined to the cart . The height of a wheel was one and a half cubits .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	33	The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel ; their axle pins , their rims , their spokes , and their hubs were all of cast bronze .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	34	And there were four supports at the four corners of each cart ; its supports were part of the cart itself .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	35	On the top of the cart , at the height of half a cubit , it was perfectly round . And on the top of the cart , its flanges and its panels were of the same casting .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	36	On the plates of its flanges and on its panels he engraved cherubim , lions , and palm trees , wherever there was a clear space on each , with wreaths all around .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	37	Thus he made the ten carts . All of them were of [ j ] the same mold , one measure , and one shape .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	38	Then ( P ) he made ten lavers of bronze ; each laver contained [ k ] forty baths , and each laver was four cubits . On each of the ten carts was a laver .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	39	And he put five carts on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house . He set the Sea on the right side of the house , toward the southeast . Furnishings of the Temple ( Q )
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	40	( R ) Huram [ l ] made the lavers and the shovels and the bowls . So Huram finished doing all the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of the Lord :
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	41	the two pillars , the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars ; the two ( S ) networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which were on top of the pillars ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	42	( T ) four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ( two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the pillars ) ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	43	the ten carts , and ten lavers on the carts ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	44	one Sea , and twelve oxen under the Sea ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	45	( U ) the pots , the shovels , and the bowls . All these articles which [ m ] Huram made for King Solomon for the house of the Lord were of burnished bronze .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	46	( V ) In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds , between ( W ) Succoth and ( X ) Zaretan .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	47	And Solomon did not weigh all the articles , because there were so many ; the weight of the bronze was not ( Y ) determined .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	48	Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of the Lord : ( Z ) the altar of gold , and ( AA ) the table of gold on which was ( AB ) the showbread ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	49	the lampstands of pure gold , five on the right side and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary , with the flowers and the lamps and the wick-trimmers of gold ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	50	the basins , the trimmers , the bowls , the ladles , and the [ n ] censers of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the inner room ( the Most Holy Place ) and for the doors of the main hall of the temple .
NKJV	1%20Kings	7	51	So all the work that King Solomon had done for the house of the Lord was finished ; and Solomon brought in the things ( AC ) which his father David had dedicated : the silver and the gold and the furnishings . He put them in the treasuries of the house of the Lord . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	8	8	The poles ( L ) extended so that the [ c ] ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place , in front of the inner sanctuary ; but they could not be seen from outside . And they are there to this day .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	2	Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with King Solomon at the ( E ) feast in the month of [ a ] Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	3	So all the elders of Israel came , ( F ) and the priests took up the ark .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	4	Then they brought up the ark of the Lord , ( G ) the [ b ] tabernacle of meeting , and all the holy furnishings that were in the tabernacle . The priests and the Levites brought them up .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	5	Also King Solomon , and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him , were with him before the ark , ( H ) sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	6	Then the priests ( I ) brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord to ( J ) its place , into the inner sanctuary of the temple , to the Most Holy Place , ( K ) under the wings of the cherubim .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	7	For the cherubim spread their two wings over the place of the ark , and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	9	( M ) Nothing was in the ark ( N ) except the two tablets of stone which Moses ( O ) put there at Horeb , ( P ) when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	10	And it came to pass , when the priests came out of the holy place , that the cloud ( Q ) filled the house of the Lord ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	11	so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud ; for the ( R ) glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	12	( S ) Then Solomon spoke : “ The Lord said He would dwell ( T ) in the dark cloud .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	13	( U ) I have surely built You an exalted house , ( V ) And a place for You to dwell in forever. ” Solomon ’ s Speech at Completion of the Work ( W )
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	14	Then the king turned around and ( X ) blessed the whole assembly of Israel , while all the assembly of Israel was standing .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	15	And he said : ( Y ) “ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who ( Z ) spoke with His mouth to my father David , and with His hand has fulfilled it , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	16	‘ Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt , I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house , that ( AA ) My name might be there ; but I chose ( AB ) David to be over My people Israel. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	17	Now ( AC ) it was in the heart of my father David to build a [ d ] temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	18	( AD ) But the Lord said to my father David , ‘ Whereas it was in your heart to build a temple for My name , you did well that it was in your heart .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	19	Nevertheless ( AE ) you shall not build the temple , but your son who will come from your body , he shall build the temple for My name. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	20	So the Lord has fulfilled His word which He spoke ; and I have [ e ] filled the position of my father David , and sit on the throne of Israel , ( AF ) as the Lord promised ; and I have built a temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	21	And there I have made a place for the ark , in which is ( AG ) the covenant of the Lord which He made with our fathers , when He brought them out of the land of Egypt. ” Solomon ’ s Prayer of Dedication ( AH )
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	22	Then Solomon stood before ( AI ) the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and ( AJ ) spread out his hands toward heaven ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	23	and he said : “ Lord God of Israel , ( AK ) there is no God in heaven above or on earth below like You , ( AL ) who keep Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who ( AM ) walk before You with all their hearts .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	24	You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father ; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand , as it is this day .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	25	Therefore , Lord God of Israel , now keep what You promised Your servant David my father , saying , ( AN ) ‘ You shall not fail to have a man sit before Me on the throne of Israel , only if your sons take heed to their way , that they walk before Me as you have walked before Me. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	26	( AO ) And now I pray , O God of Israel , let Your word come true , which You have spoken to Your servant David my father .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	27	“ But ( AP ) will God indeed dwell on the earth ? Behold , heaven and the ( AQ ) heaven of heavens can not contain You . How much less this temple which I have built !
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	28	Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication , O Lord my God , and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You today :
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	29	that Your eyes may be open toward this [ f ] temple night and day , toward the place of which You said , ( AR ) ‘ My name shall be ( AS ) there , ’ that You may hear the prayer which Your servant makes ( AT ) toward this place .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	30	( AU ) And may You hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel , when they pray toward this place . Hear in heaven Your dwelling place ; and when You hear , forgive .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	31	“ When anyone sins against his neighbor , and is forced to take ( AV ) an oath , and comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this temple ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	32	then hear in heaven , and act , and judge Your servants , ( AW ) condemning the wicked , bringing his way on his head , and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	33	( AX ) “ When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You , and ( AY ) when they turn back to You and confess Your name , and pray and make supplication to You in this temple ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	34	then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of Your people Israel , and bring them back to the land which You gave to their ( AZ ) fathers .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	35	( BA ) “ When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You , when they pray toward this place and confess Your name , and turn from their sin because You afflict them ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	36	then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of Your servants , Your people Israel , that You may ( BB ) teach them ( BC ) the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	37	( BD ) “ When there is famine in the land , pestilence or blight or mildew , locusts or grasshoppers ; when their enemy besieges them in the land of their [ g ] cities ; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	38	whatever prayer , whatever supplication is made by anyone , or by all Your people Israel , when each one knows the plague of his own heart , and spreads out his hands toward this temple :
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	39	then hear in heaven Your dwelling place , and forgive , and act , and give to everyone according to all his ways , whose heart You know ( for You alone ( BE ) know the hearts of all the sons of men ) ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	40	( BF ) that they may fear You all the days that they live in the land which You gave to our fathers .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	41	“ Moreover , concerning a foreigner , who is not of Your people Israel , but has come from a far country for Your name ’ s sake
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	42	( for they will hear of Your great name and Your ( BG ) strong hand and Your outstretched arm ) , when he comes and prays toward this temple ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	43	hear in heaven Your dwelling place , and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You , ( BH ) that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and ( BI ) fear You , as do Your people Israel , and that they may know that this temple which I have built is called by Your name .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	44	“ When Your people go out to battle against their enemy , wherever You send them , and when they pray to the Lord toward the city which You have chosen and the temple which I have built for Your name ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	45	then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their [ h ] cause .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	46	“ When they sin against You ( BJ ) ( for there is no one who does not sin ) , and You become angry with them and deliver them to the enemy , and they take them captive ( BK ) to the land of the enemy , far or near ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	47	( BL ) yet when they [ i ] come to themselves in the land where they were carried captive , and repent , and make supplication to You in the land of those who took them captive , ( BM ) saying , ‘ We have sinned and done wrong , we have committed wickedness ’ ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	48	and when they ( BN ) return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who led them away captive , and ( BO ) pray to You toward their land which You gave to their fathers , the city which You have chosen and the temple which I have built for Your name :
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	49	then hear in heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their [ j ] cause ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	50	and forgive Your people who have sinned against You , and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You ; and ( BP ) grant them compassion before those who took them captive , that they may have compassion on them
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	51	( for ( BQ ) they are Your people and Your inheritance , whom You brought out of Egypt , ( BR ) out of the iron furnace ) ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	52	( BS ) that Your eyes may be open to the supplication of Your servant and the supplication of Your people Israel , to listen to them whenever they call to You .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	53	For You separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be Your inheritance , ( BT ) as You spoke by Your servant Moses , when You brought our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord God. ” Solomon Blesses the Assembly ( BU )
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	54	( BV ) And so it was , when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication to the Lord , that he arose from before the altar of the Lord , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	55	Then he stood ( BW ) and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice , saying :
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	56	“ Blessed be the Lord , who has given ( BX ) rest [ k ] to His people Israel , according to all that He promised . ( BY ) There has not failed one word of all His good promise , which He promised through His servant Moses .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	57	May the Lord our God be with us , as He was with our fathers . ( BZ ) May He not leave us nor forsake us ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	58	that He may ( CA ) incline our hearts to Himself , to walk in all His ways , and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments , which He commanded our fathers .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	59	And may these words of mine , with which I have made supplication before the Lord , be near the Lord our God day and night , that He may maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel , as each day may require ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	60	( CB ) that all the peoples of the earth may know that ( CC ) the Lord is God ; there is no other .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	61	Let your ( CD ) heart therefore be [ l ] loyal to the Lord our God , to walk in His statutes and keep His commandments , as at this day. ” Solomon Dedicates the Temple ( CE )
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	62	Then ( CF ) the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	63	And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered to the Lord , twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep . So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	64	On ( CG ) the same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the Lord ; for there he offered burnt offerings , grain offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings , because the ( CH ) bronze altar that was before the Lord was too small to receive the burnt offerings , the grain offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	65	At that time Solomon held ( CI ) a feast , and all Israel with him , a great assembly from ( CJ ) the entrance of Hamath to ( CK ) the Brook of Egypt , before the Lord our God , ( CL ) seven days and seven more days—fourteen days .
NKJV	1%20Kings	8	66	( CM ) On the eighth day he sent the people away ; and they [ m ] blessed the king , and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the good that the Lord had done for His servant David , and for Israel His people . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	9	9	Then they will answer , ‘ Because they forsook the Lord their God , who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt , and have embraced other gods , and worshiped them and served them ; therefore the Lord has brought all this ( S ) calamity on them. ’ ” Solomon and Hiram Exchange Gifts
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	2	Chr . 8:11 -
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	3	And the Lord said to him : ( F ) “ I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before Me ; I have consecrated this house which you have built ( G ) to put My name there forever , ( H ) and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	4	Now if you ( I ) walk before Me ( J ) as your father David walked , in integrity of heart and in uprightness , to do according to all that I have commanded you , and if you ( K ) keep My statutes and My judgments ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	5	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , ( L ) as I promised David your father , saying , ‘ You shall not fail to have a man on the throne of Israel. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	6	( M ) But if you or your sons at all [ a ] turn from following Me , and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you , but go and serve other gods and worship them ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	7	( N ) then I will [ b ] cut off Israel from the land which I have given them ; and this house which I have consecrated ( O ) for My name I will cast out of My sight . ( P ) Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	8	And as for ( Q ) this house , which is exalted , everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss , and say , ( R ) ‘ Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house ? ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	10	Now ( T ) it happened at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord and the king ’ s house
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	11	( U ) ( Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress and gold , as much as he desired ) , that King Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	12	Then Hiram went from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him , but they did not please him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	13	So he said , “ What kind of cities are these which you have given me , my brother ? ” ( V ) And he called them the land of [ c ] Cabul , as they are to this day .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	14	Then Hiram sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold . Solomon ’ s Additional Achievements ( W )
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	15	And this is the reason for ( X ) the labor force which King Solomon raised : to build the house of the Lord , his own house , [ d ] the ( Y ) Millo , the wall of Jerusalem , ( Z ) Hazor , ( AA ) Megiddo , and ( AB ) Gezer .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	16	( Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire , ( AC ) had killed the Canaanites who dwelt in the city , and had given it as a dowry to his daughter , Solomon ’ s wife . )
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	17	And Solomon built Gezer , Lower ( AD ) Beth Horon ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	18	( AE ) Baalath , and Tadmor in the wilderness , in the land of Judah ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	19	all the storage cities that Solomon had , cities for ( AF ) his chariots and cities for his ( AG ) cavalry , and whatever Solomon ( AH ) desired to build in Jerusalem , in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	20	( AI ) All the people who were left of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel—
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	21	that is , their descendants ( AJ ) who were left in the land after them , ( AK ) whom the children of Israel had not been able to destroy completely— ( AL ) from these Solomon raised ( AM ) forced labor , as it is to this day .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	22	But of the children of Israel Solomon ( AN ) made no forced laborers , because they were men of war and his servants : his officers , his captains , commanders of his chariots , and his cavalry .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	23	Others were chiefs of the officials who were over Solomon ’ s work : ( AO ) five hundred and fifty , who ruled over the people who did the work .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	24	But ( AP ) Pharaoh ’ s daughter came up from the City of David to ( AQ ) her house which [ e ] Solomon had built for her . ( AR ) Then he built the Millo .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	25	( AS ) Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for the Lord , and he burned incense with them on the altar that was before the Lord . So he finished the temple .
NKJV	1%20Kings	9	26	( AT ) King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at ( AU ) Ezion Geber , which is near [ f ] Elath on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .

NKJV	1%20Kings	10	12	( K ) And the king made [ d ] steps of the almug wood for the house of the Lord and for the king ’ s house , also harps and stringed instruments for singers . There never again came such ( L ) almug wood , nor has the like been seen to this day .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	13	Now King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired , whatever she asked , besides what Solomon had given her according to the royal generosity . So she turned and went to her own country , she and her servants . Solomon ’ s Great Wealth
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	14	The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	15	besides that from the ( M ) traveling merchants , from the income of traders , ( N ) from all the kings of Arabia , and from the governors of the country .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	16	And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold ; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	17	He also made ( O ) three hundred shields of hammered gold ; three minas of gold went into each shield . The king put them in the ( P ) House of the Forest of Lebanon .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	18	( Q ) Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory , and overlaid it with pure gold .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	19	The throne had six steps , and the top of the throne was round at the back ; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the armrests .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	20	Twelve lions stood there , one on each side of the six steps ; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	21	( R ) All King Solomon ’ s drinking vessels were gold , and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold . Not one was silver , for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	22	For the king had ( S ) merchant [ e ] ships at sea with the fleet of Hiram . Once every three years the merchant ( T ) ships came bringing gold , silver , ivory , apes , and [ f ] monkeys .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	23	So ( U ) King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	24	Now all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	25	Each man brought his present : articles of silver and gold , garments , armor , spices , horses , and mules , at a set rate year by year .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	26	( V ) And Solomon ( W ) gathered chariots and horsemen ; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen , whom he [ g ] stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	27	( X ) The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones , and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	28	( Y ) Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh ; the king ’ s merchants bought them in Keveh at the current price .
NKJV	1%20Kings	10	29	Now a chariot that was imported from Egypt cost six hundred shekels of silver , and a horse one hundred and fifty ; ( Z ) and [ h ] thus , through their agents , they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	11	11	Therefore the Lord said to Solomon , “ Because you have done this , and have not kept My covenant and My statutes , which I have commanded you , ( O ) I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your ( P ) servant .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	2	from the nations of whom the Lord had said to the children of Israel , ( C ) “ You shall not intermarry with them , nor they with you . Surely they will turn away your hearts after their gods. ” Solomon clung to these in love .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	3	And he had seven hundred wives , princesses , and three hundred concubines ; and his wives turned away his heart .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	4	For it was so , when Solomon was old , ( D ) that his wives turned his heart after other gods ; and his ( E ) heart was not [ a ] loyal to the Lord his God , ( F ) as was the heart of his father David .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	5	For Solomon went after ( G ) Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians , and after ( H ) Milcom [ b ] the abomination of the ( I ) Ammonites .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	6	Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord , and did not fully follow the Lord , as did his father David .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	7	( J ) Then Solomon built a [ c ] high place for ( K ) Chemosh the abomination of Moab , on ( L ) the hill that is east of Jerusalem , and for Molech the abomination of the people of Ammon .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	8	And he did likewise for all his foreign wives , who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	9	So the Lord became angry with Solomon , because his heart had turned from the Lord God of Israel , ( M ) who had appeared to him twice ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	10	and ( N ) had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods ; but he did not keep what the Lord had commanded .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	12	Nevertheless I will not do it in your days , for the sake of your father David ; I will tear it out of the hand of your son .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	13	( Q ) However I will not tear away the whole kingdom ; I will give ( R ) one tribe to your son ( S ) for the sake of My servant David , and for the sake of Jerusalem ( T ) which I have chosen. ” Adversaries of Solomon
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	14	Now the Lord ( U ) raised up an adversary against Solomon , Hadad the Edomite ; he was a descendant of the king in Edom .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	15	( V ) For it happened , when David was in Edom , and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain , ( W ) after he had killed every male in Edom
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	16	( because for six months Joab remained there with all Israel , until he had cut down every male in Edom ) ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	17	that Hadad fled to go to Egypt , he and certain Edomites of his father ’ s servants with him . Hadad was still a little child .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	18	Then they arose from Midian and came to Paran ; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt , to Pharaoh king of Egypt , who gave him a house , apportioned food for him , and gave him land .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	19	And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , that is , the sister of Queen Tahpenes .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	20	Then the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh ’ s house . And Genubath was in Pharaoh ’ s household among the sons of Pharaoh .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	21	( X ) So when Hadad heard in Egypt that David [ d ] rested with his fathers , and that Joab the commander of the army was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , [ e ] “ Let me depart , that I may go to my own country. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	22	Then Pharaoh said to him , “ But what have you lacked with me , that suddenly you seek to go to your own country ? ” So he answered , “ Nothing , but do let me go anyway. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	23	And God raised up another adversary against him , Rezon the son of Eliadah , who had fled from his lord , ( Y ) Hadadezer king of Zobah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	24	So he gathered men to him and became captain over a band of raiders , ( Z ) when David killed those of Zobah . And they went to Damascus and dwelt there , and reigned in Damascus .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	25	He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon ( besides the trouble that Hadad caused ) ; and he abhorred Israel , and reigned over Syria . Jeroboam ’ s Rebellion
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	26	Then Solomon ’ s servant , ( AA ) Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephraimite from Zereda , whose mother ’ s name was Zeruah , a widow , ( AB ) also ( AC ) rebelled against the king .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	27	And this is what caused him to rebel against the king : ( AD ) Solomon had built the Millo and [ f ] repaired the damages to the City of David his father .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	28	The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor ; and Solomon , seeing that the young man was ( AE ) industrious , made him the officer over all the labor force of the house of Joseph .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	29	Now it happened at that time , when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet ( AF ) Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way ; and he had clothed himself with a new garment , and the two were alone in the field .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	30	Then Ahijah took hold of the new garment that was on him , and ( AG ) tore it into twelve pieces .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	31	And he said to Jeroboam , “ Take for yourself ten pieces , for ( AH ) thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : ‘ Behold , I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	32	( but he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant David , and for the sake of Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel ) ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	33	( AI ) because [ g ] they have forsaken Me , and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians , Chemosh the god of the Moabites , and Milcom the god of the people of Ammon , and have not walked in My ways to do what is right in My eyes and keep My statutes and My judgments , as did his father David .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	34	However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand , because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David , whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My statutes .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	35	But ( AJ ) I will take the kingdom out of his son ’ s hand and give it to you—ten tribes .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	36	And to his son I will give one tribe , that ( AK ) My servant David may always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen for Myself , to put My name there .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	37	So I will take you , and you shall reign over all your heart desires , and you shall be king over Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	38	Then it shall be , if you heed all that I command you , walk in My ways , and do what is right in My sight , to keep My statutes and My commandments , as My servant David did , then ( AL ) I will be with you and ( AM ) build for you an enduring house , as I built for David , and will give Israel to you .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	39	And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this , but not forever. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	40	Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam . But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt , to ( AN ) Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon . Death of Solomon ( AO )
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	41	Now ( AP ) the rest of the acts of Solomon , all that he did , and his wisdom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	42	( AQ ) And the period that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years .
NKJV	1%20Kings	11	43	( AR ) Then Solomon [ h ] rested with his fathers , and was buried in the City of David his father . And Rehoboam his son reigned in his ( AS ) place . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	12	1	Kings 12:33 instituted Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king had directed , saying , “ Come back to me the third day. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	2	So it happened , when ( D ) Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it ( he was still in ( E ) Egypt , for he had fled from the presence of King Solomon and had been dwelling in Egypt ) ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	3	that they sent and called him . Then Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	4	“ Your father made our ( F ) yoke [ a ] heavy ; now therefore , lighten the burdensome service of your father , and his heavy yoke which he put on us , and we will serve you. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	5	So he said to them , “ Depart for three days , then come back to me. ” And the people departed .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	6	Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived , and he said , “ How do you advise me to answer these people ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	7	And they spoke to him , saying , ( G ) “ If you will be a servant to these people today , and serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	8	But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him , and consulted the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	9	And he said to them , “ What advice do you give ? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me , saying , ‘ Lighten the yoke which your father put on us ’ ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	10	Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , “ Thus you should speak to this people who have spoken to you , saying , ‘ Your father made our yoke heavy , but you make it lighter on us ’ —thus you shall say to them : ‘ My little finger shall be thicker than my father ’ s waist !
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	11	And now , whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you , I will add to your yoke ; my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with [ b ] scourges ! ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	13	Then the king answered the people [ c ] roughly , and rejected the advice which the elders had given him ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	14	and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men , saying , “ My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add to your yoke ; my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with [ d ] scourges ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	15	So the king did not listen to the people ; for ( H ) the turn of events was from the Lord , that He might fulfill His word , which the Lord had ( I ) spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	16	Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them , the people answered the king , saying : ( J ) “ What share have we in David ? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse . To your tents , O Israel ! Now , see to your own house , O David ! ” So Israel departed to their tents .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	17	But Rehoboam reigned over ( K ) the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	18	Then King Rehoboam ( L ) sent Adoram , who was in charge of the revenue ; but all Israel stoned him with stones , and he died . Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	19	So ( M ) Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	20	Now it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back , they sent for him and called him to the congregation , and made him king over all ( N ) Israel . There was none who followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah ( O ) only .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	21	And when ( P ) Rehoboam came to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Judah with the tribe of ( Q ) Benjamin , one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	22	But ( R ) the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	23	“ Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , to all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and to the rest of the people , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	24	‘ Thus says the Lord : “ You shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel . Let every man return to his house , ( S ) for this thing is from Me. ” ’ ” Therefore they obeyed the word of the Lord , and turned back , according to the word of the Lord . Jeroboam ’ s Gold Calves
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	25	Then Jeroboam ( T ) built [ e ] Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim , and dwelt there . Also he went out from there and built ( U ) Penuel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	26	And Jeroboam said in his heart , “ Now the kingdom may return to the house of David :
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	27	If these people ( V ) go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem , then the heart of this people will turn back to their lord , Rehoboam king of Judah , and they will kill me and go back to Rehoboam king of Judah. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	28	Therefore the king asked advice , ( W ) made two calves of gold , and said to the people , “ It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem . ( X ) Here are your gods , O Israel , which brought you up from the land of Egypt ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	29	And he set up one in ( Y ) Bethel , and the other he put in ( Z ) Dan .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	30	Now this thing became ( AA ) a sin , for the people went to worship before the one as far as Dan .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	31	He made [ f ] shrines on the high places , ( AB ) and made priests from every class of people , who were not of the sons of Levi .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	32	Jeroboam [ g ] ordained a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month , like ( AC ) the feast that was in Judah , and offered sacrifices on the altar . So he did at Bethel , sacrificing to the calves that he had made . ( AD ) And at Bethel he installed the priests of the high places which he had made .
NKJV	1%20Kings	12	33	So he made offerings on the altar which he had made at Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month , in the month which he had ( AE ) devised in his own heart . And he [ h ] ordained a feast for the children of Israel , and offered sacrifices on the altar and ( AF ) burned incense . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	13	13	Then he said to his sons , “ Saddle the donkey for me. ” So they saddled the donkey for him ; and he rode on it ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	2	Then he cried out against the altar [ b ] by the word of the Lord , and said , “ O altar , altar ! Thus says the Lord : ‘ Behold , a child , ( C ) Josiah by name , shall be born to the house of David ; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you , and men ’ s bones shall be ( D ) burned on you. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	3	And he gave ( E ) a sign the same day , saying , “ This is the sign which the Lord has spoken : Surely the altar shall split apart , and the ashes on it shall be poured out. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	4	So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God , who cried out against the altar in Bethel , that he stretched out his hand from the altar , saying , “ Arrest him ! ” Then his hand , which he stretched out toward him , withered , so that he could not pull it back to himself .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	5	The altar also was split apart , and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	6	Then the king answered and said to the man of God , “ Please ( F ) entreat the favor of the Lord your God , and pray for me , that my hand may be restored to me. ” So the man of God entreated the Lord , and the king ’ s hand was restored to him , and became as before .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	7	Then the king said to the man of God , “ Come home with me and refresh yourself , and ( G ) I will give you a reward. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	8	But the man of God said to the king , ( H ) “ If you were to give me half your house , I would not go in with you ; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	9	For so it was commanded me by the word of the Lord , saying , ( I ) ‘ You shall not eat bread , nor drink water , nor return by the same way you came. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	10	So he went another way and did not return by the way he came to Bethel . Death of the Man of God
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	11	Now an ( J ) old prophet dwelt in Bethel , and his [ c ] sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel ; they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	12	And their father said to them , “ Which way did he go ? ” For his sons [ d ] had seen which way the man of God went who came from Judah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	14	and went after the man of God , and found him sitting under an oak . Then he said to him , “ Are you the man of God who came from Judah ? ” And he said , “ I am. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	15	Then he said to him , “ Come home with me and eat bread. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	16	And he said , ( K ) “ I can not return with you nor go in with you ; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	17	For [ e ] I have been told ( L ) by the word of the Lord , ‘ You shall not eat bread nor drink water there , nor return by going the way you came. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	18	He said to him , “ I too am a prophet as you are , and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord , saying , ‘ Bring him back with you to your house , that he may eat bread and drink water. ’ ” ( He was lying to him . )
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	19	So he went back with him , and ate bread in his house , and drank water .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	20	Now it happened , as they sat at the table , that the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	21	and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah , saying , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Because you have disobeyed the word of the Lord , and have not kept the commandment which the Lord your God commanded you ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	22	but you came back , ate bread , and drank water in the ( M ) place of which the Lord said to you , “ Eat no bread and drink no water , ” your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	23	So it was , after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk , that he saddled the donkey for him , the prophet whom he had brought back .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	24	When he was gone , ( N ) a lion met him on the road and killed him . And his corpse was thrown on the road , and the donkey stood by it . The lion also stood by the corpse .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	25	And there , men passed by and saw the corpse thrown on the road , and the lion standing by the corpse . Then they went and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	26	Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard it , he said , “ It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the Lord . Therefore the Lord has delivered him to the lion , which has torn him and killed him , according to the word of the Lord which He spoke to him. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	27	And he spoke to his sons , saying , “ Saddle the donkey for me. ” So they saddled it .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	28	Then he went and found his corpse thrown on the road , and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse . The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	29	And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God , laid it on the donkey , and brought it back . So the old prophet came to the city to mourn , and to bury him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	30	Then he laid the corpse in his own tomb ; and they mourned over him , saying , ( O ) “ Alas , my brother ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	31	So it was , after he had buried him , that he spoke to his sons , saying , “ When I am dead , then bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried ; ( P ) lay my bones beside his bones .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	32	( Q ) For the [ f ] saying which he cried out by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel , and against all the [ g ] shrines on the high places which are in the cities of ( R ) Samaria , will surely come to pass. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	33	( S ) After this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way , but again he made priests from every class of people for the high places ; whoever wished , he consecrated him , and he became one of the priests of the high places .
NKJV	1%20Kings	13	34	( T ) And this thing was the sin of the house of Jeroboam , so as ( U ) to exterminate and destroy it from the face of the earth . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	14	3	( B ) Also take [ a ] with you ten loaves , some cakes , and a jar of honey , and go to him ; he will tell you what will become of the child. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	4	And Jeroboam ’ s wife did so ; she arose ( C ) and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . But Ahijah could not see , for his eyes were [ b ] glazed by reason of his age .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	5	Now the Lord had said to Ahijah , “ Here is the wife of Jeroboam , coming to ask you something about her son , for he is sick . Thus and thus you shall say to her ; for it will be , when she comes in , that she will pretend to be another woman. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	6	And so it was , when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door , he said , “ Come in , wife of Jeroboam . Why do you pretend to be another person ? For I have been sent to you with bad news .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	7	Go , tell Jeroboam , ‘ Thus says the Lord God of Israel : ( D ) “ Because I exalted you from among the people , and made you ruler over My people Israel ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	8	and ( E ) tore the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it to you ; and yet you have not been as My servant David , ( F ) who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart , to do only what was right in My eyes ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	9	but you have done more evil than all who were before you , ( G ) for you have gone and made for yourself other gods and molded images to provoke Me to anger , and ( H ) have cast Me behind your back—
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	10	therefore behold ! ( I ) I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam , and ( J ) will cut off from Jeroboam every male in Israel , ( K ) bond and free ; I will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam , as one takes away refuse until it is all gone .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	11	The dogs shall eat ( L ) whoever belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city , and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field ; for the Lord has spoken ! ” ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	12	Arise therefore , go to your own house . ( M ) When your feet enter the city , the child shall die .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	13	And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him , for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall [ c ] come to the grave , because in him ( N ) there is found something good toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	15	For the Lord will strike Israel , as a reed is shaken in the water . He will ( P ) uproot Israel from this ( Q ) good land which He gave to their fathers , and will scatter them ( R ) beyond [ e ] the River , ( S ) because they have made their [ f ] wooden images , provoking the Lord to anger .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	16	And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , ( T ) who sinned and who made Israel sin. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	17	Then Jeroboam ’ s wife arose and departed , and came to ( U ) Tirzah . ( V ) When she came to the threshold of the house , the child died .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	18	And they buried him ; and all Israel mourned for him , ( W ) according to the word of the Lord which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet . Death of Jeroboam
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	19	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he ( X ) made war and how he reigned , indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	20	The period that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years . So he rested with his fathers . Then ( Y ) Nadab his son reigned in his place . Rehoboam Reigns in Judah ( Z )
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	21	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah . ( AA ) Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king . He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city ( AB ) which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , to put His name there . ( AC ) His mother ’ s name was Naamah , an Ammonitess .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	22	( AD ) Now Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord , and they ( AE ) provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed , more than all that their fathers had done .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	23	For they also built for themselves ( AF ) high [ g ] places , ( AG ) sacred pillars , and ( AH ) wooden images on every high hill and ( AI ) under every green tree .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	24	( AJ ) And there were also [ h ] perverted persons in the land . They did according to all the ( AK ) abominations of the nations which the Lord had cast out before the children of ( AL ) Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	25	( AM ) It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	26	( AN ) And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king ’ s house ; he took away everything . He also took away all the gold shields ( AO ) which Solomon had made .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	27	Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place , and [ i ] committed them to the hands of the captains of the [ j ] guard , who guarded the doorway of the king ’ s house .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	28	And whenever the king entered the house of the Lord , the guards carried them , then brought them back into the guardroom .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	29	( AP ) Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	30	And there was ( AQ ) war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days .
NKJV	1%20Kings	14	31	( AR ) So Rehoboam [ k ] rested with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the City of David . ( AS ) His mother ’ s name was Naamah , an Ammonitess . Then ( AT ) Abijam [ l ] his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	15	15	He also brought into the house of the Lord the things which his father ( T ) had dedicated , and the things which he himself had dedicated : silver and gold and utensils .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem . ( C ) His mother ’ s name was ( D ) Maachah the granddaughter of ( E ) Abishalom .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	3	And he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him ; ( F ) his heart was not [ a ] loyal to the Lord his God , as was the heart of his father David .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	4	Nevertheless ( G ) for David ’ s sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem , by setting up his son after him and by establishing Jerusalem ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	5	because David ( H ) did what was right in the eyes of the Lord , and had not turned aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life , ( I ) except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	6	( J ) And there was war between [ b ] Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	7	( K ) Now the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	8	( L ) So Abijam [ c ] rested with his fathers , and they buried him in the City of David . Then Asa his son reigned in his place . Asa Reigns in Judah ( M )
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	9	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel , Asa became king over Judah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	10	And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem . His grandmother ’ s name was Maachah the granddaughter of Abishalom .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	11	( N ) Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord , as did his father David .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	12	( O ) And he banished the [ d ] perverted persons from the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	13	Also he removed ( P ) Maachah his grandmother from being queen mother , because she had made an obscene image of [ e ] Asherah . And Asa cut down her obscene image and ( Q ) burned it by the Brook Kidron .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	14	( R ) But the [ f ] high places were not removed . Nevertheless Asa ’ s ( S ) heart was loyal to the Lord all his days .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	16	Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	17	And ( U ) Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah , and built ( V ) Ramah , ( W ) that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	18	Then Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and the treasuries of the king ’ s house , and delivered them into the hand of his servants . And King Asa sent them to ( X ) Ben-Hadad the son of Tabrimmon , the son of Hezion , king of Syria , who dwelt in ( Y ) Damascus , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	19	“ Let there be a treaty between you and me , as there was between my father and your father . See , I have sent you a present of silver and gold . Come and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel , so that he will withdraw from me. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	20	So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa , and ( Z ) sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel . He attacked ( AA ) Ijon , ( AB ) Dan , ( AC ) Abel Beth Maachah , and all Chinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	21	Now it happened , when Baasha heard it , that he stopped building Ramah , and remained in ( AD ) Tirzah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	22	( AE ) Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah ; none was exempted . And they took away the stones and timber of Ramah , which Baasha had used for building ; and with them King Asa built ( AF ) Geba of Benjamin , and ( AG ) Mizpah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	23	The rest of all the acts of Asa , all his might , all that he did , and the cities which he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? But ( AH ) in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	24	So Asa [ g ] rested with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father . ( AI ) Then ( AJ ) Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place . Nadab Reigns in Israel
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	25	Now ( AK ) Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah , and he reigned over Israel two years .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	26	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in ( AL ) his sin by which he had made Israel sin .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	27	( AM ) Then Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him . And Baasha killed him at ( AN ) Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines , while Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	28	Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned in his place .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	29	And it was so , when he became king , that he killed all the house of Jeroboam . He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone that breathed , until he had destroyed him , according to ( AO ) the word of the Lord which He had spoken by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	30	( AP ) because of the sins of Jeroboam , which he had sinned and by which he had made Israel sin , because of his provocation with which he had provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	32	( AQ ) And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days . Baasha Reigns in Israel
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah , Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah , and reigned twenty-four years .
NKJV	1%20Kings	15	34	He did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in ( AR ) the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	16	16	Now the people who were encamped heard it said , “ Zimri has conspired and also has killed the king. ” So all Israel made Omri , the commander of the army , king over Israel that day in the camp .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	2	( D ) “ Inasmuch as I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel , and ( E ) you have walked in the way of Jeroboam , and have made My people Israel sin , to provoke Me to anger with their sins ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	3	surely I will ( F ) take [ a ] away the posterity of Baasha and the posterity of his house , and I will make your house like ( G ) the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	4	The dogs shall eat ( H ) whoever belongs to Baasha and dies in the city , and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the fields. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha , what he did , and his might , ( I ) are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	6	So Baasha [ b ] rested with his fathers and was buried in ( J ) Tirzah . Then Elah his son reigned in his place .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	7	And also the word of the Lord came by the prophet ( K ) Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house , because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord in provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands , in being like the house of Jeroboam , and because ( L ) he killed them . Elah Reigns in Israel
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah , Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel , and reigned two years in Tirzah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	9	( M ) Now his servant Zimri , commander of half his chariots , conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , ( N ) steward [ c ] of his house in Tirzah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	10	And Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned in his place .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	11	Then it came to pass , when he began to reign , as soon as he was seated on his throne , that he killed all the household of Baasha ; he ( O ) did not leave him one male , neither of his relatives nor of his friends .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	12	Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha , ( P ) according to the word of the Lord , which He spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	13	for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son , by which they had sinned and by which they had made Israel sin , in provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger ( Q ) with their [ d ] idols .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ? Zimri Reigns in Israel
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah , Zimri had reigned in Tirzah seven days . And the people were encamped ( R ) against Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	17	Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon , and they besieged Tirzah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	18	And it happened , when Zimri saw that the city was [ e ] taken , that he went into the citadel of the king ’ s house and burned the king ’ s house [ f ] down upon himself with fire , and died ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	19	because of the sins which he had committed in doing evil in the sight of the Lord , ( S ) in walking in the ( T ) way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he had committed to make Israel sin .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and the treason he committed , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ? Omri Reigns in Israel
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	21	Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king , and half followed Omri .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	22	But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath . So Tibni died and Omri reigned .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	23	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah , Omri became king over Israel , and reigned twelve years . Six years he reigned in ( U ) Tirzah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	24	And he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver ; then he built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , ( V ) Samaria , [ g ] after the name of Shemer , owner of the hill .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	25	( W ) Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord , and did worse than all who were before him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	26	For he ( X ) walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin , provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their ( Y ) idols . [ h ]
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and the might that he showed , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	28	So Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria . Then Ahab his son reigned in his place . Ahab Reigns in Israel
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	29	In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah , Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel ; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	30	Now Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord , more than all who were before him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	31	And it came to pass , as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , ( Z ) that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal , king of the ( AA ) Sidonians ; ( AB ) and he went and served Baal and worshiped him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	32	Then he set up an altar for Baal in ( AC ) the temple of Baal , which he had built in Samaria .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	33	( AD ) And Ahab made a [ i ] wooden image . Ahab ( AE ) did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	16	34	In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho . He laid its foundation [ j ] with Abiram his firstborn , and with his youngest son Segub he set up its gates , ( AF ) according to the word of the Lord , which He had spoken through Joshua the son of Nun . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	17	17	Now it happened after these things that the son of the woman who owned the house became sick . And his sickness was so [ b ] serious that [ c ] there was no breath left in him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	2	Then the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	3	“ Get away from here and turn eastward , and hide by the Brook Cherith , which flows into the Jordan .
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	4	And it will be that you shall drink from the brook , and I have commanded the ( F ) ravens to feed you there. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	5	So he went and did according to the word of the Lord , for he went and stayed by the Brook Cherith , which flows into the Jordan .
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	6	The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning , and bread and meat in the evening ; and he drank from the brook .
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	7	And it happened after a while that the brook dried up , because there had been no rain in the land . Elijah and the Widow
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	8	Then the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	9	“ Arise , go to ( G ) Zarephath , which belongs to ( H ) Sidon , and dwell there . See , I have commanded a widow there to provide for you. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	10	So he arose and went to Zarephath . And when he came to the gate of the city , indeed a widow was there gathering sticks . And he called to her and said , “ Please bring me a little water in a cup , that I may drink. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	11	And as she was going to get it , he called to her and said , “ Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	12	So she said , “ As the Lord your God lives , I do not have bread , only a handful of flour in a bin , and a little oil in a [ a ] jar ; and see , I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son , that we may eat it , and ( I ) die. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	13	And Elijah said to her , “ Do not fear ; go and do as you have said , but make me a small cake from it first , and bring it to me ; and afterward make some for yourself and your son .
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	14	For thus says the Lord God of Israel : ‘ The bin of flour shall not be used up , nor shall the jar of oil run dry , until the day the Lord sends rain on the earth. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	15	So she went away and did according to the word of Elijah ; and she and he and her household ate for many days .
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	16	The bin of flour was not used up , nor did the jar of oil run dry , according to the word of the Lord which He spoke by Elijah . Elijah Revives the Widow ’ s Son
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	18	So she said to Elijah , ( J ) “ What have I to do with you , O man of God ? Have you come to me to bring my sin to remembrance , and to kill my son ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	19	And he said to her , “ Give me your son. ” So he took him out of her arms and carried him to the upper room where he was staying , and laid him on his own bed .
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	20	Then he cried out to the Lord and said , “ O Lord my God , have You also brought tragedy on the widow with whom I lodge , by killing her son ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	21	( K ) And he stretched himself out on the child three times , and cried out to the Lord and said , “ O Lord my God , I pray , let this child ’ s soul come back to him. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	22	Then the Lord heard the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came back to him , and he ( L ) revived .
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	23	And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house , and gave him to his mother . And Elijah said , “ See , your son lives ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	17	24	Then the woman said to Elijah , “ Now by this ( M ) I know that you are a man of God , and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is the truth. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	18	18	And he answered , “ I have not troubled Israel , but you and your father ’ s house have , ( G ) in that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and have followed the Baals .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	2	So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab ; and there was a severe famine in Samaria .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	3	And Ahab had called Obadiah , who was [ a ] in charge of his house . ( Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	4	For so it was , while Jezebel [ b ] massacred the prophets of the Lord , that Obadiah had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them , fifty to a cave , and had fed them with bread and water . )
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	5	And Ahab had said to Obadiah , “ Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks ; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive , so that we will not have to kill any livestock. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	6	So they divided the land between them to explore it ; Ahab went one way by himself , and Obadiah went another way by himself .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	7	Now as Obadiah was on his way , suddenly Elijah met him ; and he ( C ) recognized him , and fell on his face , and said , “ Is that you , my lord Elijah ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	8	And he answered him , “ It is I . Go , tell your master , ‘ Elijah is here. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	9	So he said , “ How have I sinned , that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab , to kill me ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	10	As the Lord your God lives , there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you ; and when they said , ‘ He is not here , ’ he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they could not find you .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	11	And now you say , ‘ Go , tell your master , “ Elijah is here ” ’ !
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	12	And it shall come to pass , as soon as I am gone from you , that ( D ) the Spirit of the Lord will carry you to a place I do not know ; so when I go and tell Ahab , and he can not find you , he will kill me . But I your servant have feared the Lord from my youth .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	13	Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord , how I hid one hundred men of the Lord ’ s prophets , fifty to a cave , and fed them with bread and water ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	14	And now you say , ‘ Go , tell your master , “ Elijah is here. ” ’ He will kill me ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	15	Then Elijah said , “ As the Lord of hosts lives , before whom I stand , I will surely present myself to him today. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab , and told him ; and Ahab went to meet Elijah .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	17	Then it happened , when Ahab saw Elijah , that Ahab said to him , ( E ) “ Is that you , O ( F ) troubler of Israel ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	19	Now therefore , send and gather all Israel to me on ( H ) Mount Carmel , the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal , ( I ) and the four hundred prophets of [ c ] Asherah , who [ d ] eat at Jezebel ’ s table. ” Elijah ’ s Mount Carmel Victory
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	20	So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel , and ( J ) gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	21	And Elijah came to all the people , and said , ( K ) “ How long will you falter between two opinions ? If the Lord is God , follow Him ; but if Baal , ( L ) follow him. ” But the people answered him not a word .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	22	Then Elijah said to the people , ( M ) “ I alone am left a prophet of the Lord ; ( N ) but Baal ’ s prophets are four hundred and fifty men .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	23	Therefore let them give us two bulls ; and let them choose one bull for themselves , cut it in pieces , and lay it on the wood , but put no fire under it ; and I will prepare the other bull , and lay it on the wood , but put no fire under it .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	24	Then you call on the name of your gods , and I will call on the name of the Lord ; and the God who ( O ) answers by fire , He is God. ” So all the people answered and said , [ e ] “ It is well spoken. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	25	Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , “ Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first , for you are many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	26	So they took the bull which was given them , and they prepared it , and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon , saying , “ O Baal , [ f ] hear us ! ” But there was ( P ) no voice ; no one answered . Then they [ g ] leaped about the altar which they had made .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	27	And so it was , at noon , that Elijah mocked them and said , “ Cry [ h ] aloud , for he is a god ; either he is meditating , or he is busy , or he is on a journey , or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	28	So they cried aloud , and ( Q ) cut themselves , as was their custom , with [ i ] knives and lances , until the blood gushed out on them .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	29	And when midday was past , ( R ) they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice . But there was ( S ) no voice ; no one answered , no one paid attention .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	30	Then Elijah said to all the people , “ Come near to me. ” So all the people came near to him . ( T ) And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	31	And Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , to whom the word of the Lord had come , saying , ( U ) “ Israel shall be your name. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	32	Then with the stones he built an altar ( V ) in the name of the Lord ; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	33	And he ( W ) put the wood in order , cut the bull in pieces , and laid it on the wood , and said , “ Fill four waterpots with water , and ( X ) pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	34	Then he said , “ Do it a second time , ” and they did it a second time ; and he said , “ Do it a third time , ” and they did it a third time .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	35	So the water ran all around the altar ; and he also filled ( Y ) the trench with water .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	36	And it came to pass , at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that Elijah the prophet came near and said , “ Lord ( Z ) God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , ( AA ) let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant , and that ( AB ) I have done all these things at Your word .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	37	Hear me , O Lord , hear me , that this people may know that You are the Lord God , and that You have turned their hearts back to You again. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	38	Then ( AC ) the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood and the stones and the dust , and it licked up the water that was in the trench .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	39	Now when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces ; and they said , ( AD ) “ The Lord , He is God ! The Lord , He is God ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	40	And Elijah said to them , ( AE ) “ Seize the prophets of Baal ! Do not let one of them escape ! ” So they seized them ; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook ( AF ) Kishon and ( AG ) executed them there . The Drought Ends
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	41	Then Elijah said to Ahab , “ Go up , eat and drink ; for there is the sound of abundance of rain. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	42	So Ahab went up to eat and drink . And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; ( AH ) then he bowed down on the ground , and put his face between his knees ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	43	and said to his servant , “ Go up now , look toward the sea. ” So he went up and looked , and said , “ There is nothing. ” And seven times he said , “ Go again. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	44	Then it came to pass the seventh time , that he said , “ There is a cloud , as small as a man ’ s hand , rising out of the sea ! ” So he said , “ Go up , say to Ahab , [ j ] ‘ Prepare your chariot , and go down before the rain stops you. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	45	Now it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind , and there was a heavy rain . So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	18	46	Then the ( AI ) hand of the Lord came upon Elijah ; and he ( AJ ) girded [ k ] up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	19	19	So he departed from there , and found Elisha the son of Shaphat , who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him , and he was with the twelfth . Then Elijah passed by him and threw his ( X ) mantle on him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah , saying , ( B ) “ So let the gods do to me , and more also , if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	3	And when he saw that , he arose and ran for his life , and went to Beersheba , which belongs to Judah , and left his servant there .
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	4	But he himself went a day ’ s journey into the wilderness , and came and sat down under a [ a ] broom tree . And he ( C ) prayed that he might die , and said , “ It is enough ! Now , Lord , take my life , for I am no better than my fathers ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	5	Then as he lay and slept under a broom tree , suddenly an [ b ] angel touched him , and said to him , “ Arise and eat. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	6	Then he looked , and there by his head was a cake baked on [ c ] coals , and a jar of water . So he ate and drank , and lay down again .
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	7	And the [ d ] angel of the Lord came back the second time , and touched him , and said , “ Arise and eat , because the journey is too great for you. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	8	So he arose , and ate and drank ; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and ( D ) forty nights as far as ( E ) Horeb , the mountain of God .
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	9	And there he went into a cave , and spent the night in that place ; and behold , the word of the Lord came to him , and He said to him , “ What are you doing here , Elijah ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	10	So he said , ( F ) “ I have been very ( G ) zealous for the Lord God of hosts ; for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant , torn down Your altars , and ( H ) killed Your prophets with the sword . ( I ) I alone am left ; and they seek to take my life. ” God ’ s Revelation to Elijah
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	11	Then He said , “ Go out , and stand ( J ) on the mountain before the Lord. ” And behold , the Lord ( K ) passed by , and ( L ) a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord , but the Lord was not in the wind ; and after the wind an earthquake , but the Lord was not in the earthquake ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	12	and after the earthquake a fire , but the Lord was not in the fire ; and after the fire [ e ] a still small voice .
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	13	So it was , when Elijah heard it , that ( M ) he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave . ( N ) Suddenly a voice came to him , and said , “ What are you doing here , Elijah ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	14	( O ) And he said , “ I have been very zealous for the Lord God of hosts ; because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant , torn down Your altars , and killed Your prophets with the sword . I alone am left ; and they seek to take my life. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	15	Then the Lord said to him : “ Go , return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus ; ( P ) and when you arrive , anoint Hazael as king over Syria .
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	16	Also you shall anoint ( Q ) Jehu the son of Nimshi as king over Israel . And ( R ) Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place .
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	17	( S ) It shall be that whoever escapes the sword of Hazael , Jehu will ( T ) kill ; and whoever escapes the sword of Jehu , ( U ) Elisha will kill .
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	18	( V ) Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel , all whose knees have not bowed to Baal , ( W ) and every mouth that has not kissed him. ” Elisha Follows Elijah
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	20	And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah , and said , ( Y ) “ Please let me kiss my father and my mother , and then I will follow you. ” And he said to him , “ Go back again , for what have I done to you ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	19	21	So Elisha turned back from him , and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and ( Z ) boiled their flesh , using the oxen ’ s equipment , and gave it to the people , and they ate . Then he arose and followed Elijah , and became his servant . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	20	20	And each one killed his man ; so the Syrians fled , and Israel pursued them ; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the cavalry .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	2	Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel , and said to him , “ Thus says Ben-Hadad :
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	3	‘ Your silver and your gold are mine ; your loveliest wives and children are mine. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	4	And the king of Israel answered and said , “ My lord , O king , just as you say , I and all that I have are yours. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	5	Then the messengers came back and said , “ Thus speaks Ben-Hadad , saying , ‘ Indeed I have sent to you , saying , “ You shall deliver to me your silver and your gold , your wives and your children ” ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	6	but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time , and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants . And it shall be , that whatever is [ a ] pleasant in your eyes , they will put it in their hands and take it. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	7	So the king of Israel called all the elders of the land , and said , “ Notice , please , and see how this man seeks trouble , for he sent to me for my wives , my children , my silver , and my gold ; and I did not deny him. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	8	And all the elders and all the people said to him , “ Do not listen or consent. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	9	Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad , “ Tell my lord the king , ‘ All that you sent for to your servant the first time I will do , but this thing I can not do. ’ ” And the messengers departed and brought back word to him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	10	Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said , ( C ) “ The gods do so to me , and more also , if enough dust is left of Samaria for a handful for each of the people [ b ] who follow me. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	11	So the king of Israel answered and said , “ Tell him , ‘ Let not the one who puts on his armor ( D ) boast like the one who takes it off. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	12	And it happened when Ben-Hadad heard this message , as he and the kings were ( E ) drinking at the [ c ] command post , that he said to his servants , “ Get ready. ” And they got ready to attack the city .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	13	Suddenly a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel , saying , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Have you seen all this great multitude ? Behold , ( F ) I will deliver it into your hand today , and you shall know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	14	So Ahab said , “ By whom ? ” And he said , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ By the young leaders of the provinces. ’ ” Then he said , “ Who will set the battle in order ? ” And he answered , “ You. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	15	Then he mustered the young leaders of the provinces , and there were two hundred and thirty-two ; and after them he mustered all the people , all the children of Israel—seven thousand .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	16	So they went out at noon . Meanwhile Ben-Hadad and the thirty-two kings helping him were ( G ) getting drunk at the command post .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	17	The young leaders of the provinces went out first . And Ben-Hadad sent out a patrol , and they told him , saying , “ Men are coming out of Samaria ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	18	So he said , “ If they have come out for peace , take them alive ; and if they have come out for war , take them alive. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	19	Then these young leaders of the provinces went out of the city with the army which followed them .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	21	Then the king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and chariots , and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	22	And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him , “ Go , strengthen yourself ; take note , and see what you should do , ( H ) for [ d ] in the spring of the year the king of Syria will come up against you. ” The Syrians Again Defeated
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	23	Then the servants of the king of Syria said to him , “ Their gods are gods of the hills . Therefore they were stronger than we ; but if we fight against them in the plain , surely we will be stronger than they .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	24	So do this thing : Dismiss the kings , each from his position , and put captains in their [ e ] places ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	25	and you shall muster an army like the army [ f ] that you have lost , horse for horse and chariot for chariot . Then we will fight against them in the plain ; surely we will be stronger than they. ” And he listened to their voice and did so .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	26	So it was , in the spring of the year , that Ben-Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to ( I ) Aphek to fight against Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	27	And the children of Israel were mustered and given provisions , and they went against them . Now the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats , while the Syrians filled the ( J ) countryside .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	28	Then a ( K ) man of God came and spoke to the king of Israel , and said , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Because the Syrians have said , “ The Lord is God of the hills , but He is not God of the valleys , ” therefore ( L ) I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand , and you shall know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	29	And they encamped opposite each other for seven days . So it was that on the seventh day the battle was joined ; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians in one day .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	30	But the rest fled to Aphek , into the city ; then a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men who were left . And Ben-Hadad fled and went into the city , into an inner chamber . Ahab ’ s Treaty with Ben-Hadad
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	31	Then his servants said to him , “ Look now , we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings . Please , let us ( M ) put sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads , and go out to the king of Israel ; perhaps he will spare your life. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	32	So they wore sackcloth around their waists and put ropes around their heads , and came to the king of Israel and said , “ Your servant Ben-Hadad says , ‘ Please let me live. ’ ” And he said , “ Is he still alive ? He is my brother. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	33	Now the men were watching closely to see whether any sign of mercy would come from him ; and they quickly grasped at this word and said , “ Your brother Ben-Hadad. ” So he said , “ Go , bring him. ” Then Ben-Hadad came out to him ; and he had him come up into the chariot .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	34	So Ben-Hadad said to him , ( N ) “ The cities which my father took from your father I will restore ; and you may set up marketplaces for yourself in Damascus , as my father did in Samaria. ” Then Ahab said , “ I will send you away with this treaty. ” So he made a treaty with him and sent him away . Ahab Condemned
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	35	Now a certain man of ( O ) the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor ( P ) by the word of the Lord , “ Strike me , please. ” And the man refused to strike him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	36	Then he said to him , “ Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord , surely , as soon as you depart from me , a lion shall kill you. ” And as soon as he left him , ( Q ) a lion found him and killed him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	37	And he found another man , and said , “ Strike me , please. ” So the man struck him , inflicting a wound .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	38	Then the prophet departed and waited for the king by the road , and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	39	Now ( R ) as the king passed by , he cried out to the king and said , “ Your servant went out into the midst of the battle ; and there , a man came over and brought a man to me , and said , ‘ Guard this man ; if by any means he is missing , ( S ) your life shall be for his life , or else you shall [ g ] pay a talent of silver. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	40	While your servant was busy here and there , he was gone. ” Then the king of Israel said to him , “ So shall your judgment be ; you yourself have decided it. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	41	And he hastened to take the bandage away from his eyes ; and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets .
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	42	Then he said to him , “ Thus says the Lord : ( T ) ‘ Because you have let slip out of your hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction , therefore your life shall go for his life , and your people for his people. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	20	43	So the king of Israel ( U ) went to his house sullen and displeased , and came to Samaria . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	21	3	But Naboth said to Ahab , “ The Lord forbid ( C ) that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	4	So Ahab went into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him ; for he had said , “ I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. ” And he lay down on his bed , and turned away his face , and would eat no food .
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	5	But ( D ) Jezebel his wife came to him , and said to him , “ Why is your spirit so sullen that you eat no food ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	6	He said to her , “ Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite , and said to him , ‘ Give me your vineyard for money ; or else , if it pleases you , I will give you another vineyard for it. ’ And he answered , ‘ I will not give you my vineyard. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	7	Then Jezebel his wife said to him , “ You now exercise authority over Israel ! Arise , eat food , and let your heart be cheerful ; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	8	And she wrote letters in Ahab ’ s name , sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naboth .
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	9	She wrote in the letters , saying , Proclaim a fast , and seat Naboth [ a ] with high honor among the people ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	10	and seat two men , scoundrels , before him to bear witness against him , saying , “ You have ( E ) blasphemed God and the king. ” Then take him out , and ( F ) stone him , that he may die .
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	11	So the men of his city , the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city , did as Jezebel had sent to them , as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	12	( G ) They proclaimed a fast , and seated Naboth with high honor among the people .
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	13	And two men , scoundrels , came in and sat before him ; and the scoundrels ( H ) witnessed against him , against Naboth , in the presence of the people , saying , “ Naboth has blasphemed God and the king ! ” ( I ) Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones , so that he died .
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	14	Then they sent to Jezebel , saying , “ Naboth has been stoned and is dead. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	15	And it came to pass , when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead , that Jezebel said to Ahab , “ Arise , take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , which he refused to give you for money ; for Naboth is not alive , but dead. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	16	So it was , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite . The Lord Condemns Ahab
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	17	( J ) Then the word of the Lord came to ( K ) Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	18	“ Arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , ( L ) who lives in Samaria . There he is , in the vineyard of Naboth , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	19	You shall speak to him , saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ Have you murdered and also taken possession ? ” ’ And you shall speak to him , saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( M ) “ In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth , dogs shall lick your blood , even yours. ” ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	20	So Ahab said to Elijah , ( N ) “ Have you found me , O my enemy ? ” And he answered , “ I have found you , because ( O ) you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord :
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	22	I will make your house like the house of ( T ) Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of ( U ) Baasha the son of Ahijah , because of the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger , and made Israel sin. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	23	And ( V ) concerning Jezebel the Lord also spoke , saying , ‘ The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the [ b ] wall of Jezreel. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	24	The dogs shall eat ( W ) whoever belongs to Ahab and dies in the city , and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	25	But ( X ) there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the Lord , ( Y ) because Jezebel his wife [ c ] stirred him up .
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	26	And he behaved very abominably in following idols , according to all ( Z ) that the Amorites had done , whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	27	So it was , when Ahab heard those words , that he tore his clothes and ( AA ) put sackcloth on his body , and fasted and lay in sackcloth , and went about mourning .
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	28	And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Kings	21	29	“ See how Ahab has humbled himself before Me ? Because he ( AB ) has humbled himself before Me , I will not bring the calamity in his days . ( AC ) In the days of his son I will bring the calamity on his house. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Kings	22	22	The Lord said to him , ‘ In what way ? ’ So he said , ‘ I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. ’ And the Lord said , ( N ) ‘ You shall persuade him , and also prevail . Go out and do so. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	2	Then it came to pass , in the third year , that ( B ) Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	3	And the king of Israel said to his servants , “ Do you know that ( C ) Ramoth in Gilead is ours , but we hesitate to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	4	So he said to Jehoshaphat , “ Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead ? ” Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , ( D ) “ I am as you are , my people as your people , my horses as your horses. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	5	Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , ( E ) “ Please inquire for the word of the Lord today. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	6	Then the king of Israel ( F ) gathered [ a ] the prophets together , about four hundred men , and said to them , “ Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to fight , or shall I refrain ? ” So they said , “ Go up , for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	7	And ( G ) Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there not still a prophet of the Lord here , that we may inquire of [ b ] Him ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	8	So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ There is still one man , Micaiah the son of Imlah , by whom we may inquire of the Lord ; but I hate him , because he does not prophesy good concerning me , but evil. ” And Jehoshaphat said , “ Let not the king say such things ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	9	Then the king of Israel called an officer and said , “ Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	10	The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , having put on their robes , sat each on his throne , at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	11	Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made ( H ) horns of iron for himself ; and he said , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ With these you shall ( I ) gore the Syrians until they are destroyed. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	12	And all the prophets prophesied so , saying , “ Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper , for the Lord will deliver it into the king ’ s hand. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	13	Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him , saying , “ Now listen , the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king . Please , let your word be like the word of one of them , and speak encouragement. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	14	And Micaiah said , “ As the Lord lives , ( J ) whatever the Lord says to me , that I will speak. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	15	Then he came to the king ; and the king said to him , “ Micaiah , shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead , or shall we refrain ? ” And he answered him , “ Go and prosper , for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	16	So the king said to him , “ How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	17	Then he said , “ I saw all Israel ( K ) scattered on the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd . And the Lord said , ‘ These have no master . Let each return to his house in peace. ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	18	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me , but evil ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	19	Then Micaiah said , “ Therefore hear the word of the Lord : ( L ) I saw the Lord sitting on His throne , ( M ) and all the host of heaven standing by , on His right hand and on His left .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	20	And the Lord said , ‘ Who will persuade Ahab to go up , that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead ? ’ So one spoke in this manner , and another spoke in that manner .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	21	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord , and said , ‘ I will persuade him. ’
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	23	( O ) Therefore look ! The Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours , and the Lord has declared disaster against you. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	24	Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and ( P ) struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , ( Q ) “ Which way did the spirit from the Lord go from me to speak to you ? ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	25	And Micaiah said , “ Indeed , you shall see on that day when you go into an ( R ) inner chamber to hide ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	26	So the king of Israel said , “ Take Micaiah , and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king ’ s son ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	27	and say , ‘ Thus says the king : “ Put this fellow in ( S ) prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction , until I come in peace. ” ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	28	But Micaiah said , “ If you ever return in peace , ( T ) the Lord has not spoken by me. ” And he said , “ Take heed , all you people ! ” Ahab Dies in Battle ( U )
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	30	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ I will disguise myself and go into battle ; but you put on your robes. ” So the king of Israel ( V ) disguised himself and went into battle .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	31	Now the ( W ) king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two ( X ) captains of his chariots , saying , “ Fight with no one small or great , but only with the king of Israel. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	32	So it was , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , “ Surely it is the king of Israel ! ” Therefore they turned aside to fight against him , and Jehoshaphat ( Y ) cried out .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	33	And it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	34	Now a certain man drew a bow at random , and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor . So he said to the driver of his chariot , “ Turn around and take me out of the battle , for I am wounded. ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	35	The battle increased that day ; and the king was propped up in his chariot , facing the Syrians , and died at evening . The blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	36	Then , as the sun was going down , a shout went throughout the army , saying , “ Every man to his city , and every man to his own country ! ”
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	37	So the king died , and was brought to Samaria . And they buried the king in Samaria .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	38	Then someone washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria , and the dogs licked up his blood while [ c ] the harlots bathed , according ( Z ) to the word of the Lord which He had spoken .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , ( AA ) the ivory house which he built and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	40	So Ahab [ d ] rested with his fathers . Then ( AB ) Ahaziah his son reigned in his place . Jehoshaphat Reigns in Judah ( AC )
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	41	( AD ) Jehoshaphat the son of Asa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	43	And ( AE ) he walked in all the ways of his father Asa . He did not turn aside from them , doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord . Nevertheless ( AF ) the high places were not taken away , for the people offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	44	Also ( AG ) Jehoshaphat made ( AH ) peace with the king of Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , the might that he showed , and how he made war , are they not written ( AI ) in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	46	( AJ ) And the rest of the [ e ] perverted persons , who remained in the days of his father Asa , he banished from the land .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	47	( AK ) There was then no king in Edom , only a deputy of the king .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	48	( AL ) Jehoshaphat ( AM ) made [ f ] merchant ships to go to ( AN ) Ophir for gold ; ( AO ) but they never sailed , for the ships were wrecked at ( AP ) Ezion Geber .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	49	Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , “ Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. ” But Jehoshaphat would not .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	50	And ( AQ ) Jehoshaphat [ g ] rested with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father . Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place . Ahaziah Reigns in Israel
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	51	( AR ) Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and reigned two years over Israel .
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	52	He did evil in the sight of the Lord , and ( AS ) walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who had made Israel sin ;
NKJV	1%20Kings	22	53	for ( AT ) he served Baal and worshiped him , and provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger , ( AU ) according [ h ] to all that his father had done . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	1	1	Moab ( A ) rebelled against Israel ( B ) after the death of Ahab .
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	3	But the [ b ] angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite , “ Arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria , and say to them , ‘ Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub , the god of Ekron ? ’
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	4	Now therefore , thus says the Lord : ‘ You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up , but you shall surely die. ’ ” So Elijah departed .
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	5	And when the messengers returned to [ c ] him , he said to them , “ Why have you come back ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	6	So they said to him , “ A man came up to meet us , and said to us , ‘ Go , return to the king who sent you , and say to him , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub , the god of Ekron ? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up , but you shall surely die. ’ ” ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	7	Then he said to them , “ What kind of man was it who came up to meet you and told you these words ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	8	So they answered him , ( F ) “ A hairy man wearing a leather belt around his waist. ” And he said , ( G ) “ It is Elijah the Tishbite. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	9	Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men . So he went up to him ; and there he was , sitting on the top of a hill . And he spoke to him : “ Man of God , the king has said , ‘ Come down ! ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	10	So Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty , “ If I am a man of God , then ( H ) let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men. ” And fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty .
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	11	Then he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty men . And he answered and said to him : “ Man of God , thus has the king said , ‘ Come down quickly ! ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	12	So Elijah answered and said to them , “ If I am a man of God , let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men. ” And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty .
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	13	Again , he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men . And the third captain of fifty went up , and came and [ d ] fell on his knees before Elijah , and pleaded with him , and said to him : “ Man of God , please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours ( I ) be precious in your sight .
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	14	Look , fire has come down from heaven and burned up the first two captains of fifties with their fifties . But let my life now be precious in your sight. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	15	And the [ e ] angel of the Lord said to Elijah , “ Go down with him ; do not be afraid of him. ” So he arose and went down with him to the king .
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	16	Then he said to him , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub , the god of Ekron , is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word ? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up , but you shall surely die. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	17	So Ahaziah died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken . Because he had no son , ( J ) Jehoram [ f ] became king in his place , in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat , king of Judah .
NKJV	2%20Kings	1	18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ? Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	2	3	Now ( E ) the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha , and said to him , “ Do you know that the Lord will take away your master [ a ] from over you today ? ” And he said , “ Yes , I know ; keep silent ! ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	4	Then Elijah said to him , “ Elisha , stay here , please , for the Lord has sent me on to Jericho. ” But he said , “ As the Lord lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you ! ” So they came to Jericho .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	5	Now the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him , “ Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from over you today ? ” So he answered , “ Yes , I know ; keep silent ! ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	6	Then Elijah said to him , “ Stay here , please , for the Lord has sent me on to the Jordan. ” But he said , “ As the Lord lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you ! ” So the two of them went on .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing them at a distance , while the two of them stood by the Jordan .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	8	Now Elijah took his mantle , rolled it up , and struck the water ; and ( F ) it was divided this way and that , so that the two of them crossed over on dry ( G ) ground .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	9	And so it was , when they had crossed over , that Elijah said to Elisha , “ Ask ! What may I do for you , before I am taken away from you ? ” Elisha said , “ Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	10	So he said , “ You have asked a hard thing . Nevertheless , if you see me when I am taken from you , it shall be so for you ; but if not , it shall not be so. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	11	Then it happened , as they continued on and talked , that suddenly ( H ) a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire , and separated the two of them ; and Elijah ( I ) went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	12	And Elisha saw it , and he cried out , ( J ) “ My father , my father , the chariot of Israel and its horsemen ! ” So he saw him no more . And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	13	He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him , and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	14	Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him , and struck the water , and said , “ Where is the Lord God of Elijah ? ” And when he also had struck the water , ( K ) it was divided this way and that ; and Elisha crossed over .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	15	Now when the sons of the prophets who were ( L ) from [ b ] Jericho saw him , they said , “ The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. ” And they came to meet him , and bowed to the ground before him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	16	Then they said to him , “ Look now , there are fifty strong men with your servants . Please let them go and search for your master , ( M ) lest perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. ” And he said , “ You shall not send anyone. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	17	But when they urged him till he was ( N ) ashamed , he said , “ Send them ! ” Therefore they sent fifty men , and they searched for three days but did not find him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	18	And when they came back to him , for he had stayed in Jericho , he said to them , “ Did I not say to you , ‘ Do not go ’ ? ” Elisha Performs Miracles
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	19	Then the men of the city said to Elisha , “ Please notice , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord sees ; but the water is bad , and the ground barren. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	20	And he said , “ Bring me a new bowl , and put salt in it. ” So they brought it to him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	21	Then he went out to the source of the water , and ( O ) cast in the salt there , and said , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ I have [ c ] healed this water ; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	22	So the water remains ( P ) healed to this day , according to the word of Elisha which he spoke .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	23	Then he went up from there to Bethel ; and as he was going up the road , some youths came from the city and mocked him , and said to him , “ Go up , you baldhead ! Go up , you baldhead ! ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	24	So he turned around and looked at them , and ( Q ) pronounced a curse on them in the name of the Lord . And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths .
NKJV	2%20Kings	2	25	Then he went from there to ( R ) Mount Carmel , and from there he returned to Samaria . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	3	3	Nevertheless he persisted in ( C ) the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who had made Israel sin ; he did not depart from them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	4	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepbreeder , and he ( D ) regularly paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand ( E ) lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	5	But it happened , when ( F ) Ahab died , that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	6	So King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	7	Then he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah , saying , “ The king of Moab has rebelled against me . Will you go with me to fight against Moab ? ” And he said , “ I will go up ; ( G ) I am as you are , my people as your people , my horses as your horses. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	8	Then he said , “ Which way shall we go up ? ” And he answered , “ By way of the Wilderness of Edom. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	9	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom , and they marched on that roundabout route seven days ; and there was no water for the army , nor for the animals that followed them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	10	And the king of Israel said , “ Alas ! For the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	11	But ( H ) Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there no prophet of the Lord here , that we may inquire of the Lord by him ? ” So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said , “ Elisha the son of Shaphat is here , who ( I ) poured [ a ] water on the hands of Elijah. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	12	And Jehoshaphat said , “ The word of the Lord is with him. ” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom ( J ) went down to him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	13	Then Elisha said to the king of Israel , ( K ) “ What have I to do with you ? ( L ) Go to ( M ) the prophets of your father and the ( N ) prophets of your mother. ” But the king of Israel said to him , “ No , for the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	14	And Elisha said , ( O ) “ As the Lord of hosts lives , before whom I stand , surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , I would not look at you , nor see you .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	15	But now bring me ( P ) a musician. ” Then it happened , when the musician ( Q ) played , that ( R ) the hand of the Lord came upon him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	16	And he said , “ Thus says the Lord : ( S ) ‘ Make this valley full of [ b ] ditches. ’
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	17	For thus says the Lord : ‘ You shall not see wind , nor shall you see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , so that you , your cattle , and your animals may drink. ’
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	18	And this is a simple matter in the sight of the Lord ; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	19	Also you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city , and shall cut down every good tree , and stop up every spring of water , and ruin every good piece of land with stones. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	20	Now it happened in the morning , when ( T ) the grain offering was offered , that suddenly water came by way of Edom , and the land was filled with water .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	21	And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , all who were able to bear arms and older were [ c ] gathered ; and they stood at the border .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	22	Then they rose up early in the morning , and the sun was shining on the water ; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	23	And they said , “ This is blood ; the kings have surely struck swords and have killed one another ; now therefore , Moab , to the spoil ! ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	24	So when they came to the camp of Israel , Israel rose up and attacked the Moabites , so that they fled before them ; and they entered their land , killing the Moabites .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	25	Then they destroyed the cities , and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it ; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees . But they left the stones of ( U ) Kir Haraseth intact . However the slingers surrounded and attacked it .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	26	And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords , to break through to the king of Edom , but they could not .
NKJV	2%20Kings	3	27	Then ( V ) he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place , and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall ; and there was great [ d ] indignation against Israel . ( W ) So they departed from him and returned to their own land . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	4	4	And when you have come in , you shall shut the door behind you and your sons ; then pour it into all those vessels , and set aside the full ones. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	3	Then he said , “ Go , borrow vessels from everywhere , from all your neighbors—empty vessels ; ( D ) do not gather just a few .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	5	So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she poured it out .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	6	Now it came to pass , when the vessels were full , that she said to her son , “ Bring me another vessel. ” And he said to her , “ There is not another vessel. ” So the oil ceased .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	7	Then she came and told the man of God . And he said , “ Go , sell the oil and pay your debt ; and you and your sons live on the rest. ” Elisha Raises the Shunammite ’ s Son ( E )
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	8	Now it happened one day that Elisha went to ( F ) Shunem , where there was a [ a ] notable woman , and she [ b ] persuaded him to eat some food . So it was , as often as he passed by , he would turn in there to eat some food .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	9	And she said to her husband , “ Look now , I know that this is a holy man of God , who passes by us regularly .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	10	Please , let us make [ c ] a small upper room on the wall ; and let us put a bed for him there , and a table and a chair and a lampstand ; so it will be , whenever he comes to us , he can turn in there. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	11	And it happened one day that he came there , and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	12	Then he said to ( G ) Gehazi his servant , “ Call this Shunammite woman. ” When he had called her , she stood before him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	13	And he said to him , “ Say now to her , ‘ Look , you have been concerned for us with all this care . What can I do for you ? Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army ? ’ ” She answered , “ I dwell among my own people. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	14	So he said , “ What then is to be done for her ? ” And Gehazi answered , “ Actually , she has no son , and her husband is old. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	15	So he said , “ Call her. ” When he had called her , she stood in the doorway .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	16	Then he said , [ d ] “ About this time next year you shall embrace a son. ” And she said , “ No , my lord . Man of God , ( H ) do not lie to your maidservant ! ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	17	But the woman conceived , and bore a son when the appointed time had come , of which Elisha had told her .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	18	And the child grew . Now it happened one day that he went out to his father , to the reapers .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	19	And he said to his father , “ My head , my head ! ” So he said to a servant , “ Carry him to his mother. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	20	When he had taken him and brought him to his mother , he sat on her knees till noon , and then died .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	21	And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God , shut the door upon him , and went out .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	22	Then she called to her husband , and said , “ Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys , that I may run to the man of God and come back. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	23	So he said , “ Why are you going to him today ? It is neither the ( I ) New Moon nor the Sabbath. ” And she said , [ e ] “ It is well. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	24	Then she saddled a donkey , and said to her servant , “ Drive , and go forward ; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	25	And so she departed , and went to the man of God ( J ) at Mount Carmel . So it was , when the man of God saw her afar off , that he said to his servant Gehazi , “ Look , the Shunammite woman !
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	26	Please run now to meet her , and say to her , ‘ Is it well with you ? Is it well with your husband ? Is it well with the child ? ’ ” And she answered , “ It is well. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	27	Now when she came to the man of God at the hill , she caught him by the feet , but Gehazi came near to push her away . But the man of God said , “ Let her alone ; for her soul is in deep distress , and the Lord has hidden it from me , and has not told me. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	28	So she said , “ Did I ask a son of my lord ? ( K ) Did I not say , ‘ Do not deceive me ’ ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	29	Then he said to Gehazi , ( L ) “ Get [ f ] yourself ready , and take my staff in your hand , and be on your way . If you meet anyone , ( M ) do not greet him ; and if anyone greets you , do not answer him ; but ( N ) lay my staff on the face of the child. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	30	And the mother of the child said , ( O ) “ As the Lord lives , and as your soul lives , I will not ( P ) leave you. ” So he arose and followed her .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	31	Now Gehazi went on ahead of them , and laid the staff on the face of the child ; but there was neither voice nor hearing . Therefore he went back to meet him , and told him , saying , “ The child has ( Q ) not awakened. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	32	When Elisha came into the house , there was the child , lying dead on his bed .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	33	He ( R ) went in therefore , shut the door behind the two of them , ( S ) and prayed to the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	34	And he went up and lay on the child , and put his mouth on his mouth , his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands ; and ( T ) he stretched himself out on the child , and the flesh of the child became warm .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	35	He returned and walked back and forth in the house , and again went up ( U ) and stretched himself out on him ; then ( V ) the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	36	And he called Gehazi and said , “ Call this Shunammite woman. ” So he called her . And when she came in to him , he said , “ Pick up your son. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	37	So she went in , fell at his feet , and bowed to the ground ; then she ( W ) picked up her son and went out . Elisha Purifies the Pot of Stew
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	38	And Elisha returned to ( X ) Gilgal , and there was a ( Y ) famine in the land . Now the sons of the prophets were ( Z ) sitting before him ; and he said to his servant , “ Put on the large pot , and boil stew for the sons of the prophets. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	39	So one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds , and came and sliced them into the pot of stew , though they did not know what they were .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	40	Then they served it to the men to eat . Now it happened , as they were eating the stew , that they cried out and said , “ Man of God , there is ( AA ) death in the pot ! ” And they could not eat it .
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	41	So he said , “ Then bring some flour. ” And ( AB ) he put it into the pot , and said , “ Serve it to the people , that they may eat. ” And there was nothing harmful in the pot . Elisha Feeds One Hundred Men ( AC )
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	42	Then a man came from ( AD ) Baal Shalisha , ( AE ) and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits , twenty loaves of barley bread , and newly ripened grain in his knapsack . And he said , “ Give it to the people , that they may eat. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	43	But his servant said , ( AF ) “ What ? Shall I set this before one hundred men ? ” He said again , “ Give it to the people , that they may eat ; for thus says the Lord : ( AG ) ‘ They shall eat and have some left over. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	4	44	So he set it before them ; and they ate ( AH ) and had some left over , according to the word of the Lord . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	5	5	Then the king of Syria said , “ Go now , and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. ” So he departed and ( D ) took with him ten talents of silver , six thousand shekels of gold , and ten changes of clothing .
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	3	Then she said to her mistress , “ If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria ! For he would heal him of his leprosy. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	4	And Naaman went in and told his master , saying , “ Thus and thus said the girl who is from the land of Israel. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	6	Then he brought the letter to the king of Israel , which said , Now be advised , when this letter comes to you , that I have sent Naaman my servant to you , that you may heal him of his leprosy .
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	7	And it happened , when the king of Israel read the letter , that he tore his clothes and said , “ Am I ( E ) God , to kill and make alive , that this man sends a man to me to heal him of his leprosy ? Therefore please consider , and see how he seeks a quarrel with me. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	8	So it was , when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , “ Why have you torn your clothes ? Please let him come to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	9	Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot , and he stood at the door of Elisha ’ s house .
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	10	And Elisha sent a messenger to him , saying , “ Go and ( F ) wash in the Jordan seven times , and your flesh shall be restored to you , and you shall be clean. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	11	But Naaman became furious , and went away and said , “ Indeed , I said to myself , ‘ He will surely come out to me , and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God , and wave his hand over the place , and heal the leprosy. ’
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	12	Are not the [ c ] Abanah and the Pharpar , the rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? Could I not wash in them and be clean ? ” So he turned and went away in a rage .
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	13	And his ( G ) servants came near and spoke to him , and said , “ My father , if the prophet had told you to do something great , would you not have done it ? How much more then , when he says to you , ‘ Wash , and be clean ’ ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	14	So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his ( H ) flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and ( I ) he was clean .
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	15	And he returned to the man of God , he and all his aides , and came and stood before him ; and he said , “ Indeed , now I know that there is ( J ) no God in all the earth , except in Israel ; now therefore , please take ( K ) a gift from your servant. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	16	But he said , ( L ) “ As the Lord lives , before whom I stand , ( M ) I will receive nothing. ” And he urged him to take it , but he refused .
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	17	So Naaman said , “ Then , if not , please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth ; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods , but to the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	18	Yet in this thing may the Lord pardon your servant : when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there , and ( N ) he leans on my hand , and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon—when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon , may the Lord please pardon your servant in this thing. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	19	Then he said to him , “ Go in peace. ” So he departed from him a short distance . Gehazi ’ s Greed
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	20	But ( O ) Gehazi , the servant of Elisha the man of God , said , “ Look , my master has spared Naaman this Syrian , while not receiving from his hands what he brought ; but as the Lord lives , I will run after him and take something from him. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	21	So Gehazi pursued Naaman . When Naaman saw him running after him , he got down from the chariot to meet him , and said , “ Is all well ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	22	And he said , “ All is ( P ) well . My master has sent me , saying , ‘ Indeed , just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the mountains of Ephraim . Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	23	So Naaman said , “ Please , take two talents. ” And he urged him , and bound two talents of silver in two bags , with two changes of garments , and handed them to two of his servants ; and they carried them on ahead of him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	24	When he came to [ d ] the citadel , he took them from their hand , and stored them away in the house ; then he let the men go , and they departed .
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	25	Now he went in and stood before his master . Elisha said to him , “ Where did you go , Gehazi ? ” And he said , “ Your servant did not go anywhere. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	26	Then he said to him , “ Did not my heart go with you when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you ? Is it ( Q ) time to receive money and to receive clothing , olive groves and vineyards , sheep and oxen , male and female servants ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	5	27	Therefore the leprosy of Naaman ( R ) shall cling to you and your descendants forever. ” And he went out from his presence ( S ) leprous , as white as snow . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	6	2	Kings 6:25 Approximately
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	6	So the man of God said , “ Where did it fall ? ” And he showed him the place . So ( D ) he cut off a stick , and threw it in there ; and he made the iron float .
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	3	Then one said , ( B ) “ Please consent to go with your servants. ” And he answered , “ I will go. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	4	So he went with them . And when they came to the Jordan , they cut down trees .
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	5	But as one was cutting down a tree , the iron ax head fell into the water ; and he cried out and said , “ Alas , master ! For it was ( C ) borrowed. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	7	Therefore he said , “ Pick it up for yourself. ” So he reached out his hand and took it . The Blinded Syrians Captured
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	8	Now the ( E ) king of Syria was making war against Israel ; and he consulted with his servants , saying , “ My camp will be in such and such a place. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	9	And the man of God sent to the king of Israel , saying , “ Beware that you do not pass this place , for the Syrians are coming down there. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	10	Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place of which the man of God had told him . Thus he warned him , and he was watchful there , not just once or twice .
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	11	Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing ; and he called his servants and said to them , “ Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	12	And one of his servants said , “ None , my lord , O king ; but Elisha , the prophet who is in Israel , tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	13	So he said , “ Go and see where he is , that I may send and get him. ” And it was told him , saying , “ Surely he is in ( F ) Dothan. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	14	Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there , and they came by night and surrounded the city .
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	15	And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out , there was an army , surrounding the city with horses and chariots . And his servant said to him , “ Alas , my master ! What shall we do ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	16	So he answered , ( G ) “ Do not fear , for ( H ) those who are with us are more than those who are with them. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	17	And Elisha prayed , and said , “ Lord , I pray , open his eyes that he may see. ” Then the Lord ( I ) opened the eyes of the young man , and he saw . And behold , the mountain was full of ( J ) horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha .
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	18	So when the Syrians came down to him , Elisha prayed to the Lord , and said , “ Strike this people , I pray , with blindness. ” And ( K ) He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha .
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	19	Now Elisha said to them , “ This is not the way , nor is this the city . Follow me , and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. ” But he led them to Samaria .
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	20	So it was , when they had come to Samaria , that Elisha said , “ Lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see. ” And the Lord opened their eyes , and they saw ; and there they were , inside Samaria !
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	21	Now when the king of Israel saw them , he said to Elisha , “ My ( L ) father , shall I kill them ? Shall I kill them ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	22	But he answered , “ You shall not kill them . Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow ? ( M ) Set food and water before them , that they may eat and drink and go to their master. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	23	Then he prepared a great feast for them ; and after they ate and drank , he sent them away and they went to their master . So ( N ) the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel . Syria Besieges Samaria in Famine
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	24	And it happened after this that ( O ) Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army , and went up and besieged Samaria .
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	25	And there was a great ( P ) famine in Samaria ; and indeed they besieged it until a donkey ’ s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver , and one-fourth of a [ a ] kab of dove droppings for five shekels of silver .
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	26	Then , as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall , a woman cried out to him , saying , “ Help , my lord , O king ! ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	27	And he said , “ If the Lord does not help you , where can I find help for you ? From the threshing floor or from the winepress ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	28	Then the king said to her , “ What is troubling you ? ” And she answered , “ This woman said to me , ‘ Give your son , that we may eat him today , and we will eat my son tomorrow. ’
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	29	So ( Q ) we boiled my son , and ate him . And I said to her on the next day , ‘ Give your son , that we may eat him ’ ; but she has hidden her son. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	30	Now it happened , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he ( R ) tore his clothes ; and as he passed by on the wall , the people looked , and there underneath he had sackcloth on his body .
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	31	Then he said , ( S ) “ God do so to me and more also , if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today ! ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	32	But Elisha was sitting in his house , and ( T ) the elders were sitting with him . And the king sent a man ahead of him , but before the messenger came to him , he said to the elders , ( U ) “ Do you see how this son of ( V ) a murderer has sent someone to take away my head ? Look , when the messenger comes , shut the door , and hold him fast at the door . Is not the sound of his master ’ s feet behind him ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	6	33	And while he was still talking with them , there was the messenger , coming down to him ; and then the king said , “ Surely this calamity is from the Lord ; ( W ) why should I wait for the Lord any longer ? ” Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	7	7	Therefore they ( H ) arose and fled at twilight , and left the camp intact—their tents , their horses , and their donkeys—and they fled for their lives .
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	3	Now there were four leprous men ( D ) at the entrance of the gate ; and they said to one another , “ Why are we sitting here until we die ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	4	If we say , ‘ We will enter the city , ’ the famine is in the city , and we shall die there . And if we sit here , we die also . Now therefore , come , let us surrender to the ( E ) army of the Syrians . If they keep us alive , we shall live ; and if they kill us , we shall only die. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	5	And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians ; and when they had come to the outskirts of the Syrian camp , to their surprise no one was there .
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	6	For the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians ( F ) to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses—the noise of a great army ; so they said to one another , “ Look , the king of Israel has hired against us ( G ) the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us ! ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	8	gallons -
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	9	Then they said to one another , “ We are not doing right . This day is a day of good news , and we remain silent . If we wait until morning light , some [ b ] punishment will come upon us . Now therefore , come , let us go and tell the king ’ s household. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	10	So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city , and told them , saying , “ We went to the Syrian camp , and surprisingly no one was there , not a human sound—only horses and donkeys tied , and the tents intact. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	11	And the gatekeepers called out , and they told it to the king ’ s household inside .
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	12	So the king arose in the night and said to his servants , “ Let me now tell you what the Syrians have done to us . They know that we are ( I ) hungry ; therefore they have gone out of the camp to [ c ] hide themselves in the field , saying , ‘ When they come out of the city , we shall catch them alive , and get into the city. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	13	And one of his servants answered and said , “ Please , let several men take five of the remaining horses which are left in the city . Look , they may either become like all the multitude of Israel that are left in it ; or indeed , I say , they may become like all the multitude of Israel left from those who are consumed ; so let us send them and see. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	14	Therefore they took two chariots with horses ; and the king sent them in the direction of the Syrian army , saying , “ Go and see. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	15	And they went after them to the Jordan ; and indeed all the road was full of garments and weapons which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste . So the messengers returned and told the king .
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	16	Then the people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians . So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two seahs of barley for a shekel , ( J ) according to the word of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	17	Now the king had appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate . But the people trampled him in the gate , and he died , just ( K ) as the man of God had said , who spoke when the king came down to him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	18	So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king , saying , ( L ) “ Two seahs of barley for a shekel , and a seah of fine flour for a shekel , shall be sold tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	19	Then that officer had answered the man of God , and said , “ Now look , if the Lord would make windows in heaven , could such a thing be ? ” And he had said , “ In fact , you shall see it with your eyes , but you shall not eat of it. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	7	20	And so it happened to him , for the people trampled him in the gate , and he died . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	8	3	It came to pass , at the end of seven years , that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines ; and she went to make an appeal to the king for her house and for her land .
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	4	Then the king talked with ( D ) Gehazi , the servant of the man of God , saying , “ Tell me , please , all the great things Elisha has done. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	5	Now it happened , as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life , that there was the woman whose son he had ( E ) restored to life , appealing to the king for her house and for her land . And Gehazi said , “ My lord , O king , this is the woman , and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	6	And when the king asked the woman , she told him . So the king appointed a certain officer for her , saying , “ Restore all that was hers , and all the proceeds of the field from the day that she left the land until now. ” Death of Ben-Hadad
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	7	Then Elisha went to Damascus , and ( F ) Ben-Hadad king of Syria was sick ; and it was told him , saying , “ The man of God has come here. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	9	So ( J ) Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him , of every good thing of Damascus , forty camel-loads ; and he came and stood before him , and said , “ Your son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has sent me to you , saying , ‘ Shall I recover from this disease ? ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	10	And Elisha said to him , “ Go , say to him , ‘ You shall certainly recover. ’ However the Lord has shown me that ( K ) he will really die. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	11	Then he [ a ] set his countenance in a stare until he was ashamed ; and the man of God ( L ) wept .
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	12	And Hazael said , “ Why is my lord weeping ? ” He answered , “ Because I know ( M ) the evil that you will do to the children of Israel : Their strongholds you will set on fire , and their young men you will kill with the sword ; and you ( N ) will dash their children , and rip open their women with child. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	13	So Hazael said , “ But what ( O ) is your servant—a dog , that he should do this gross thing ? ” And Elisha answered , ( P ) “ The Lord has shown me that you will become king over Syria. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	14	Then he departed from Elisha , and came to his master , who said to him , “ What did Elisha say to you ? ” And he answered , “ He told me you would surely recover. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	15	But it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water , and spread it over his face so that he died ; and Hazael reigned in his place . Jehoram Reigns in Judah ( Q )

NKJV	2%20Kings	8	18	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , just as the house of Ahab had done , for ( U ) the daughter of Ahab was his wife ; and he did evil in the sight of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	19	Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah , for the sake of His servant David , ( V ) as He promised him to give a lamp to him and his sons forever .
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	20	In his days ( W ) Edom revolted against Judah ’ s authority , ( X ) and made a king over themselves .
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	21	So [ c ] Joram went to Zair , and all his chariots with him . Then he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots ; and the troops fled to their tents .
NKJV	2%20Kings	8	22	Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah ’ s authority to this day . ( Y ) And Libnah revolted at that time .

NKJV	2%20Kings	9	3	Then ( E ) take the flask of oil , and pour it on his head , and say , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ I have anointed you king over Israel. ” ’ Then open the door and flee , and do not delay. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	4	So the young man , the servant of the prophet , went to Ramoth Gilead .
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	5	And when he arrived , there were the captains of the army sitting ; and he said , “ I have a message for you , Commander. ” Jehu said , “ For which one of us ? ” And he said , “ For you , Commander. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	6	Then he arose and went into the house . And he poured the oil on his head , and said to him , ( F ) “ Thus says the Lord God of Israel : ‘ I have anointed you king over the people of the Lord , over Israel .
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	7	You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master , that I may ( G ) avenge the blood of My servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , ( H ) at the hand of Jezebel .

NKJV	2%20Kings	9	12	And they said , “ A lie ! Tell us now. ” So he said , “ Thus and thus he spoke to me , saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ I have anointed you king over Israel. ” ’ ”

NKJV	2%20Kings	9	16	So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel , for Joram was laid up there ; ( S ) and Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram .
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	17	Now a watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel , and he saw the company of Jehu as he came , and said , “ I see a company of men. ” And Joram said , “ Get a horseman and send him to meet them , and let him say , [ d ] ‘ Is it peace ? ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	18	So the horseman went to meet him , and said , “ Thus says the king : ‘ Is it peace ? ’ ” And Jehu said , “ What have you to do with peace ? [ e ] Turn around and follow me. ” So the watchman reported , saying , “ The messenger went to them , but is not coming back. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	19	Then he sent out a second horseman who came to them , and said , “ Thus says the king : ‘ Is it peace ? ’ ” And Jehu answered , “ What have you to do with peace ? Turn around and follow me. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	20	So the watchman reported , saying , “ He went up to them and is not coming back ; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi , for he drives furiously ! ”

NKJV	2%20Kings	9	25	Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain , “ Pick him up , and throw him into the tract of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite ; for remember , when you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father , that ( V ) the Lord laid this ( W ) burden upon him :
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	26	‘ Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons , ’ says the Lord , ( X ) ‘ and I will repay you [ i ] in this plot , ’ says the Lord . Now therefore , take and throw him on the plot of ground , according to the word of the Lord. ” Ahaziah of Judah Killed ( Y )
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	27	But when Ahaziah king of Judah saw this , he fled by the road to [ j ] Beth Haggan . So Jehu pursued him , and said , [ k ] “ Shoot him also in the chariot. ” And they shot him at the Ascent of Gur , which is by Ibleam . Then he fled to ( Z ) Megiddo , and died there .
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	28	And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem , and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David .
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	29	In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab , Ahaziah had become king over Judah . Jezebel ’ s Violent Death
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	30	Now when Jehu had come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; ( AA ) and she put paint on her eyes and adorned her head , and looked through a window .
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	31	Then , as Jehu entered at the gate , she said , ( AB ) “ Is it peace , Zimri , murderer of your master ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	32	And he looked up at the window , and said , “ Who is on my side ? Who ? ” So two or three eunuchs looked out at him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	33	Then he said , “ Throw her down. ” So they threw her down , and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses ; and he trampled her underfoot .
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	34	And when he had gone in , he ate and drank . Then he said , “ Go now , see to this accursed woman , and bury her , for ( AC ) she was a king ’ s daughter. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	35	So they went to bury her , but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands .
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	36	Therefore they came back and told him . And he said , “ This is the word of the Lord , which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite , saying , ( AD ) ‘ On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel ;
NKJV	2%20Kings	9	37	and the corpse of Jezebel shall be ( AE ) as refuse on the surface of the field , in the plot at Jezreel , so that they shall not say , “ Here lies Jezebel. ” ’ ” Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	10	3	choose the [ c ] best qualified of your master ’ s sons , set him on his father ’ s throne , and fight for your master ’ s house .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	4	But they were exceedingly afraid , and said , “ Look , ( A ) two kings could not [ d ] stand up to him ; how then can we stand ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	5	And he who was in charge of the house , and he who was in charge of the city , the elders also , and those who reared the sons , sent to Jehu , saying , “ We are your servants , we will do all you tell us ; but we will not make anyone king . Do what is good in your sight. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	6	Then he wrote a second letter to them , saying : If you are for me and will obey my voice , take the heads of the men , your master ’ s sons , and come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow . Now the king ’ s sons , seventy persons , were with the great men of the city , who were rearing them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	7	So it was , when the letter came to them , that they took the king ’ s sons and ( B ) slaughtered seventy persons , put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	8	Then a messenger came and told him , saying , “ They have brought the heads of the king ’ s sons. ” And he said , “ Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	9	So it was , in the morning , that he went out and stood , and said to all the people , “ You are righteous . Indeed ( C ) I conspired against my master and killed him ; but who killed all these ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	11	So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , and all his great men and his close acquaintances and his priests , until he left him none remaining . Ahaziah ’ s Forty-two Brothers Killed
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	12	And he arose and departed and went to Samaria . On the way , at [ e ] Beth Eked of the Shepherds ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	13	( F ) Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah , and said , “ Who are you ? ” So they answered , “ We are the brothers of Ahaziah ; we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	14	And he said , “ Take them alive ! ” So they took them alive , and ( G ) killed them at the well of [ f ] Beth Eked , forty-two men ; and he left none of them . The Rest of Ahab ’ s Family Killed
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	15	Now when he departed from there , he [ g ] met ( H ) Jehonadab the son of ( I ) Rechab , coming to meet him ; and he greeted him and said to him , “ Is your heart right , as my heart is toward your heart ? ” And Jehonadab answered , “ It is. ” Jehu said , “ If it is , ( J ) give me your hand. ” So he gave him his hand , and he took him up to him into the chariot .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	16	Then he said , “ Come with me , and see my ( K ) zeal for the Lord. ” So they had him ride in his chariot .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	17	And when he came to Samaria , ( L ) he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria , till he had destroyed them , according to the word of the Lord ( M ) which He spoke to Elijah . Worshipers of Baal Killed
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	18	Then Jehu gathered all the people together , and said to them , ( N ) “ Ahab served Baal a little , Jehu will serve him much .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	19	Now therefore , call to me all the ( O ) prophets of Baal , all his servants , and all his priests . Let no one be missing , for I have a great sacrifice for Baal . Whoever is missing shall not live. ” But Jehu acted deceptively , with the intent of destroying the worshipers of Baal .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	20	And Jehu said , [ h ] “ Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. ” So they proclaimed it .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	21	Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel ; and all the worshipers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left who did not come . So they came into the [ i ] temple of Baal , and the ( P ) temple of Baal was full from one end to the other .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	22	And he said to the one in charge of the wardrobe , “ Bring out vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. ” So he brought out vestments for them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the temple of Baal , and said to the worshipers of Baal , “ Search and see that no servants of the Lord are here with you , but only the worshipers of Baal. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	24	So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings . Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men on the outside , and had said , “ If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escapes , whoever lets him escape , it shall be ( Q ) his life for the life of the other. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	25	Now it happened , as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains , “ Go in and kill them ; let no one come out ! ” And they killed them with the edge of the sword ; then the guards and the officers threw them out , and went into the [ j ] inner room of the temple of Baal .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	26	And they brought the ( R ) sacred pillars out of the temple of Baal and burned them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	27	Then they broke down the sacred pillar of Baal , and tore down the [ k ] temple of Baal and ( S ) made it a refuse dump to this day .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	28	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal from Israel .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	29	However Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who had made Israel sin , that is , from ( T ) the golden calves that were at Bethel and Dan .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	30	And the Lord ( U ) said to Jehu , “ Because you have done well in doing what is right in My sight , and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart , ( V ) your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	31	But Jehu [ l ] took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart ; for he did not depart from ( W ) the sins of Jeroboam , who had made Israel sin . Death of Jehu
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	32	In those days the Lord began to cut off parts of Israel ; and ( X ) Hazael conquered them in all the territory of Israel
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	33	from the Jordan eastward : all the land of Gilead—Gad , Reuben , and Manasseh—from ( Y ) Aroer , which is by the River Arnon , including ( Z ) Gilead and Bashan .
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu , all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	10	35	So Jehu [ m ] rested with his fathers , and they buried him in Samaria . Then ( AA ) Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place .

NKJV	2%20Kings	11	3	So he was hidden with her in the house of the Lord for six years , while Athaliah reigned over the land . Joash Crowned King of Judah ( F )
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	4	In ( G ) the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds—of the bodyguards and the [ c ] escorts—and brought them into the house of the Lord to him . And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of the Lord , and showed them the king ’ s son .
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	5	Then he commanded them , saying , “ This is what you shall do : One-third of you who [ d ] come on duty ( H ) on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the king ’ s house ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	6	one-third shall be at the gate of Sur , and one-third at the gate behind the escorts . You shall keep the watch of the house , lest it be broken down .
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	7	The two [ e ] contingents of you who go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord for the king .
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	8	But you shall surround the king on all sides , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and whoever comes within range , let him be put to death . You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	9	( I ) So the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded . Each of them took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath , with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest .
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	10	And the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to King David , ( J ) that were in the temple of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	12	And he brought out the king ’ s son , put the crown on him , and gave him the ( K ) Testimony ; [ g ] they made him king and anointed him , and they clapped their hands and said , ( L ) “ Long live the king ! ” Death of Athaliah ( M )
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	13	( N ) Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the escorts and the people , she came to the people in the temple of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	14	When she looked , there was the king standing by ( O ) a pillar according to custom ; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king . All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets . So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	15	And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds , the officers of the army , and said to them , “ Take her outside [ h ] under guard , and slay with the sword whoever follows her. ” For the priest had said , “ Do not let her be killed in the house of the Lord. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	16	So they seized her ; and she went by way of the horses ’ entrance into the king ’ s house , and there she was killed .
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	17	( P ) Then Jehoiada ( Q ) made a covenant between the Lord , the king , and the people , that they should be the Lord ’ s people , and also ( R ) between the king and the people .
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	18	And all the people of the land went to the ( S ) temple of Baal , and tore it down . They thoroughly ( T ) broke in pieces its altars and [ i ] images , and ( U ) killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . And ( V ) the priest appointed [ j ] officers over the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	19	Then he took the captains of hundreds , the bodyguards , the escorts , and all the people of the land ; and they brought the king down from the house of the Lord , and went by way of the gate of the escorts to the king ’ s house . Then he sat on the throne of the kings .
NKJV	2%20Kings	11	20	So all the people of the land rejoiced ; and the city was quiet , for they had slain Athaliah with the sword in the king ’ s house .

NKJV	2%20Kings	12	3	But ( D ) the [ b ] high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places .
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	4	And Jehoash said to the priests , ( E ) “ All the money of the dedicated gifts that are brought into the house of the Lord—each man ’ s ( F ) census [ c ] money , each man ’ s ( G ) assessment money—and all the money that [ d ] a man ( H ) purposes in his heart to bring into the house of the Lord ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	5	let the priests take it themselves , each from his constituency ; and let them repair the [ e ] damages of the temple , wherever any dilapidation is found. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	6	Now it was so , by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash , ( I ) that the priests had not repaired the damages of the temple .
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	7	( J ) So King Jehoash called Jehoiada the priest and the other priests , and said to them , “ Why have you not repaired the damages of the temple ? Now therefore , do not take more money from your constituency , but deliver it for repairing the damages of the temple. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	8	And the priests agreed that they would neither receive more money from the people , nor repair the damages of the temple .
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	9	Then Jehoiada the priest took ( K ) a chest , bored a hole in its lid , and set it beside the altar , on the right side as one comes into the house of the Lord ; and the priests who [ f ] kept the door put ( L ) there all the money brought into the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	10	So it was , whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king ’ s ( M ) scribe [ g ] and the high priest came up and [ h ] put it in bags , and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	11	Then they gave the money , which had been apportioned , into the hands of those who did the work , who had the oversight of the house of the Lord ; and they [ i ] paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the house of the Lord ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	13	However ( O ) there were not made for the house of the Lord basins of silver , trimmers , sprinkling-bowls , trumpets , any articles of gold or articles of silver , from the money brought into the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	14	But they gave that to the workmen , and they repaired the house of the Lord with it .
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	15	Moreover ( P ) they did not require an account from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to be paid to workmen , for they dealt faithfully .
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	16	( Q ) The money from the trespass offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the Lord . ( R ) It belonged to the priests . Hazael Threatens Jerusalem
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	17	( S ) Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath , and took it ; then ( T ) Hazael set his face to [ j ] go up to Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Kings	12	18	And Jehoash king of Judah ( U ) took all the sacred things that his fathers , Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah , kings of Judah , had dedicated , and his own sacred things , and all the gold found in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and in the king ’ s house , and sent them to Hazael king of Syria .

NKJV	2%20Kings	13	3	Then ( D ) the anger of the Lord was aroused against Israel , and He delivered them into the hand of ( E ) Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of ( F ) Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael , all their days .
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	4	So Jehoahaz ( G ) pleaded with the Lord , and the Lord listened to him ; for ( H ) He saw the oppression of Israel , because the king of Syria oppressed them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	5	( I ) Then the Lord gave Israel a deliverer , so that they escaped from under the hand of the Syrians ; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before .
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	6	Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , who had made Israel sin , but walked in them ; ( J ) and the [ c ] wooden image also remained in Samaria .
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	7	For He left of the army of Jehoahaz only fifty horsemen , ten chariots , and ten thousand foot soldiers ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them ( K ) and made them ( L ) like the dust at threshing .

NKJV	2%20Kings	13	14	Elisha had become sick with the illness of which he would die . Then Joash the king of Israel came down to him , and wept over his face , and said , “ O my father , my father , ( Q ) the chariots of Israel and their horsemen ! ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	15	And Elisha said to him , “ Take a bow and some arrows. ” So he took himself a bow and some arrows .
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	16	Then he said to the king of Israel , “ Put your hand on the bow. ” So he put his hand on it , and Elisha put his hands on the king ’ s hands .
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	17	And he said , “ Open the east window ” ; and he opened it . Then Elisha said , “ Shoot ” ; and he shot . And he said , “ The arrow of the Lord ’ s deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria ; for you must strike the Syrians at ( R ) Aphek till you have destroyed them. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	18	Then he said , “ Take the arrows ” ; so he took them . And he said to the king of Israel , “ Strike the ground ” ; so he struck three times , and stopped .
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	19	And the man of God was angry with him , and said , “ You should have struck five or six times ; then you would have struck Syria till you had destroyed it ! ( S ) But now you will strike Syria only three times. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	20	Then Elisha [ h ] died , and they buried him . And the ( T ) raiding bands from Moab invaded the land in the spring of the year .
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	21	So it was , as they were burying a man , that suddenly they spied a band of raiders ; and they put the man in the tomb of Elisha ; and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha , he revived and stood on his feet . Israel Recaptures Cities from Syria
NKJV	2%20Kings	13	22	And ( U ) Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz .

NKJV	2%20Kings	14	4	( E ) However the [ a ] high places were not taken away , and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places .
NKJV	2%20Kings	14	5	Now it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand , that he executed his servants ( F ) who had murdered his father the king .
NKJV	2%20Kings	14	6	But the children of the murderers he did not execute , according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses , in which the Lord commanded , saying , ( G ) “ Fathers shall not be put to death for their children , nor shall children be put to death for their fathers ; but a person shall be put to death for his own sin. ”

NKJV	2%20Kings	16	16	Thus did Urijah the priest , according to all that King Ahaz commanded .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	3	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel ; indeed ( B ) he made his son pass through the fire , according to the ( C ) abominations of the nations whom the Lord had cast out from before the children of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	4	And he sacrificed and burned incense on the ( D ) high places , ( E ) on the hills , and under every green tree .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	5	( F ) Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , came up to Jerusalem to make war ; and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	6	At that time Rezin king of Syria ( G ) captured [ a ] Elath for Syria , and drove the men of Judah from Elath . Then the [ b ] Edomites went to Elath , and dwell there to this day .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	7	So Ahaz sent messengers to ( H ) Tiglath-Pileser [ c ] king of Assyria , saying , “ I am your servant and your son . Come up and save me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel , who rise up against me. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	8	And Ahaz ( I ) took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasuries of the king ’ s house , and sent it as a present to the king of Assyria .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	9	So the king of Assyria heeded him ; for the king of Assyria went up against ( J ) Damascus and ( K ) took it , carried its people captive to ( L ) Kir , and killed Rezin .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	10	Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria , and saw an altar that was at Damascus ; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the design of the altar and its pattern , according to all its workmanship .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	11	Then ( M ) Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus . So Urijah the priest made it before King Ahaz came back from Damascus .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	12	And when the king came back from Damascus , the king saw the altar ; and ( N ) the king approached the altar and made offerings on it .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	13	So he burned his burnt offering and his grain offering ; and he poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	14	He also brought ( O ) the bronze altar which was before the Lord , from the front of the [ d ] temple—from between the new altar and the house of the Lord—and put it on the north side of the new altar .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	15	Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest , saying , “ On the great new altar burn ( P ) the morning burnt offering , the evening grain offering , the king ’ s burnt sacrifice , and his grain offering , with the burnt offering of all the people of the land , their grain offering , and their drink offerings ; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice . And the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	17	( Q ) And King Ahaz cut off ( R ) the panels of the carts , and removed the lavers from them ; and he took down ( S ) the Sea from the bronze oxen that were under it , and put it on a pavement of stones .
NKJV	2%20Kings	16	18	Also he removed the Sabbath pavilion which they had built in the temple , and he removed the king ’ s outer entrance from the house of the Lord , on account of the king of Assyria .

NKJV	2%20Kings	17	17	( AF ) And they caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire , ( AG ) practiced witchcraft and soothsaying , and ( AH ) sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke Him to anger .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	3	( B ) Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him ; and Hoshea ( C ) became his vassal , and paid him tribute money .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	4	And the king of Assyria uncovered a conspiracy by Hoshea ; for he had sent messengers to So , king of Egypt , and brought no tribute to the king of Assyria , as he had done year by year . Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up , and bound him in prison . Israel Carried Captive to Assyria ( D )
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	5	Now ( E ) the king of Assyria went throughout all the land , and went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	6	( F ) In the ninth year of Hoshea , the king of Assyria took Samaria and ( G ) carried Israel away to Assyria , ( H ) and placed them in Halah and by the Habor , the River of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	7	For ( I ) so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God , who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt , from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and they had ( J ) feared other gods ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	8	and ( K ) had walked in the statutes of the nations whom the Lord had cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	9	Also the children of Israel secretly did against the Lord their God things that were not right , and they built for themselves [ a ] high places in all their cities , ( L ) from watchtower to fortified city .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	10	( M ) They set up for themselves sacred pillars and ( N ) wooden images [ b ] ( O ) on every high hill and under every green tree .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	11	There they burned incense on all the high places , like the nations whom the Lord had carried away before them ; and they did wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	12	for they served idols , ( P ) of which the Lord had said to them , ( Q ) “ You shall not do this thing. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	13	Yet the Lord testified against Israel and against Judah , by all of His ( R ) prophets , ( S ) every seer , saying , ( T ) “ Turn from your evil ways , and keep My commandments and My statutes , according to all the law which I commanded your fathers , and which I sent to you by My servants the prophets. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	14	Nevertheless they would not hear , but ( U ) stiffened their necks , like the necks of their fathers , who ( V ) did not believe in the Lord their God .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	15	And they ( W ) rejected His statutes ( X ) and His covenant that He had made with their fathers , and His testimonies which He had testified against them ; they followed ( Y ) idols , ( Z ) became idolaters , and went after the nations who were all around them , concerning whom the Lord had charged them that they should ( AA ) not do like them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	16	So they left all the commandments of the Lord their God , ( AB ) made for themselves a molded image and two calves , ( AC ) made a wooden image and worshiped all the ( AD ) host of heaven , ( AE ) and served Baal .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	18	Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel , and removed them from His sight ; there was none left ( AI ) but the tribe of Judah alone .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	19	Also ( AJ ) Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God , but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	20	And the Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel , afflicted them , and ( AK ) delivered them into the hand of plunderers , until He had cast them from His ( AL ) sight .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	21	For ( AM ) He tore Israel from the house of David , and ( AN ) they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king . Then Jeroboam drove Israel from following the Lord , and made them commit a great sin .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	22	For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did ; they did not depart from them ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	23	until the Lord removed Israel out of His sight , ( AO ) as He had said by all His servants the prophets . ( AP ) So Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria , as it is to this day . Assyria Resettles Samaria
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	24	( AQ ) Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon , Cuthah , ( AR ) Ava , Hamath , and from Sepharvaim , and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel ; and they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its cities .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	25	And it was so , at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they did not fear the Lord ; therefore the Lord sent lions among them , which killed some of them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	26	So they spoke to the king of Assyria , saying , “ The nations whom you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the rituals of the God of the land ; therefore He has sent lions among them , and indeed , they are killing them because they do not know the rituals of the God of the land. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	27	Then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , “ Send there one of the priests whom you brought from there ; let him go and dwell there , and let him teach them the rituals of the God of the land. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	28	Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel , and taught them how they should fear the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	29	However every nation continued to make gods of its own , and put them ( AS ) in the shrines on the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in the cities where they dwelt .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	30	The men of ( AT ) Babylon made Succoth Benoth , the men of Cuth made Nergal , the men of Hamath made Ashima ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	31	( AU ) and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak ; and the Sepharvites ( AV ) burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	32	So they feared the Lord , ( AW ) and from every class they appointed for themselves priests of the [ c ] high places , who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	33	( AX ) They feared the Lord , yet served their own gods—according to the rituals of the nations from among whom they were carried away .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	34	To this day they continue practicing the former rituals ; they do not fear the Lord , nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances , or the law and commandment which the Lord had commanded the children of Jacob , ( AY ) whom He named Israel ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	35	with whom the Lord had made a covenant and charged them , saying : ( AZ ) “ You shall not fear other gods , nor ( BA ) bow down to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them ;
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	36	but the Lord , who ( BB ) brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and ( BC ) an outstretched arm , ( BD ) Him you shall fear , Him you shall worship , and to Him you shall offer sacrifice .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	37	And the statutes , the ordinances , the law , and the commandment which He wrote for you , ( BE ) you shall be careful to observe forever ; you shall not fear other gods .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	38	And the covenant that I have made with you , ( BF ) you shall not forget , nor shall you fear other gods .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	39	But the Lord your God you shall fear ; and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	40	However they did not obey , but they followed their former rituals .
NKJV	2%20Kings	17	41	( BG ) So these nations feared the Lord , yet served their carved images ; also their children and their children ’ s children have continued doing as their fathers did , even to this day . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	18	18	And when they had called to the king , ( Y ) Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , Shebna the [ j ] scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph , the recorder , came out to them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	3	And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father David had done .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	4	( E ) He removed the [ b ] high places and broke the sacred pillars , cut down the [ c ] wooden image and broke in pieces the ( F ) bronze serpent that Moses had made ; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it , and called it [ d ] Nehushtan .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	5	He ( G ) trusted in the Lord God of Israel , ( H ) so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor who were before him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	6	For he ( I ) held fast to the Lord ; he did not depart from following Him , but kept His commandments , which the Lord had commanded Moses .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	7	The Lord ( J ) was with him ; he ( K ) prospered wherever he went . And he ( L ) rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	8	( M ) He [ e ] subdued the Philistines , as far as Gaza and its territory , ( N ) from watchtower to fortified city .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	9	Now ( O ) it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah , king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	10	And at the end of three years they took it . In the sixth year of Hezekiah , that is , ( P ) the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	11	( Q ) Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away captive to Assyria , and put them ( R ) in Halah and by the Habor , the River of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	12	because they ( S ) did not obey the voice of the Lord their God , but transgressed His covenant and all that Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded ; and they would neither hear nor do them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	13	And ( T ) in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah , Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	14	Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish , saying , “ I have done wrong ; turn away from me ; whatever you impose on me I will pay. ” And the king of Assyria assessed Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	15	So Hezekiah ( U ) gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king ’ s house .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	16	At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave [ f ] it to the king of Assyria . Sennacherib Boasts Against the Lord ( V )
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	17	Then the king of Assyria sent the [ g ] Tartan , the [ h ] Rabsaris , and the [ i ] Rabshakeh from Lachish , with a great army against Jerusalem , to King Hezekiah . And they went up and came to Jerusalem . When they had come up , they went and stood by the ( W ) aqueduct from the upper pool , ( X ) which was on the highway to the Fuller ’ s Field .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	19	Then the Rabshakeh said to them , “ Say now to Hezekiah , ‘ Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria : ( Z ) “ What confidence is this in which you trust ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	20	You speak of having plans and power for war ; but they are [ k ] mere words . And in whom do you trust , that you rebel against me ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	21	( AA ) Now look ! You are trusting in the staff of this broken reed , Egypt , on which if a man leans , it will go into his hand and pierce it . So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him .
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	22	But if you say to me , ‘ We trust in the Lord our God , ’ is it not He ( AB ) whose [ l ] high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away , and said to Judah and Jerusalem , ‘ You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem ’ ? ” ’
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	23	Now therefore , I urge you , give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses—if you are able on your part to put riders on them !
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	24	How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master ’ s servants , and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	25	Have I now come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it ? The Lord said to me , ‘ Go up against this land , and destroy it. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	26	( AC ) Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , Shebna , and Joah said to the Rabshakeh , “ Please speak to your servants in ( AD ) Aramaic , for we understand it ; and do not speak to us in [ m ] Hebrew in the hearing of the people who are on the wall. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	27	But the Rabshakeh said to them , “ Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words , and not to the men who sit on the wall , who will eat and drink their own waste with you ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	28	Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in [ n ] Hebrew , and spoke , saying , “ Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria !
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	29	Thus says the king : ( AE ) ‘ Do not let Hezekiah deceive you , for he shall not be able to deliver you from his hand ;
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	30	nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , “ The Lord will surely deliver us ; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. ” ’
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	31	Do not listen to Hezekiah ; for thus says the king of Assyria : ‘ Make peace with me [ o ] by a present and come out to me ; and every one of you eat from his own ( AF ) vine and every one from his own fig tree , and every one of you drink the waters of his own cistern ;
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , ( AG ) a land of grain and new wine , a land of bread and vineyards , a land of olive groves and honey , that you may live and not die . But do not listen to Hezekiah , lest he persuade you , saying , “ The Lord will deliver us. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	33	( AH ) Has any of the gods of the nations at all delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	34	Where are the gods of ( AI ) Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim and Hena and ( AJ ) Ivah ? Indeed , have they delivered Samaria from my hand ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	35	Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their countries from my hand , ( AK ) that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem from my hand ? ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	36	But the people held their peace and answered him not a word ; for the king ’ s commandment was , “ Do not answer him. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	18	37	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah ( AL ) with their clothes torn , and told him the words of the Rabshakeh . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	19	19	Now therefore , O Lord our God , I pray , save us from his hand , ( Z ) that all the kingdoms of the earth may ( AA ) know that You are the Lord God , You alone. ” The Word of the Lord Concerning Sennacherib ( AB )
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	3	And they said to him , “ Thus says Hezekiah : ‘ This day is a day of trouble , and rebuke , and blasphemy ; for the children have come to birth , but there is no strength to [ a ] bring them forth .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	4	( D ) It may be that the Lord your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh , whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to ( E ) reproach the living God , and will ( F ) rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard . Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	5	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	6	( G ) And Isaiah said to them , “ Thus you shall say to your master , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ Do not be ( H ) afraid of the words which you have heard , with which the ( I ) servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	7	Surely I will send ( J ) a spirit upon him , and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. ” ’ ” Sennacherib ’ s Threat and Hezekiah ’ s Prayer ( K )
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	8	Then the Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah , for he heard that he had departed ( L ) from Lachish .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	9	And ( M ) the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , “ Look , he has come out to make war with you. ” So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	10	“ Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying : ‘ Do not let your God ( N ) in whom you trust deceive you , saying , “ Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	11	Look ! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them ; and shall you be delivered ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	12	( O ) Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed , Gozan and Haran and Rezeph , and the people of ( P ) Eden who were in Telassar ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	13	( Q ) Where is the king of Hamath , the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ? ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	14	( R ) And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it ; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	15	Then Hezekiah prayed before the Lord , and said : “ O Lord God of Israel , the One ( S ) who dwells between the cherubim , ( T ) You are God , You alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth . You have made heaven and earth .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	16	( U ) Incline Your ear , O Lord , and hear ; ( V ) open Your eyes , O Lord , and see ; and hear the words of Sennacherib , ( W ) which he has sent to reproach the living God .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	17	Truly , Lord , the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	18	and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were ( X ) not gods , but ( Y ) the work of men ’ s hands—wood and stone . Therefore they destroyed them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , “ Thus says the Lord God of Israel : ( AC ) ‘ Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria , ( AD ) I have heard. ’
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	21	This is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him : ‘ The virgin , ( AE ) the daughter of Zion , Has despised you , laughed you to scorn ; The daughter of Jerusalem ( AF ) Has shaken her head behind your back !
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	22	‘ Whom have you reproached and blasphemed ? Against whom have you raised your voice , And lifted up your eyes on high ? Against ( AG ) the Holy One of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	23	( AH ) By your messengers you have reproached the Lord , And said : ( AI ) “ By the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains , To the limits of Lebanon ; I will cut down its tall cedars And its choice cypress trees ; I will enter the extremity of its borders , To its fruitful forest .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	24	I have dug and drunk strange water , And with the soles of my feet I have ( AJ ) dried up All the brooks of defense. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	25	‘ Did you not hear long ago How ( AK ) I made it , From ancient times that I formed it ? Now I have brought it to pass , That ( AL ) you should be For crushing fortified cities into heaps of ruins .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	26	Therefore their inhabitants had little power ; They were dismayed and confounded ; They were as the grass of the field And the green herb , As ( AM ) the grass on the housetops And grain blighted before it is grown .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	27	‘ But ( AN ) I know your dwelling place , Your going out and your coming in , And your rage against Me .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	28	Because your rage against Me and your tumult Have come up to My ears , Therefore ( AO ) I will put My hook in your nose And My bridle in your lips , And I will turn you back ( AP ) By the way which you came .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	29	‘ This shall be a ( AQ ) sign to you : ‘ You shall eat this year such as grows [ b ] of itself , And in the second year what springs from the same ; Also in the third year sow and reap , Plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	30	( AR ) And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah Shall again take root downward , And bear fruit upward .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	31	For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant , And those who escape from Mount Zion . ( AS ) The zeal of the Lord [ c ] of hosts will do this. ’
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	32	“ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria : ‘ He shall ( AT ) not come into this city , Nor shoot an arrow there , Nor come before it with shield , Nor build a siege mound against it .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	33	By the way that he came , By the same shall he return ; And he shall not come into this city , ’ Says the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	34	‘ For ( AU ) I will ( AV ) defend this city , to save it For My own sake and ( AW ) for My servant David ’ s sake. ’ ” Sennacherib ’ s Defeat and Death ( AX )
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	35	And ( AY ) it came to pass on a certain night that the [ d ] angel of the Lord went out , and killed in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand ; and when people arose early in the morning , there were the corpses—all dead .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went away , returned home , and remained at ( AZ ) Nineveh .
NKJV	2%20Kings	19	37	Now it came to pass , as he was worshiping in the temple of Nisroch his god , that his sons ( BA ) Adrammelech and Sharezer ( BB ) struck him down with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . Then ( BC ) Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	20	20	( V ) Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah—all his might , and how he ( W ) made a ( X ) pool and a [ g ] tunnel and ( Y ) brought water into the city—are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	3	( C ) “ Remember now , O Lord , I pray , how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart , and have done what was good in Your sight. ” And Hezekiah wept bitterly .
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	4	And it happened , before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court , that the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	5	“ Return and tell Hezekiah ( D ) the leader of My people , ‘ Thus says the Lord , the God of David your father : ( E ) “ I have heard your prayer , I have seen ( F ) your tears ; surely I will heal you . On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	6	And I will add to your days fifteen years . I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria ; and ( G ) I will defend this city for My own sake , and for the sake of My servant David. ” ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	7	Then ( H ) Isaiah said , “ Take a lump of figs. ” So they took and laid it on the boil , and he recovered .
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	8	And Hezekiah said to Isaiah , ( I ) “ What is the sign that the Lord will heal me , and that I shall go up to the house of the Lord the third day ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	9	Then Isaiah said , ( J ) “ This is the sign to you from the Lord , that the Lord will do the thing which He has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go backward ten degrees ? ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	10	And Hezekiah answered , “ It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten [ a ] degrees ; no , but let the shadow go backward ten degrees. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	11	So Isaiah the prophet cried out to the Lord , and ( K ) He brought the shadow ten [ b ] degrees backward , by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz . The Babylonian Envoys ( L )
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	12	( M ) At that time [ c ] Berodach-Baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah , for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	13	And ( N ) Hezekiah was attentive to them , and showed them all the house of his treasures—the silver and gold , the spices and precious ointment , and [ d ] all [ e ] his armory—all that was found among his treasures . There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	14	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah , and said to him , “ What did these men say , and from where did they come to you ? ” So Hezekiah said , “ They came from a far country , from Babylon. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	15	And he said , “ What have they seen in your house ? ” So Hezekiah answered , ( O ) “ They have seen all that is in my house ; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Hear the word of the Lord :
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	17	‘ Behold , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and what your fathers have accumulated until this day , ( P ) shall be carried to Babylon ; nothing shall be left , ’ says the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	18	‘ And ( Q ) they shall take away some of your sons who will [ f ] descend from you , whom you will beget ; ( R ) and they shall be ( S ) eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	20	19	So Hezekiah said to Isaiah , ( T ) “ The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good ! ” For he said , “ Will there not be peace and truth at least in my days ? ” Death of Hezekiah ( U )

NKJV	2%20Kings	21	21	So he walked in all the ways that his father had walked ; and he served the idols that his father had served , and worshiped them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	3	For he rebuilt the [ a ] high places ( D ) which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; he raised up altars for Baal , and made a [ b ] wooden image , ( E ) as Ahab king of Israel had done ; and he ( F ) worshiped all [ c ] the host of heaven and served them .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	4	( G ) He also built altars in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord had said , ( H ) “ In Jerusalem I will put My name. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the ( I ) two courts of the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	6	( J ) Also he made his son pass through the fire , practiced ( K ) soothsaying , used witchcraft , and consulted spiritists and mediums . He did much evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke Him to anger .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	7	He even set a carved image of [ d ] Asherah that he had made , in the [ e ] house of which the Lord had said to David and to Solomon his son , ( L ) “ In this house and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , I will put My name forever ;
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	8	( M ) and I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers—only if they are careful to do according to all that I have commanded them , and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	9	But they paid no attention , and Manasseh ( N ) seduced them to do more evil than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	10	And the Lord spoke ( O ) by His servants the prophets , saying ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	11	( P ) “ Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations ( ( Q ) he has acted more wickedly than all the ( R ) Amorites who were before him , and ( S ) has also made Judah sin with his idols ) ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	12	therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel : ‘ Behold , I am bringing such calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah , that whoever hears of it , both ( T ) his ears will tingle .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem ( U ) the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab ; ( V ) I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish , wiping it and turning it upside down .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	14	So I will forsake the ( W ) remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become victims of plunder to all their enemies ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	15	because they have done evil in My sight , and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt , even to this day. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	16	( X ) Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood , till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another , besides his sin by which he made Judah sin , in doing evil in the sight of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	17	Now ( Y ) the rest of the acts of ( Z ) Manasseh—all that he did , and the sin that he committed—are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	18	So ( AA ) Manasseh [ f ] rested with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza . Then his son Amon reigned in his place . Amon ’ s Reign and Death ( AB )
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	19	( AC ) Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	20	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord , ( AD ) as his father Manasseh had done .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	22	He ( AE ) forsook the Lord God of his fathers , and did not walk in the way of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	23	( AF ) Then the servants of Amon ( AG ) conspired against him , and killed the king in his own house .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	24	But the people of the land ( AH ) executed all those who had conspired against King Amon . Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place .
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
NKJV	2%20Kings	21	26	And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza . Then Josiah his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	22	22	Josiah ( B ) was eight years old when he became king , and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of ( C ) Bozkath .
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	3	( F ) Now it came to pass , in the eighteenth year of King Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan the scribe , the son of Azaliah , the son of Meshullam , to the house of the Lord , saying :
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	4	“ Go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may count the money which has been ( G ) brought into the house of the Lord , which ( H ) the doorkeepers have gathered from the people .
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	5	And let them ( I ) deliver it into the hand of those doing the work , who are the overseers in the house of the Lord ; let them give it to those who are in the house of the Lord doing the work , to repair the damages of the house—
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	6	to carpenters and builders and masons—and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house .
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	7	However ( J ) there need be no accounting made with them of the money delivered into their hand , because they deal faithfully. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	8	Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe , ( K ) “ I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord. ” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	9	So Shaphan the scribe went to the king , bringing the king word , saying , “ Your servants have [ a ] gathered the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of those who do the work , who oversee the house of the Lord. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	10	Then Shaphan the scribe showed the king , saying , “ Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. ” And Shaphan read it before the king .
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	11	Now it happened , when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law , that he tore his clothes .
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	12	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , ( L ) Ahikam the son of Shaphan , [ b ] Achbor the son of Michaiah , Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king , saying ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	13	“ Go , inquire of the Lord for me , for the people and for all Judah , concerning the words of this book that has been found ; for great is ( M ) the wrath of the Lord that is aroused against us , because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book , to do according to all that is written concerning us. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	14	So Hilkiah the priest , Ahikam , Achbor , Shaphan , and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of ( N ) Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe . ( She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter . ) And they spoke with her .
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	15	Then she said to them , “ Thus says the Lord God of Israel , ‘ Tell the man who sent you to Me ,
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	16	“ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Behold , ( O ) I will bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants—all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read—
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	17	( P ) because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods , that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands . Therefore My wrath shall be aroused against this place and shall not be quenched. ’ ” ’
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	18	But as for ( Q ) the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of the Lord , in this manner you shall speak to him , ‘ Thus says the Lord God of Israel : “ Concerning the words which you have heard—
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	19	because your ( R ) heart was tender , and you ( S ) humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants , that they would become ( T ) a desolation and ( U ) a curse , and you tore your clothes and wept before Me , I also have heard you , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	22	20	“ Surely , therefore , I will [ c ] gather you to your fathers , and you ( V ) shall [ d ] be gathered to your grave in peace ; and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I will bring on this place. ” ’ ” So they brought back word to the king . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Kings	23	2	Kings 23:34 Jehoahaz Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was held before the Lord in Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	3	Then the king ( E ) stood by a pillar and made a ( F ) covenant before the Lord , to follow the Lord and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes , with all his heart and all his soul , to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book . And all the people took a stand for the covenant .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	4	And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest , the ( G ) priests of the second order , and the doorkeepers , to bring ( H ) out of the temple of the Lord all the articles that were made for Baal , for [ a ] Asherah , and for all [ b ] the host of heaven ; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron , and carried their ashes to Bethel .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	5	Then he removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem , and those who burned incense to Baal , to the sun , to the moon , to the [ c ] constellations , and to ( I ) all the host of heaven .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	6	And he brought out the ( J ) wooden [ d ] image from the house of the Lord , to the Brook Kidron outside Jerusalem , burned it at the Brook Kidron and ground it to ( K ) ashes , and threw its ashes on ( L ) the graves of the common people .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	7	Then he tore down the ritual [ e ] booths ( M ) of the [ f ] perverted persons that were in the house of the Lord , ( N ) where the ( O ) women wove hangings for the wooden image .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	8	And he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah , and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense , from ( P ) Geba to Beersheba ; also he broke down the high places at the gates which were at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua the governor of the city , which were to the left of the city gate .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	9	( Q ) Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem , ( R ) but they ate unleavened bread among their brethren .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	10	And he defiled ( S ) Topheth , which is in ( T ) the Valley of the [ g ] Son of Hinnom , ( U ) that no man might make his son or his daughter ( V ) pass through the fire to Molech .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	11	Then he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had [ h ] dedicated to the sun , at the entrance to the house of the Lord , by the chamber of Nathan-Melech , the officer who was in the court ; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	12	The altars that were ( W ) on the roof , the upper chamber of Ahaz , which the kings of Judah had made , and the altars which ( X ) Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , the king broke down and pulverized there , and threw their dust into the Brook Kidron .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	13	Then the king defiled the [ i ] high places that were east of Jerusalem , which were on the [ j ] south of [ k ] the Mount of Corruption , which ( Y ) Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians , for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites , and for Milcom the abomination of the people of Ammon .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	14	And he ( Z ) broke in pieces the sacred pillars and cut down the wooden images , and filled their places with the bones of men .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	15	Moreover the altar that was at Bethel , and the [ l ] high place ( AA ) which Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel sin , had made , both that altar and the high place he broke down ; and he burned the high place and crushed it to powder , and burned the wooden image .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	16	As Josiah turned , he saw the tombs that were there on the mountain . And he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar , and defiled it according to the ( AB ) word of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these words .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	17	Then he said , “ What gravestone is this that I see ? ” So the men of the city told him , “ It is ( AC ) the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	18	And he said , “ Let him alone ; let no one move his bones. ” So they let his bones alone , with the bones of ( AD ) the prophet who came from Samaria .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	19	Now Josiah also took away all the [ m ] shrines of the [ n ] high places that were ( AE ) in the cities of Samaria , which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [ o ] the Lord to anger ; and he did to them according to all the deeds he had done in Bethel .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	20	( AF ) He ( AG ) executed all the priests of the [ p ] high places who were there , on the altars , and ( AH ) burned men ’ s bones on them ; and he returned to Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	21	Then the king commanded all the people , saying , ( AI ) “ Keep the Passover to the Lord your God , ( AJ ) as it is written in this Book of the Covenant. ”
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	22	( AK ) Such a Passover surely had never been held since the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	24	Moreover Josiah put away those who consulted mediums and spiritists , the household gods and idols , all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem , that he might perform the words of ( AL ) the law which were written in the book ( AM ) that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	25	( AN ) Now before him there was no king like him , who turned to the Lord with all his heart , with all his soul , and with all his might , according to all the Law of Moses ; nor after him did any arise like him . Impending Judgment on Judah
NKJV	2%20Kings	23	26	Nevertheless the Lord did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath , with which His anger was aroused against Judah , ( AO ) because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him .

NKJV	1%20Chronicles	19	3	And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun , [ a ] “ Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you ? Did his servants not come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land ? ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	19	4	Therefore Hanun took David ’ s servants , shaved them , and cut off their garments [ b ] in the middle , at their ( C ) buttocks , and sent them away .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	19	5	Then some went and told David about the men ; and he sent to meet them , because the men were greatly ashamed . And the king said , “ Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown , and then return. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	19	6	When the people of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David , Hanun and the people of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from [ c ] Mesopotamia , from Syrian Maacah , ( D ) and from [ d ] Zobah .

NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	21	So David came to Ornan , and Ornan looked and saw David . And he went out from the threshing floor , and bowed before David with his face to the ground .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	2	Sam . 24:16 , 18–24 -
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	3	And Joab answered , “ May the Lord make His people a hundred times more than they are . But , my lord the king , are they not all my lord ’ s servants ? Why then does my lord require this thing ? Why should he be a cause of guilt in Israel ? ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	4	Nevertheless the king ’ s word prevailed against Joab . Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	5	Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David . All Israel had one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword , and Judah had four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	6	( D ) But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them , for the king ’ s [ b ] word was abominable to Joab .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	7	And [ c ] God was displeased with this thing ; therefore He struck Israel .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	8	So David said to God , ( E ) “ I have sinned greatly , because I have done this thing ; ( F ) but now , I pray , take away the iniquity of Your servant , for I have done very foolishly. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	9	Then the Lord spoke to Gad , David ’ s ( G ) seer , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	10	“ Go and tell David , ( H ) saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ I offer you three things ; choose one of them for yourself , that I may do it to you. ” ’ ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	11	So Gad came to David and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Choose for yourself ,
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	12	( I ) either [ d ] three years of famine , or three months to be defeated by your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking you , or else for three days the sword of the Lord—the plague in the land , with the [ e ] angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. ’ Now consider what answer I should take back to Him who sent me. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	13	And David said to Gad , “ I am in great distress . Please let me fall into the hand of the Lord , for His ( J ) mercies are very great ; but do not let me fall into the hand of man. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	14	So the Lord sent a ( K ) plague upon Israel , and seventy thousand men of Israel fell .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	15	And God sent [ f ] an ( L ) angel to Jerusalem to destroy it . As [ g ] he was destroying , the Lord looked and ( M ) relented of the disaster , and said to the angel who was destroying , “ It is enough ; now restrain [ h ] your hand. ” And the angel of the Lord stood by the ( N ) threshing floor of [ i ] Ornan the Jebusite .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	16	Then David lifted his eyes and ( O ) saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and heaven , having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem . So David and the elders , clothed in sackcloth , fell on their faces .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	17	And David said to God , “ Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered ? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed ; but these ( P ) sheep , what have they done ? Let Your hand , I pray , O Lord my God , be against me and my father ’ s house , but not against Your people that they should be plagued. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	18	Therefore , the ( Q ) angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David that David should go and erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	19	So David went up at the word of Gad , which he had spoken in the name of the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	20	Now Ornan turned and saw the angel ; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves , but Ornan continued threshing wheat .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	22	Then David said to Ornan , [ j ] “ Grant me the place of this threshing floor , that I may build an altar on it to the Lord . You shall grant it to me at the full price , that the plague may be withdrawn from the people. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	23	But Ornan said to David , “ Take it to yourself , and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes . Look , I also give you the oxen for burnt offerings , the threshing implements for wood , and the wheat for the grain offering ; I give it all. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	24	Then King David said to Ornan , “ No , but I will surely buy it for the full price , for I will not take what is yours for the Lord , nor offer burnt offerings with that which costs me nothing. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	25	So ( R ) David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	26	And David built there an altar to the Lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called on the Lord ; and ( S ) He answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	27	So the Lord commanded the angel , and he returned his sword to its sheath .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	28	At that time , when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite , he sacrificed there .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	29	( T ) For the tabernacle of the Lord and the altar of the burnt offering , which Moses had made in the wilderness , were at that time at the high place in ( U ) Gibeon .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	21	30	But David could not go before it to inquire of God , for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the Lord . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	22	Then David said , ( A ) “ This is the house of the Lord God , and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	2	So David commanded to gather the ( B ) aliens who were in the land of Israel ; and he appointed masons to ( C ) cut hewn stones to build the house of God .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	3	And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the joints , and bronze in abundance ( D ) beyond measure ,

NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	5	Now David said , ( F ) “ Solomon my son is young and inexperienced , and the house to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent , famous and glorious throughout all countries . I will now make preparation for it. ” So David made abundant preparations before his death .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	6	Then he called for his son Solomon , and [ a ] charged him to build a house for the Lord God of Israel .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	7	And David said to Solomon : “ My son , as for me , ( G ) it was in my mind to build a house ( H ) to the name of the Lord my God ;
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	8	but the word of the Lord came to me , saying , ( I ) ‘ You have shed much blood and have made great wars ; you shall not build a house for My name , because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	9	( J ) Behold , a son shall be born to you , who shall be a man of rest ; and I will give him ( K ) rest from all his enemies all around . His name shall be [ b ] Solomon , for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	10	( L ) He shall build a house for My name , and ( M ) he shall be My son , and I will be his Father ; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever. ’
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	11	Now , my son , may ( N ) the Lord be with you ; and may you prosper , and build the house of the Lord your God , as He has said to you .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	12	Only may the Lord ( O ) give you wisdom and understanding , and give you charge concerning Israel , that you may keep the law of the Lord your God .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	13	( P ) Then you will prosper , if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments with which the Lord [ c ] charged Moses concerning Israel . ( Q ) Be strong and of good courage ; do not fear nor be dismayed .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	14	Indeed I have taken much trouble to prepare for the house of the Lord one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver , and bronze and iron ( R ) beyond measure , for it is so abundant . I have prepared timber and stone also , and you may add to them .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	15	Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance : woodsmen and stonecutters , and all types of skillful men for every kind of work .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	16	Of gold and silver and bronze and iron there is no limit . Arise and begin working , and ( S ) the Lord be with you. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	17	David also commanded all the ( T ) leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son , saying ,
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	18	“ Is not the Lord your God with you ? ( U ) And has He not given you rest on every side ? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand , and the land is subdued before the Lord and before His people .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	22	19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God .

NKJV	1%20Chronicles	29	17	I know also , my God , that You ( O ) test the heart and ( P ) have pleasure in uprightness . As for me , in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things ; and now with joy I have seen Your people , who are present here to offer willingly to You .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	29	18	O Lord God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , our fathers , keep this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people , and fix their heart toward You .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	29	19	And ( Q ) give my son Solomon a loyal heart to keep Your commandments and Your testimonies and Your statutes , to do all these things , and to build the [ g ] temple for which ( R ) I have made provision. ”
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	29	20	Then David said to all the assembly , “ Now bless the Lord your God. ” So all the assembly blessed the Lord God of their fathers , and bowed their heads and prostrated themselves before the Lord and the king . Solomon Anointed King ( S )
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	29	21	And they made sacrifices to the Lord and offered burnt offerings to the Lord on the next day : a thousand bulls , a thousand rams , a thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and ( T ) sacrifices in abundance for all Israel .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	29	22	-
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	29	23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father , and prospered ; and all Israel obeyed him .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	29	24	All the leaders and the mighty men , and also all the sons of King David , ( V ) submitted [ h ] themselves to King Solomon .
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	29	25	So the Lord exalted Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and ( W ) bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel . The Close of David ’ s Reign
NKJV	1%20Chronicles	29	26	Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	1	Now ( B ) Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom , and ( C ) the Lord his God was with him and ( D ) exalted him exceedingly .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	3	Then Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to [ a ] the high place that was at ( F ) Gibeon ; for the tabernacle of meeting with God was there , which Moses the servant of the Lord had ( G ) made in the wilderness .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	4	( H ) But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to the place David had prepared for it , for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	5	Now ( I ) the bronze altar that ( J ) Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , [ b ] he put before the tabernacle of the Lord ; Solomon and the assembly sought Him there .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	6	And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the Lord , which was at the tabernacle of meeting , and ( K ) offered a thousand burnt offerings on it .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	7	( L ) On that night God appeared to Solomon , and said to him , “ Ask ! What shall I give you ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	8	And Solomon said to God : “ You have shown great ( M ) mercy to David my father , and have made me ( N ) king in his place .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	9	Now , O Lord God , let Your promise to David my father be established , ( O ) for You have made me king over a people like the ( P ) dust of the earth in multitude .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	10	( Q ) Now give me wisdom and knowledge , that I may ( R ) go out and come in before this people ; for who can judge this great people of Yours ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	11	( S ) Then God said to Solomon : “ Because this was in your heart , and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies , nor have you asked long life—but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself , that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king—
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	12	wisdom and knowledge are granted to you ; and I will give you riches and wealth and honor , such as ( T ) none of the kings have had who were before you , nor shall any after you have the like. ” Solomon ’ s Military and Economic Power ( U )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	13	So Solomon came to Jerusalem from [ c ] the high place that was at Gibeon , from before the tabernacle of meeting , and reigned over Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	14	( V ) And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen ; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen , whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	15	( W ) Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones , and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	16	( X ) And Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh ; the king ’ s merchants bought them in Keveh at the current price .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	1	17	They also acquired and imported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver , and a horse for one hundred and fifty ; thus , [ d ] through their agents , they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	4	Behold , ( E ) I am building a temple for the name of the Lord my God , to dedicate it to Him , ( F ) to burn before Him [ b ] sweet incense , for ( G ) the continual showbread , for ( H ) the burnt offerings morning and evening , on the ( I ) Sabbaths , on the New Moons , and on the [ c ] set feasts of the Lord our God . This is an ordinance forever to Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	5	And the temple which I build will be great , for ( J ) our God is greater than all gods .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	6	( K ) But who is able to build Him a temple , since heaven and the heaven of heavens can not contain Him ? Who am I then , that I should build Him a temple , except to burn sacrifice before Him ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	7	Therefore send me at once a man skillful to work in gold and silver , in bronze and iron , in purple and crimson and blue , who has skill to engrave with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem , ( L ) whom David my father provided .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	8	( M ) Also send me cedar and cypress and algum logs from Lebanon , for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon ; and indeed my servants will be with your servants ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	9	to prepare timber for me in abundance , for the [ d ] temple which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	10	( N ) And indeed I will give to your servants , the woodsmen who cut timber , twenty thousand kors of ground wheat , twenty thousand kors of barley , twenty thousand baths of wine , and twenty thousand baths of oil .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	11	Then Hiram king of Tyre answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon : ( O ) Because the Lord loves His people , He has made you king over them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	12	[ e ] Hiram also said : ( P ) Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , ( Q ) who made heaven and earth , for He has given King David a wise son , endowed with prudence and understanding , who will build a temple for the Lord and a royal house for himself !
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	13	And now I have sent a skillful man , endowed with understanding , [ f ] Huram my [ g ] master craftsman
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	14	-

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	2	17	( U ) Then Solomon numbered all the aliens who were in the land of Israel , after the census in which ( V ) David his father had numbered them ; and there were found to be one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	4	( H ) Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	5	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep . So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	6	( I ) And the priests attended to their services ; the Levites also with instruments of the music of the Lord , which King David had made to praise the Lord , saying , “ For His mercy endures forever , ” whenever David offered praise by their [ b ] ministry . ( J ) The priests sounded trumpets opposite them , while all Israel stood .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	8	( L ) At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great assembly ( M ) from the entrance of Hamath to ( N ) the [ c ] Brook of Egypt .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	9	And on the eighth day they held a ( O ) sacred assembly , for they observed the dedication of the altar seven days , and the feast seven days .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	10	( P ) On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents , joyful and glad of heart for the good that the Lord had done for David , for Solomon , and for His people Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	11	Thus ( Q ) Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the king ’ s house ; and Solomon successfully accomplished all that came into his heart to make in the house of the Lord and in his own house . God ’ s Second Appearance to Solomon ( R )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	12	Then the Lord ( S ) appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him : “ I have heard your prayer , ( T ) and have chosen this ( U ) place for Myself as a house of sacrifice .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	13	( V ) When I shut up heaven and there is no rain , or command the locusts to devour the land , or send pestilence among My people ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	14	if My people who are ( W ) called by My name will ( X ) humble themselves , and pray and seek My face , and turn from their wicked ways , ( Y ) then I will hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin and heal their land .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	15	Now ( Z ) My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayer made in this place .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	16	For now ( AA ) I have chosen and [ d ] sanctified this house , that My name may be there forever ; and [ e ] My eyes and [ f ] My heart will be there perpetually .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	17	( AB ) As for you , if you walk before Me as your father David walked , and do according to all that I have commanded you , and if you keep My statutes and My judgments ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	18	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom , as I covenanted with David your father , saying , ( AC ) ‘ You shall not fail to have a man as ruler in Israel. ’
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	19	( AD ) “ But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you , and go and serve other gods , and worship them ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	20	( AE ) then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them ; and this house which I have [ g ] sanctified for My name I will cast out of My sight , and will make it a proverb and a ( AF ) byword among all peoples .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	21	“ And as for ( AG ) this [ h ] house , which [ i ] is exalted , everyone who passes by it will be ( AH ) astonished and say , ( AI ) ‘ Why has the Lord done thus to this land and this house ? ’
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	7	22	Then they will answer , ‘ Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and embraced other gods , and worshiped them and served them ; therefore He has brought all this calamity on them. ’ ” Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	3	And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	4	( D ) He also built Tadmor in the wilderness , and all the storage cities which he built in ( E ) Hamath .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	5	He built Upper Beth Horon and ( F ) Lower Beth Horon , fortified cities with walls , gates , and bars ,

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	9	But Solomon did not make the children of Israel [ b ] servants for his work . Some were men of war , captains of his officers , captains of his chariots , and his cavalry .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	10	And others were chiefs of the officials of King Solomon : ( I ) two hundred and fifty , who ruled over the people .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	11	Now Solomon ( J ) brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the house he had built for her , for he said , “ My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel , because the places to which the ark of the Lord has come are holy. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of the Lord which he had built before the vestibule ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	13	according to the ( K ) daily rate , offering according to the commandment of Moses , for the Sabbaths , the New Moons , and the ( L ) three appointed yearly ( M ) feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the Feast of Weeks , and the Feast of Tabernacles .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	14	And , according to the [ c ] order of David his father , he appointed the ( N ) divisions of the priests for their service , ( O ) the Levites for their duties ( to praise and serve before the priests ) as the duty of each day required , and the ( P ) gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate ; for so David the man of God had commanded .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	15	They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the ( Q ) treasuries .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	16	Now all the work of Solomon was well-ordered [ d ] from the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord until it was finished . So the house of the Lord was completed .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	8	18	( S ) And Hiram sent him ships by the hand of his servants , and servants who knew the sea . They went with the servants of Solomon to ( T ) Ophir , and acquired four hundred and fifty talents of gold from there , and brought it to King Solomon . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	5	Then she said to the king : “ It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	6	However I did not believe their words until I came and saw with my own eyes ; and indeed the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me . You exceed the fame of which I heard .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	8	Blessed be the Lord your God , who delighted in you , setting you on His throne to be king for the Lord your God ! Because your God has ( D ) loved Israel , to establish them forever , therefore He made you king over them , to do justice and righteousness. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	10	Also , the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon , ( E ) who brought gold from Ophir , brought [ a ] algum wood and precious stones .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	11	And the king made walkways of the [ b ] algum wood for the house of the Lord and for the king ’ s house , also harps and stringed instruments for singers ; and there were none such as these seen before in the land of Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	12	-
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	13	( G ) The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	14	besides what the traveling merchants and traders brought . And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	15	And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold ; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	16	He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold ; [ c ] three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield . The king put them in the ( H ) House of the Forest of Lebanon .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	17	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory , and overlaid it with pure gold .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	18	The throne had six steps , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne ; there were [ d ] armrests on either side of the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the armrests .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	19	Twelve lions stood there , one on each side of the six steps ; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	20	All King Solomon ’ s drinking vessels were gold , and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold . Not one was silver , for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	21	For the king ’ s ships went to ( I ) Tarshish with the servants of [ e ] Hiram . Once every three years the [ f ] merchant ships came , bringing gold , silver , ivory , apes , and [ g ] monkeys .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	22	So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	9	24	Each man brought his present : articles of silver and gold , garments , ( J ) armor , spices , horses , and mules , at a set rate year by year .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	3	Then they sent for him and called him . And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	4	“ Your father made our yoke heavy ; now therefore , lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us , and we will serve you. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	5	So he said to them , “ Come back to me after three days. ” And the people departed .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	6	Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived , saying , “ How do you advise me to answer these people ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	7	And they spoke to him , saying , “ If you are kind to these people , and please them , and speak good words to them , they will be your servants forever. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	8	( D ) But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him , and consulted the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	9	And he said to them , “ What advice do you give ? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me , saying , ‘ Lighten the yoke which your father put on us ’ ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	11	And now , whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you , I will add to your yoke ; my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with [ a ] scourges ! ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	12	So ( E ) Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day , as the king had directed , saying , “ Come back to me the third day. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	13	Then the king answered them roughly . King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	14	and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men , saying , [ b ] “ My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add to it ; my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with [ c ] scourges ! ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	15	So the king did not listen to the people ; ( F ) for the turn of events was from God , that the Lord might fulfill His ( G ) word , which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	16	Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them , the people answered the king , saying : “ What share have we in David ? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse . Every man to your tents , O Israel ! Now see to your own house , O David ! ” So all Israel departed to their tents .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	17	But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	10	18	Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram , who was in charge of revenue ; but the children of Israel stoned him with stones , and he died . Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	5	So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem , and built cities for defense in Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	6	And he built Bethlehem , Etam , Tekoa ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	7	Beth Zur , Sochoh , Adullam ,

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	13	And from all their territories the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel took their stand with him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	14	For the Levites left ( D ) their common-lands and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem , for ( E ) Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests to the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	15	( F ) Then he appointed for himself priests for the [ a ] high places , for ( G ) the demons , and ( H ) the calf idols which he had made .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	16	( I ) And [ b ] after the Levites left , those from all the tribes of Israel , such as set their heart to seek the Lord God of Israel , ( J ) came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the Lord God of their fathers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	17	So they ( K ) strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years , because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years . The Family of Rehoboam
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	18	Then Rehoboam took for himself as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David , and of Abihail the daughter of ( L ) Eliah the son of Jesse .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	19	And she bore him children : Jeush , Shamariah , and Zaham .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	20	After her he took ( M ) Maachah the [ c ] granddaughter of ( N ) Absalom ; and she bore him ( O ) Abijah , Attai , Ziza , and Shelomith .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	21	Now Rehoboam loved Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his ( P ) wives and his concubines ; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines , and begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	11	22	And Rehoboam ( Q ) appointed ( R ) Abijah the son of Maachah as chief , to be leader among his brothers ; for he intended to make him king .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	12	When he humbled himself , the wrath of the Lord turned from him , so as not to destroy him completely ; and things also went well in Judah . The End of Rehoboam ’ s Reign ( O )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	3	with twelve hundred chariots , sixty thousand horsemen , and people without number who came with him out of Egypt— ( E ) the Lubim and the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	4	And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came to Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	5	Then ( F ) Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah , who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said to them , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ You have forsaken Me , and therefore I also have left you in the hand of Shishak. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	6	So the leaders of Israel and the king ( G ) humbled themselves ; and they said , ( H ) “ The Lord is righteous. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	7	Now when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves , ( I ) the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah , saying , “ They have humbled themselves ; therefore I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliverance . My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	8	Nevertheless ( J ) they will be his servants , that they may distinguish ( K ) My service from the service of the kingdoms of the nations. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	9	( L ) So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king ’ s house ; he took everything . He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had ( M ) made .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	10	Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place , and committed them ( N ) to the hands of the captains of the guard , who guarded the doorway of the king ’ s house .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	11	And whenever the king entered the house of the Lord , the guard would go and bring them out ; then they would take them back into the guardroom .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	13	Thus King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned . Now ( P ) Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king ; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , ( Q ) the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , to put His name there . His mother ’ s name was Naamah , an ( R ) Ammonitess .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	14	And he did evil , because he did not prepare his heart to seek the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	12	15	The acts of Rehoboam , first and last , are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet , ( S ) and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies ? ( T ) And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	13	But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them ; so they were in front of Judah , and the ambush was behind them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	3	Abijah set the battle in order with an army of valiant warriors , four hundred thousand choice men . Jeroboam also drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand choice men , mighty men of valor .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	4	Then Abijah stood on Mount ( D ) Zemaraim , which is in the mountains of Ephraim , and said , “ Hear me , Jeroboam and all Israel :
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	5	Should you not know that the Lord God of Israel ( E ) gave the dominion over Israel to David forever , to him and his sons , ( F ) by a covenant of salt ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up and ( G ) rebelled against his lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	7	Then ( H ) worthless rogues gathered to him , and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was ( I ) young and inexperienced and could not withstand them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	8	And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord , which is in the hand of the sons of David ; and you are a great multitude , and with you are the gold calves which Jeroboam ( J ) made for you as gods .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	9	( K ) Have you not cast out the priests of the Lord , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites , and made for yourselves priests , like the peoples of other lands , ( L ) so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of ( M ) things that are not gods ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	10	But as for us , the Lord is our ( N ) God , and we have not forsaken Him ; and the priests who minister to the Lord are the sons of Aaron , and the Levites attend to their duties .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	11	( O ) And they burn to the Lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense ; they also set the ( P ) showbread in order on the pure gold table , and the lampstand of gold with its lamps ( Q ) to burn every evening ; for we keep the command of the Lord our God , but you have forsaken Him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	12	Now look , God Himself is with us as our ( R ) head , ( S ) and His priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you . O children of Israel , do not fight against the Lord God of your fathers , for you shall not prosper ! ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	14	And when Judah looked around , to their surprise the battle line was at both front and rear ; and they ( T ) cried out to the Lord , and the priests sounded the trumpets .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	15	Then the men of Judah gave a shout ; and as the men of Judah shouted , it happened that God ( U ) struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	16	And the children of Israel fled before Judah , and God delivered them into their hand .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	17	Then Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter ; so five hundred thousand choice men of Israel fell slain .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	18	Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that time ; and the children of Judah prevailed , ( V ) because they relied on the Lord God of their fathers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	19	And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him : Bethel with its villages , Jeshanah with its villages , and ( W ) Ephrain [ b ] with its villages .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	13	20	So Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah ; and the Lord ( X ) struck him , and ( Y ) he died .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	14	5	He also removed the [ b ] high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah , and the kingdom was quiet under him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	14	6	And he built fortified cities in Judah , for the land had rest ; he had no war in those years , because the Lord had given him ( G ) rest .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	14	7	Therefore he said to Judah , “ Let us build these cities and make walls around them , and towers , gates , and bars , while the land is yet before us , because we have sought the Lord our God ; we have sought Him , and He has given us rest on every side. ” So they built and prospered .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	14	8	And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried [ c ] shields and spears , and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried shields and drew ( H ) bows ; all these were mighty men of ( I ) valor .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	14	9	( J ) Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots , and he came to ( K ) Mareshah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	14	10	So Asa went out against him , and they set the troops in battle array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	14	11	And Asa ( L ) cried out to the Lord his God , and said , “ Lord , it is ( M ) nothing for You to help , whether with many or with those who have no power ; help us , O Lord our God , for we rest on You , and ( N ) in Your name we go against this multitude . O Lord , You are our God ; do not let man prevail against You ! ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	14	12	So the Lord ( O ) struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah , and the Ethiopians fled .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	14	13	And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to ( P ) Gerar . So the Ethiopians were overthrown , and they could not recover , for they were broken before the Lord and His army . And they carried away very much [ d ] spoil .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	14	15	They also [ f ] attacked the livestock enclosures , and carried off sheep and camels in abundance , and returned to Jerusalem . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	15	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath , for they had sworn with all their heart and ( P ) sought Him with all their soul ; and He was found by them , and the Lord gave them ( Q ) rest all around .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	3	( E ) For a long time Israel has been without the true God , without a ( F ) teaching priest , and without ( G ) law ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	4	but ( H ) when in their trouble they turned to the Lord God of Israel , and sought Him , He was found by them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	5	And in those times there was no peace to the one who went out , nor to the one who came in , but great turmoil was on all the inhabitants of the lands .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	6	( I ) So nation was [ b ] destroyed by nation , and city by city , for God troubled them with every adversity .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	7	But you , be strong and do not let your hands be weak , for your work shall be rewarded ! ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	8	And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of [ c ] Oded the prophet , he took courage , and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities ( J ) which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim ; and he restored the altar of the Lord that was before the vestibule of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	9	Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin , and ( K ) those who dwelt with them from Ephraim , Manasseh , and Simeon , for they came over to him in great numbers from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	10	So they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	11	( L ) And they offered to the Lord [ d ] at that time seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep from the [ e ] spoil they had brought .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	12	Then they ( M ) entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	13	( N ) and whoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel ( O ) was to be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	14	Then they took an oath before the Lord with a loud voice , with shouting and trumpets and rams ’ horns .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	16	Also he removed ( R ) Maachah , the [ f ] mother of Asa the king , from being queen mother , because she had made an obscene image of [ g ] Asherah ; and Asa cut down her obscene image , then crushed and burned it by the Brook Kidron .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	17	But ( S ) the [ h ] high places were not removed from Israel . Nevertheless the heart of Asa was loyal all his days .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	18	He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated : silver and gold and utensils .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	15	19	And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	16	In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa , ( B ) Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah , ( C ) that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	3	“ Let there be a treaty between you and me , as there was between my father and your father . See , I have sent you silver and gold ; come , break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel , so that he will withdraw from me. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	4	So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel . They attacked Ijon , Dan , Abel Maim , and all the storage cities of Naphtali .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	5	Now it happened , when Baasha heard it , that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	6	Then King Asa took all Judah , and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah , which Baasha had used for building ; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah . Hanani ’ s Message to Asa
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	7	And at that time ( D ) Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah , and said to him : ( E ) “ Because you have relied on the king of Syria , and have not relied on the Lord your God , therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	8	Were ( F ) the Ethiopians and ( G ) the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen ? Yet , because you relied on the Lord , He delivered them into your ( H ) hand .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	9	( I ) For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth , to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him . In this ( J ) you have done foolishly ; therefore from now on ( K ) you shall have wars. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	10	Then Asa was angry with the seer , and ( L ) put him in prison , for he was enraged at him because of this . And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time . Illness and Death of Asa ( M )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	11	( N ) Note that the acts of Asa , first and last , are indeed written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	12	And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign , Asa became diseased in his feet , and his malady was severe ; yet in his disease he ( O ) did not seek the Lord , but the physicians .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	13	( P ) So Asa [ a ] rested with his fathers ; he died in the forty-first year of his reign .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	16	14	They buried him in his own tomb , which he had [ b ] made for himself in the City of David ; and they laid him in the bed which was filled ( Q ) with spices and various ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments . They made ( R ) a very great burning for him . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	17	Of Benjamin : Eliada a mighty man of valor , and with him two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	3	Now the Lord was with Jehoshaphat , because he walked in the former ways of his father David ; he did not seek the Baals ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	4	but sought [ a ] the God of his father , and walked in His commandments and not according to ( D ) the acts of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	5	Therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand ; and all Judah ( E ) gave presents to Jehoshaphat , ( F ) and he had riches and honor in abundance .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	6	And his heart took delight in the ways of the Lord ; moreover ( G ) he removed the [ b ] high places and wooden images from Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	7	Also in the third year of his reign he sent his leaders , Ben-Hail , Obadiah , Zechariah , Nethanel , and Michaiah , ( H ) to teach in the cities of Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	8	And with them he sent Levites : Shemaiah , Nethaniah , Zebadiah , Asahel , Shemiramoth , Jehonathan , Adonijah , Tobijah , and Tobadonijah—the Levites ; and with them Elishama and Jehoram , the priests .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	9	( I ) So they taught in Judah , and had the Book of the Law of the Lord with them ; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	10	And ( J ) the fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah , so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	11	Also some of the Philistines ( K ) brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver as tribute ; and the Arabians brought him flocks , seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	12	So Jehoshaphat became increasingly powerful , and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	13	He had much property in the cities of Judah ; and the men of war , mighty men of valor , were in Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	14	These are their numbers , according to their fathers ’ houses . Of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	15	and next to him was Jehohanan the captain , and with him two hundred and eighty thousand ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	16	and next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri , ( L ) who willingly offered himself to the Lord , and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	18	and next to him was Jehozabad , and with him one hundred and eighty thousand prepared for war .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	17	19	These served the king , besides ( M ) those the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	18	Then Micaiah said , “ Therefore hear the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on His ( L ) throne , and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and His left .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	3	So Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah , “ Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead ? ” And he answered him , “ I am as you are , and my people as your people ; we will be with you in the war. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	4	Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , ( F ) “ Please inquire for the word of the Lord today. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	5	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together , four hundred men , and said to them , “ Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead , or shall I refrain ? ” So they said , “ Go up , for God will deliver it into the king ’ s hand. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	6	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there not still a prophet of the Lord here , that we may inquire of ( G ) Him ? ” [ a ]
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	7	So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ There is still one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord ; but I hate him , because he never prophesies good concerning me , but always evil . He is Micaiah the son of Imla. ” And Jehoshaphat said , “ Let not the king say such things ! ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	8	Then the king of Israel called one of his officers and said , “ Bring Micaiah the son of Imla quickly ! ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	9	The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah , clothed in their robes , sat each on his throne ; and they sat at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	10	Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made ( H ) horns of iron for himself ; and he said , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ With these you shall gore the Syrians until they are destroyed. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	11	And all the prophets prophesied so , saying , “ Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper , for the Lord will deliver it into the king ’ s hand. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	12	Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him , saying , “ Now listen , the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king . Therefore please let your word be like the word of one of them , and speak encouragement. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	13	And Micaiah said , “ As the Lord lives , ( I ) whatever my God says , that I will speak. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	14	Then he came to the king ; and the king said to him , “ Micaiah , shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead , or shall I refrain ? ” And he said , “ Go and prosper , and they shall be delivered into your hand ! ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	15	So the king said to him , “ How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	16	Then he said , “ I saw all Israel ( J ) scattered on the mountains , as sheep that have no ( K ) shepherd . And the Lord said , ‘ These have no master . Let each return to his house in peace. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me , but evil ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	19	And the Lord said , ‘ Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up , that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead ? ’ So one spoke in this manner , and another spoke in that manner .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	20	Then a ( M ) spirit came forward and stood before the Lord , and said , ‘ I will persuade him. ’ The Lord said to him , ‘ In what way ? ’
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	21	So he said , ‘ I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. ’ And the Lord said , ‘ You shall persuade him and also prevail ; go out and do so. ’
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	22	Therefore look ! ( N ) The Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours , and the Lord has declared disaster against you. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and ( O ) struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , “ Which way did the spirit from the Lord go from me to speak to you ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	24	And Micaiah said , “ Indeed you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide ! ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	25	Then the king of Israel said , “ Take Micaiah , and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king ’ s son ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	26	and say , ‘ Thus says the king : ( P ) “ Put this fellow in prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction , until I return in peace. ” ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	27	But Micaiah said , “ If you ever return in peace , the Lord has not spoken by ( Q ) me. ” And he said , “ Take heed , all you people ! ” Ahab Dies in Battle ( R )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	29	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ I will ( S ) disguise myself and go into battle ; but you put on your robes. ” So the king of Israel disguised himself , and they went into battle .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots who were with him , saying , “ Fight with no one small or great , but only with the king of Israel. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	31	So it was , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , “ It is the king of Israel ! ” Therefore they surrounded him to attack ; but Jehoshaphat ( T ) cried out , and the Lord helped him , and God diverted them from him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	32	For so it was , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	33	Now a certain man drew a bow at random , and struck the king of Israel between the [ b ] joints of his armor . So he said to the driver of his chariot , “ Turn around and take me out of the battle , for I am wounded. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	18	34	The battle increased that day , and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening ; and about the time of sunset he died . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	19	19	Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned safely to his house in Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	19	3	Nevertheless ( D ) good things are found in you , in that you have removed the [ a ] wooden images from the land , and have ( E ) prepared your heart to seek God. ” The Reforms of Jehoshaphat
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	19	4	So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem ; and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the mountains of Ephraim , and brought them back to the Lord God of their ( F ) fathers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	19	5	Then he set ( G ) judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah , city by city ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	19	6	and said to the judges , “ Take heed to what you are doing , for ( H ) you do not judge for man but for the Lord , ( I ) who is with you [ b ] in the judgment .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	19	7	Now therefore , let the fear of the Lord be upon you ; take care and do it , for ( J ) there is no iniquity with the Lord our God , no ( K ) partiality , nor taking of bribes. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	19	8	Moreover in Jerusalem , for the judgment of the Lord and for controversies , Jehoshaphat ( L ) appointed some of the Levites and priests , and some of the chief fathers of Israel , [ c ] when they returned to Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	19	9	And he commanded them , saying , “ Thus you shall act ( M ) in the fear of the Lord , faithfully and with a loyal heart :
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	19	10	( N ) Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities , whether of bloodshed or offenses against law or commandment , against statutes or ordinances , you shall warn them , lest they trespass against the Lord and ( O ) wrath come upon ( P ) you and your brethren . Do this , and you will not be guilty .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	19	11	And take notice : ( Q ) Amariah the chief priest is over you ( R ) in all matters of the Lord ; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael , the ruler of the house of Judah , for all the king ’ s matters ; also the Levites will be officials before you . Behave courageously , and the Lord will be ( S ) with the good. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	20	So they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa ; and as they went out , Jehoshaphat stood and said , “ Hear me , O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem : ( AB ) Believe in the Lord your God , and you shall be established ; believe His prophets , and you shall prosper. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	3	And Jehoshaphat feared , and set [ c ] himself to ( F ) seek the Lord , and ( G ) proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	4	So Judah gathered together to ask ( H ) help from the Lord ; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	5	Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem , in the house of the Lord , before the new court ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	6	and said : “ O Lord God of our fathers , are You not ( I ) God in heaven , and ( J ) do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations , and ( K ) in Your hand is there not power and might , so that no one is able to withstand You ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	7	Are You not ( L ) our God , who ( M ) drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel , and gave it to the descendants of Abraham ( N ) Your friend forever ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	8	And they dwell in it , and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name , saying ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	9	( O ) ‘ If disaster comes upon us—sword , judgment , pestilence , or famine—we will stand before this temple and in Your presence ( for Your ( P ) name is in this temple ) , and cry out to You in our affliction , and You will hear and save. ’
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	10	And now , here are the people of Ammon , Moab , and Mount Seir—whom You ( Q ) would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt , but ( R ) they turned from them and did not destroy them—
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	11	here they are , rewarding us ( S ) by coming to throw us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	12	O our God , will You not ( T ) judge them ? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us ; nor do we know what to do , but ( U ) our eyes are upon You. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	13	Now all Judah , with their little ones , their wives , and their children , stood before the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	14	Then ( V ) the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph , in the midst of the assembly .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	15	And he said , “ Listen , all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem , and you , King Jehoshaphat ! Thus says the Lord to you : ( W ) ‘ Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude , ( X ) for the battle is not yours , but God ’ s .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	16	Tomorrow go down against them . They will surely come up by the Ascent of Ziz , and you will find them at the end of the [ d ] brook before the Wilderness of Jeruel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	17	( Y ) You will not need to fight in this battle . Position yourselves , stand still and see the salvation of the Lord , who is with you , O Judah and Jerusalem ! ’ Do not fear or be dismayed ; tomorrow go out against them , ( Z ) for the Lord is with you. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	18	And Jehoshaphat ( AA ) bowed his head with his face to the ground , and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the Lord , worshiping the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	19	Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with voices loud and high .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	21	And when he had consulted with the people , he appointed those who should sing to the Lord , ( AC ) and who should praise the beauty of holiness , as they went out before the army and were saying :
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	22	Now when they began to sing and to praise , ( AF ) the Lord set ambushes against the people of Ammon , Moab , and Mount Seir , who had come against Judah ; and they were defeated .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	23	For the people of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them . And when they [ e ] had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , ( AG ) they helped to destroy one another .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	24	So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness , they looked toward the multitude ; and there were their dead bodies , fallen on the earth . No one had escaped .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	25	When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil , they found among them an abundance of valuables on the [ f ] dead bodies , and precious jewelry , which they stripped off for themselves , more than they could carry away ; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	26	And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of [ g ] Berachah , for there they blessed the Lord ; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah until this day .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	27	Then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , with Jehoshaphat in front of them , to go back to Jerusalem with joy , for the Lord had ( AH ) made them rejoice over their enemies .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	28	So they came to Jerusalem , with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets , to the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	29	And ( AI ) the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	30	Then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet , for his ( AJ ) God gave him rest all around . The End of Jehoshaphat ’ s Reign ( AK )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	31	( AL ) So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah . He was thirty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	32	And he walked in the way of his father ( AM ) Asa , and did not turn aside from it , doing what was right in the sight of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	33	Nevertheless ( AN ) the [ h ] high places were not taken away , for as yet the people had not ( AO ) directed their hearts to the God of their fathers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , indeed they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani , ( AP ) which is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	35	After this ( AQ ) Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel , ( AR ) who acted very ( AS ) wickedly .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	36	And he allied himself with him ( AT ) to make ships to go to Tarshish , and they made the ships in Ezion Geber .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	20	37	But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat , saying , “ Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah , the Lord has destroyed your works. ” ( AU ) Then the ships were wrecked , so that they were not able to go ( AV ) to Tarshish .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	21	And ( B ) Jehoshaphat [ a ] rested with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the City of David . Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	3	Their father gave them great gifts of silver and gold and precious things , with fortified cities in Judah ; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram , because he was the firstborn .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	4	Now when Jehoram [ b ] was established over the kingdom of his father , he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword , and also others of the princes of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	5	( C ) Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , just as the house of Ahab had done , for he had the daughter of ( D ) Ahab as a wife ; and he did evil in the sight of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	7	Yet the Lord would not destroy the house of David , because of the ( E ) covenant that He had made with David , and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his ( F ) sons forever .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	8	( G ) In his days Edom revolted against Judah ’ s authority , and made a king over themselves .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	9	So Jehoram went out with his officers , and all his chariots with him . And he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	10	Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah ’ s authority to this day . At that time Libnah revolted against his rule , because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	11	Moreover he made [ c ] high places in the mountains of Judah , and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to ( H ) commit harlotry , and led Judah astray .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	12	And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet , saying , Thus says the Lord God of your father David : Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father , or in the ways of Asa king of Judah ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	13	but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have ( I ) made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to ( J ) play the harlot like the ( K ) harlotry of the house of Ahab , and also have ( L ) killed your brothers , those of your father ’ s household , who were better than yourself ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	14	behold , the Lord will strike your people with a serious affliction—your children , your wives , and all your possessions ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	15	and you will become very sick with a ( M ) disease of your intestines , until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness , day by day .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	16	Moreover the ( N ) Lord ( O ) stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the ( P ) Arabians who were near the Ethiopians .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	17	And they came up into Judah and invaded it , and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king ’ s house , and also ( Q ) his sons and his wives , so that there was not a son left to him except [ d ] Jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	18	After all this the Lord struck him ( R ) in his intestines with an incurable disease .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	19	Then it happened in the course of time , after the end of two years , that his intestines came out because of his sickness ; so he died in severe pain . And his people made no [ e ] burning for him , like ( S ) the burning for his fathers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	21	20	He was thirty-two years old when he became king . He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and , to no one ’ s sorrow , departed . However they buried him in the City of David , but not in the tombs of the kings . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	22	Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made ( B ) Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place , for the raiders who came with the ( C ) Arabians into the camp had killed all the ( D ) older sons . So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram , king of Judah , reigned .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab , for his mother advised him to do wickedly .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	4	Therefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord , like the house of Ahab ; for they were his counselors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	5	,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	6	( F ) Then he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had received at Ramah , when he fought against Hazael king of Syria . And [ d ] Azariah the son of Jehoram , king of Judah , went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel , because he was sick .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	7	;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	8	And it happened , when Jehu was ( J ) executing judgment on the house of Ahab , and ( K ) found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah ’ s brothers who served Ahaziah , that he killed them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	9	( L ) Then he searched for Ahaziah ; and they caught him ( he was hiding in Samaria ) , and brought him to Jehu . When they had killed him , they buried him , “ because , ” they said , “ he is the son of ( M ) Jehoshaphat , who ( N ) sought the Lord with all his heart. ” So the house of Ahaziah had no one to assume power over the kingdom . Athaliah Reigns in Judah ( O )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	10	( P ) Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs of the house of Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	11	But [ h ] Jehoshabeath , the daughter of the king , took ( Q ) Joash the son of Ahaziah , and stole him away from among the king ’ s sons who were being murdered , and put him and his nurse in a bedroom . So Jehoshabeath , the daughter of King Jehoram , the wife of Jehoiada the priest ( for she was the sister of Ahaziah ) , hid him from Athaliah so that she did not kill him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	22	12	And he was hidden with them in the house of God for six years , while Athaliah reigned over the land . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	23	In ( B ) the seventh year ( C ) Jehoiada strengthened himself , and made a covenant with the captains of hundreds : Azariah the son of Jeroham , Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , Azariah the son of ( D ) Obed , Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	3	Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God . And he said to them , “ Behold , the king ’ s son shall reign , as the Lord has ( F ) said of the sons of David .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	4	This is what you shall do : One-third of you ( G ) entering on the Sabbath , of the priests and the Levites , shall be keeping watch over the doors ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	5	one-third shall be at the king ’ s house ; and one-third at the Gate of the Foundation . All the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	6	But let no one come into the house of the Lord except the priests and ( H ) those of the Levites who serve . They may go in , for they are holy ; but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	7	And the Levites shall surround the king on all sides , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and whoever comes into the house , let him be put to death . You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded . And each man took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath , with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath ; for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed ( I ) the divisions .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	9	And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small ( J ) shields which had belonged to King David , that were in the temple of God .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	10	Then he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and by the temple , all around the king .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	11	And they brought out the king ’ s son , put the crown on him , ( K ) gave him the [ a ] Testimony , and made him king . Then Jehoiada and his sons anointed him , and said , “ Long live the king ! ” Death of Athaliah ( L )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	12	Now when ( M ) Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king , she came to the people in the temple of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	13	When she looked , there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance ; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king . All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets , also the singers with musical instruments , and ( N ) those who led in praise . So Athaliah tore her clothes and said , ( O ) “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	14	And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , “ Take her outside under guard , and slay with the sword whoever follows her. ” For the priest had said , “ Do not kill her in the house of the Lord. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	15	So they seized her ; and she went by way of the entrance ( P ) of the Horse Gate into the king ’ s house , and they killed her there .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	16	Then Jehoiada made a ( Q ) covenant between himself , the people , and the king , that they should be the Lord ’ s people .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	17	And all the people went to the [ b ] temple of Baal , and tore it down . They broke in pieces its altars and images , and ( R ) killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	18	Also Jehoiada appointed the oversight of the house of the Lord to the hand of the priests , the Levites , whom David had ( S ) assigned in the house of the Lord , to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord , as it is written in the ( T ) Law of Moses , with rejoicing and with singing , as it was established by David .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	19	And he set the ( U ) gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the Lord , so that no one who was in any way unclean should enter .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	23	20	( V ) Then he took the captains of hundreds , the nobles , the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought the king down from the house of the Lord ; and they went through the Upper Gate to the king ’ s house , and set the king on the throne of the kingdom .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	24	For the army of the Syrians ( Y ) came with a small company of men ; but the Lord ( Z ) delivered a very great army into their hand , because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers . So they ( AA ) executed judgment against Joash .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	3	And Jehoiada took two wives for him , and he had sons and daughters .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	4	Now it happened after this that Joash set his heart on repairing the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	5	Then he gathered the priests and the Levites , and said to them , “ Go out to the cities of Judah , and ( D ) gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year , and see that you do it quickly. ” However the Levites did not do it quickly .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	6	( E ) So the king called Jehoiada the chief priest , and said to him , “ Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the collection , according to the commandment of ( F ) Moses the servant of the Lord and of the assembly of Israel , for the ( G ) tabernacle of witness ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	7	For ( H ) the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken into the house of God , and had also presented all the ( I ) dedicated things of the house of the Lord to the Baals .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	8	Then at the king ’ s command ( J ) they made a chest , and set it outside at the gate of the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	9	And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the Lord ( K ) the collection that Moses the servant of God had imposed on Israel in the wilderness .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	10	Then all the leaders and all the people rejoiced , brought their contributions , and put them into the chest until all had given .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	11	So it was , at that time , when the chest was brought to the king ’ s official by the hand of the Levites , and ( L ) when they saw that there was much money , that the king ’ s scribe and the high priest ’ s officer came and emptied the chest , and took it and returned it to its place . Thus they did day by day , and gathered money in abundance .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	12	The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the Lord ; and they hired masons and carpenters to ( M ) repair the house of the Lord , and also those who worked in iron and bronze to restore the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	13	So the workmen labored , and the work was completed by them ; they restored the house of God to its original condition and reinforced it .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	14	When they had finished , they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada ; ( N ) they made from it articles for the house of the Lord , articles for serving and offering , spoons and vessels of gold and silver . And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jehoiada . Apostasy of Joash
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	15	But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days , and he died ; he was one hundred and thirty years old when he died .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	16	And they buried him in the City of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both toward God and His house .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	17	Now after the death of Jehoiada the leaders of Judah came and bowed down to the king . And the king listened to them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	18	Therefore they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers , and served ( O ) wooden images and idols ; and ( P ) wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their trespass .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	19	Yet He ( Q ) sent prophets to them , to bring them back to the Lord ; and they testified against them , but they would not listen .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	20	Then the Spirit of God [ a ] came upon ( R ) Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest , who stood above the people , and said to them , “ Thus says God : ( S ) ‘ Why do you transgress the commandments of the Lord , so that you can not prosper ? ( T ) Because you have forsaken the Lord , He also has forsaken you. ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	21	So they conspired against him , and at the command of the king they ( U ) stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	22	Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his [ b ] father had done to him , but killed his son ; and as he died , he said , “ The Lord look on it , and ( V ) repay ! ” Death of Joash ( W )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	23	So it happened in the spring of the year that ( X ) the army of Syria came up against him ; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem , and destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people , and sent all their [ c ] spoil to the king of Damascus .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	25	And when they had withdrawn from him ( for they left him severely wounded ) , ( AB ) his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the [ d ] sons of Jehoiada the priest , and killed him on his bed . So he died . And they buried him in the City of David , but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	26	These are the ones who conspired against him : [ e ] Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of [ f ] Shimrith the Moabitess .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	24	27	Now concerning his sons , and ( AC ) the many oracles about him , and the repairing of the house of God , indeed they are written in the [ g ] annals of the book of the kings . ( AD ) Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	25	( Z ) Amaziah the son of Joash , king of Judah , lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz , king of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	3	( D ) Now it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established for him , that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	4	However he did not execute their children , but did as it is written in the Law in the Book of Moses , where the Lord commanded , saying , ( E ) “ The fathers shall not be put to death for their children , nor shall the children be put to death for their fathers ; but a person shall die for his own sin. ” The War Against Edom ( F )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	5	Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds , according to their fathers ’ houses , throughout all Judah and Benjamin ; and he numbered them ( G ) from twenty years old and above , and found them to be three hundred thousand choice men , able to go to war , who could handle spear and shield .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	6	He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	7	But a ( H ) man of God came to him , saying , “ O king , do not let the army of Israel go with you , for the Lord is not with Israel—not with any of the children of Ephraim .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	8	But if you go , be gone ! Be strong in battle ! Even so , God shall make you fall before the enemy ; for God has ( I ) power to help and to overthrow. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	9	Then Amaziah said to the man of God , “ But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel ? ” And the man of God answered , ( J ) “ The Lord is able to give you much more than this. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	10	So Amaziah discharged the troops that had come to him from Ephraim , to go back home . Therefore their anger was greatly aroused against Judah , and they returned home in great anger .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	11	Then Amaziah strengthened himself , and leading his people , he went to ( K ) the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the people of Seir .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	12	Also the children of Judah took captive ten thousand alive , brought them to the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were dashed in pieces .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	13	But as for the soldiers of the army which Amaziah had discharged , so that they would not go with him to battle , they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon , killed three thousand in them , and took much [ a ] spoil .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	14	Now it was so , after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites , that ( L ) he brought the gods of the people of Seir , set them up to be ( M ) his gods , and bowed down before them and burned incense to them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	15	Therefore the anger of the Lord was aroused against Amaziah , and He sent him a prophet who said to him , “ Why have you sought ( N ) the gods of the people , which ( O ) could not rescue their own people from your hand ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	16	So it was , as he talked with him , that the king said to him , “ Have we made you the king ’ s counselor ? Cease ! Why should you be killed ? ” Then the prophet ceased , and said , “ I know that God has ( P ) determined to destroy you , because you have done this and have not heeded my advice. ” Israel Defeats Judah ( Q )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	17	Now ( R ) Amaziah king of Judah asked advice and sent to [ b ] Joash the son of Jehoahaz , the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , “ Come , let us face one another in battle. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	18	And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah , saying , “ The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon , saying , ‘ Give your daughter to my son as wife ’ ; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	19	Indeed you say that you have defeated the Edomites , and your heart is lifted up to ( S ) boast . Stay at home now ; why should you meddle with trouble , that you should fall—you and Judah with you ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	20	But Amaziah would not heed , for ( T ) it came from God , that He might give them into the hand of their enemies , because they ( U ) sought the gods of Edom .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	21	So Joash king of Israel went out ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at ( V ) Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	22	And Judah was defeated by Israel , and every man fled to his tent .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	23	Then Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash , the son of ( W ) Jehoahaz , at Beth Shemesh ; and he brought him to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate—four hundred cubits .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	24	And he took all the gold and silver , all the articles that were found in the house of God with ( X ) Obed-Edom , the treasures of the king ’ s house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria . Death of Amaziah ( Y )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , from first to last , indeed are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	27	After the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord , they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem , and he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	25	28	Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in [ c ] the City of Judah . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	26	Now all the people of Judah took [ a ] Uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king instead of his father Amaziah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king , and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	4	And he did what was ( B ) right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Amaziah had done .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	5	( C ) He sought God in the days of Zechariah , who ( D ) had understanding in the [ c ] visions of God ; and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him ( E ) prosper .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	6	Now he went out and ( F ) made war against the Philistines , and broke down the wall of Gath , the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod ; and he built cities around Ashdod and among the Philistines .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	7	God helped him against ( G ) the Philistines , against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal , and against the Meunites .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	8	Also the Ammonites ( H ) brought tribute to Uzziah . His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt , for he became exceedingly strong .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	9	And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the ( I ) Corner Gate , at the Valley Gate , and at the corner buttress of the wall ; then he fortified them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	10	Also he built towers in the desert . He dug many wells , for he had much livestock , both in the lowlands and in the plains ; he also had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in [ d ] Carmel , for he loved the soil .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	11	Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by companies , according to the number on their roll as prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer , under the hand of Hananiah , one of the king ’ s captains .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	12	The total number of [ e ] chief officers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	13	And under their authority was an army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred , that made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	14	Then Uzziah prepared for them , for the entire army , shields , spears , helmets , body armor , bows , and slings to cast stones .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	15	And he made devices in Jerusalem , invented by ( J ) skillful men , to be on the towers and the corners , to shoot arrows and large stones . So his fame spread far and wide , for he was marvelously helped till he became strong . The Penalty for Uzziah ’ s Pride ( K )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	16	But ( L ) when he was strong his heart was ( M ) lifted up , to his destruction , for he transgressed against the Lord his God ( N ) by entering the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	17	So ( O ) Azariah the priest went in after him , and with him were eighty priests of the Lord—valiant men .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	18	And they withstood King Uzziah , and said to him , “ It ( P ) is not for you , Uzziah , to burn incense to the Lord , but for the ( Q ) priests , the sons of Aaron , who are consecrated to burn incense . Get out of the sanctuary , for you have trespassed ! You shall have no honor from the Lord God. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	19	Then Uzziah became furious ; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense . And while he was angry with the priests , ( R ) leprosy broke out on his forehead , before the priests in the house of the Lord , beside the incense altar .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	20	And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him , and there , on his forehead , he was leprous ; so they thrust him out of that place . Indeed he also ( S ) hurried to get out , because the Lord had struck him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	21	( T ) King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death . He dwelt in an ( U ) isolated house , because he was a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord . Then Jotham his son was over the king ’ s house , judging the people of the land .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , from first to last , the prophet ( V ) Isaiah the son of Amoz wrote .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	26	23	( W ) So Uzziah [ f ] rested with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings , for they said , “ He is a leper. ” Then Jotham his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	28	Ahaz ( B ) was twenty years old when he became king , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem ; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord , as his father David had done .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	3	He burned incense in ( E ) the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , and burned ( F ) his children in the ( G ) fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord had ( H ) cast out before the children of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	4	And he sacrificed and burned incense on the [ a ] high places , on the hills , and under every green tree . Syria and Israel Defeat Judah ( I )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	5	Therefore ( J ) the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria . They ( K ) defeated him , and carried away a great multitude of them as captives , and brought them to Damascus . Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel , who defeated him with a great slaughter .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	6	For ( L ) Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day , all valiant men , ( M ) because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	7	Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , killed Maaseiah the king ’ s son , Azrikam the officer over the house , and Elkanah who was second to the king .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	8	And the children of Israel carried away captive of their ( N ) brethren two hundred thousand women , sons , and daughters ; and they also took away much [ b ] spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria . Israel Returns the Captives
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	9	But a ( O ) prophet of the Lord was there , whose name was Oded ; and he went out before the army that came to Samaria , and said to them : “ Look , ( P ) because the Lord God of your fathers was angry with Judah , He has delivered them into your hand ; but you have killed them in a rage that ( Q ) reaches up to heaven .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	10	And now you propose to force the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your ( R ) male and female slaves ; but are you not also guilty before the Lord your God ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Now hear me , therefore , and return the captives , whom you have taken captive from your brethren , ( S ) for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	12	Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against those who came from the war ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	13	and said to them , “ You shall not bring the captives here , for we already have offended the Lord . You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt ; for our guilt is great , and there is fierce wrath against Israel. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	14	So the armed men left the captives and the [ c ] spoil before the leaders and all the assembly .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	15	Then the men ( T ) who were designated by name rose up and took the captives , and from the [ d ] spoil they clothed all who were naked among them , dressed them and gave them sandals , ( U ) gave them food and drink , and anointed them ; and they let all the feeble ones ride on donkeys . So they brought them to their brethren at Jericho , ( V ) the city of palm trees . Then they returned to Samaria . Assyria Refuses to Help Judah ( W )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	16	( X ) At the same time King Ahaz sent to the [ e ] kings of Assyria to help him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	17	For again the ( Y ) Edomites had come , attacked Judah , and carried away captives .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	18	( Z ) The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the South of Judah , and had taken Beth Shemesh , Aijalon , Gederoth , Sochoh with its villages , Timnah with its villages , and Gimzo with its villages ; and they dwelt there .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	19	For the Lord [ f ] brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of ( AA ) Israel , for he had ( AB ) encouraged moral decline in Judah and had been continually unfaithful to the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	20	) -
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	21	For Ahaz took part of the treasures from the house of the Lord , from the house of the king , and from the leaders , and he gave it to the king of Assyria ; but he did not help him . Apostasy and Death of Ahaz ( AD )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	22	Now in the time of his distress King Ahaz became increasingly unfaithful to the Lord . This is that King Ahaz .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	23	For ( AE ) he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him , saying , “ Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them , I will sacrifice to them ( AF ) that they may help me. ” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	24	So Ahaz gathered the articles of the house of God , cut in pieces the articles of the house of God , ( AG ) shut up the doors of the house of the Lord , and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	25	And in every single city of Judah he made [ h ] high places to burn incense to other gods , and provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	26	( AH ) Now the rest of his acts and all his ways , from first to last , indeed they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	28	27	So Ahaz [ i ] rested with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , in Jerusalem ; but they ( AI ) did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel . Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	29	And when they had finished offering , ( AE ) the king and all who were present with him bowed and worshiped .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	3	In the first year of his reign , in the first month , he ( C ) opened the doors of the house of the Lord and repaired them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	4	Then he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them in the East Square ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	5	and said to them : “ Hear me , Levites ! Now [ b ] sanctify yourselves , ( D ) sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers , and carry out the rubbish from the holy place .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	6	For our fathers have trespassed and done evil in the eyes of the Lord our God ; they have forsaken Him , have ( E ) turned their faces away from the [ c ] dwelling place of the Lord , and turned their backs on Him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	7	( F ) They have also shut up the doors of the vestibule , put out the lamps , and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	8	Therefore the ( G ) wrath of the Lord fell upon Judah and Jerusalem , and He has ( H ) given them up to trouble , to desolation , and to ( I ) jeering , as you see with your ( J ) eyes .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	9	For indeed , because of this ( K ) our fathers have fallen by the sword ; and our sons , our daughters , and our wives are in captivity .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	10	“ Now it is in my heart to make ( L ) a covenant with the Lord God of Israel , that His fierce wrath may turn away from us .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	11	My sons , do not be negligent now , for the Lord has ( M ) chosen you to stand before Him , to serve Him , and that you should minister to Him and burn incense. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	12	Then these Levites arose : ( N ) Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah , of the sons of the ( O ) Kohathites ; of the sons of Merari , Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel ; of the Gershonites , Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	13	of the sons of Elizaphan , Shimri and Jeiel ; of the sons of Asaph , Zechariah and Mattaniah ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	14	of the sons of Heman , Jehiel and Shimei ; and of the sons of Jeduthun , Shemaiah and Uzziel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	15	And they gathered their brethren , ( P ) sanctified [ d ] themselves , and went according to the commandment of the king , at the words of the Lord , ( Q ) to cleanse the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	16	Then the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to cleanse it , and brought out all the debris that they found in the temple of the Lord to the court of the house of the Lord . And the Levites took it out and carried it to the Brook ( R ) Kidron .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	17	Now they began to [ e ] sanctify on the first day of the first month , and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the Lord . So they sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days , and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	18	Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said , “ We have cleansed all the house of the Lord , the altar of burnt offerings with all its articles , and the table of the showbread with all its articles .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	19	Moreover all the articles which King Ahaz in his reign had ( S ) cast aside in his transgression we have prepared and [ f ] sanctified ; and there they are , before the altar of the Lord. ” Hezekiah Restores Temple Worship
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	20	Then King Hezekiah rose early , gathered the rulers of the city , and went up to the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	21	And they brought seven bulls , seven rams , seven lambs , and seven male goats for a ( T ) sin offering for the kingdom , for the sanctuary , and for Judah . Then he commanded the priests , the sons of Aaron , to offer them on the altar of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	22	So they killed the bulls , and the priests received the blood and ( U ) sprinkled it on the altar . Likewise they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar . They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	23	Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly , and they laid their ( V ) hands on them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	24	And the priests killed them ; and they presented their blood on the altar as a sin offering ( W ) to make an atonement for all Israel , for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering be made for all Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	25	( X ) And he stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals , with stringed instruments , and with harps , ( Y ) according to the commandment of David , of ( Z ) Gad the king ’ s seer , and of Nathan the prophet ; ( AA ) for thus was the commandment of the Lord by His prophets .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	26	The Levites stood with the instruments ( AB ) of David , and the priests with ( AC ) the trumpets .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	27	Then Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar . And when the burnt offering began , ( AD ) the song of the Lord also began , with the trumpets and with the instruments of David king of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	28	So all the assembly worshiped , the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded ; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	30	Moreover King Hezekiah and the leaders commanded the Levites to sing praise to the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph the seer . So they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	31	Then Hezekiah answered and said , “ Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the Lord , come near , and bring sacrifices and ( AF ) thank offerings into the house of the Lord. ” So the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings , and as many as were of a ( AG ) willing heart brought burnt offerings .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	32	And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls , one hundred rams , and two hundred lambs ; all these were for a burnt offering to the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	33	The consecrated things were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	34	But the priests were too few , so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings ; therefore ( AH ) their brethren the Levites helped them until the work was ended and until the other priests had [ g ] sanctified themselves , ( AI ) for the Levites were ( AJ ) more diligent in ( AK ) sanctifying themselves than the priests .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	35	Also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with ( AL ) the fat of the peace offerings and with ( AM ) the drink offerings for every burnt offering . So the service of the house of the Lord was set in order .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	29	36	Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced that God had prepared the people , since the events took place so suddenly . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	30	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem , to keep the Passover to the Lord God of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	3	For they could not keep it ( B ) at [ a ] the regular time , ( C ) because a sufficient number of priests had not consecrated themselves , nor had the people gathered together at Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	4	And the matter pleased the king and all the assembly .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	5	So they [ b ] resolved to make a proclamation throughout all Israel , from Beersheba to Dan , that they should come to keep the Passover to the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem , since they had not done it for a long time in the prescribed manner .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	6	Then the ( D ) runners went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the king and his leaders , and spoke according to the command of the king : “ Children of Israel , ( E ) return to the Lord God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel ; then He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of ( F ) the kings of ( G ) Assyria .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	7	And do not be ( H ) like your fathers and your brethren , who trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers , so that He ( I ) gave them up to ( J ) desolation , as you see .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	8	Now do not be ( K ) stiff-necked , [ c ] as your fathers were , but yield yourselves to the Lord ; and enter His sanctuary , which He has sanctified forever , and serve the Lord your God , ( L ) that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	9	For if you return to the Lord , your brethren and your children will be treated with ( M ) compassion by those who lead them captive , so that they may come back to this land ; for the Lord your God is ( N ) gracious and merciful , and will not turn His face from you if you ( O ) return to Him. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	10	So the runners passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh , as far as Zebulun ; but ( P ) they laughed at them and mocked them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	11	Nevertheless ( Q ) some from Asher , Manasseh , and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	12	Also ( R ) the hand of God was on Judah to give them singleness of heart to obey the command of the king and the leaders , ( S ) at the word of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	13	Now many people , a very great assembly , gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of ( T ) Unleavened Bread in the second month .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	14	They arose and took away the ( U ) altars that were in Jerusalem , and they took away all the incense altars and cast them into the Brook ( V ) Kidron .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	15	Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the second month . The priests and the Levites [ d ] were ( W ) ashamed , and [ e ] sanctified themselves , and brought the burnt offerings to the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	16	They stood in their ( X ) place [ f ] according to their custom , according to the Law of Moses the man of God ; the priests sprinkled the blood received from the hand of the Levites .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	17	For there were many in the assembly who had not [ g ] sanctified themselves ; ( Y ) therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover lambs for everyone who was not clean , to sanctify them to the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	18	For a multitude of the people , ( Z ) many from Ephraim , Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun , had not cleansed themselves , ( AA ) yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written . But Hezekiah prayed for them , saying , “ May the good Lord provide atonement for everyone
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	19	who ( AB ) prepares his heart to seek God , the Lord God of his fathers , though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	20	And the Lord listened to Hezekiah and healed the people .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	21	So the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept ( AC ) the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness ; and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day , singing to the Lord , accompanied by loud instruments .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	22	And Hezekiah gave encouragement to all the Levites ( AD ) who taught the good knowledge of the Lord ; and they ate throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings and ( AE ) making confession to the Lord God of their fathers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	23	Then the whole assembly agreed to keep the feast ( AF ) another seven days , and they kept it another seven days with gladness .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	24	For Hezekiah king of Judah ( AG ) gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep , and the leaders gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep ; and a great number of priests ( AH ) sanctified [ h ] themselves .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	25	The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced , also the priests and Levites , all the assembly that came from Israel , the sojourners ( AI ) who came from the land of Israel , and those who dwelt in Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem , for since the time of ( AJ ) Solomon the son of David , king of Israel , there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	30	27	Then the priests , the Levites , arose and ( AK ) blessed the people , and their voice was heard ; and their prayer came up to ( AL ) His holy dwelling place , to heaven . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	31	Now when all this was finished , all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and ( B ) broke the sacred pillars in pieces , cut down the wooden images , and threw down the [ a ] high places and the altars—from all Judah , Benjamin , Ephraim , and Manasseh—until they had utterly destroyed them all . Then all the children of Israel returned to their own cities , every man to his possession .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	3	The king also appointed a [ c ] portion of his ( E ) possessions [ d ] for the burnt offerings : for the morning and evening burnt offerings , the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and the New Moons and the set feasts , as it is written in the ( F ) Law of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	4	Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute ( G ) support [ e ] for the priests and the Levites , that they might devote themselves to ( H ) the Law of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	5	As soon as the commandment was circulated , the children of Israel brought in abundance ( I ) the firstfruits of grain and wine , oil and honey , and of all the produce of the field ; and they brought in abundantly the ( J ) tithe of everything .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	6	And the children of Israel and Judah , who dwelt in the cities of Judah , brought the tithe of oxen and sheep ; also the ( K ) tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the Lord their God they laid in heaps .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	7	In the third month they began laying them in heaps , and they finished in the seventh month .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	8	And when Hezekiah and the leaders came and saw the heaps , they blessed the Lord and His people Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	9	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	10	And Azariah the chief priest , from the ( L ) house of Zadok , answered him and said , ( M ) “ Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord , we have had enough to eat and have plenty left , for the Lord has blessed His people ; and what is left is this great ( N ) abundance. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	11	Now Hezekiah commanded them to prepare ( O ) rooms [ f ] in the house of the Lord , and they prepared them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	12	Then they faithfully brought in the offerings , the tithes , and the dedicated things ; ( P ) Cononiah the Levite had charge of them , and Shimei his brother was the next .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	13	Jehiel , Azaziah , Nahath , Asahel , Jerimoth , Jozabad , Eliel , Ismachiah , Mahath , and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother , at the commandment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ( Q ) ruler of the house of God .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	14	Kore the son of Imnah the Levite , the keeper of the East Gate , was over the ( R ) freewill offerings to God , to distribute the offerings of the Lord and the most holy things .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	15	And under him were ( S ) Eden , Miniamin , Jeshua , Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shecaniah , his faithful assistants in ( T ) the cities of the priests , to distribute ( U ) allotments to their brethren by divisions , to the great as well as the small .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	16	Besides those males from three years old and up who were written in the genealogy , they distributed to everyone who entered the house of the Lord his daily portion for the work of his service , by his division ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	17	and to the priests who were written in the genealogy according to their father ’ s house , and to the Levites ( V ) from twenty years old and up according to their work , by their divisions ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	18	and to all who were written in the genealogy—their little ones and their wives , their sons and daughters , the whole company of them—for in their faithfulness they [ g ] sanctified themselves in holiness .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	19	Also for the sons of Aaron the priests , who were in ( W ) the fields of the common-lands of their cities , in every single city , there were men who were ( X ) designated by name to distribute portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed by genealogies among the Levites .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	20	Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah , and he ( Y ) did what was good and right and true before the Lord his God .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	31	21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God , in the law and in the commandment , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart . So he ( Z ) prospered . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	3	he consulted with his leaders and [ a ] commanders to stop the water from the springs which were outside the city ; and they helped him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	4	Thus many people gathered together who stopped all the ( C ) springs and the brook that ran through the land , saying , “ Why should the [ b ] kings of Assyria come and find much water ? ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	5	And ( D ) he strengthened himself , ( E ) built up all the wall that was broken , raised it up to the towers , and built another wall outside ; also he repaired [ c ] the ( F ) Millo in the City of David , and made [ d ] weapons and shields in abundance .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	9	( M ) After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem ( but he and all the forces with him laid siege against Lachish ) , to Hezekiah king of Judah , and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem , saying ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	10	( N ) “ Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria : ‘ In what do you trust , that you remain under siege in Jerusalem ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	11	Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ( O ) “ The Lord our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria ” ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	12	( P ) Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem , saying , “ You shall worship before one altar and burn incense on ( Q ) it ” ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	13	Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands ? ( R ) Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	14	Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people from my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you from my ( S ) hand ?
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	15	Now therefore , ( T ) do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you like this , and do not believe him ; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers . How much less will your God deliver you from my hand ? ’ ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	16	Furthermore , his servants spoke against the Lord God and against His servant Hezekiah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	17	He also wrote letters to revile the Lord God of Israel , and to speak against Him , saying , ( U ) “ As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people from my hand , so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my ( V ) hand. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	18	( W ) Then they called out with a loud voice in [ e ] Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten them and trouble them , that they might take the city .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	19	And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem , as against the gods of the people of the earth— ( X ) the work of men ’ s hands . Sennacherib ’ s Defeat and Death ( Y )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	20	( Z ) Now because of this King Hezekiah and ( AA ) the prophet Isaiah , the son of Amoz , prayed and cried out to heaven .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	21	( AB ) Then the Lord sent an angel who cut down every mighty man of valor , leader , and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria . So he returned ( AC ) shamefaced to his own land . And when he had gone into the temple of his god , some of his own offspring struck him down with the sword there .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	22	Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all others , and [ f ] guided them on every side .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	23	And many brought gifts to the Lord at Jerusalem , and ( AD ) presents [ g ] to Hezekiah king of Judah , so that he was ( AE ) exalted in the sight of all nations thereafter . Hezekiah Humbles Himself ( AF )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	24	( AG ) In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death , and he prayed to the Lord ; and He spoke to him and gave him a sign .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	25	But Hezekiah ( AH ) did not repay according to the favor shown him , for ( AI ) his heart was lifted up ; ( AJ ) therefore wrath was looming over him and over Judah and Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	26	( AK ) Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them ( AL ) in the days of Hezekiah . Hezekiah ’ s Wealth and Honor ( AM )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	27	Hezekiah had very great riches and honor . And he made himself treasuries for silver , for gold , for precious stones , for spices , for shields , and for all kinds of desirable items ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	28	storehouses for the harvest of grain , wine , and oil ; and stalls for all kinds of livestock , and [ h ] folds for flocks .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	29	Moreover he provided cities for himself , and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance ; for ( AN ) God had given him very much property .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	30	( AO ) This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of Upper Gihon , and [ i ] brought the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David . Hezekiah ( AP ) prospered in all his works .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	31	However , regarding the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , whom they ( AQ ) sent to him to inquire about the wonder that was done in the land , God withdrew from him , in order to ( AR ) test him , that He might know all that was in his heart . Death of Hezekiah
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	32	33	( AU ) So Hezekiah [ j ] rested with his fathers , and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of David ; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem ( AV ) honored him at his death . Then Manasseh his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	33	Manasseh ( B ) was twelve years old when he became king , and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	3	For he rebuilt the [ a ] high places which Hezekiah his father had ( D ) broken down ; he raised up altars for the Baals , and ( E ) made wooden images ; and he worshiped ( F ) all [ b ] the host of heaven and served them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	4	He also built altars in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord had said , ( G ) “ In Jerusalem shall My name be forever. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven ( H ) in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	6	( I ) Also he caused his sons to pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom ; he practiced ( J ) soothsaying , used witchcraft and sorcery , and ( K ) consulted mediums and spiritists . He did much evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke Him to anger .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	7	( L ) He even set a carved image , the idol which he had made , in the [ c ] house of God , of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son , ( M ) “ In this house and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , I will put My name forever ;
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	8	( N ) and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers—only if they are careful to do all that I have commanded them , according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	9	So Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel . Manasseh Restored After Repentance
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	10	And the Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people , but they would not [ d ] listen .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	11	( O ) Therefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria , who took Manasseh with [ e ] hooks , ( P ) bound him with [ f ] bronze fetters , and carried him off to Babylon .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	12	Now when he was in affliction , he implored the Lord his God , and ( Q ) humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	13	and prayed to Him ; and He ( R ) received his entreaty , heard his supplication , and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom . Then Manasseh ( S ) knew that the Lord was God .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	14	After this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of ( T ) Gihon , in the valley , as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate ; and it ( U ) enclosed Ophel , and he raised it to a very great height . Then he put military captains in all the fortified cities of Judah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	15	He took away ( V ) the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the Lord , and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem ; and he cast them out of the city .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	16	He also repaired the altar of the Lord , sacrificed peace offerings and ( W ) thank offerings on it , and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	17	( X ) Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the [ g ] high places , but only to the Lord their God . Death of Manasseh ( Y )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , his prayer to his God , and the words of ( Z ) the seers who spoke to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel , indeed they are written in the [ h ] book of the kings of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	19	Also his prayer and how God received his entreaty , and all his sin and trespass , and the sites where he built [ i ] high places and set up wooden images and carved images , before he was humbled , indeed they are written among the sayings of [ j ] Hozai .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	20	( AA ) So Manasseh rested with his fathers , and they buried him in his own house . Then his son Amon reigned in his place . Amon ’ s Reign and Death ( AB )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	21	( AC ) Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	22	But he did evil in the sight of the Lord , as his father Manasseh had done ; for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made , and served them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	23	And he did not humble himself before the Lord , ( AD ) as his father Manasseh had humbled himself ; but Amon trespassed more and more .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	24	( AE ) Then his servants conspired against him , and ( AF ) killed him in his own house .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	33	25	But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon . Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	34	Josiah ( B ) was eight years old when he became king , and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	3	For in the eighth year of his reign , while he was still ( C ) young , he began to ( D ) seek the God of his father David ; and in the twelfth year he began ( E ) to purge Judah and Jerusalem ( F ) of the [ a ] high places , the wooden images , the carved images , and the molded images .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	4	( G ) They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence , and the incense altars which were above them he cut down ; and the wooden images , the carved images , and the molded images he broke in pieces , and made dust of them ( H ) and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	5	He also ( I ) burned the bones of the priests on their ( J ) altars , and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	6	And so he did in the cities of Manasseh , Ephraim , and Simeon , as far as Naphtali and all around , with [ b ] axes .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	7	When he had broken down the altars and the wooden images , had ( K ) beaten the carved images into powder , and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel , he returned to Jerusalem . Hilkiah Finds the Book of the Law ( L )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	8	( M ) In the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land and the [ c ] temple , he sent ( N ) Shaphan the son of Azaliah , Maaseiah the ( O ) governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the Lord his God .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	9	When they came to Hilkiah the high priest , they delivered ( P ) the money that was brought into the house of God , which the Levites who kept the doors had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim , from all the ( Q ) remnant of Israel , from all Judah and Benjamin , and which they had brought back to Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	10	Then they put it in the hand of the foremen who had the oversight of the house of the Lord ; and they gave it to the workmen who worked in the house of the Lord , to repair and restore the house .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	11	They gave it to the craftsmen and builders to buy hewn stone and timber for beams , and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	12	And the men did the work faithfully . Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites , of the sons of Merari , and Zechariah and Meshullam , of the sons of the Kohathites , to supervise . Others of the Levites , all of whom were skillful with instruments of music ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	13	were ( R ) over the burden bearers and were overseers of all who did work in any kind of service . ( S ) And some of the Levites were scribes , officers , and gatekeepers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	14	Now when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , Hilkiah the priest ( T ) found the Book of the Law of the Lord given by Moses .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	15	Then Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe , “ I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord. ” And Hilkiah gave the ( U ) book to Shaphan .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	16	So Shaphan carried the book to the king , bringing the king word , saying , “ All that was committed to your servants they are doing .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	17	And they have [ d ] gathered the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	18	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , “ Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. ” And Shaphan read it before the king .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	19	Thus it happened , when the king heard the words of the Law , that he tore his clothes .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	20	Then the king commanded Hilkiah , ( V ) Ahikam the son of Shaphan , [ e ] Abdon the son of Micah , Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king , saying ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	21	“ Go , inquire of the Lord for me , and for those who are left in Israel and Judah , concerning the words of the book that is found ; for great is the wrath of the Lord that is poured out on us , because our fathers have not ( W ) kept the word of the Lord , to do according to all that is written in this book. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	22	So Hilkiah and those the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of [ f ] Tokhath , the son of [ g ] Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe . ( She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter . ) And they spoke to her to that effect .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	23	Then she answered them , “ Thus says the Lord God of Israel , ‘ Tell the man who sent you to Me ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	24	“ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will ( X ) bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants , all the curses that are written in the ( Y ) book which they have read before the king of Judah ,
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	25	because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods , that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands . Therefore My wrath will be poured out on this place , and not be quenched. ’ ” ’
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	26	But as for the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of the Lord , in this manner you shall speak to him , ‘ Thus says the Lord God of Israel : “ Concerning the words which you have heard—
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	27	because your heart was tender , and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants , and you humbled yourself before Me , and you tore your clothes and wept before Me , I also have heard you , ” says the ( Z ) Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	28	“ Surely I will gather you to your fathers , and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace ; and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I will bring on this place and its inhabitants. ” ’ ” So they brought back word to the king . Josiah Restores True Worship ( AA )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	29	( AB ) Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	30	The king went up to the house of the Lord , with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—the priests and the Levites , and all the people , great and small . And he ( AC ) read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	31	Then the king ( AD ) stood in ( AE ) his place and made a ( AF ) covenant before the Lord , to follow the Lord , and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul , to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	32	And he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin take a stand . So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	34	33	Thus Josiah removed all the ( AG ) abominations from all the country that belonged to the children of Israel , and made all who were present in Israel [ h ] diligently serve the Lord their God . ( AH ) All his days they did not depart from following the Lord God of their fathers . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	35	Now ( B ) Josiah kept a Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem , and they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the ( C ) fourteenth day of the first month .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	3	Then he said to the Levites ( F ) who taught all Israel , who were holy to the Lord : ( G ) “ Put the holy ark ( H ) in the house which Solomon the son of David , king of Israel , built . ( I ) It shall no longer be a burden on your shoulders . Now serve the Lord your God and His people Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	4	Prepare yourselves ( J ) according to your fathers ’ [ a ] houses , according to your divisions , following the ( K ) written instruction of David king of Israel and the ( L ) written instruction of Solomon his son .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	5	And ( M ) stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers ’ houses of your brethren the lay people , and according to the division of the father ’ s house of the Levites .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	6	So slaughter the Passover offerings , ( N ) consecrate yourselves , and prepare them for your brethren , that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	7	Then Josiah ( O ) gave the lay people lambs and young goats from the flock , all for Passover offerings for all who were present , to the number of thirty thousand , as well as three thousand cattle ; these were from the king ’ s ( P ) possessions .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	8	And his ( Q ) leaders gave willingly to the people , to the priests , and to the Levites . Hilkiah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , rulers of the house of God , gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred from the flock , and three hundred cattle .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	9	Also ( R ) Conaniah , his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel , and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad , chief of the Levites , gave to the Levites for Passover offerings five thousand from the flock and five hundred cattle .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	10	So the service was prepared , and the priests ( S ) stood in their places , and the ( T ) Levites in their divisions , according to the king ’ s command .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	11	And they slaughtered the Passover offerings ; and the priests ( U ) sprinkled the blood with their hands , while the Levites ( V ) skinned the animals .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	12	Then they removed the burnt offerings that they might give them to the divisions of the fathers ’ houses of the lay people , to offer to the Lord , as it is written ( W ) in the Book of Moses . And so they did with the cattle .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	13	Also they ( X ) roasted the Passover offerings with fire according to the ordinance ; but the other holy offerings they ( Y ) boiled in pots , in caldrons , and in pans , and divided them quickly among all the lay people .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	14	Then afterward they prepared portions for themselves and for the priests , because the priests , the sons of Aaron , were busy in offering burnt offerings and fat until night ; therefore the Levites prepared portions for themselves and for the priests , the sons of Aaron .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	15	And the singers , the sons of Asaph , were in their places , according to the ( Z ) command of David , Asaph , Heman , and Jeduthun the king ’ s seer . Also the gatekeepers ( AA ) were at each gate ; they did not have to leave their position , because their brethren the Levites prepared portions for them .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	16	So all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day , to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord , according to the command of King Josiah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	17	And the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time , and the Feast of ( AB ) Unleavened Bread for seven days .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	18	( AC ) There had been no Passover kept in Israel like that since the days of Samuel the prophet ; and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as Josiah kept , with the priests and the Levites , all Judah and Israel who were present , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept . Josiah Dies in Battle ( AD )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	20	( AE ) After all this , when Josiah had prepared the temple , Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against ( AF ) Carchemish by the Euphrates ; and Josiah went out against him .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	21	But he sent messengers to him , saying , “ What have I to do with you , king of Judah ? I have not come against you this day , but against the house with which I have war ; for God commanded me to make haste . Refrain from meddling with God , who is with me , lest He destroy you. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	22	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him , but ( AG ) disguised himself so that he might fight with him , and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God . So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	23	And the archers shot King Josiah ; and the king said to his servants , “ Take me away , for I am severely wounded. ”
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	24	( AH ) His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had , and they brought him to Jerusalem . So he died , and was buried in one of the tombs of his fathers . And ( AI ) all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	35	25	Jeremiah also ( AJ ) lamented for ( AK ) Josiah . And to this day ( AL ) all the singing men and the singing women speak of Josiah in their lamentations . ( AM ) They made it a custom in Israel ; and indeed they are written in the Laments .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	36	3	Now the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem ; and he imposed on the land a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	36	4	Then the king of Egypt made [ b ] Jehoahaz ’ s brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem , and changed his name to Jehoiakim . And Necho took [ c ] Jehoahaz his brother and carried him off to Egypt . The Reign and Captivity of Jehoiakim ( C )

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	36	11	( O ) Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem .

NKJV	2%20Chronicles	36	13	And he also ( Q ) rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear an oath by God ; but he ( R ) stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the Lord God of Israel .
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	36	14	Moreover all the leaders of the priests and the people transgressed more and more , according to all the abominations of the nations , and defiled the house of the Lord which He had consecrated in Jerusalem . The Fall of Jerusalem ( S )
NKJV	2%20Chronicles	36	15	( T ) And the Lord God of their fathers sent warnings to them by His messengers , rising up early and sending them , because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place .

NKJV	Ezra	3	3	Though fear had come upon them because of the people of those countries , they set the altar on its [ c ] bases ; and they offered ( F ) burnt offerings on it to the Lord , both the morning and evening burnt offerings .
NKJV	Ezra	3	2	Then [ a ] Jeshua the son of ( B ) Jozadak [ b ] and his brethren the priests , ( C ) and Zerubbabel the son of ( D ) Shealtiel and his brethren , arose and built the altar of the God of Israel , to offer burnt offerings on it , as it is ( E ) written in the Law of Moses the man of God .
NKJV	Ezra	3	4	( G ) They also kept the Feast of Tabernacles , ( H ) as it is written , and ( I ) offered the daily burnt offerings in the number required by ordinance for each day .
NKJV	Ezra	3	5	Afterwards they offered the ( J ) regular burnt offering , and those for New Moons and for all the appointed feasts of the Lord that were consecrated , and those of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to the Lord .
NKJV	Ezra	3	6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord , although the foundation of the temple of the Lord had not been laid .
NKJV	Ezra	3	7	They also gave money to the masons and the carpenters , and ( K ) food , drink , and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to the sea , to ( L ) Joppa , ( M ) according to the permission which they had from Cyrus king of Persia . Restoration of the Temple Begins
NKJV	Ezra	3	8	Now in the second month of the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem , ( N ) Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , Jeshua the son of [ d ] Jozadak , and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites , and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem , began work ( O ) and appointed the Levites from twenty years old and above to oversee the work of the house of the Lord .
NKJV	Ezra	3	9	Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers , Kadmiel with his sons , and the sons of [ e ] Judah , arose as one to oversee those working on the house of God : the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brethren the Levites .
NKJV	Ezra	3	10	When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord , ( P ) the [ f ] priests stood in their apparel with trumpets , and the Levites , the sons of Asaph , with cymbals , to praise the Lord , according to the ( Q ) ordinance [ g ] of David king of Israel .
NKJV	Ezra	3	11	( R ) And they sang responsively , praising and giving thanks to the Lord : Then all the people shouted with a great shout , when they praised the Lord , because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid .
NKJV	Ezra	3	12	But many of the priests and Levites and ( U ) heads of the fathers ’ houses , old men who had seen the first temple , wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this temple was laid before their eyes . Yet many shouted aloud for joy ,
NKJV	Ezra	3	13	so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people , for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the sound was heard afar off . Footnotes - Ezra 3:2 Or Joshua - Ezra 3:2 Jehozadak ,

NKJV	Ezra	4	4	Then ( E ) the people of the land tried to discourage the people of Judah . They troubled them in building ,
NKJV	Ezra	4	2	they came to Zerubbabel and the heads of the fathers ’ houses , and said to them , “ Let us build with you , for we seek your God as you do ; and we have sacrificed to Him ( B ) since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria , who brought us here. ”
NKJV	Ezra	4	3	But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the fathers ’ houses of Israel said to them , ( C ) “ You may do nothing with us to build a [ b ] house for our God ; but we alone will build to the Lord God of Israel , as ( D ) King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us. ”
NKJV	Ezra	4	5	and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of ( F ) Darius king of Persia . Rebuilding of Jerusalem Opposed
NKJV	Ezra	4	6	In the reign of Ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem .
NKJV	Ezra	4	7	In the days of ( G ) Artaxerxes also , [ c ] Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabel , and the rest of their companions wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia ; and the letter was written in ( H ) Aramaic script , and translated into the Aramaic language .
NKJV	Ezra	4	8	[ d ] Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes in this fashion :
NKJV	Ezra	4	9	[ e ] From Rehum the commander , Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions—representatives of ( I ) the Dinaites , the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the people of Persia and Erech and Babylon and [ f ] Shushan , the Dehavites , the Elamites ,
NKJV	Ezra	4	10	( J ) and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnapper took captive and settled in the cities of Samaria and the remainder beyond [ g ] the River— ( K ) and [ h ] so forth .
NKJV	Ezra	4	11	( This is a copy of the letter that they sent him . ) To King Artaxerxes from your servants , the men of the region beyond the River , [ i ] and so forth :
NKJV	Ezra	4	12	Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem , and are building the ( L ) rebellious and evil city , and are finishing its ( M ) walls and repairing the foundations .
NKJV	Ezra	4	13	Let it now be known to the king that , if this city is built and the walls completed , they will not pay ( N ) tax , tribute , or custom , and the king ’ s treasury will be diminished .
NKJV	Ezra	4	14	Now because we receive support from the palace , it was not proper for us to see the king ’ s dishonor ; therefore we have sent and informed the king ,
NKJV	Ezra	4	15	that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers . And you will find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city , harmful to kings and provinces , and that they have incited sedition within the city in former times , for which cause this city was destroyed .
NKJV	Ezra	4	16	We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed , the result will be that you will have no dominion beyond the River .
NKJV	Ezra	4	17	The king sent an answer : To Rehum the commander , to Shimshai the scribe , to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria , and to the remainder beyond the River : Peace , [ j ] and so forth .
NKJV	Ezra	4	18	The letter which you sent to us has been clearly read before me .
NKJV	Ezra	4	19	And [ k ] I gave the command , and a search has been made , and it was found that this city in former times has revolted against kings , and rebellion and sedition have been fostered in it .
NKJV	Ezra	4	20	There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem , who have ( O ) ruled over all the region ( P ) beyond the River ; and tax , tribute , and custom were paid to them .
NKJV	Ezra	4	21	Now [ l ] give the command to make these men cease , that this city may not be built until the command is given by me .
NKJV	Ezra	4	22	Take heed now that you do not fail to do this . Why should damage increase to the hurt of the kings ?
NKJV	Ezra	4	23	Now when the copy of King Artaxerxes ’ letter was read before Rehum , Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went up in haste to Jerusalem against the Jews , and by force of arms made them cease .
NKJV	Ezra	4	24	Thus the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ceased , and it was discontinued until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia .

NKJV	Ezra	5	5	But ( I ) the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , so that they could not make them cease till a report could go to Darius . Then a ( J ) written answer was returned concerning this matter .
NKJV	Ezra	5	2	So ( D ) Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of [ a ] Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God which is in Jerusalem ; and ( E ) the prophets of God were with them , helping them .
NKJV	Ezra	5	3	At the same time ( F ) Tattenai the governor of the region beyond [ b ] the River and Shethar-Boznai and their companions came to them and spoke thus to them : ( G ) “ Who has commanded you to build this [ c ] temple and finish this wall ? ”
NKJV	Ezra	5	4	( H ) Then , accordingly , we told them the names of the men who were constructing this building .
NKJV	Ezra	5	6	This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai sent : The governor of the region beyond the River , and Shethar-Boznai , ( K ) and his companions , the Persians who were in the region beyond the River , to Darius the king .
NKJV	Ezra	5	7	( They sent a letter to him , in which was written thus . ) To Darius the king : All peace .
NKJV	Ezra	5	8	Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judea , to the [ d ] temple of the great God , which is being built with [ e ] heavy stones , and timber is being laid in the walls ; and this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands .
NKJV	Ezra	5	9	Then we asked those elders , and spoke thus to them : ( L ) “ Who commanded you to build this temple and to finish these walls ? ”
NKJV	Ezra	5	10	We also asked them their names to inform you , that we might write the names of the men who were chief among them .
NKJV	Ezra	5	11	And thus they returned us an answer , saying : “ We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth , and we are rebuilding the [ f ] temple that was built many years ago , which a great king of Israel built ( M ) and completed .
NKJV	Ezra	5	12	But ( N ) because our fathers provoked the God of heaven to wrath , He gave them into the hand of ( O ) Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this temple and ( P ) carried the people away to Babylon .
NKJV	Ezra	5	13	However , in the first year of ( Q ) Cyrus king of Babylon , King Cyrus issued a decree to build this [ g ] house of God .
NKJV	Ezra	5	14	Also , ( R ) the gold and silver articles of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple that was in Jerusalem and carried into the temple of Babylon—those King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon , and they were given to ( S ) one named Sheshbazzar , whom he had made governor .
NKJV	Ezra	5	15	And he said to him , ‘ Take these articles ; go , carry them to the temple site that is in Jerusalem , and let the house of God be rebuilt on its former site. ’
NKJV	Ezra	5	16	Then the same Sheshbazzar came and ( T ) laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem ; but from that time even until now it has been under construction , and ( U ) it is not finished. ”
NKJV	Ezra	5	17	Now therefore , if it seems good to the king , ( V ) let a search be made in the king ’ s treasure house , which is there in Babylon , whether it is so that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem , and let the king send us his pleasure concerning this matter .

NKJV	Ezra	6	6	( G ) Now therefore , Tattenai , governor of the region beyond the River , and Shethar-Boznai , and your companions the Persians who are beyond the River , keep yourselves far from there .
NKJV	Ezra	6	2	And at [ b ] Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of ( B ) Media , a scroll was found , and in it a record was written thus :
NKJV	Ezra	6	3	In the first year of King Cyrus , King Cyrus issued a ( C ) decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem : “ Let the house be rebuilt , the place where they offered sacrifices ; and let the foundations of it be firmly laid , its height sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits ,
NKJV	Ezra	6	4	( D ) with three rows of heavy stones and one row of new timber . Let the ( E ) expenses be paid from the king ’ s treasury .
NKJV	Ezra	6	5	Also let ( F ) the gold and silver articles of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple which is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon , be restored and taken back to the temple which is in Jerusalem , each to its place ; and deposit them in the house of God ” —
NKJV	Ezra	6	7	Let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site .
NKJV	Ezra	6	8	Moreover I issue a decree as to what you shall do for the elders of these Jews , for the building of this [ c ] house of God : Let the cost be paid at the king ’ s expense from taxes on the region beyond the River ; this is to be given immediately to these men , so that they are not hindered .
NKJV	Ezra	6	9	And whatever they need—young bulls , rams , and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven , wheat , salt , wine , and oil , according to the request of the priests who are in Jerusalem—let it be given them day by day without fail ,
NKJV	Ezra	6	10	( H ) that they may offer sacrifices of sweet aroma to the God of heaven , and pray for the life of the king and his sons .
NKJV	Ezra	6	11	Also I issue a decree that whoever alters this edict , let a timber be pulled from his house and erected , and let him be hanged on it ; ( I ) and let his house be made a refuse heap because of this .
NKJV	Ezra	6	12	And may the God who causes His ( J ) name to dwell there destroy any king or people who put their hand to alter it , or to destroy this [ d ] house of God which is in Jerusalem . I Darius issue a decree ; let it be done diligently . The Temple Completed and Dedicated
NKJV	Ezra	6	13	Then Tattenai , governor of the region beyond the River , Shethar-Boznai , and their companions diligently did according to what King Darius had sent .
NKJV	Ezra	6	14	( K ) So the elders of the Jews built , and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo . And they built and finished it , according to the commandment of the God of Israel , and according to the [ e ] command of ( L ) Cyrus , ( M ) Darius , and ( N ) Artaxerxes king of Persia .
NKJV	Ezra	6	15	Now the temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius .
NKJV	Ezra	6	16	Then the children of Israel , the priests and the Levites and the rest of the descendants of the captivity , celebrated ( O ) the dedication of this [ f ] house of God with joy .
NKJV	Ezra	6	17	And they ( P ) offered sacrifices at the dedication of this house of God , one hundred bulls , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs , and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
NKJV	Ezra	6	18	They assigned the priests to their ( Q ) divisions and the Levites to their ( R ) divisions , over the service of God in Jerusalem , ( S ) as it is written in the Book of Moses . The Passover Celebrated ( T )
NKJV	Ezra	6	19	[ g ] And the descendants of the captivity kept the Passover ( U ) on the fourteenth day of the first month .
NKJV	Ezra	6	20	For the priests and the Levites had ( V ) purified themselves ; all of them were ritually clean . And they ( W ) slaughtered the Passover lambs for all the descendants of the captivity , for their brethren the priests , and for themselves .

NKJV	Ezra	7	7	( G ) Some of the children of Israel , the priests , ( H ) the Levites , the singers , the gatekeepers , and ( I ) the Nethinim came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes .

NKJV	Ezra	7	5	the son of Abishua , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the chief priest—
NKJV	Ezra	7	6	this Ezra came up from Babylon ; and he was ( E ) a skilled scribe in the Law of Moses , which the Lord God of Israel had given . The king granted him all his request , ( F ) according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him .
NKJV	Ezra	7	8	And Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
NKJV	Ezra	7	9	On the first day of the first month he began his journey from Babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem , ( J ) according to the good hand of his God upon him .
NKJV	Ezra	7	10	For Ezra had prepared his heart to ( K ) seek [ a ] the Law of the Lord , and to do it , and to ( L ) teach statutes and ordinances in Israel . The Letter of Artaxerxes to Ezra
NKJV	Ezra	7	11	This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave Ezra the priest , the scribe , expert in the words of the commandments of the Lord , and of His statutes to Israel : To Ezra the priest , a scribe of the Law of the God of heaven :
NKJV	Ezra	7	13	I issue a decree that all those of the people of Israel and the priests and Levites in my realm , who volunteer to go up to Jerusalem , may go with you .
NKJV	Ezra	7	14	And whereas you are being sent [ d ] by the king and his ( O ) seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , with regard to the Law of your God which is in your hand ;
NKJV	Ezra	7	15	and whereas you are to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel , ( P ) whose dwelling is in Jerusalem ;
NKJV	Ezra	7	16	( Q ) and whereas all the silver and gold that you may find in all the province of Babylon , along with the freewill offering of the people and the priests , are to be ( R ) freely offered for the [ e ] house of their God in Jerusalem—
NKJV	Ezra	7	17	now therefore , be careful to buy with this money bulls , rams , and lambs , with their ( S ) grain offerings and their drink offerings , and ( T ) offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem .
NKJV	Ezra	7	18	And whatever seems good to you and your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do it according to the will of your God .
NKJV	Ezra	7	19	Also the articles that are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem .
NKJV	Ezra	7	20	And whatever more may be needed for the house of your God , which you may have occasion to provide , pay for it from the king ’ s treasury .
NKJV	Ezra	7	21	And I , even I , Artaxerxes the king , issue a decree to all the treasurers who are in the region beyond the River , that whatever Ezra the priest , the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven , may require of you , let it be done diligently ,
NKJV	Ezra	7	22	up to one hundred talents of silver , one hundred kors of wheat , one hundred baths of wine , one hundred baths of oil , and salt without prescribed limit .
NKJV	Ezra	7	23	Whatever [ f ] is commanded by the God of heaven , let it diligently be done for the [ g ] house of the God of heaven . For why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
NKJV	Ezra	7	24	Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tax , tribute , or custom on any of the priests , Levites , singers , gatekeepers , Nethinim , or servants of this house of God .
NKJV	Ezra	7	25	And you , Ezra , according to your God-given wisdom , ( U ) set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people who are in the region beyond the River , all such as know the laws of your God ; and ( V ) teach those who do not know them .
NKJV	Ezra	7	26	Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king , let judgment be executed speedily on him , whether it be death , or [ h ] banishment , or confiscation of goods , or imprisonment .
NKJV	Ezra	7	27	( W ) Blessed [ i ] be the Lord God of our fathers , ( X ) who has put such a thing as this in the king ’ s heart , to beautify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem ,
NKJV	Ezra	7	28	and ( Y ) has extended mercy to me before the king and his counselors , and before all the king ’ s mighty princes . So I was encouraged , as ( Z ) the hand of the Lord my God was upon me ; and I gathered leading men of Israel to go up with me . Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Ezra	8	14	also of the sons of Bigvai , Uthai and [ d ] Zabbud , and with them seventy males . Servants for the Temple
NKJV	Ezra	8	15	Now I gathered them by the river that flows to Ahava , and we camped there three days . And I looked among the people and the priests , and found none of the ( E ) sons of Levi there .
NKJV	Ezra	8	16	Then I sent for Eliezer , Ariel , Shemaiah , Elnathan , Jarib , Elnathan , Nathan , Zechariah , and ( F ) Meshullam , leaders ; also for Joiarib and Elnathan , men of understanding .
NKJV	Ezra	8	17	And I gave them a command for Iddo the chief man at the place Casiphia , and [ e ] I told them what they should say to [ f ] Iddo and his brethren the Nethinim at the place Casiphia—that they should bring us servants for the house of our God .
NKJV	Ezra	8	18	Then , by the good hand of our God upon us , they ( G ) brought us a man of understanding , of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi , the son of Israel , namely Sherebiah , with his sons and brothers , eighteen men ;
NKJV	Ezra	8	19	and ( H ) Hashabiah , and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari , his brothers and their sons , twenty men ;
NKJV	Ezra	8	20	( I ) also of the Nethinim , whom David and the leaders had appointed for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinim . All of them were designated by name . Fasting and Prayer for Protection
NKJV	Ezra	8	21	Then I ( J ) proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava , that we might ( K ) humble ourselves before our God , to seek from Him the ( L ) right way for us and our little ones and all our possessions .
NKJV	Ezra	8	22	For ( M ) I was ashamed to request of the king an escort of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the road , because we had spoken to the king , saying , ( N ) “ The hand of our God is upon all those for ( O ) good who seek Him , but His power and His wrath are ( P ) against all those who ( Q ) forsake Him. ”
NKJV	Ezra	8	23	So we fasted and entreated our God for this , and He ( R ) answered our prayer . Gifts for the Temple
NKJV	Ezra	8	24	And I separated twelve of the leaders of the priests—Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their brethren with them—
NKJV	Ezra	8	25	and weighed out to them ( S ) the silver , the gold , and the articles , the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes , and all Israel who were present , had offered .
NKJV	Ezra	8	26	I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver , silver articles weighing one hundred talents , one hundred talents of gold ,
NKJV	Ezra	8	27	twenty gold basins worth a thousand drachmas , and two vessels of fine polished bronze , precious as gold .
NKJV	Ezra	8	28	And I said to them , “ You are ( T ) holy [ g ] to the Lord ; the articles are ( U ) holy also ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the Lord God of your fathers .
NKJV	Ezra	8	29	Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the leaders of the priests and the Levites and ( V ) heads of the fathers ’ houses of Israel in Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the Lord. ”
NKJV	Ezra	8	30	So the priests and the Levites received the silver and the gold and the articles by weight , to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God . The Return to Jerusalem
NKJV	Ezra	8	31	Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month , to go to Jerusalem . And ( W ) the hand of our God was upon us , and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the road .
NKJV	Ezra	8	32	So we ( X ) came to Jerusalem , and stayed there three days .
NKJV	Ezra	8	33	Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the articles were ( Y ) weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest , and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas ; with them were the Levites , ( Z ) Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui ,
NKJV	Ezra	8	34	with the number and weight of everything . All the weight was written down at that time .
NKJV	Ezra	8	35	The children of those who had been ( AA ) carried away captive , who had come from the captivity , ( AB ) offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel : twelve bulls for all Israel , ninety-six rams , seventy-seven lambs , and twelve male goats as a sin offering . All this was a burnt offering to the Lord .
NKJV	Ezra	8	36	And they delivered the king ’ s ( AC ) orders to the king ’ s satraps and the governors in the region beyond [ h ] the River .

NKJV	Ezra	9	9	( S ) For we were slaves . ( T ) Yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage ; but ( U ) He extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia , to revive us , to repair the house of our God , to rebuild its ruins , and to give us ( V ) a wall in Judah and Jerusalem .
NKJV	Ezra	9	2	For they have ( C ) taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons , so that the ( D ) holy seed is ( E ) mixed with the peoples of those lands . Indeed , the hand of the leaders and rulers has been foremost in this [ a ] trespass. ”
NKJV	Ezra	9	3	So when I heard this thing , ( F ) I tore my garment and my robe , and plucked out some of the hair of my head and beard , and sat down ( G ) astonished .
NKJV	Ezra	9	4	Then everyone who ( H ) trembled at the words of the God of Israel assembled to me , because of the transgression of those who had been carried away captive , and I sat astonished until the ( I ) evening sacrifice .
NKJV	Ezra	9	5	At the evening sacrifice I arose from my fasting ; and having torn my garment and my robe , I fell on my knees and ( J ) spread out my hands to the Lord my God .
NKJV	Ezra	9	6	And I said : “ O my God , I am too ( K ) ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You , my God ; for ( L ) our iniquities have risen higher than our heads , and our guilt has ( M ) grown up to the heavens .
NKJV	Ezra	9	7	Since the days of our fathers to this day ( N ) we have been very guilty , and for our iniquities ( O ) we , our kings , and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands , to the ( P ) sword , to captivity , to plunder , and to ( Q ) humiliation , [ b ] as it is this day .
NKJV	Ezra	9	8	And now for a little while grace has been shown from the Lord our God , to leave us a remnant to escape , and to give us a peg in His holy place , that our God may ( R ) enlighten our eyes and give us a measure of revival in our bondage .
NKJV	Ezra	9	10	And now , O our God , what shall we say after this ? For we have forsaken Your commandments ,
NKJV	Ezra	9	11	which You commanded by Your servants the prophets , saying , ‘ The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land , with the ( W ) uncleanness of the peoples of the lands , with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their impurity .
NKJV	Ezra	9	12	Now therefore , ( X ) do not give your daughters as wives for their sons , nor take their daughters to your sons ; and ( Y ) never seek their peace or prosperity , that you may be strong and eat the good of the land , and ( Z ) leave it as an inheritance to your children forever. ’
NKJV	Ezra	9	13	And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt , since You our God ( AA ) have punished us less than our iniquities deserve , and have given us such deliverance as this ,
NKJV	Ezra	9	14	should we ( AB ) again break Your commandments , and ( AC ) join in marriage with the people committing these abominations ? Would You not be ( AD ) angry with us until You had [ c ] consumed us , so that there would be no remnant or survivor ?
NKJV	Ezra	9	15	O Lord God of Israel , ( AE ) You are righteous , for we are left as a remnant , as it is this day . ( AF ) Here we are before You , ( AG ) in our guilt , though no one can stand before You because of this ! ” Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Ezra	10	10	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them , “ You have [ b ] transgressed and [ c ] have taken pagan wives , adding to the guilt of Israel .
NKJV	Ezra	10	2	And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , spoke up and said to Ezra , “ We have ( D ) trespassed [ a ] against our God , and have taken pagan wives from the peoples of the land ; yet now there is hope in Israel in spite of this .
NKJV	Ezra	10	3	Now therefore , let us make ( E ) a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and those who have been born to them , according to the advice of my master and of those who ( F ) tremble at ( G ) the commandment of our God ; and let it be done according to the ( H ) law .
NKJV	Ezra	10	4	Arise , for this matter is your responsibility . We also are with you . ( I ) Be of good courage , and do it. ”
NKJV	Ezra	10	5	Then Ezra arose , and made the leaders of the priests , the Levites , and all Israel ( J ) swear an oath that they would do according to this word . So they swore an oath .
NKJV	Ezra	10	6	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God , and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib ; and when he came there , he ( K ) ate no bread and drank no water , for he mourned because of the guilt of those from the captivity .
NKJV	Ezra	10	7	And they issued a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the descendants of the captivity , that they must gather at Jerusalem ,
NKJV	Ezra	10	8	and that whoever would not come within three days , according to the instructions of the leaders and elders , all his property would be confiscated , and he himself would be separated from the assembly of those from the captivity .
NKJV	Ezra	10	9	So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered at Jerusalem within three days . It was the ninth month , on the twentieth of the month ; and ( L ) all the people sat in the open square of the house of God , trembling because of this matter and because of heavy rain .
NKJV	Ezra	10	11	Now therefore , ( M ) make confession to the Lord God of your fathers , and do His will ; ( N ) separate yourselves from the peoples of the land , and from the pagan wives. ”
NKJV	Ezra	10	12	Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice , “ Yes ! As you have said , so we must do .
NKJV	Ezra	10	13	But there are many people ; it is the season for heavy rain , and we are not able to stand outside . Nor is this the work of one or two days , for there are many of us who have transgressed in this matter .
NKJV	Ezra	10	14	Please , let the leaders of our entire assembly stand ; and let all those in our cities who have taken pagan wives come at appointed times , together with the elders and judges of their cities , until ( O ) the fierce wrath of our God is turned away from us in this matter. ”
NKJV	Ezra	10	15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah opposed this , and ( P ) Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite gave them support .
NKJV	Ezra	10	16	Then the descendants of the captivity did so . And Ezra the priest , with certain ( Q ) heads of the fathers ’ households , were set apart by the fathers ’ households , each of them by name ; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
NKJV	Ezra	10	17	By the first day of the first month they finished questioning all the men who had taken pagan wives . Pagan Wives Put Away
NKJV	Ezra	10	18	And among the sons of the priests who had taken pagan wives the following were found of the sons of ( R ) Jeshua the son of [ d ] Jozadak , and his brothers : Maaseiah , Eliezer , Jarib , and Gedaliah .
NKJV	Ezra	10	19	And they ( S ) gave their promise that they would put away their wives ; and being ( T ) guilty , they presented a ram of the flock as their ( U ) trespass offering .

NKJV	Nehemiah	1	1	The words of ( A ) Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah . It came to pass in the month of Chislev , in the ( B ) twentieth year , as I was in ( C ) Shushan [ a ] the [ b ] citadel ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	1	2	that ( D ) Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who had survived the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
NKJV	Nehemiah	1	3	And they said to me , “ The survivors who are left from the captivity in the ( E ) province are there in great distress and ( F ) reproach . ( G ) The wall of Jerusalem ( H ) is also broken down , and its gates are burned with fire. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	1	4	So it was , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned for many days ; I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven .
NKJV	Nehemiah	1	5	And I said : “ I pray , ( I ) Lord God of heaven , O great and ( J ) awesome God , ( K ) You who keep Your covenant and mercy with those who love [ c ] You and observe [ d ] Your commandments ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	1	6	please let Your ear be attentive and ( L ) Your eyes open , that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now , day and night , for the children of Israel Your servants , and ( M ) confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You . Both my father ’ s house and I have sinned .
NKJV	Nehemiah	1	7	( N ) We have acted very corruptly against You , and have ( O ) not kept the commandments , the statutes , nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses .
NKJV	Nehemiah	1	8	Remember , I pray , the word that You commanded Your servant Moses , saying , ( P ) ‘ If you [ e ] are unfaithful , I will scatter you among the nations ;
NKJV	Nehemiah	1	9	( Q ) but if you return to Me , and keep My commandments and do them , ( R ) though some of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens , yet I will gather them from there , and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling for My name. ’

NKJV	Nehemiah	2	2	Therefore the king said to me , “ Why is your face sad , since you are not sick ? This is nothing but ( C ) sorrow of heart. ” So I became [ b ] dreadfully afraid ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	3	and said to the king , ( D ) “ May the king live forever ! Why should my face not be sad , when ( E ) the city , the place of my fathers ’ tombs , lies waste , and its gates are burned with ( F ) fire ? ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	4	Then the king said to me , “ What do you request ? ” So I ( G ) prayed to the God of heaven .
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	5	And I said to the king , “ If it pleases the king , and if your servant has found favor in your sight , I ask that you send me to Judah , to the city of my fathers ’ tombs , that I may rebuild it. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	6	Then the king said to me ( the queen also sitting beside him ) , “ How long will your journey be ? And when will you return ? ” So it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him ( H ) a time .
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	7	Furthermore I said to the king , “ If it pleases the king , let letters be given to me for the ( I ) governors of the region beyond [ c ] the River , that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	8	and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king ’ s forest , that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the [ d ] citadel which pertains ( J ) to the [ e ] temple , for the city wall , and for the house that I will occupy. ” And the king granted them to me ( K ) according to the good hand of my God upon me .
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	9	Then I went to the governors in the region beyond the River , and gave them the king ’ s letters . Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me .
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	10	When ( L ) Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite [ f ] official heard of it , they were deeply disturbed that a man had come to seek the well-being of the children of Israel . Nehemiah Views the Wall of Jerusalem
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	11	So I ( M ) came to Jerusalem and was there three days .
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	12	Then I arose in the night , I and a few men with me ; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem ; nor was there any animal with me , except the one on which I rode .
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	13	And I went out by night ( N ) through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and the [ g ] Refuse Gate , and [ h ] viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were ( O ) broken down and its gates which were burned with fire .

NKJV	Nehemiah	2	17	Then I said to them , “ You see the distress that we are in , how Jerusalem lies [ k ] waste , and its gates are burned with fire . Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem , that we may no longer be ( S ) a reproach. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	18	And I told them of ( T ) the hand of my God which had been good upon me , and also of the king ’ s words that he had spoken to me . So they said , “ Let us rise up and build. ” Then they ( U ) set [ l ] their hands to this good work .
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	19	But when Sanballat the Horonite , Tobiah the Ammonite official , and Geshem the Arab heard of it , they laughed at us and despised us , and said , “ What is this thing that you are doing ? ( V ) Will you rebel against the king ? ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	2	20	So I answered them , and said to them , “ The God of heaven Himself will prosper us ; therefore we His servants will arise and build , ( W ) but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem. ” Footnotes - Nehemiah 2:1 Artaxerxes Longimanus - Nehemiah 2:2 Lit . very much - Nehemiah 2:7 The Euphrates - Nehemiah 2:8 palace - Nehemiah 2:8 Lit . house - Nehemiah 2:10 Lit . servant - Nehemiah 2:13 Dung - Nehemiah 2:13 examined - Nehemiah 2:15 torrent valley , wadi - Nehemiah 2:15 examined - Nehemiah 2:17 desolate - Nehemiah 2:18 Lit . strengthened Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Nehemiah	4	4	( C ) Hear , O our God , for we are despised ; ( D ) turn their reproach on their own heads , and give them as plunder to a land of captivity !
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	2	And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria , and said , “ What are these feeble Jews doing ? Will they fortify themselves ? Will they offer sacrifices ? Will they complete it in a day ? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish—stones that are burned ? ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	3	Now ( B ) Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him , and he said , “ Whatever they build , if even a fox goes up on it , he will break down their stone wall. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	5	( E ) Do not cover their iniquity , and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You ; for they have provoked You to anger before the builders .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	6	So we built the wall , and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height , for the people had a mind to work .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	7	Now it happened , ( F ) when Sanballat , Tobiah , ( G ) the Arabs , the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being restored and the [ a ] gaps were beginning to be closed , that they became very angry ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	8	and all of them ( H ) conspired together to come and attack Jerusalem and create confusion .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	9	Nevertheless ( I ) we made our prayer to our God , and because of them we set a watch against them day and night .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	10	Then Judah said , “ The strength of the laborers is failing , and there is so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	11	And our adversaries said , “ They will neither know nor see anything , till we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	12	So it was , when the Jews who dwelt near them came , that they told us ten times , “ From whatever place you turn , they will be upon us. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	13	Therefore I positioned men behind the lower parts of the wall , at the openings ; and I set the people according to their families , with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	14	And I looked , and arose and said to the nobles , to the leaders , and to the rest of the people , ( J ) “ Do not be afraid of them . Remember the Lord , ( K ) great and awesome , and ( L ) fight for your brethren , your sons , your daughters , your wives , and your houses. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	15	And it happened , when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and ( M ) that God had brought their plot to nothing , that all of us returned to the wall , everyone to his work .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	16	So it was , from that time on , that half of my servants worked at construction , while the other half held the spears , the shields , the bows , and wore armor ; and the leaders [ b ] were behind all the house of Judah .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	17	Those who built on the wall , and those who carried burdens , loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construction , and with the other held a weapon .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	18	Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built . And the one who sounded the trumpet was beside me .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	19	Then I said to the nobles , the rulers , and the rest of the people , “ The work is great and extensive , and we are separated far from one another on the wall .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	20	Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet , rally to us there . ( N ) Our God will fight for us. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	21	So we labored in the work , and half of [ c ] the men held the spears from daybreak until the stars appeared .
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	22	At the same time I also said to the people , “ Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem , that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	4	23	So neither I , my brethren , my servants , nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes , except that everyone took them off for washing .

NKJV	Nehemiah	5	5	Yet now ( C ) our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren , our children as their children ; and indeed we ( D ) are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves , and some of our daughters have been brought into slavery . It is not in our power to redeem them , for other men have our lands and vineyards. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	2	For there were those who said , “ We , our sons , and our daughters are many ; therefore let us get grain , that we may eat and live. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	3	There were also some who said , “ We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses , that we might buy grain because of the famine. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	4	There were also those who said , “ We have borrowed money for the king ’ s tax on our lands and vineyards .
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	6	And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words .
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	7	After serious thought , I rebuked the nobles and rulers , and said to them , ( E ) “ Each of you is [ a ] exacting usury from his brother. ” So I [ b ] called a great assembly against them .
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	8	And I said to them , “ According to our ability we have ( F ) redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations . Now indeed , will you even sell your brethren ? Or should they be sold to us ? ” Then they were silenced and found nothing to say .
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	9	Then I said , “ What you are doing is not good . Should you not walk ( G ) in the fear of our God ( H ) because of the reproach of the nations , our enemies ?
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	10	I also , with my brethren and my servants , am lending them money and grain . Please , let us stop this [ c ] usury !
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	11	Restore now to them , even this day , their lands , their vineyards , their olive groves , and their houses , also a hundredth of the money and the grain , the new wine and the oil , that you have charged them. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	12	So they said , “ We will restore it , and will require nothing from them ; we will do as you say. ” Then I called the priests , ( I ) and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise .
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	13	Then ( J ) I shook out [ d ] the fold of my garment and said , “ So may God shake out each man from his house , and from his property , who does not perform this promise . Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied. ” And all the assembly said , “ Amen ! ” and praised the Lord . ( K ) Then the people did according to this promise . The Generosity of Nehemiah
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	14	Moreover , from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah , from the twentieth year ( L ) until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes , twelve years , neither I nor my brothers ( M ) ate the governor ’ s provisions .
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	15	But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people , and took from them bread and wine , besides forty shekels of silver . Yes , even their servants bore rule over the people , but ( N ) I did not do so , because of the ( O ) fear of God .
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	16	Indeed , I also continued the ( P ) work on this wall , and [ e ] we did not buy any land . All my servants were gathered there for the work .
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	17	And ( Q ) at my table were one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers , besides those who came to us from the nations around us .
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	18	Now that ( R ) which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep . Also fowl were prepared for me , and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine . Yet in spite of this ( S ) I did not demand the governor ’ s provisions , because the bondage was heavy on this people .
NKJV	Nehemiah	5	19	( T ) Remember me , my God , for good , according to all that I have done for this people .

NKJV	Nehemiah	6	6	In it was written : It is reported among the nations , and [ d ] Geshem says , that you and the Jews plan to rebel ; therefore , according to these rumors , you are rebuilding the wall , ( F ) that you may be their king .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	2	that Sanballat and [ b ] Geshem ( C ) sent to me , saying , “ Come , let us meet together [ c ] among the villages in the plain of ( D ) Ono. ” But they ( E ) thought to do me harm .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	3	So I sent messengers to them , saying , “ I am doing a great work , so that I can not come down . Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you ? ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	4	But they sent me this message four times , and I answered them in the same manner .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	5	Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before , the fifth time , with an open letter in his hand .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	7	And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem , saying , “ There is a king in Judah ! ” Now these matters will be reported to the king . So come , therefore , and let us consult together .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	8	Then I sent to him , saying , “ No such things as you say are being done , but you invent them in your own heart. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	9	For they all were trying to make us afraid , saying , “ Their hands will be weakened in the work , and it will not be done. ” Now therefore , O God , strengthen my hands .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	10	Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah , the son of Mehetabel , who was a secret informer ; and he said , “ Let us meet together in the house of God , within the [ e ] temple , and let us close the doors of the temple , for they are coming to kill you ; indeed , at night they will come to kill you. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	11	And I said , “ Should such a man as I flee ? And who is there such as I who would go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go in ! ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	12	Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all , but that ( G ) he pronounced this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	13	For this reason he was hired , that I should be afraid and act that way and sin , so that they might have cause for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	14	( H ) My God , remember Tobiah and Sanballat , according to these their works , and the ( I ) prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid . The Wall Completed
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	15	So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul , in fifty-two days .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	16	And it happened , ( J ) when all our enemies heard of it , and all the nations around us saw these things , that they were very disheartened in their own eyes ; for ( K ) they perceived that this work was done by our God .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	17	Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah , and the letters of Tobiah came to them .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	18	For many in Judah were pledged to him , because he was the ( L ) son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah , and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of ( M ) Meshullam the son of Berechiah .
NKJV	Nehemiah	6	19	Also they reported his good deeds before me , and reported my [ f ] words to him . Tobiah sent letters to frighten me .

NKJV	Nehemiah	7	2	that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother ( B ) Hanani , and Hananiah the leader ( C ) of the [ a ] citadel , for he was a faithful man and ( D ) feared God more than many .
NKJV	Nehemiah	7	3	And I said to them , “ Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot ; and while they stand guard , let them shut and bar the doors ; and appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem , one at his watch station and another in front of his own house. ” The Captives Who Returned to Jerusalem ( E )
NKJV	Nehemiah	7	4	Now the city was large and spacious , but the people in it were ( F ) few , and the houses were not rebuilt .
NKJV	Nehemiah	7	5	Then my God put it into my heart to gather the nobles , the rulers , and the people , that they might be registered by genealogy . And I found a register of the genealogy of those who had come up in the first return , and found written in it :

NKJV	Nehemiah	12	22	During the reign of Darius the Persian , a record was also kept of the Levites and priests who had been ( I ) heads of their fathers ’ houses in the days of Eliashib , Joiada , Johanan , and Jaddua .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	23	The sons of Levi , the heads of the fathers ’ houses until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib , were written in the book of the ( J ) chronicles .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	24	And the heads of the Levites were Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brothers across from them , to ( K ) praise and give thanks , ( L ) group [ p ] alternating with group , ( M ) according to the command of David the man of God .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	25	Mattaniah , Bakbukiah , Obadiah , Meshullam , Talmon , and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storerooms of the gates .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	26	These lived in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua , the son of [ q ] Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah ( N ) the governor , and of Ezra the priest , ( O ) the scribe . Nehemiah Dedicates the Wall
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	27	Now at ( P ) the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites in all their places , to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness , ( Q ) both with thanksgivings and singing , with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	28	And the sons of the singers gathered together from the countryside around Jerusalem , from the ( R ) villages of the Netophathites ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	29	from the house of Gilgal , and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth ; for the singers had built themselves villages all around Jerusalem .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	30	Then the priests and Levites ( S ) purified themselves , and purified the people , the gates , and the wall .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	31	So I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall , and appointed two large thanksgiving choirs . ( T ) One went to the right hand on the wall ( U ) toward the Refuse Gate .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	32	After them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	33	and Azariah , Ezra , Meshullam ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	34	Judah , Benjamin , Shemaiah , Jeremiah ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	35	and some of the priests ’ sons ( V ) with trumpets—Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Michaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	36	and his brethren , Shemaiah , Azarel , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethanel , Judah , and Hanani , with ( W ) the musical ( X ) instruments of David the man of God . And Ezra the scribe went before them .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	37	( Y ) By the Fountain Gate , in front of them , they went up ( Z ) the stairs of the ( AA ) City of David , on the stairway of the wall , beyond the house of David , as far as ( AB ) the Water Gate eastward .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	38	( AC ) The other thanksgiving choir went the opposite way , and I was behind them with half of the people on the wall , going past the ( AD ) Tower of the Ovens as far as ( AE ) the Broad Wall ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	39	( AF ) and above the Gate of Ephraim , above ( AG ) the Old Gate , above ( AH ) the Fish Gate , ( AI ) the Tower of Hananel , the Tower of [ r ] the Hundred , as far as ( AJ ) the Sheep Gate ; and they stopped by ( AK ) the Gate of the Prison .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	40	So the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the house of God , likewise I and the half of the rulers with me ;
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	41	and the priests , Eliakim , Maaseiah , [ s ] Minjamin , Michaiah , Elioenai , Zechariah , and Hananiah , with trumpets ;
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	42	also Maaseiah , Shemaiah , Eleazar , Uzzi , Jehohanan , Malchijah , Elam , and Ezer . The singers [ t ] sang loudly with Jezrahiah the director .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	43	Also that day they offered great sacrifices , and rejoiced , for God had made them rejoice with great joy ; the women and the children also rejoiced , so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard ( AL ) afar off . Temple Responsibilities
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	44	( AM ) And at the same time some were appointed over the rooms of the storehouse for the offerings , the firstfruits , and the ( AN ) tithes , to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions specified by the Law for the priests and Levites ; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who [ u ] ministered .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	45	Both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purification , ( AO ) according to the command of David and Solomon his son .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	46	For in the days of David ( AP ) and Asaph of old there were chiefs of the singers , and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God .
NKJV	Nehemiah	12	47	In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers , a portion for ( AQ ) each day . ( AR ) They also [ v ] consecrated holy things for the Levites , ( AS ) and the Levites consecrated them for the children of Aaron . Footnotes - Nehemiah 12:2 Melichu , v.

NKJV	Nehemiah	13	13	( S ) And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe , and of the Levites , Pedaiah ; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur , the son of Mattaniah ; for they were considered ( T ) faithful , and their task was to distribute to their brethren .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	2	because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water , but ( D ) hired Balaam against them to curse them . ( E ) However , our God turned the curse into a blessing .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	3	So it was , when they had heard the Law , ( F ) that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel . The Reforms of Nehemiah
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	4	Now before this , ( G ) Eliashib the priest , having authority over the storerooms of the house of our God , was allied with ( H ) Tobiah .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	5	And he had prepared for him a large room , ( I ) where previously they had stored the grain offerings , the frankincense , the articles , the tithes of grain , the new wine and oil , ( J ) which were commanded to be given to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers , and the offerings for the priests .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	6	But during all this I was not in Jerusalem , ( K ) for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king . Then after certain days I obtained leave from the king ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	7	and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah , in ( L ) preparing a room for him in the courts of the [ a ] house of God .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	8	And it grieved me bitterly ; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	9	Then I commanded them to ( M ) cleanse the rooms ; and I brought back into them the articles of the house of God , with the grain offering and the frankincense .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	10	I also realized that the portions for the Levites had ( N ) not been given them ; for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to ( O ) his field .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	11	So ( P ) I contended with the rulers , and said , ( Q ) “ Why is the house of God forsaken ? ” And I gathered them together and set them in their place .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	12	( R ) Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	14	( U ) Remember me , O my God , concerning this , and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for its services !
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses ( V ) on the Sabbath , and bringing in sheaves , and loading donkeys with wine , grapes , figs , and all kinds of burdens , ( W ) which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day . And I warned them about the day on which they were selling provisions .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	16	Men of Tyre dwelt there also , who brought in fish and all kinds of goods , and sold them on the Sabbath to the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	17	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said to them , “ What evil thing is this that you do , by which you profane the Sabbath day ?
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	18	( X ) Did not your fathers do thus , and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city ? Yet you bring added wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath. ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	19	So it was , at the gates of Jerusalem , as it ( Y ) began to be dark before the Sabbath , that I commanded the gates to be shut , and charged that they must not be opened till after the Sabbath . ( Z ) Then I posted some of my servants at the gates , so that no burdens would be brought in on the Sabbath day .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	20	Now the merchants and sellers of all kinds of [ b ] wares [ c ] lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	21	Then I warned them , and said to them , “ Why do you spend the night [ d ] around the wall ? If you do so again , I will lay hands on you ! ” From that time on they came no more on the Sabbath .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	22	And I commanded the Levites that ( AA ) they should cleanse themselves , and that they should go and guard the gates , to sanctify the Sabbath day . Remember me , O my God , concerning this also , and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy !
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	23	In those days I also saw Jews who ( AB ) had married women of ( AC ) Ashdod , Ammon , and Moab .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	24	And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod , and could not speak the language of Judah , but spoke according to the language of one or the other people .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	25	So I ( AD ) contended with them and [ e ] cursed them , struck some of them and pulled out their hair , and made them ( AE ) swear by God , saying , “ You shall not give your daughters as wives to their sons , nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	26	( AF ) Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things ? Yet among many nations there was no king like him , ( AG ) who was beloved of his God ; and God made him king over all Israel . ( AH ) Nevertheless pagan women caused even him to sin .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	27	Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil , ( AI ) transgressing against our God by marrying pagan women ? ”
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	28	And one of the sons ( AJ ) of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was a son-in-law of ( AK ) Sanballat the Horonite ; therefore I drove him from me .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	29	( AL ) Remember them , O my God , because they have defiled the priesthood and ( AM ) the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites .
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	30	( AN ) Thus I cleansed them of everything pagan . I also ( AO ) assigned duties to the priests and the Levites , each to his service ,
NKJV	Nehemiah	13	31	and to bringing ( AP ) the wood offering and the firstfruits at appointed times . ( AQ ) Remember me , O my God , for good !

NKJV	Esther	1	1	Now it came to pass in the days of ( A ) Ahasuerus [ a ] ( this was the Ahasuerus who reigned ( B ) over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces , ( C ) from India to Ethiopia ) ,
NKJV	Esther	1	2	in those days when King Ahasuerus ( D ) sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in ( E ) Shushan [ b ] the [ c ] citadel ,
NKJV	Esther	1	3	that in the third year of his reign he ( F ) made a feast for all his officials and servants—the powers of Persia and Media , the nobles , and the princes of the provinces being before him—
NKJV	Esther	1	4	when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his excellent majesty for many days , one hundred and eighty days in all .
NKJV	Esther	1	5	And when these days were completed , the king made a feast lasting seven days for all the people who were present in [ d ] Shushan the [ e ] citadel , from great to small , in the court of the garden of the king ’ s palace .
NKJV	Esther	1	6	There were white and blue linen curtains fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and marble pillars ; and the ( G ) couches were of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of alabaster , turquoise , and white and black marble .
NKJV	Esther	1	7	And they served drinks in golden vessels , each vessel being different from the other , with royal wine in abundance , ( H ) according to the [ f ] generosity of the king .
NKJV	Esther	1	8	In accordance with the law , the drinking was not compulsory ; for so the king had ordered all the officers of his household , that they should do according to each man ’ s pleasure .
NKJV	Esther	1	9	Queen Vashti also made a feast for the women in the royal palace which belonged to King Ahasuerus .
NKJV	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day , when the heart of the king was merry with wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , ( I ) Harbona , Bigtha , Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas , seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus ,
NKJV	Esther	1	11	to bring Queen Vashti before the king , wearing her royal crown , in order to show her beauty to the people and the officials , for she was beautiful to behold .
NKJV	Esther	1	12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king ’ s command brought by his eunuchs ; therefore the king was furious , and his anger burned within him .
NKJV	Esther	1	13	Then the king said to the ( J ) wise men ( K ) who understood the times ( for this was the king ’ s manner toward all who knew law and justice ,
NKJV	Esther	1	14	those closest to him being Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , and Memucan , the ( L ) seven princes of Persia and Media , ( M ) who had access to the king ’ s presence , and who [ g ] ranked highest in the kingdom ) :
NKJV	Esther	1	15	“ What shall we do to Queen Vashti , according to law , because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus brought to her by the eunuchs ? ”
NKJV	Esther	1	16	And Memucan answered before the king and the princes : “ Queen Vashti has not only wronged the king , but also all the princes , and all the people who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus .
NKJV	Esther	1	17	For the queen ’ s behavior will become known to all women , so that they will ( N ) despise their husbands in their eyes , when they report , ‘ King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him , but she did not come. ’
NKJV	Esther	1	18	This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media will say to all the king ’ s officials that they have heard of the behavior of the queen . Thus there will be excessive contempt and wrath .
NKJV	Esther	1	19	If it pleases the king , let a royal [ h ] decree go out from him , and let it be recorded in the laws of the Persians and the Medes , so that it will ( O ) not [ i ] be altered , that Vashti shall come no more before King Ahasuerus ; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she .
NKJV	Esther	1	20	When the king ’ s decree which he will make is proclaimed throughout all his empire ( for it is great ) , all wives will ( P ) honor their husbands , both great and small. ”
NKJV	Esther	1	21	And the reply pleased the king and the princes , and the king did according to the word of Memucan .
NKJV	Esther	1	22	Then he sent letters to all the king ’ s provinces , ( Q ) to each province in its own script , and to every people in their own language , that each man should ( R ) be master in his own house , and speak in the language of his own people .

NKJV	Esther	2	3	and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom , that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to [ a ] Shushan the [ b ] citadel , into the women ’ s quarters , under the custody of [ c ] Hegai the king ’ s eunuch , custodian of the women . And let beauty preparations be given them .
NKJV	Esther	2	4	Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. ” This thing pleased the king , and he did so .
NKJV	Esther	2	5	In [ d ] Shushan the [ e ] citadel there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of ( B ) Kish , a Benjamite .
NKJV	Esther	2	6	( C ) Kish [ f ] had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been captured with [ g ] Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
NKJV	Esther	2	7	And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah , that is , Esther , ( D ) his uncle ’ s daughter , for she had neither father nor mother . The young woman was lovely and beautiful . When her father and mother died , Mordecai took her as his own daughter .
NKJV	Esther	2	8	So it was , when the king ’ s command and decree were heard , and when many young women were ( E ) gathered at [ h ] Shushan the [ i ] citadel , under the custody of Hegai , that Esther also was taken to the king ’ s palace , into the care of Hegai the custodian of the women .
NKJV	Esther	2	9	Now the young woman pleased him , and she obtained his favor ; so he readily gave ( F ) beauty preparations to her , besides [ j ] her allowance . Then seven choice maidservants were provided for her from the king ’ s palace , and he moved her and her maidservants to the best place in the house of the women .
NKJV	Esther	2	10	( G ) Esther had not [ k ] revealed her people or family , for Mordecai had charged her not to reveal it .
NKJV	Esther	2	11	And every day Mordecai paced in front of the court of the women ’ s quarters , to learn of Esther ’ s welfare and what was happening to her .
NKJV	Esther	2	12	Each young woman ’ s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after she had completed twelve months ’ preparation , according to the regulations for the women , for thus were the days of their preparation apportioned : six months with oil of myrrh , and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women .
NKJV	Esther	2	13	Thus prepared , each young woman went to the king , and she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the women ’ s quarters to the king ’ s palace .
NKJV	Esther	2	14	In the evening she went , and in the morning she returned to the second house of the women , to the custody of Shaashgaz , the king ’ s eunuch who kept the concubines . She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name .
NKJV	Esther	2	15	Now when the turn came for Esther ( H ) the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai , who had taken her as his daughter , to go in to the king , she requested nothing but what Hegai the king ’ s eunuch , the custodian of the women , advised . And Esther ( I ) obtained favor in the sight of all who saw her .
NKJV	Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus , into his royal palace , in the tenth month , which is the month of Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
NKJV	Esther	2	17	The king loved Esther more than all the other women , and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins ; so he set the royal ( J ) crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti .
NKJV	Esther	2	18	Then the king ( K ) made a great feast , the Feast of Esther , for all his officials and servants ; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces and gave gifts according to the [ l ] generosity of a king . Mordecai Discovers a Plot
NKJV	Esther	2	19	When virgins were gathered together a second time , Mordecai sat within the king ’ s gate .
NKJV	Esther	2	20	( L ) Now Esther had not revealed her family and her people , just as Mordecai had charged her , for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him .
NKJV	Esther	2	21	In those days , while Mordecai sat within the king ’ s gate , two of the king ’ s eunuchs , [ m ] Bigthan and Teresh , doorkeepers , became furious and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus .
NKJV	Esther	2	22	So the matter became known to Mordecai , ( M ) who told Queen Esther , and Esther informed the king in Mordecai ’ s name .
NKJV	Esther	2	23	And when an inquiry was made into the matter , it was confirmed , and both were hanged on a gallows ; and it was written in ( N ) the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king .

NKJV	Esther	3	3	Then the king ’ s servants who were within the king ’ s gate said to Mordecai , “ Why do you transgress the ( E ) king ’ s command ? ”
NKJV	Esther	3	2	And all the king ’ s servants who were ( C ) within the king ’ s gate bowed and paid homage to Haman , for so the king had commanded concerning him . But Mordecai ( D ) would not bow or pay homage .
NKJV	Esther	3	4	Now it happened , when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to them , that they told it to Haman , to see whether Mordecai ’ s words would stand ; for Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew .
NKJV	Esther	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai ( F ) did not bow or pay him homage , Haman was ( G ) filled with wrath .
NKJV	Esther	3	6	But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone , for they had told him of the people of Mordecai . Instead , Haman ( H ) sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus—the people of Mordecai .
NKJV	Esther	3	7	In the first month , which is the month of Nisan , in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus , ( I ) they cast Pur ( that is , the lot ) , before Haman [ a ] to determine the day and the [ b ] month , [ c ] until it fell on the twelfth month , which is the month of Adar .
NKJV	Esther	3	8	Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus , “ There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom ; ( J ) their laws are different from all other people ’ s , and they do not keep the king ’ s laws . Therefore it is not fitting for the king to let them remain .
NKJV	Esther	3	9	If it pleases the king , let a decree be written that they be destroyed , and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who do the work , to bring it into the king ’ s treasuries. ”
NKJV	Esther	3	10	So the king ( K ) took ( L ) his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman , the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the ( M ) enemy of the Jews .
NKJV	Esther	3	11	And the king said to Haman , “ The money and the people are given to you , to do with them as seems good to you. ”
NKJV	Esther	3	12	( N ) Then the king ’ s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month , and a decree was written according to all that Haman commanded—to the king ’ s satraps , to the governors who were over each province , to the officials of all people , to every province ( O ) according to its script , and to every people in their language . ( P ) In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written , and sealed with the king ’ s signet ring .
NKJV	Esther	3	13	And the letters were ( Q ) sent by couriers into all the king ’ s provinces , to destroy , to kill , and to annihilate all the Jews , both young and old , little children and women , ( R ) in one day , on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month of Adar , and ( S ) to plunder their [ d ] possessions .
NKJV	Esther	3	14	( T ) A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province , being published for all people , that they should be ready for that day .
NKJV	Esther	3	15	The couriers went out , hastened by the king ’ s command ; and the decree was proclaimed in [ e ] Shushan the [ f ] citadel . So the king and Haman sat down to drink , but ( U ) the city of Shushan was [ g ] perplexed .

NKJV	Esther	4	4	So Esther ’ s maids and eunuchs came and told her , and the queen was deeply distressed . Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth away from him , but he would not accept them .
NKJV	Esther	4	2	He went as far as the front of the king ’ s gate , for no one might enter the king ’ s gate clothed with sackcloth .
NKJV	Esther	4	3	And in every province where the king ’ s command and decree arrived , there was great mourning among the Jews , with fasting , weeping , and wailing ; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
NKJV	Esther	4	5	Then Esther called Hathach , one of the king ’ s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her , and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai , to learn what and why this was .
NKJV	Esther	4	6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that was in front of the king ’ s gate .
NKJV	Esther	4	7	And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him , and ( D ) the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king ’ s treasuries to destroy the Jews .
NKJV	Esther	4	8	He also gave him ( E ) a copy of the written decree for their destruction , which was given at [ b ] Shushan , that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her , and that he might command her to go in to the king to make supplication to him and plead before him for her people .
NKJV	Esther	4	9	So Hathach returned and told Esther the words of Mordecai .
NKJV	Esther	4	10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach , and gave him a command for Mordecai :
NKJV	Esther	4	11	“ All the king ’ s servants and the people of the king ’ s provinces know that any man or woman who goes into ( F ) the inner court to the king , who has not been called , ( G ) he has but one law : put all to death , except the one ( H ) to whom the king holds out the golden scepter , that he may live . Yet I myself have not been ( I ) called to go in to the king these thirty days. ”
NKJV	Esther	4	12	So they told Mordecai Esther ’ s words .
NKJV	Esther	4	13	And Mordecai told them to answer Esther : “ Do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king ’ s palace any more than all the other Jews .
NKJV	Esther	4	14	For if you remain completely silent at this time , relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place , but you and your father ’ s house will perish . Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this ? ”
NKJV	Esther	4	15	Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai :
NKJV	Esther	4	16	“ Go , gather all the Jews who are present in [ c ] Shushan , and fast for me ; neither eat nor drink for ( J ) three days , night or day . My maids and I will fast likewise . And so I will go to the king , which is against the law ; ( K ) and if I perish , I perish ! ”

NKJV	Esther	5	5	Then the king said , “ Bring Haman quickly , that he may do as Esther has said. ” So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared .

NKJV	Esther	5	3	And the king said to her , “ What do you wish , Queen Esther ? What is your request ? ( E ) It shall be given to you—up to half the kingdom ! ”
NKJV	Esther	5	4	So Esther answered , “ If it pleases the king , let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him. ”
NKJV	Esther	5	6	At the banquet of wine ( F ) the king said to Esther , ( G ) “ What is your petition ? It shall be granted you . What is your request , up to half the kingdom ? It shall be done ! ”
NKJV	Esther	5	7	Then Esther answered and said , “ My petition and request is this :
NKJV	Esther	5	8	If I have found favor in the sight of the king , and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and [ b ] fulfill my request , then let the king and Haman come to the ( H ) banquet which I will prepare for them , and tomorrow I will do as the king has said. ” Haman ’ s Plot Against Mordecai
NKJV	Esther	5	9	So Haman went out that day ( I ) joyful and with a glad heart ; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king ’ s gate , and ( J ) that he did not stand or tremble before him , he was filled with indignation against Mordecai .
NKJV	Esther	5	10	Nevertheless Haman ( K ) restrained himself and went home , and he sent and called for his friends and his wife Zeresh .
NKJV	Esther	5	11	Then Haman told them of his great riches , ( L ) the multitude of his children , everything in which the king had promoted him , and how he had ( M ) advanced him above the officials and servants of the king .
NKJV	Esther	5	12	Moreover Haman said , “ Besides , Queen Esther invited no one but me to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared ; and tomorrow I am again invited by her , along with the king .
NKJV	Esther	5	13	Yet all this avails me nothing , so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king ’ s gate. ”
NKJV	Esther	5	14	Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him , “ Let a ( N ) gallows [ c ] be made , [ d ] fifty cubits high , and in the morning ( O ) suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on it ; then go merrily with the king to the banquet. ” And the thing pleased Haman ; so he had ( P ) the gallows made .

NKJV	Esther	6	6	So Haman came in , and the king asked him , “ What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor ? ” Now Haman thought in his heart , “ Whom would the king delight to honor more than ( D ) me ? ”
NKJV	Esther	6	2	And it was found written that Mordecai had told of [ b ] Bigthana and Teresh , two of the king ’ s eunuchs , the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus .
NKJV	Esther	6	3	Then the king said , “ What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this ? ” And the king ’ s servants who attended him said , “ Nothing has been done for him. ”
NKJV	Esther	6	4	So the king said , “ Who is in the court ? ” Now Haman had just entered ( B ) the outer court of the king ’ s palace ( C ) to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
NKJV	Esther	6	5	The king ’ s servants said to him , “ Haman is there , standing in the court. ” And the king said , “ Let him come in. ”
NKJV	Esther	6	7	And Haman answered the king , “ For the man whom the king delights to honor ,
NKJV	Esther	6	8	let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn , and ( E ) a horse on which the king has ridden , which has a royal [ c ] crest placed on its head .
NKJV	Esther	6	9	Then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king ’ s most noble princes , that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor . Then [ d ] parade him on horseback through the city square , ( F ) and proclaim before him : ‘ Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor ! ’ ”
NKJV	Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman , “ Hurry , take the robe and the horse , as you have suggested , and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits within the king ’ s gate ! Leave nothing undone of all that you have spoken. ”
NKJV	Esther	6	11	So Haman took the robe and the horse , arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square , and proclaimed before him , “ Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor ! ”
NKJV	Esther	6	12	Afterward Mordecai went back to the king ’ s gate . But Haman ( G ) hurried to his house , mourning ( H ) and with his head covered .
NKJV	Esther	6	13	When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him , his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him , “ If Mordecai , before whom you have begun to fall , is of Jewish descent , you will not prevail against ( I ) him but will surely fall before him. ”
NKJV	Esther	6	14	While they were still talking with him , the king ’ s eunuchs came , and hastened to bring Haman to ( J ) the banquet which Esther had prepared .

NKJV	Esther	7	7	Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden ; but Haman stood before Queen Esther , pleading for his life , for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king .
NKJV	Esther	7	2	And on the second day , ( A ) at the banquet of wine , the king again said to Esther , “ What is your petition , Queen Esther ? It shall be granted you . And what is your request , up to half the kingdom ? It shall be done ! ”
NKJV	Esther	7	3	Then Queen Esther answered and said , “ If I have found favor in your sight , O king , and if it pleases the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
NKJV	Esther	7	4	For we have been ( B ) sold , my people and I , to be destroyed , to be killed , and to be annihilated . Had we been sold as ( C ) male and female slaves , I would have held my tongue , although the enemy could never compensate for the king ’ s loss. ”
NKJV	Esther	7	5	So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther , “ Who is he , and where is he , who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing ? ”
NKJV	Esther	7	6	And Esther said , “ The adversary and ( D ) enemy is this wicked Haman ! ” So Haman was terrified before the king and queen .
NKJV	Esther	7	8	When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine , Haman had fallen across ( E ) the couch where Esther was . Then the king said , “ Will he also assault the queen while I am in the house ? ” As the word left the king ’ s mouth , they ( F ) covered Haman ’ s face .
NKJV	Esther	7	9	Now ( G ) Harbonah , one of the eunuchs , said to the king , “ Look ! ( H ) The [ a ] gallows , fifty cubits high , which Haman made for Mordecai , who spoke ( I ) good on the king ’ s behalf , is standing at the house of Haman. ” Then the king said , “ Hang him on it ! ”
NKJV	Esther	7	10	So ( J ) they ( K ) hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai . Then the king ’ s wrath subsided . Footnotes - Esther 7:9 Lit . tree or wood Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Esther	8	8	You yourselves write a decree concerning the Jews , [ a ] as you please , in the king ’ s name , and seal it with the king ’ s signet ring ; for whatever is written in the king ’ s name and sealed with the king ’ s signet ring ( H ) no one can revoke. ”
NKJV	Esther	8	2	So the king took off ( C ) his signet ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it to Mordecai ; and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman .
NKJV	Esther	8	3	Now Esther spoke again to the king , fell down at his feet , and implored him with tears to counteract the evil of Haman the Agagite , and the scheme which he had devised against the Jews .
NKJV	Esther	8	4	And ( D ) the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther . So Esther arose and stood before the king ,
NKJV	Esther	8	5	and said , “ If it pleases the king , and if I have found favor in his sight and the thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes , let it be written to revoke the ( E ) letters devised by Haman , the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , which he wrote to annihilate the Jews who are in all the king ’ s provinces .
NKJV	Esther	8	6	For how can I endure to see ( F ) the evil that will come to my people ? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my countrymen ? ”
NKJV	Esther	8	7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew , “ Indeed , ( G ) I have given Esther the house of Haman , and they have hanged him on the gallows because he tried to lay his hand on the Jews .
NKJV	Esther	8	9	( I ) So the king ’ s scribes were called at that time , in the third month , which is the month of Sivan , on the twenty-third day ; and it was written , according to all that Mordecai commanded , to the Jews , the satraps , the governors , and the princes of the provinces ( J ) from India to Ethiopia , one hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all , to every province ( K ) in its own script , to every people in their own language , and to the Jews in their own script and language .
NKJV	Esther	8	10	( L ) And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus , sealed it with the king ’ s signet ring , and sent letters by couriers on horseback , riding on royal horses [ b ] bred from swift steeds .
NKJV	Esther	8	11	By these letters the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to ( M ) gather together and protect their lives—to ( N ) destroy , kill , and annihilate all the forces of any people or province that would assault them , both little children and women , and to plunder their possessions ,
NKJV	Esther	8	12	( O ) on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus , on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month of [ c ] Adar .
NKJV	Esther	8	13	( P ) A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province and published for all people , so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
NKJV	Esther	8	14	The couriers who rode on royal horses went out , hastened and pressed on by the king ’ s command . And the decree was issued in [ d ] Shushan the [ e ] citadel .
NKJV	Esther	8	15	So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of [ f ] blue and white , with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple ; and ( Q ) the city of [ g ] Shushan rejoiced and was glad .
NKJV	Esther	8	16	The Jews had ( R ) light and gladness , joy and honor .
NKJV	Esther	8	17	And in every province and city , wherever the king ’ s command and decree came , the Jews had joy and gladness , a feast ( S ) and a holiday . Then many of the people of the land ( T ) became Jews , because ( U ) fear of the Jews fell upon them .

NKJV	Esther	9	9	Parmashta , Arisai , Aridai , and Vajezatha—
NKJV	Esther	9	2	The Jews ( D ) gathered together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who ( E ) sought their harm . And no one could withstand them , ( F ) because fear of them fell upon all people .
NKJV	Esther	9	3	And all the officials of the provinces , the satraps , the governors , and all those doing the king ’ s work , helped the Jews , because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them .
NKJV	Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the king ’ s palace , and his fame spread throughout all the provinces ; for this man Mordecai ( G ) became increasingly prominent .
NKJV	Esther	9	5	Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , with slaughter and destruction , and did what they pleased with those who hated them .
NKJV	Esther	9	6	And in ( H ) Shushan [ a ] the [ b ] citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men .
NKJV	Esther	9	7	Also Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
NKJV	Esther	9	8	Poratha , Adalia , Aridatha ,
NKJV	Esther	9	10	( I ) the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha , the enemy of the Jews—they killed ; ( J ) but they did not lay a hand on the [ c ] plunder .
NKJV	Esther	9	11	On that day the number of those who were killed in [ d ] Shushan the [ e ] citadel [ f ] was brought to the king .
NKJV	Esther	9	12	And the king said to Queen Esther , “ The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the citadel , and the ten sons of Haman . What have they done in the rest of the king ’ s provinces ? Now ( K ) what is your petition ? It shall be granted to you . Or what is your further request ? It shall be done. ”
NKJV	Esther	9	13	Then Esther said , “ If it pleases the king , let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do again tomorrow ( L ) according to today ’ s decree , and let Haman ’ s ten sons ( M ) be hanged on the gallows. ”
NKJV	Esther	9	14	So the king commanded this to be done ; the decree was issued in Shushan , and they hanged Haman ’ s ten sons .
NKJV	Esther	9	15	And the Jews who were in [ g ] Shushan ( N ) gathered together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men at Shushan ; ( O ) but they did not lay a hand on the plunder .
NKJV	Esther	9	16	The remainder of the Jews in the king ’ s provinces ( P ) gathered together and protected their lives , had rest from their enemies , and killed seventy-five thousand of their enemies ; ( Q ) but they did not lay a hand on the plunder .
NKJV	Esther	9	17	This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar . And on the fourteenth of [ h ] the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness . The Feast of Purim
NKJV	Esther	9	18	But the Jews who were at [ i ] Shushan assembled together ( R ) on the thirteenth day , as well as on the fourteenth ; and on the fifteenth of [ j ] the month they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
NKJV	Esther	9	19	Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns celebrated the fourteenth day of the month of Adar ( S ) with gladness and feasting , ( T ) as a holiday , and for ( U ) sending presents to one another .
NKJV	Esther	9	20	And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews , near and far , who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus ,
NKJV	Esther	9	21	to establish among them that they should celebrate yearly the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar ,
NKJV	Esther	9	22	as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies , as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them , and from mourning to a holiday ; that they should make them days of feasting and joy , of ( V ) sending presents to one another and gifts to the ( W ) poor .
NKJV	Esther	9	23	So the Jews accepted the custom which they had begun , as Mordecai had written to them ,
NKJV	Esther	9	24	because Haman , the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , ( X ) had plotted against the Jews to annihilate them , and had cast Pur ( that is , the lot ) , to consume them and destroy them ;
NKJV	Esther	9	25	but ( Y ) when [ k ] Esther came before the king , he commanded by letter that [ l ] this wicked plot which Haman had devised against the Jews should ( Z ) return on his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
NKJV	Esther	9	26	So they called these days Purim , after the name [ m ] Pur . Therefore , because of all the words of ( AA ) this letter , what they had seen concerning this matter , and what had happened to them ,
NKJV	Esther	9	27	the Jews established and imposed it upon themselves and their descendants and all who would ( AB ) join them , that without fail they should celebrate these two days every year , according to the written instructions and according to the prescribed time ,
NKJV	Esther	9	28	that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation , every family , every province , and every city , that these days of Purim should not fail to be observed among the Jews , and that the memory of them should not perish among their descendants .
NKJV	Esther	9	29	Then Queen Esther , ( AC ) the daughter of Abihail , with Mordecai the Jew , wrote with full authority to confirm this ( AD ) second letter about Purim .
NKJV	Esther	9	30	And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews , to ( AE ) the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , with words of peace and truth ,
NKJV	Esther	9	31	to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed time , as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had prescribed for them , and as they had decreed for themselves and their descendants concerning matters of their ( AF ) fasting and lamenting .
NKJV	Esther	9	32	So the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim , and it was written in the book .

NKJV	Job	1	1	There was a man ( A ) in the land of Uz , whose name was ( B ) Job ; and that man was ( C ) blameless and upright , and one who ( D ) feared God and [ a ] shunned evil .
NKJV	Job	1	2	And seven sons and three daughters were born to him .
NKJV	Job	1	3	Also , his possessions were seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred yoke of oxen , five hundred female donkeys , and a very large household , so that this man was the greatest of all the [ b ] people of the East .
NKJV	Job	1	4	And his sons would go and feast in their houses , each on his appointed day , and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them .
NKJV	Job	1	5	So it was , when the days of feasting had run their course , that Job would send and [ c ] sanctify them , and he would rise early in the morning ( E ) and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all . For Job said , “ It may be that my sons have sinned and ( F ) cursed [ d ] God in their hearts. ” Thus Job did regularly . Satan Attacks Job ’ s Character
NKJV	Job	1	6	Now ( G ) there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and [ e ] Satan also came among them .
NKJV	Job	1	7	And the Lord said to [ f ] Satan , “ From where do you come ? ” So Satan answered the Lord and said , “ From ( H ) going to and fro on the earth , and from walking back and forth on it. ”
NKJV	Job	1	8	Then the Lord said to Satan , “ Have you [ g ] considered My servant Job , that there is none like him on the earth , a blameless and upright man , one who fears God and [ h ] shuns evil ? ”

NKJV	Job	1	12	And the Lord said to Satan , “ Behold , all that he has is in your [ k ] power ; only do not lay a hand on his person. ” So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord . Job Loses His Property and Children
NKJV	Job	1	13	Now there was a day ( M ) when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother ’ s house ;
NKJV	Job	1	14	and a messenger came to Job and said , “ The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them ,
NKJV	Job	1	15	when the [ l ] Sabeans [ m ] raided them and took them away—indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I alone have escaped to tell you ! ”
NKJV	Job	1	16	While he was still speaking , another also came and said , “ The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants , and [ n ] consumed them ; and I alone have escaped to tell you ! ”
NKJV	Job	1	17	While he was still speaking , another also came and said , “ The Chaldeans formed three bands , raided the camels and took them away , yes , and killed the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I alone have escaped to tell you ! ”

And still he ( D ) holds fast to his integrity , although you incited Me against him , ( E ) to [ a ] destroy him without cause. ”

NKJV	Job	2	8	And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself ( J ) while he sat in the midst of the ashes .

NKJV	Job	2	11	Now when Job ’ s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him , each one came from his own place—Eliphaz the ( N ) Temanite , Bildad the ( O ) Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite . For they had made an appointment together to come ( P ) and mourn with him , and to comfort him .

NKJV	Job	3	7	Oh , may that night be barren ! May no joyful shout come into it !
NKJV	Job	3	8	May those curse it who curse the day , Those ( C ) who are ready to arouse Leviathan .
NKJV	Job	3	9	May the stars of its morning be dark ; May it look for light , but have none , And not see the [ c ] dawning of the day ;
NKJV	Job	3	10	Because it did not shut up the doors of my mother ’ s womb , Nor hide sorrow from my eyes .
NKJV	Job	3	11	“ Why ( D ) did I not die at birth ? Why did I not [ d ] perish when I came from the womb ?
NKJV	Job	3	12	( E ) Why did the knees receive me ? Or why the breasts , that I should nurse ?
NKJV	Job	3	13	For now I would have lain still and been quiet , I would have been asleep ; Then I would have been at rest
NKJV	Job	3	14	With kings and counselors of the earth , Who ( F ) built ruins for themselves ,
NKJV	Job	3	15	Or with princes who had gold , Who filled their houses with silver ;
NKJV	Job	3	16	Or why was I not hidden ( G ) like a stillborn child , Like infants who never saw light ?
NKJV	Job	3	17	There the wicked cease from troubling , And there the [ e ] weary are at ( H ) rest .
NKJV	Job	3	18	There the prisoners [ f ] rest together ; ( I ) They do not hear the voice of the oppressor .
NKJV	Job	3	19	The small and great are there , And the servant is free from his master .
NKJV	Job	3	20	“ Why ( J ) is light given to him who is in misery , And life to the ( K ) bitter of soul ,
NKJV	Job	3	21	Who ( L ) long [ g ] for death , but it does not come , And search for it more than ( M ) hidden treasures ;
NKJV	Job	3	22	Who rejoice exceedingly , And are glad when they can find the ( N ) grave ?
NKJV	Job	3	23	Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden , ( O ) And whom God has hedged in ?
NKJV	Job	3	24	For my sighing comes before [ h ] I eat , And my groanings pour out like water .
NKJV	Job	3	25	For the thing I greatly ( P ) feared has come upon me , And what I dreaded has happened to me .
NKJV	Job	3	26	I am not at ease , nor am I quiet ; I have no rest , for trouble comes. ” Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Job	4	4	Your words have upheld him who was stumbling , And you ( B ) have strengthened the [ a ] feeble knees ;
NKJV	Job	4	2	“ If one attempts a word with you , will you become weary ? But who can withhold himself from speaking ?
NKJV	Job	4	3	Surely you have instructed many , And you ( A ) have strengthened weak hands .
NKJV	Job	4	5	But now it comes upon you , and you are weary ; It touches you , and you are troubled .
NKJV	Job	4	6	Is not ( C ) your reverence ( D ) your confidence ? And the integrity of your ways your hope ?
NKJV	Job	4	7	“ Remember now , ( E ) who ever perished being innocent ? Or where were the upright ever cut off ?
NKJV	Job	4	8	Even as I have seen , ( F ) Those who plow iniquity And sow trouble reap the same .
NKJV	Job	4	9	By the blast of God they perish , And by the breath of His anger they are consumed .
NKJV	Job	4	10	The roaring of the lion , The voice of the fierce lion , And ( G ) the teeth of the young lions are broken .
NKJV	Job	4	11	( H ) The old lion perishes for lack of prey , And the cubs of the lioness are scattered .
NKJV	Job	4	12	“ Now a word was secretly brought to me , And my ear received a whisper of it .
NKJV	Job	4	13	( I ) In disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night , When deep sleep falls on men ,
NKJV	Job	4	14	Fear came upon me , and ( J ) trembling , Which made all my bones shake .
NKJV	Job	4	15	Then a spirit passed before my face ; The hair on my body stood up .
NKJV	Job	4	16	It stood still , But I could not discern its appearance . A form was before my eyes ; There was silence ; Then I heard a voice saying :
NKJV	Job	4	17	‘ Can a mortal be more righteous than God ? Can a man be more pure than his Maker ?
NKJV	Job	4	18	If He ( K ) puts no trust in His servants , If He charges His angels with error ,
NKJV	Job	4	19	How much more those who dwell in houses of clay , Whose foundation is in the dust , Who are crushed before a moth ?
NKJV	Job	4	20	( L ) They are broken in pieces from morning till evening ; They perish forever , with no one regarding .

NKJV	Job	5	5	Because the hungry eat up his harvest , [ a ] Taking it even from the thorns , [ b ] And a snare snatches their [ c ] substance .
NKJV	Job	5	2	For wrath kills a foolish man , And envy slays a simple one .
NKJV	Job	5	3	( A ) I have seen the foolish taking root , But suddenly I cursed his dwelling place .
NKJV	Job	5	4	His sons are ( B ) far from safety , They are crushed in the gate , And ( C ) there is no deliverer .
NKJV	Job	5	6	For affliction does not come from the dust , Nor does trouble spring from the ground ;
NKJV	Job	5	7	Yet man is ( D ) born to [ d ] trouble , As the sparks fly upward .
NKJV	Job	5	8	“ But as for me , I would seek God , And to God I would commit my cause—
NKJV	Job	5	9	Who does great things , and unsearchable , Marvelous things without number .
NKJV	Job	5	10	( E ) He gives rain on the earth , And sends waters on the fields .
NKJV	Job	5	11	( F ) He sets on high those who are lowly , And those who mourn are lifted to safety .
NKJV	Job	5	12	( G ) He frustrates the devices of the crafty , So that their hands can not carry out their plans .
NKJV	Job	5	13	He catches the ( H ) wise in their own craftiness , And the counsel of the cunning comes quickly upon them .
NKJV	Job	5	14	They meet with darkness in the daytime , And grope at noontime as in the night .
NKJV	Job	5	15	But ( I ) He saves the needy from the sword , From the mouth of the mighty , And from their hand .
NKJV	Job	5	16	( J ) So the poor have hope , And injustice shuts her mouth .
NKJV	Job	5	17	“ Behold , ( K ) happy is the man whom God corrects ; Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty .
NKJV	Job	5	18	( L ) For He bruises , but He binds up ; He wounds , but His hands make whole .
NKJV	Job	5	19	( M ) He shall deliver you in six troubles , Yes , in seven ( N ) no evil shall touch you .
NKJV	Job	5	20	( O ) In famine He shall redeem you from death , And in war from the [ e ] power of the sword .
NKJV	Job	5	21	( P ) You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue , And you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes .
NKJV	Job	5	22	You shall laugh at destruction and famine , And ( Q ) you shall not be afraid of the ( R ) beasts of the earth .
NKJV	Job	5	23	( S ) For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field , And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you .
NKJV	Job	5	24	You shall know that your tent is in peace ; You shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss .
NKJV	Job	5	25	You shall also know that ( T ) your descendants shall be many , And your offspring ( U ) like the grass of the earth .
NKJV	Job	5	26	( V ) You shall come to the grave at a full age , As a sheaf of grain ripens in its season .

NKJV	Job	6	6	Can flavorless food be eaten without salt ? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg ?
NKJV	Job	6	2	“ Oh , that my grief were fully weighed , And my calamity laid with it on the scales !
NKJV	Job	6	3	For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea— Therefore my words have been rash .
NKJV	Job	6	4	( A ) For the arrows of the Almighty are within me ; My spirit drinks in their poison ; ( B ) The terrors of God are arrayed ( C ) against me .
NKJV	Job	6	5	Does the ( D ) wild donkey bray when it has grass , Or does the ox low over its fodder ?
NKJV	Job	6	7	My soul refuses to touch them ; They are as loathsome food to me .
NKJV	Job	6	8	“ Oh , that I might have my request , That God would grant me the thing that I long for !
NKJV	Job	6	9	That it would please God to crush me , That He would loose His hand and ( E ) cut me off !

NKJV	Job	6	12	Is my strength the strength of stones ? Or is my flesh bronze ?
NKJV	Job	6	13	Is my help not within me ? And is success driven from me ?
NKJV	Job	6	14	“ To ( H ) him who is [ a ] afflicted , kindness should be shown by his friend , Even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty .
NKJV	Job	6	15	( I ) My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a brook , ( J ) Like the streams of the brooks that pass away ,
NKJV	Job	6	16	Which are dark because of the ice , And into which the snow vanishes .
NKJV	Job	6	17	When it is warm , they cease to flow ; When it is hot , they vanish from their place .
NKJV	Job	6	18	The paths of their way turn aside , They go nowhere and perish .
NKJV	Job	6	19	The caravans of ( K ) Tema look , The travelers of ( L ) Sheba hope for them .
NKJV	Job	6	20	They are ( M ) disappointed [ b ] because they were confident ; They come there and are confused .
NKJV	Job	6	21	For now ( N ) you are nothing , You see terror and ( O ) are afraid .
NKJV	Job	6	22	Did I ever say , ‘ Bring something to me ’ ? Or , ‘ Offer a bribe for me from your wealth ’ ?
NKJV	Job	6	23	Or , ‘ Deliver me from the enemy ’ s hand ’ ? Or , ‘ Redeem me from the hand of oppressors ’ ?
NKJV	Job	6	24	“ Teach me , and I will hold my tongue ; Cause me to understand wherein I have erred .
NKJV	Job	6	25	How forceful are right words ! But what does your arguing prove ?
NKJV	Job	6	26	Do you intend to rebuke my words , And the speeches of a desperate one , which are as wind ?
NKJV	Job	6	27	Yes , you overwhelm the fatherless , And you ( P ) undermine your friend .
NKJV	Job	6	28	Now therefore , be pleased to look at me ; For I would never lie to your face .
NKJV	Job	6	29	( Q ) Yield now , let there be no injustice ! Yes , concede , my ( R ) righteousness [ c ] still stands !

NKJV	Job	7	7	Oh , remember that ( F ) my life is a breath ! My eye will never again see good .
NKJV	Job	7	2	Like a servant who [ a ] earnestly desires the shade , And like a hired man who eagerly looks for his wages ,
NKJV	Job	7	3	So I have been allotted ( B ) months of futility , And wearisome nights have been appointed to me .
NKJV	Job	7	4	( C ) When I lie down , I say , ‘ When shall I arise , And the night be ended ? ’ For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn .
NKJV	Job	7	5	My flesh is ( D ) caked with worms and dust , My skin is cracked and breaks out afresh .
NKJV	Job	7	6	“ My ( E ) days are swifter than a weaver ’ s shuttle , And are spent without hope .
NKJV	Job	7	8	( G ) The eye of him who sees me will see me no more ; While your eyes are upon me , I shall no longer be .

NKJV	Job	7	10	He shall never return to his house , ( I ) Nor shall his place know him anymore .
NKJV	Job	7	11	“ Therefore I will ( J ) not restrain my mouth ; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit ; I will ( K ) complain in the bitterness of my soul .
NKJV	Job	7	12	Am I a sea , or a sea serpent , That You set a guard over me ?
NKJV	Job	7	13	( L ) When I say , ‘ My bed will comfort me , My couch will ease my complaint , ’
NKJV	Job	7	14	Then You scare me with dreams And terrify me with visions ,
NKJV	Job	7	15	So that my soul chooses strangling And death rather than [ b ] my body .
NKJV	Job	7	16	( M ) I loathe my life ; I would not live forever . ( N ) Let me alone , For ( O ) my days are but [ c ] a breath .

NKJV	Job	7	18	That You should [ d ] visit him every morning , And test him every moment ?
NKJV	Job	7	19	How long ? Will You not look away from me , And let me alone till I swallow my saliva ?
NKJV	Job	7	20	Have I sinned ? What have I done to You , ( Q ) O watcher of men ? Why ( R ) have You set me as Your target , So that I am a burden [ e ] to myself ?

NKJV	Job	8	3	( A ) Does God subvert judgment ? Or does the Almighty pervert justice ?
NKJV	Job	8	4	If ( B ) your sons have sinned against Him , He has cast them away [ a ] for their transgression .
NKJV	Job	8	5	( C ) If you would earnestly seek God And make your supplication to the Almighty ,

NKJV	Job	8	7	Though your beginning was small , Yet your latter end would ( D ) increase abundantly .
NKJV	Job	8	9	For ( F ) we were born yesterday , and know [ c ] nothing , Because our days on earth are a shadow .

NKJV	Job	9	5	He removes the mountains , and they do not know When He overturns them in His anger ;

NKJV	Job	9	7	He commands the sun , and it does not rise ; He seals off the stars ;
NKJV	Job	9	8	( F ) He alone spreads out the heavens , And [ b ] treads on the [ c ] waves of the sea ;
NKJV	Job	9	10	( H ) He does great things past finding out , Yes , wonders without number .

NKJV	Job	9	17	For He crushes me with a tempest , And multiplies my wounds ( M ) without cause .
NKJV	Job	9	18	He will not allow me to catch my breath , But fills me with bitterness .
NKJV	Job	9	19	If it is a matter of strength , indeed He is strong ; And if of justice , who will appoint my day in court ?
NKJV	Job	9	20	Though I were righteous , my own mouth would condemn me ; Though I were blameless , it would prove me perverse .

NKJV	Job	21	19	They say , ‘ God [ g ] lays up [ h ] one ’ s iniquity ( M ) for his children ’ ; Let Him recompense him , that he may know it .
NKJV	Job	21	20	Let his eyes see his destruction , And ( N ) let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty .
NKJV	Job	21	22	“ Can ( O ) anyone teach God knowledge , Since He judges those on high ?
NKJV	Job	21	23	One dies in his full strength , Being wholly at ease and secure ;
NKJV	Job	21	24	His [ i ] pails are full of milk , And the marrow of his bones is moist .
NKJV	Job	21	25	Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul , Never having eaten with pleasure .
NKJV	Job	21	26	They ( P ) lie down alike in the dust , And worms cover them .
NKJV	Job	21	27	“ Look , I know your thoughts , And the schemes with which you would wrong me .
NKJV	Job	21	28	For you say , ‘ Where is the house of the prince ? And where is [ j ] the tent , The dwelling place of the wicked ? ’
NKJV	Job	21	29	Have you not asked those who travel the road ? And do you not know their signs ?
NKJV	Job	21	30	( Q ) For the wicked are reserved for the day of doom ; They shall be brought out on the day of wrath .
NKJV	Job	21	31	Who condemns his way to his face ? And who repays him for what he has done ?
NKJV	Job	21	32	Yet he shall be brought to the grave , And a vigil kept over the tomb .
NKJV	Job	21	33	The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him ; ( R ) Everyone shall follow him , As countless have gone before him .

NKJV	Job	22	22	Receive , please , ( L ) instruction from His mouth , And ( M ) lay up His words in your heart .
NKJV	Job	22	2	“ Can ( B ) a man be profitable to God , Though he who is wise may be profitable to himself ?
NKJV	Job	22	3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous ? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways blameless ?
NKJV	Job	22	4	“ Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you , And enters into judgment with you ?
NKJV	Job	22	5	Is not your wickedness great , And your iniquity without end ?
NKJV	Job	22	6	For you have ( C ) taken pledges from your brother for no reason , And stripped the naked of their clothing .
NKJV	Job	22	7	You have not given the weary water to drink , And you ( D ) have withheld bread from the hungry .
NKJV	Job	22	8	But the [ a ] mighty man possessed the land , And the honorable man dwelt in it .
NKJV	Job	22	9	You have sent widows away empty , And the [ b ] strength of the fatherless was crushed .
NKJV	Job	22	10	Therefore snares are all around you , And sudden fear troubles you ,
NKJV	Job	22	11	Or darkness so that you can not see ; And an abundance of ( E ) water covers you .
NKJV	Job	22	12	“ Is not God in the height of heaven ? And see the highest stars , how lofty they are !
NKJV	Job	22	13	And you say , ( F ) ‘ What does God know ? Can He judge through the deep darkness ?
NKJV	Job	22	14	( G ) Thick clouds cover Him , so that He can not see , And He walks above the circle of heaven. ’
NKJV	Job	22	15	Will you keep to the old way Which wicked men have trod ,
NKJV	Job	22	16	Who ( H ) were cut down before their time , Whose foundations were swept away by a flood ?
NKJV	Job	22	17	( I ) They said to God , ‘ Depart from us ! What can the Almighty do to [ c ] them ? ’
NKJV	Job	22	18	Yet He filled their houses with good things ; But the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
NKJV	Job	22	19	“ The ( J ) righteous see it and are glad , And the innocent laugh at them :
NKJV	Job	22	20	‘ Surely our [ d ] adversaries are cut down , And the fire consumes their remnant. ’
NKJV	Job	22	21	“ Now acquaint yourself with Him , and ( K ) be at peace ; Thereby good will come to you .
NKJV	Job	22	23	If you return to the Almighty , you will be built up ; You will remove iniquity far from your tents .
NKJV	Job	22	24	Then you will ( N ) lay your gold in the dust , And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks .
NKJV	Job	22	25	Yes , the Almighty will be your [ e ] gold And your precious silver ;
NKJV	Job	22	26	For then you will have your ( O ) delight in the Almighty , And lift up your face to God .
NKJV	Job	22	27	( P ) You will make your prayer to Him , He will hear you , And you will pay your vows .
NKJV	Job	22	28	You will also declare a thing , And it will be established for you ; So light will shine on your ways .
NKJV	Job	22	29	When they cast you down , and you say , ‘ Exaltation will come ! ’ Then ( Q ) He will save the humble person .
NKJV	Job	22	30	He will even deliver one who is not innocent ; Yes , he will be delivered by the purity of your hands. ” Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Job	23	23	Then Job answered and said :
NKJV	Job	23	2	“ Even today my ( A ) complaint is bitter ; [ a ] My hand is listless because of my groaning .
NKJV	Job	23	3	( B ) Oh , that I knew where I might find Him , That I might come to His seat !
NKJV	Job	23	4	I would present my case before Him , And fill my mouth with arguments .
NKJV	Job	23	5	I would know the words which He would answer me , And understand what He would say to me .
NKJV	Job	23	6	( C ) Would He contend with me in His great power ? No ! But He would take note of me .
NKJV	Job	23	7	There the upright could reason with Him , And I would be delivered forever from my Judge .
NKJV	Job	23	8	“ Look , ( D ) I go forward , but He is not there , And backward , but I can not perceive Him ;
NKJV	Job	23	9	When He works on the left hand , I can not behold Him ; When He turns to the right hand , I can not see Him .
NKJV	Job	23	10	But ( E ) He knows the way that I take ; When ( F ) He has tested me , I shall come forth as gold .
NKJV	Job	23	11	( G ) My foot has held fast to His steps ; I have kept His way and not turned aside .
NKJV	Job	23	12	I have not departed from the ( H ) commandment of His lips ; ( I ) I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my [ b ] necessary food .
NKJV	Job	23	13	“ But He is unique , and who can make Him change ? And whatever ( J ) His soul desires , that He does .
NKJV	Job	23	14	For He performs what is ( K ) appointed for me , And many such things are with Him .
NKJV	Job	23	15	Therefore I am terrified at His presence ; When I consider this , I am afraid of Him .
NKJV	Job	23	16	For God ( L ) made my heart weak , And the Almighty terrifies me ;
NKJV	Job	23	17	Because I was not ( M ) cut off [ c ] from the presence of darkness , And He did not hide deep darkness from my face . Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Job	24	24	They are exalted for a little while , Then they are gone . They are brought low ; They are [ e ] taken out of the way like all others ; They dry out like the heads of grain .
NKJV	Job	24	2	“ Some remove ( C ) landmarks ; They seize flocks violently and feed on them ;
NKJV	Job	24	3	They drive away the donkey of the fatherless ; They ( D ) take the widow ’ s ox as a pledge .
NKJV	Job	24	4	They push the needy off the road ; All the ( E ) poor of the land are forced to hide .
NKJV	Job	24	5	Indeed , like wild donkeys in the desert , They go out to their work , searching for food . The wilderness yields food for them and for their children .
NKJV	Job	24	6	They gather their fodder in the field And glean in the vineyard of the wicked .
NKJV	Job	24	7	They ( F ) spend the night naked , without clothing , And have no covering in the cold .
NKJV	Job	24	8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains , And ( G ) huddle around the rock for want of shelter .
NKJV	Job	24	9	“ Some snatch the fatherless from the breast , And take a pledge from the poor .
NKJV	Job	24	10	They cause the poor to go naked , without ( H ) clothing ; And they take away the sheaves from the hungry .
NKJV	Job	24	11	They press out oil within their walls , And tread winepresses , yet suffer thirst .
NKJV	Job	24	12	The dying groan in the city , And the souls of the wounded cry out ; Yet God does not charge them with wrong .
NKJV	Job	24	13	“ There are those who rebel against the light ; They do not know its ways Nor abide in its paths .
NKJV	Job	24	14	( I ) The murderer rises with the light ; He kills the poor and needy ; And in the night he is like a thief .
NKJV	Job	24	15	( J ) The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight , ( K ) Saying , ‘ No eye will see me ’ ; And he [ a ] disguises his face .
NKJV	Job	24	16	In the dark they break into houses Which they marked for themselves in the daytime ; ( L ) They do not know the light .
NKJV	Job	24	17	For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death ; If someone recognizes them , They are in the terrors of the shadow of death .
NKJV	Job	24	18	“ They should be swift on the face of the waters , Their portion should be cursed in the earth , So that no one would turn into the way of their vineyards .
NKJV	Job	24	19	As drought and heat [ b ] consume the snow waters , So [ c ] the grave consumes those who have sinned .
NKJV	Job	24	20	The womb should forget him , The worm should feed sweetly on him ; ( M ) He should be remembered no more , And wickedness should be broken like a tree .
NKJV	Job	24	21	For he [ d ] preys on the barren who do not bear , And does no good for the widow .
NKJV	Job	24	22	“ But God draws the mighty away with His power ; He rises up , but no man is sure of life .
NKJV	Job	24	23	He gives them security , and they rely on it ; Yet ( N ) His eyes are on their ways .

NKJV	Job	26	3	How have you counseled one who has no wisdom ? And how have you declared sound advice to many ?
NKJV	Job	26	4	To whom have you uttered words ? And whose spirit came from you ?
NKJV	Job	26	5	“ The dead tremble , Those under the waters and those inhabiting them .
NKJV	Job	26	6	( A ) Sheol is naked before Him , And Destruction has no covering .
NKJV	Job	26	7	( B ) He stretches out the north over empty space ; He hangs the earth on nothing .
NKJV	Job	26	8	( C ) He binds up the water in His thick clouds , Yet the clouds [ a ] are not broken under it .
NKJV	Job	26	9	He covers the face of His throne , And spreads His cloud over it .
NKJV	Job	26	10	( D ) He drew a circular horizon on the face of the waters , At the boundary of light and darkness .
NKJV	Job	26	11	The pillars of heaven tremble , And are [ b ] astonished at His rebuke .
NKJV	Job	26	12	( E ) He stirs up the sea with His power , And by His understanding He breaks up [ c ] the storm .
NKJV	Job	26	13	( F ) By His Spirit He adorned the heavens ; His hand pierced ( G ) the fleeing serpent .

NKJV	Job	27	27	Moreover Job continued his discourse , and said :
NKJV	Job	27	2	“ As God lives , ( A ) who has taken away my justice , And the Almighty , who has made my soul bitter ,
NKJV	Job	27	3	As long as my breath is in me , And the breath of God in my nostrils ,
NKJV	Job	27	4	My lips will not speak wickedness , Nor my tongue utter deceit .
NKJV	Job	27	5	Far be it from me That I should say you are right ; Till I die ( B ) I will not put away my integrity from me .
NKJV	Job	27	6	My righteousness I ( C ) hold fast , and will not let it go ; ( D ) My heart shall not [ a ] reproach me as long as I live .
NKJV	Job	27	7	“ May my enemy be like the wicked , And he who rises up against me like the unrighteous .
NKJV	Job	27	8	( E ) For what is the hope of the hypocrite , Though he may gain much , If God takes away his life ?
NKJV	Job	27	9	( F ) Will God hear his cry When trouble comes upon him ?
NKJV	Job	27	10	( G ) Will he delight himself in the Almighty ? Will he always call on God ?
NKJV	Job	27	11	“ I will teach you [ b ] about the hand of God ; What is with the Almighty I will not conceal .
NKJV	Job	27	12	Surely all of you have seen it ; Why then do you behave with complete nonsense ?
NKJV	Job	27	13	“ This ( H ) is the portion of a wicked man with God , And the heritage of oppressors , received from the Almighty :

NKJV	Job	27	15	Those who survive him shall be buried in death , And ( J ) their [ c ] widows shall not weep ,

NKJV	Job	28	5	As for the earth , from it comes bread , But underneath it is turned up as by fire ;

NKJV	Job	28	10	He cuts out channels in the rocks , And his eye sees every precious thing .
NKJV	Job	28	11	He dams up the streams from trickling ; What is hidden he brings forth to light .
NKJV	Job	28	12	“ But ( A ) where can wisdom be found ? And where is the place of understanding ?
NKJV	Job	28	13	Man does not know its ( B ) value , Nor is it found in the land of the living .

NKJV	Job	28	15	It ( D ) can not be purchased for gold , Nor can silver be weighed for its price .
NKJV	Job	28	16	It can not be valued in the gold of Ophir , In precious onyx or sapphire .
NKJV	Job	28	17	Neither ( E ) gold nor crystal can equal it , Nor can it be exchanged for [ d ] jewelry of fine gold .
NKJV	Job	28	18	No mention shall be made of [ e ] coral or quartz , For the price of wisdom is above ( F ) rubies .

NKJV	Job	29	11	When the ear heard , then it blessed me , And when the eye saw , then it approved me ;
NKJV	Job	29	12	Because ( I ) I delivered the poor who cried out , The fatherless and the one who had no helper .
NKJV	Job	29	13	The blessing of a perishing man came upon me , And I caused the widow ’ s heart to sing for joy .

NKJV	Job	31	12	For that would be a fire that consumes to destruction , And would root out all my increase .
NKJV	Job	31	13	“ If I have ( I ) despised the cause of my male or female servant When they complained against me ,
NKJV	Job	31	14	What then shall I do when ( J ) God rises up ? When He punishes , how shall I answer Him ?
NKJV	Job	31	15	( K ) Did not He who made me in the womb make them ? Did not the same One fashion us in the womb ?
NKJV	Job	31	16	“ If I have kept the poor from their desire , Or caused the eyes of the widow to ( L ) fail ,
NKJV	Job	31	17	Or eaten my morsel by myself , So that the fatherless could not eat of it
NKJV	Job	31	18	( But from my youth I reared him as a father , And from my mother ’ s womb I guided [ d ] the widow ) ;
NKJV	Job	31	19	If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing , Or any poor man without covering ;
NKJV	Job	31	20	If his [ e ] heart has not ( M ) blessed me , And if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep ;
NKJV	Job	31	21	If I have raised my hand ( N ) against the fatherless , When I saw I had help in the gate ;
NKJV	Job	31	22	Then let my arm fall from my shoulder , Let my arm be torn from the socket .
NKJV	Job	31	23	For ( O ) destruction from God is a terror to me , And because of His magnificence I can not endure .
NKJV	Job	31	24	“ If ( P ) I have made gold my hope , Or said to fine gold , ‘ You are my confidence ’ ;
NKJV	Job	31	25	( Q ) If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great , And because my hand had gained much ;
NKJV	Job	31	26	( R ) If I have observed the [ f ] sun when it shines , Or the moon moving in brightness ,
NKJV	Job	31	27	So that my heart has been secretly enticed , And my mouth has kissed my hand ;
NKJV	Job	31	28	This also would be an iniquity deserving of judgment , For I would have denied God who is above .
NKJV	Job	31	29	“ If ( S ) I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me , Or lifted myself up when evil found him
NKJV	Job	31	30	( T ) ( Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for a curse on his [ g ] soul ) ;
NKJV	Job	31	32	( U ) ( But no sojourner had to lodge in the street , For I have opened my doors to the [ h ] traveler ) ;
NKJV	Job	31	33	If I have covered my transgressions ( V ) as [ i ] Adam , By hiding my iniquity in my bosom ,
NKJV	Job	31	34	Because I feared the great ( W ) multitude , And dreaded the contempt of families , So that I kept silence And did not go out of the door—
NKJV	Job	31	35	( X ) Oh , that I had one to hear me ! Here is my mark . Oh , ( Y ) that the Almighty would answer me , That my [ j ] Prosecutor had written a book !
NKJV	Job	31	36	Surely I would carry it on my shoulder , And bind it on me like a crown ;
NKJV	Job	31	37	I would declare to Him the number of my steps ; Like a prince I would approach Him .
NKJV	Job	31	38	“ If my land cries out against me , And its furrows weep together ;
NKJV	Job	31	39	If ( Z ) I have eaten its [ k ] fruit without money , Or ( AA ) caused its owners to lose their lives ;
NKJV	Job	31	40	Then let ( AB ) thistles grow instead of wheat , And weeds instead of barley. ” The words of Job are ended . Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Job	32	32	So these three men ceased answering Job , because he was ( A ) righteous in his own eyes .
NKJV	Job	32	2	Then the wrath of Elihu , the son of Barachel the ( B ) Buzite , of the family of Ram , was aroused against Job ; his wrath was aroused because he ( C ) justified himself rather than God .
NKJV	Job	32	3	Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused , because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned Job .
NKJV	Job	32	4	Now because they were years older than he , Elihu had waited [ a ] to speak to Job .
NKJV	Job	32	5	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men , his wrath was aroused .
NKJV	Job	32	6	So Elihu , the son of Barachel the Buzite , answered and said : “ I am ( D ) young in years , and you are very old ; Therefore I was afraid , And dared not declare my opinion to you .
NKJV	Job	32	7	I said , [ b ] ‘ Age should speak , And multitude of years should teach wisdom. ’
NKJV	Job	32	8	But there is a spirit in man , And ( E ) the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding .
NKJV	Job	32	9	( F ) Great [ c ] men are not always wise , Nor do the aged always understand justice .
NKJV	Job	32	10	“ Therefore I say , ‘ Listen to me , I also will declare my opinion. ’
NKJV	Job	32	11	Indeed I waited for your words , I listened to your reasonings , while you searched out what to say .
NKJV	Job	32	12	I paid close attention to you ; And surely not one of you convinced Job , Or answered his words—
NKJV	Job	32	13	( G ) Lest you say , ‘ We have found wisdom ’ ; God will vanquish him , not man .
NKJV	Job	32	14	Now he has not [ d ] directed his words against me ; So I will not answer him with your words .
NKJV	Job	32	15	“ They are dismayed and answer no more ; Words escape them .
NKJV	Job	32	16	And I have waited , because they did not speak , Because they stood still and answered no more .
NKJV	Job	32	17	I also will answer my part , I too will declare my opinion .
NKJV	Job	32	18	For I am full of words ; The spirit within me compels me .
NKJV	Job	32	19	Indeed my [ e ] belly is like wine that has no [ f ] vent ; It is ready to burst like new wineskins .
NKJV	Job	32	20	I will speak , that I may find relief ; I must open my lips and answer .
NKJV	Job	32	21	Let me not , I pray , show partiality to anyone ; Nor let me flatter any man .

NKJV	Job	33	2	Now , I open my mouth ; My tongue speaks in my mouth .
NKJV	Job	33	3	My words come from my upright heart ; My lips utter pure knowledge .
NKJV	Job	33	4	( A ) The Spirit of God has made me , And the breath of the Almighty gives me life .
NKJV	Job	33	5	If you can answer me , Set your words in order before me ; Take your stand .
NKJV	Job	33	6	( B ) Truly I am [ a ] as your spokesman before God ; I also have been formed out of clay .
NKJV	Job	33	7	( C ) Surely no fear of me will terrify you , Nor will my hand be heavy on you .
NKJV	Job	33	8	“ Surely you have spoken [ b ] in my hearing , And I have heard the sound of your words , saying ,
NKJV	Job	33	9	‘ I ( D ) am pure , without transgression ; I am innocent , and there is no iniquity in me .
NKJV	Job	33	10	Yet He finds occasions against me , ( E ) He counts me as His enemy ;
NKJV	Job	33	11	( F ) He puts my feet in the stocks , He watches all my paths. ’
NKJV	Job	33	12	“ Look , in this you are not righteous . I will answer you , For God is greater than man .
NKJV	Job	33	13	Why do you ( G ) contend with Him ? For He does not give an accounting of any of His words .
NKJV	Job	33	14	( H ) For God may speak in one way , or in another , Yet man does not perceive it .
NKJV	Job	33	15	( I ) In a dream , in a vision of the night , When deep sleep falls upon men , While slumbering on their beds ,
NKJV	Job	33	16	( J ) Then He opens the ears of men , And seals their instruction .
NKJV	Job	33	17	In order to turn man from his deed , And conceal pride from man ,
NKJV	Job	33	18	He keeps back his soul from the Pit , And his life from [ c ] perishing by the sword .
NKJV	Job	33	19	“ Man is also chastened with pain on his ( K ) bed , And with strong pain in many of his bones ,
NKJV	Job	33	20	( L ) So that his life abhors ( M ) bread , And his soul [ d ] succulent food .
NKJV	Job	33	21	His flesh wastes away from sight , And his bones stick out which once were not seen .
NKJV	Job	33	22	Yes , his soul draws near the Pit , And his life to the executioners .
NKJV	Job	33	23	“ If there is a messenger for him , A mediator , one among a thousand , To show man His uprightness ,
NKJV	Job	33	24	Then He is gracious to him , and says , ‘ Deliver him from going down to the Pit ; I have found [ e ] a ransom ’ ;
NKJV	Job	33	25	His flesh shall be young like a child ’ s , He shall return to the days of his youth .
NKJV	Job	33	26	He shall pray to God , and He will delight in him , He shall see His face with joy , For He restores to man His righteousness .
NKJV	Job	33	27	Then he looks at men and ( N ) says , ‘ I have sinned , and perverted what was right , And it ( O ) did not profit me. ’
NKJV	Job	33	28	He will ( P ) redeem [ f ] his soul from going down to the Pit , And his life shall see the light .
NKJV	Job	33	29	“ Behold , God works all these things , Twice , in fact , three times with a man ,
NKJV	Job	33	30	( Q ) To bring back his soul from the Pit , That he may be enlightened with the light of life .
NKJV	Job	33	31	“ Give ear , Job , listen to me ; Hold your peace , and I will speak .

NKJV	Job	34	34	“ Men of understanding say to me , Wise men who listen to me :
NKJV	Job	34	2	“ Hear my words , you wise men ; Give ear to me , you who have knowledge .
NKJV	Job	34	3	( A ) For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food .
NKJV	Job	34	4	Let us choose justice for ourselves ; Let us know among ourselves what is good .
NKJV	Job	34	5	“ For Job has said , ( B ) ‘ I am righteous , But ( C ) God has taken away my justice ;
NKJV	Job	34	6	( D ) Should I lie concerning my right ? My [ a ] wound is incurable , though I am without transgression. ’
NKJV	Job	34	7	What man is like Job , ( E ) Who drinks [ b ] scorn like water ,
NKJV	Job	34	8	Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity , And walks with wicked men ?
NKJV	Job	34	9	For ( F ) he has said , ‘ It profits a man nothing That he should delight in God. ’
NKJV	Job	34	10	“ Therefore listen to me , you [ c ] men of understanding : ( G ) Far be it from God to do wickedness , And from the Almighty to commit iniquity .
NKJV	Job	34	11	( H ) For He repays man according to his work , And makes man to find a reward according to his way .
NKJV	Job	34	12	Surely God will never do wickedly , Nor will the Almighty ( I ) pervert justice .
NKJV	Job	34	13	Who gave Him charge over the earth ? Or who appointed Him over the whole world ?
NKJV	Job	34	14	If He should set His heart on it , If He should ( J ) gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath ,
NKJV	Job	34	15	( K ) All flesh would perish together , And man would return to dust .
NKJV	Job	34	16	“ If you have understanding , hear this ; Listen to the sound of my words :
NKJV	Job	34	17	( L ) Should one who hates justice govern ? Will you ( M ) condemn Him who is most just ?
NKJV	Job	34	18	( N ) Is it fitting to say to a king , ‘ You are worthless , ’ And to nobles , ‘ You are wicked ’ ?
NKJV	Job	34	19	Yet He ( O ) is not partial to princes , Nor does He regard the rich more than the poor ; For ( P ) they are all the work of His hands .
NKJV	Job	34	20	In a moment they die , ( Q ) in the middle of the night ; The people are shaken and pass away ; The mighty are taken away without a hand .
NKJV	Job	34	21	“ For ( R ) His eyes are on the ways of man , And He sees all his steps .
NKJV	Job	34	22	( S ) There is no darkness nor shadow of death Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves .
NKJV	Job	34	23	For He need not further consider a man , That he should go before God in judgment .
NKJV	Job	34	24	( T ) He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry , And sets others in their place .
NKJV	Job	34	25	Therefore He knows their works ; He overthrows them in the night , And they are crushed .
NKJV	Job	34	26	He strikes them as wicked men In the open sight of others ,
NKJV	Job	34	27	Because they ( U ) turned back from Him , And ( V ) would not consider any of His ways ,
NKJV	Job	34	28	So that they ( W ) caused the cry of the poor to come to Him ; For He ( X ) hears the cry of the afflicted .
NKJV	Job	34	29	When He gives quietness , who then can make trouble ? And when He hides His face , who then can see Him , Whether it is against a nation or a man alone ? —
NKJV	Job	34	30	That the hypocrite should not reign , Lest the people be ensnared .
NKJV	Job	34	31	“ For has anyone said to God , ‘ I have borne chastening ; I will offend no more ;
NKJV	Job	34	32	Teach me what I do not see ; If I have done iniquity , I will do no more ’ ?
NKJV	Job	34	33	Should He repay it according to your terms , Just because you disavow it ? You must choose , and not I ; Therefore speak what you know .
NKJV	Job	34	35	‘ Job ( Y ) speaks without knowledge , His words are without wisdom. ’
NKJV	Job	34	36	Oh , that Job were tried to the utmost , Because his answers are like those of wicked men !
NKJV	Job	34	37	For he adds ( Z ) rebellion to his sin ; He claps his hands among us , And multiplies his words against God. ” Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Job	35	35	Moreover Elihu answered and said :
NKJV	Job	35	2	“ Do you think this is right ? Do you say , ‘ My righteousness is more than God ’ s ’ ?
NKJV	Job	35	3	For ( A ) you say , ‘ What advantage will it be to You ? What profit shall I have , more than if I had sinned ? ’
NKJV	Job	35	4	“ I will answer you , And ( B ) your companions with you .
NKJV	Job	35	5	( C ) Look to the heavens and see ; And behold the clouds— They are higher than you .
NKJV	Job	35	6	If you sin , what do you accomplish ( D ) against Him ? Or , if your transgressions are multiplied , what do you do to Him ?
NKJV	Job	35	7	( E ) If you are righteous , what do you give Him ? Or what does He receive from your hand ?
NKJV	Job	35	8	Your wickedness affects a man such as you , And your righteousness a son of man .
NKJV	Job	35	9	“ Because ( F ) of the multitude of oppressions they cry out ; They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty .
NKJV	Job	35	10	But no one says , ( G ) ‘ Where is God my Maker , ( H ) Who gives songs in the night ,
NKJV	Job	35	11	Who ( I ) teaches us more than the beasts of the earth , And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven ? ’
NKJV	Job	35	12	( J ) There they cry out , but He does not answer , Because of the pride of evil men .
NKJV	Job	35	13	( K ) Surely God will not listen to empty talk , Nor will the Almighty regard it .
NKJV	Job	35	14	( L ) Although you say you do not see Him , Yet justice is before Him , and ( M ) you must wait for Him .
NKJV	Job	35	15	And now , because He has not ( N ) punished in His anger , Nor taken much notice of folly ,
NKJV	Job	35	16	( O ) Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain ; He multiplies words without knowledge. ” Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Job	36	36	Elihu also proceeded and said :
NKJV	Job	36	2	“ Bear with me a little , and I will show you That there are yet words to speak on God ’ s behalf .
NKJV	Job	36	3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar ; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker .
NKJV	Job	36	4	For truly my words are not false ; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you .
NKJV	Job	36	5	“ Behold , God is mighty , but despises no one ; ( A ) He is mighty in strength [ a ] of understanding .
NKJV	Job	36	6	He does not preserve the life of the wicked , But gives justice to the ( B ) oppressed .
NKJV	Job	36	7	( C ) He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous ; But ( D ) they are on the throne with kings , For He has seated them forever , And they are exalted .
NKJV	Job	36	8	And ( E ) if they are bound in [ b ] fetters , Held in the cords of affliction ,
NKJV	Job	36	9	Then He tells them their work and their transgressions— That they have acted [ c ] defiantly .
NKJV	Job	36	10	( F ) He also opens their ear to [ d ] instruction , And commands that they turn from iniquity .
NKJV	Job	36	11	If they obey and serve Him , They shall ( G ) spend their days in prosperity , And their years in pleasures .
NKJV	Job	36	12	But if they do not obey , They shall perish by the sword , And they shall die [ e ] without ( H ) knowledge .
NKJV	Job	36	13	“ But the hypocrites in heart ( I ) store up wrath ; They do not cry for help when He binds them .
NKJV	Job	36	14	( J ) They [ f ] die in youth , And their life ends among the [ g ] perverted persons .
NKJV	Job	36	15	He delivers the poor in their affliction , And opens their ears in oppression .
NKJV	Job	36	16	“ Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress , ( K ) Into a broad place where there is no restraint ; And ( L ) what is set on your table would be full of ( M ) richness .
NKJV	Job	36	17	But you are filled with the judgment due the ( N ) wicked ; Judgment and justice take hold of you .
NKJV	Job	36	18	Because there is wrath , beware lest He take you away with one blow ; For ( O ) a large ransom would not help you avoid it .
NKJV	Job	36	19	( P ) Will your riches , Or all the mighty forces , Keep you from distress ?
NKJV	Job	36	20	Do not desire the night , When people are cut off in their place .
NKJV	Job	36	21	Take heed , ( Q ) do not turn to iniquity , For ( R ) you have chosen this rather than affliction .
NKJV	Job	36	22	“ Behold , God is exalted by His power ; Who teaches like Him ?
NKJV	Job	36	23	( S ) Who has assigned Him His way , Or who has said , ‘ You have done ( T ) wrong ’ ? Elihu Proclaims God ’ s Majesty
NKJV	Job	36	24	“ Remember to ( U ) magnify His work , Of which men have sung .
NKJV	Job	36	25	Everyone has seen it ; Man looks on it from afar .

NKJV	Job	36	30	Look , He ( Z ) scatters His light upon it , And covers the depths of the sea .
NKJV	Job	36	31	For ( AA ) by these He judges the peoples ; He ( AB ) gives food in abundance .

NKJV	Job	37	5	God thunders marvelously with His voice ; ( B ) He does great things which we can not comprehend .

NKJV	Job	37	22	He comes from the north as golden splendor ; With God is awesome majesty .
NKJV	Job	37	23	As for the Almighty , ( Q ) we can not find Him ; ( R ) He is excellent in power , In judgment and abundant justice ; He does not oppress .

NKJV	Job	39	2	Can you number the months that they fulfill ? Or do you know the time when they bear young ?
NKJV	Job	39	3	They bow down , They bring forth their young , They deliver their [ a ] offspring .
NKJV	Job	39	4	Their young ones are healthy , They grow strong with grain ; They depart and do not return to them .
NKJV	Job	39	5	“ Who set the wild donkey free ? Who loosed the bonds of the [ b ] onager ,
NKJV	Job	39	6	( C ) Whose home I have made the wilderness , And the [ c ] barren land his dwelling ?

NKJV	Job	39	13	“ The wings of the ostrich wave proudly , But are her wings and pinions like the kindly stork ’ s ?
NKJV	Job	39	14	For she leaves her eggs on the ground , And warms them in the dust ;
NKJV	Job	39	15	She forgets that a foot may crush them , Or that a wild beast may break them .
NKJV	Job	39	16	She ( F ) treats her young harshly , as though they were not hers ; Her labor is in vain , without [ e ] concern ,
NKJV	Job	39	17	Because God deprived her of wisdom , And did not ( G ) endow her with understanding .
NKJV	Job	39	18	When she lifts herself on high , She scorns the horse and its rider .
NKJV	Job	39	19	“ Have you given the horse strength ? Have you clothed his neck with [ f ] thunder ?
NKJV	Job	39	20	Can you [ g ] frighten him like a locust ? His majestic snorting strikes terror .

NKJV	Job	40	11	Disperse the rage of your wrath ; Look on everyone who is proud , and humble him .
NKJV	Job	40	12	Look on everyone who is ( L ) proud , and bring him low ; Tread down the wicked in their place .
NKJV	Job	40	13	Hide them in the dust together , Bind their faces in hidden darkness .
NKJV	Job	40	14	Then I will also confess to you That your own right hand can save you .
NKJV	Job	40	15	“ Look now at the [ c ] behemoth , which I made along with you ; He eats grass like an ox .
NKJV	Job	40	16	See now , his strength is in his hips , And his power is in his stomach muscles .
NKJV	Job	40	17	He moves his tail like a cedar ; The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit .
NKJV	Job	40	18	His bones are like beams of bronze , His ribs like bars of iron .
NKJV	Job	40	19	He is the first of the ( M ) ways of God ; Only He who made him can bring near His sword .
NKJV	Job	40	20	Surely the mountains ( N ) yield food for him , And all the beasts of the field play there .
NKJV	Job	40	21	He lies under the lotus trees , In a covert of reeds and marsh .
NKJV	Job	40	22	The lotus trees cover him with their shade ; The willows by the brook surround him .
NKJV	Job	40	23	Indeed the river may rage , Yet he is not disturbed ; He is confident , though the Jordan gushes into his mouth ,

NKJV	Job	41	5	Will you play with him as with a bird , Or will you leash him for your maidens ?
NKJV	Job	41	6	Will your companions [ c ] make a banquet of him ? Will they apportion him among the merchants ?
NKJV	Job	41	7	Can you fill his skin with harpoons , Or his head with fishing spears ?
NKJV	Job	41	8	Lay your hand on him ; Remember the battle— Never do it again !
NKJV	Job	41	9	Indeed , any hope of overcoming him is false ; Shall one not be overwhelmed at the sight of him ?
NKJV	Job	41	10	No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up . Who then is able to stand against Me ?

NKJV	Job	41	17	They are joined one to another , They stick together and can not be parted .
NKJV	Job	41	18	His sneezings flash forth light , And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning .
NKJV	Job	41	19	Out of his mouth go burning lights ; Sparks of fire shoot out .
NKJV	Job	41	20	Smoke goes out of his nostrils , As from a boiling pot and burning rushes .
NKJV	Job	41	21	His breath kindles coals , And a flame goes out of his mouth .
NKJV	Job	41	22	Strength dwells in his neck , And [ g ] sorrow dances before him .
NKJV	Job	41	23	The folds of his flesh are joined together ; They are firm on him and can not be moved .
NKJV	Job	41	24	His heart is as hard as stone , Even as hard as the lower millstone .
NKJV	Job	41	25	When he raises himself up , the mighty are afraid ; Because of his crashings they [ h ] are beside themselves .
NKJV	Job	41	26	Though the sword reaches him , it can not avail ; Nor does spear , dart , or javelin .
NKJV	Job	41	27	He regards iron as straw , And bronze as rotten wood .
NKJV	Job	41	28	The arrow can not make him flee ; Slingstones become like stubble to him .
NKJV	Job	41	29	Darts are regarded as straw ; He laughs at the threat of javelins .
NKJV	Job	41	30	His undersides are like sharp potsherds ; He spreads pointed marks in the mire .
NKJV	Job	41	31	He makes the deep boil like a pot ; He makes the sea like a pot of ointment .
NKJV	Job	41	32	He leaves a shining wake behind him ; One would think the deep had white hair .

NKJV	Job	42	42	Then Job answered the Lord and said :
NKJV	Job	42	2	“ I know that You ( A ) can do everything , And that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You .
NKJV	Job	42	3	You asked , ( B ) ‘ Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge ? ’ Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand , ( C ) Things too wonderful for me , which I did not know .
NKJV	Job	42	4	Listen , please , and let me speak ; You said , ( D ) ‘ I will question you , and you shall answer Me. ’
NKJV	Job	42	5	“ I have ( E ) heard of You by the hearing of the ear , But now my eye sees You .
NKJV	Job	42	6	Therefore I ( F ) abhor [ a ] myself , And repent in dust and ashes. ”
NKJV	Job	42	7	And so it was , after the Lord had spoken these words to Job , that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite , “ My wrath is aroused against you and your two friends , for you have not spoken of Me what is right , as My servant Job has .
NKJV	Job	42	8	Now therefore , take for yourselves ( G ) seven bulls and seven rams , ( H ) go to My servant Job , and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering ; and My servant Job shall ( I ) pray for you . For I will accept [ b ] him , lest I deal with you according to your folly ; because you have not spoken of Me what is right , as My servant Job has. ”
NKJV	Job	42	9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord commanded them ; for the Lord had [ c ] accepted Job .
NKJV	Job	42	10	( J ) And the Lord [ d ] restored Job ’ s losses when he prayed for his friends . Indeed the Lord gave Job ( K ) twice as much as he had before .
NKJV	Job	42	11	Then ( L ) all his brothers , all his sisters , and all those who had been his acquaintances before , came to him and ate food with him in his house ; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the Lord had brought upon him . Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold .
NKJV	Job	42	12	Now the Lord blessed ( M ) the latter days of Job more than his beginning ; for he had ( N ) fourteen thousand sheep , six thousand camels , one thousand yoke of oxen , and one thousand female donkeys .
NKJV	Job	42	13	( O ) He also had seven sons and three daughters .
NKJV	Job	42	14	And he called the name of the first [ e ] Jemimah , the name of the second [ f ] Keziah , and the name of the third [ g ] Keren-Happuch .
NKJV	Job	42	15	In all the land were found no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job ; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers .

NKJV	Psalms	78	22	Because they ( Y ) did not believe in God , And did not trust in His salvation .
NKJV	Psalms	78	23	Yet He had commanded the clouds above , ( Z ) And opened the doors of heaven ,
NKJV	Psalms	78	24	( AA ) Had rained down manna on them to eat , And given them of the [ e ] bread of ( AB ) heaven .
NKJV	Psalms	78	25	Men ate angels ’ food ; He sent them food to [ f ] the full .
NKJV	Psalms	78	26	( AC ) He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens ; And by His power He brought in the south wind .
NKJV	Psalms	78	27	He also rained meat on them like the dust , Feathered fowl like the sand of the seas ;
NKJV	Psalms	78	28	And He let them fall in the midst of their camp , All around their dwellings .
NKJV	Psalms	78	29	( AD ) So they ate and were well filled , For He gave them their own desire .
NKJV	Psalms	78	30	They were not [ g ] deprived of their craving ; But ( AE ) while their food was still in their mouths ,
NKJV	Psalms	78	31	The wrath of God came against them , And slew the stoutest of them , And struck down the choice men of Israel .
NKJV	Psalms	78	32	In spite of this ( AF ) they still sinned , And ( AG ) did not believe in His wondrous works .
NKJV	Psalms	78	33	( AH ) Therefore their days He consumed in futility , And their years in fear .
NKJV	Psalms	78	34	( AI ) When He slew them , then they sought Him ; And they returned and sought earnestly for God .
NKJV	Psalms	78	35	Then they remembered that ( AJ ) God was their rock , And the Most High God ( AK ) their Redeemer .
NKJV	Psalms	78	36	Nevertheless they ( AL ) flattered Him with their mouth , And they lied to Him with their tongue ;
NKJV	Psalms	78	37	For their heart was not steadfast with Him , Nor were they faithful in His covenant .
NKJV	Psalms	78	38	( AM ) But He , being full of ( AN ) compassion , forgave their iniquity , And did not destroy them . Yes , many a time ( AO ) He turned His anger away , And ( AP ) did not stir up all His wrath ;
NKJV	Psalms	78	39	For ( AQ ) He remembered ( AR ) that they were but flesh , ( AS ) A breath that passes away and does not come again .
NKJV	Psalms	78	40	How often they ( AT ) provoked [ h ] Him in the wilderness , And grieved Him in the desert !
NKJV	Psalms	78	41	Yes , ( AU ) again and again they tempted God , And limited the Holy One of Israel .
NKJV	Psalms	78	42	They did not remember His [ i ] power : The day when He redeemed them from the enemy ,
NKJV	Psalms	78	43	When He worked His signs in Egypt , And His wonders in the field of Zoan ;
NKJV	Psalms	78	44	( AV ) Turned their rivers into blood , And their streams , that they could not drink .
NKJV	Psalms	78	45	( AW ) He sent swarms of flies among them , which devoured them , And ( AX ) frogs , which destroyed them .
NKJV	Psalms	78	46	He also gave their crops to the caterpillar , And their labor to the ( AY ) locust .
NKJV	Psalms	78	47	( AZ ) He destroyed their vines with hail , And their sycamore trees with frost .
NKJV	Psalms	78	48	He also gave up their ( BA ) cattle to the hail , And their flocks to fiery [ j ] lightning .
NKJV	Psalms	78	49	He cast on them the fierceness of His anger , Wrath , indignation , and trouble , By sending angels of destruction among them .
NKJV	Psalms	78	50	He made a path for His anger ; He did not spare their soul from death , But gave [ k ] their life over to the plague ,
NKJV	Psalms	78	51	And destroyed all the ( BB ) firstborn in Egypt , The first of their strength in the tents of Ham .
NKJV	Psalms	78	52	But He ( BC ) made His own people go forth like sheep , And guided them in the wilderness like a flock ;
NKJV	Psalms	78	53	And He ( BD ) led them on safely , so that they did not fear ; But the sea ( BE ) overwhelmed their enemies .
NKJV	Psalms	78	54	And He brought them to His ( BF ) holy border , This mountain ( BG ) which His right hand had acquired .
NKJV	Psalms	78	55	( BH ) He also drove out the nations before them , ( BI ) Allotted them an inheritance by [ l ] survey , And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents .
NKJV	Psalms	78	56	( BJ ) Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God , And did not keep His testimonies ,
NKJV	Psalms	78	57	But ( BK ) turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers ; They were turned aside ( BL ) like a deceitful bow .
NKJV	Psalms	78	58	( BM ) For they provoked Him to anger with their ( BN ) high places , And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images .
NKJV	Psalms	78	59	When God heard this , He was furious , And greatly abhorred Israel ,
NKJV	Psalms	78	60	( BO ) So that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh , The tent He had placed among men ,
NKJV	Psalms	78	61	( BP ) And delivered His strength into captivity , And His glory into the enemy ’ s hand .
NKJV	Psalms	78	62	( BQ ) He also gave His people over to the sword , And was furious with His inheritance .
NKJV	Psalms	78	63	The fire consumed their young men , And ( BR ) their maidens were not given in marriage .
NKJV	Psalms	78	64	( BS ) Their priests fell by the sword , And ( BT ) their widows made no lamentation .
NKJV	Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord awoke as from sleep , ( BU ) Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine .
NKJV	Psalms	78	66	And ( BV ) He beat back His enemies ; He put them to a perpetual reproach .
NKJV	Psalms	78	67	Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph , And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim ,
NKJV	Psalms	78	68	But chose the tribe of Judah , Mount Zion ( BW ) which He loved .
NKJV	Psalms	78	69	And He built His ( BX ) sanctuary like the heights , Like the earth which He has established forever .
NKJV	Psalms	78	70	( BY ) He also chose David His servant , And took him from the sheepfolds ;
NKJV	Psalms	78	71	From following ( BZ ) the ewes that had young He brought him , ( CA ) To shepherd Jacob His people , And Israel His inheritance .
NKJV	Psalms	78	72	So he shepherded them according to the ( CB ) integrity of his heart , And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands . Footnotes - Psalm 78:1 Heb .

NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	2	I said of laughter— “ Madness ! ” ; and of mirth , “ What does it accomplish ? ”
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	3	( E ) I searched in my heart how [ b ] to gratify my flesh with wine , while guiding my heart with wisdom , and how to lay hold on folly , till I might see what was ( F ) good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	4	I made my works great , I built myself ( G ) houses , and planted myself vineyards .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	5	I made myself gardens and orchards , and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	6	I made myself water pools from which to [ c ] water the growing trees of the grove .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	7	I acquired male and female servants , and had [ d ] servants born in my house . Yes , I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem before me .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	8	( H ) I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and of the provinces . I acquired male and female singers , the delights of the sons of men , and [ e ] musical instruments of all kinds .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	9	( I ) So I became great and [ f ] excelled ( J ) more than all who were before me in Jerusalem . Also my wisdom remained with me .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	10	Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them . I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure , For my heart rejoiced in all my labor ; And ( K ) this was my [ g ] reward from all my labor .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	11	Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done And on the labor in which I had toiled ; And indeed all was ( L ) vanity and grasping for the wind . There was no profit under the sun . The End of the Wise and the Fool
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	12	Then I turned myself to consider wisdom ( M ) and madness and folly ; For what can the man do who succeeds the king ? — Only what he has already ( N ) done .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	13	Then I saw that wisdom ( O ) excels folly As light excels darkness .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	14	( P ) The wise man ’ s eyes are in his head , But the fool walks in darkness . Yet I myself perceived That ( Q ) the same event happens to them all .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	15	So I said in my heart , “ As it happens to the fool , It also happens to me , And why was I then more wise ? ” Then I said in my heart , “ This also is vanity. ”
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	16	For there is ( R ) no more remembrance of the wise than of the fool forever , Since all that now is will be forgotten in the days to come . And how does a wise man die ? As the fool !
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	17	Therefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me , for all is vanity and grasping for the wind .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	18	Then I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun , because ( S ) I must leave it to the man who will come after me .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	19	And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool ? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun . This also is vanity .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	20	Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	21	For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom , knowledge , and skill ; yet he must leave his [ h ] heritage to a man who has not labored for it . This also is vanity and a great evil .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	22	( T ) For what has man for all his labor , and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	23	For all his days are ( U ) sorrowful , and his work burdensome ; even in the night his heart takes no rest . This also is vanity .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	24	( V ) Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor . This also , I saw , was from the hand of God .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	2	25	For who can eat , or who can have enjoyment , [ i ] more than I ?

NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	8	A time to love , And a time to ( G ) hate ; A time of war , And a time of peace . The God-Given Task
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	9	( H ) What profit has the worker from that in which he labors ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	10	( I ) I have seen the God-given task with which the sons of men are to be occupied .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	11	He has made everything beautiful in its time . Also He has put eternity in their hearts , except that ( J ) no one can find out the work that God does from beginning to end .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	12	I know that nothing is ( K ) better for them than to rejoice , and to do good in their lives ,
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	13	and also that ( L ) every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor—it is the gift of God .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I know that whatever God does , It shall be forever . ( M ) Nothing can be added to it , And nothing taken from it . God does it , that men should fear before Him .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	15	( N ) That which is has already been , And what is to be has already been ; And God [ b ] requires an account of [ c ] what is past . Injustice Seems to Prevail
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	16	Moreover ( O ) I saw under the sun : In the place of [ d ] judgment , Wickedness was there ; And in the place of righteousness , [ e ] Iniquity was there .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	17	I said in my heart , ( P ) “ God shall judge the righteous and the wicked , For there is a time there for every [ f ] purpose and for every work. ”
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I said in my heart , “ Concerning the condition of the sons of men , God tests them , that they may see that they themselves are like animals. ”
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	19	( Q ) For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals ; one thing befalls them : as one dies , so dies the other . Surely , they all have one breath ; man has no advantage over animals , for all is vanity .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	20	All go to one place : ( R ) all are from the dust , and all return to dust .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	21	( S ) Who [ g ] knows the spirit of the sons of men , which goes upward , and the spirit of the animal , which goes down to the earth ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	3	22	( T ) So I perceived that nothing is better than that a man should rejoice in his own works , for ( U ) that is his [ h ] heritage . ( V ) For who can bring him to see what will happen after him ?

NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	4	Again , I saw that for all toil and every skillful work a man is envied by his neighbor . This also is vanity and grasping for the wind .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	2	( B ) Therefore I praised the dead who were already dead , More than the living who are still alive .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	3	( C ) Yet , better than both is he who has never existed , Who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun . The Vanity of Selfish Toil
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	5	( D ) The fool folds his hands And consumes his own flesh .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	6	( E ) Better a handful with quietness Than both hands full , together with toil and grasping for the wind .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Then I returned , and I saw vanity under the sun :
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	8	There is one alone , without [ b ] companion : He has neither son nor brother . Yet there is no end to all his labors , Nor is his ( F ) eye satisfied with riches . But ( G ) he never asks , “ For whom do I toil and deprive myself of ( H ) good ? ” This also is vanity and a [ c ] grave misfortune . The Value of a Friend
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two are better than one , Because they have a good reward for their labor .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	10	For if they fall , one will lift up his companion . But woe to him who is alone when he falls , For he has no one to help him up .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	11	Again , if two lie down together , they will keep warm ; But how can one be warm alone ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	12	Though one may be overpowered by another , two can withstand him . And a threefold cord is not quickly broken . Popularity Passes Away
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	13	Better a poor and wise youth Than an old and foolish king who will be admonished no more .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	14	For he comes out of prison to be king , Although [ d ] he was born poor in his kingdom .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I saw all the living who walk under the sun ; They were with the second youth who stands in his place .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	4	16	There was no end of all the people [ e ] over whom he was made king ; Yet those who come afterward will not rejoice in him . Surely this also is vanity and grasping for the wind . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 4:1 Lit .

NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	5	( H ) Better not to vow than to vow and not pay .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	2	Do not be ( C ) rash with your mouth , And let not your heart utter anything hastily before God . For God is in heaven , and you on earth ; Therefore let your words ( D ) be few .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	3	For a dream comes through much activity , And ( E ) a fool ’ s voice is known by his many words .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	4	( F ) When you make a vow to God , do not delay to ( G ) pay it ; For He has no pleasure in fools . Pay what you have vowed—
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	6	Do not let your ( I ) mouth cause your flesh to sin , ( J ) nor say before the messenger of God that it was an error . Why should God be angry at your [ a ] excuse and destroy the work of your hands ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	7	For in the multitude of dreams and many words there is also vanity . But ( K ) fear God . The Vanity of Gain and Honor
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	8	If you ( L ) see the oppression of the poor , and the violent [ b ] perversion of justice and righteousness in a province , do not marvel at the matter ; for ( M ) high official watches over high official , and higher officials are over them .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	9	Moreover the profit of the land is for all ; even the king is served from the field .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	10	He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver ; Nor he who loves abundance , with increase . This also is vanity .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	11	When goods increase , They increase who eat them ; So what profit have the owners Except to see them with their eyes ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	12	The sleep of a laboring man is sweet , Whether he eats little or much ; But the abundance of the rich will not permit him to sleep .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	13	( N ) There is a severe evil which I have seen under the sun : Riches kept for their owner to his hurt .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	14	But those riches perish through [ c ] misfortune ; When he begets a son , there is nothing in his hand .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	15	( O ) As he came from his mother ’ s womb , naked shall he return , To go as he came ; And he shall take nothing from his labor Which he may carry away in his hand .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	16	And this also is a severe evil— Just exactly as he came , so shall he go . And ( P ) what profit has he ( Q ) who has labored for the wind ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	17	All his days ( R ) he also eats in darkness , And he has much sorrow and sickness and anger .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	18	Here is what I have seen : ( S ) It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink , and to enjoy the good of all his labor in which he toils under the sun all the days of his life which God gives him ; ( T ) for it is his [ d ] heritage .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	19	As for ( U ) every man to whom God has given riches and wealth , and given him power to eat of it , to receive his [ e ] heritage and rejoice in his labor—this is the ( V ) gift of God .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	5	20	For he will not dwell unduly on the days of his life , because God keeps him busy with the joy of his heart .

NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	6	even if he lives a thousand years twice—but has not seen goodness . Do not all go to one ( F ) place ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	2	A man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor , ( B ) so that he lacks nothing for himself of all he desires ; ( C ) yet God does not give him power to eat of it , but a foreigner consumes it . This is vanity , and it is an evil [ a ] affliction .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	3	If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years , so that the days of his years are many , but his soul is not satisfied with goodness , or ( D ) indeed he has no burial , I say that ( E ) a [ b ] stillborn child is better than he—
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	4	for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness , and its name is covered with darkness .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	5	Though it has not seen the sun or known anything , this has more rest than that man ,
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	7	( G ) All the labor of man is for his mouth , And yet the soul is not satisfied .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	8	For what more has the wise man than the fool ? What does the poor man have , Who knows how to walk before the living ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	9	Better is [ c ] the ( H ) sight of the eyes than the wandering of [ d ] desire . This also is vanity and grasping for the wind .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	10	Whatever one is , he has been named ( I ) already , For it is known that he is man ; ( J ) And he can not contend with Him who is mightier than he .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	11	Since there are many things that increase vanity , How is man the better ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	6	12	For who knows what is good for man in life , [ e ] all the days of his [ f ] vain life which he passes like ( K ) a shadow ? ( L ) Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun ?

NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	7	Surely oppression destroys a wise man ’ s reason , ( G ) And a bribe [ e ] debases the heart .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	2	Better to go to the house of mourning Than to go to the house of feasting , For that is the end of all men ; And the living will take it to ( C ) heart .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	3	[ a ] Sorrow is better than laughter , ( D ) For by a sad countenance the heart is made [ b ] better .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning , But the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	5	( E ) It is better to [ c ] hear the rebuke of the wise Than for a man to hear the song of fools .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	6	( F ) For like the [ d ] crackling of thorns under a pot , So is the laughter of the fool . This also is vanity .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	8	The end of a thing is better than its beginning ; ( H ) The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	9	( I ) Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry , For anger rests in the bosom of fools .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Do not say , “ Why were the former days better than these ? ” For you do not inquire wisely concerning this .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Wisdom is good with an inheritance , And profitable ( J ) to those who see the sun .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	12	For wisdom is [ f ] a ( K ) defense as money is a defense , But the [ g ] excellence of knowledge is that wisdom gives ( L ) life to those who have it .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Consider the work of God ; For ( M ) who can make straight what He has made crooked ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	14	( N ) In the day of prosperity be joyful , But in the day of adversity consider : Surely God has appointed the one [ h ] as well as the other , So that man can find out nothing that will come after him .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	15	I have seen everything in my days of vanity : ( O ) There is a just man who perishes in his righteousness , And there is a wicked man who prolongs life in his wickedness .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	16	( P ) Do not be overly righteous , ( Q ) Nor be overly wise : Why should you destroy yourself ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	17	Do not be overly wicked , Nor be foolish : ( R ) Why should you die before your time ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	18	It is good that you grasp this , And also not remove your hand from the other ; For he who ( S ) fears God will [ i ] escape them all .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	19	( T ) Wisdom strengthens the wise More than ten rulers of the city .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	20	( U ) For there is not a just man on earth who does good And does not sin .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Also do not take to heart everything people say , Lest you hear your servant cursing you .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	22	For many times , also , your own heart has known That even you have cursed others .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	23	All this I have [ j ] proved by wisdom . ( V ) I said , “ I will be wise ” ; But it was far from me .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	24	( W ) As for that which is far off and ( X ) exceedingly deep , Who can find it out ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	25	( Y ) I applied my heart to know , To search and seek out wisdom and the reason of things , To know the wickedness of folly , Even of foolishness and madness .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	26	( Z ) And I find more bitter than death The woman whose heart is snares and nets , Whose hands are fetters . [ k ] He who pleases God shall escape from her , But the sinner shall be trapped by her .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	27	“ Here is what I have found , ” says ( AA ) the Preacher , “ Adding one thing to the other to find out the reason ,
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	7	28	Which my soul still seeks but I can not find : ( AB ) One man among a thousand I have found , But a woman among all these I have not found .

NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	8	( H ) No one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit , And no one has power in the day of death . There is ( I ) no release from that war , And wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	2	I say , “ Keep the king ’ s commandment ( C ) for the sake of your oath to God .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	3	( D ) Do not be hasty to go from his presence . Do not take your stand for an evil thing , for he does whatever pleases him. ”
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	4	Where the word of a king is , there is power ; And ( E ) who may say to him , “ What are you doing ? ”
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	5	He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful ; And a wise man ’ s heart [ b ] discerns both time and judgment ,
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	6	Because ( F ) for every matter there is a time and judgment , Though the misery of man [ c ] increases greatly .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	7	( G ) For he does not know what will happen ; So who can tell him when it will occur ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	9	All this I have seen , and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun : There is a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt . Death Comes to All
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	10	Then I saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the place of holiness , and they were ( J ) forgotten [ d ] in the city where they had so done . This also is vanity .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	11	( K ) Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	12	( L ) Though a sinner does evil a hundred times , and his days are prolonged , yet I surely know that ( M ) it will be well with those who fear God , who fear before Him .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	13	But it will not be well with the wicked ; nor will he prolong his days , which are as a shadow , because he does not fear before God .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	14	There is a vanity which occurs on earth , that there are just men to whom it ( N ) happens according to the work of the wicked ; again , there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the ( O ) righteous . I said that this also is vanity .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	15	( P ) So I commended enjoyment , because a man has nothing better under the sun than to eat , drink , and be merry ; for this will remain with him in his labor all the days of his life which God gives him under the sun .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	16	When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done on earth , even though one sees no sleep day or night ,
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	8	17	then I saw all the work of God , that ( Q ) a man can not find out the work that is done under the sun . For though a man labors to discover it , yet he will not find it ; moreover , though a wise man attempts to know it , he will not be able to find it .

NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	9	[ c ] Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which He has given you under the sun , all your days of vanity ; ( F ) for that is your portion in life , and in the labor which you perform under the sun .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	2	( B ) All things come alike to all : One event happens to the righteous and the wicked ; To the [ b ] good , the clean , and the unclean ; To him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice . As is the good , so is the sinner ; He who takes an oath as he who fears an oath .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	3	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun : that one thing happens to all . Truly the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil ; madness is in their hearts while they live , and after that they go to the dead .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	4	But for him who is joined to all the living there is hope , for a living dog is better than a dead lion .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	5	For the living know that they will die ; But ( C ) the dead know nothing , And they have no more reward , For ( D ) the memory of them is forgotten .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	6	Also their love , their hatred , and their envy have now perished ; Nevermore will they have a share In anything done under the sun .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	7	Go , ( E ) eat your bread with joy , And drink your wine with a merry heart ; For God has already accepted your works .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Let your garments always be white , And let your head lack no oil .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	10	( G ) Whatever your hand finds to do , do it with your ( H ) might ; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	11	I returned ( I ) and saw under the sun that— The race is not to the swift , Nor the battle to the strong , Nor bread to the wise , Nor riches to men of understanding , Nor favor to men of skill ; But time and ( J ) chance happen to them all .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	12	For ( K ) man also does not know his time : Like fish taken in a cruel net , Like birds caught in a snare , So the sons of men are ( L ) snared in an evil time , When it falls suddenly upon them . Wisdom Superior to Folly
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	13	This wisdom I have also seen under the sun , and it seemed great to me :
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	14	( M ) There was a little city with few men in it ; and a great king came against it , besieged it , and built great [ d ] snares around it .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	15	Now there was found in it a poor wise man , and he by his wisdom delivered the city . Yet no one remembered that same poor man .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	16	Then I said : “ Wisdom is better than ( N ) strength . Nevertheless ( O ) the poor man ’ s wisdom is despised , And his words are not heard .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	17	Words of the wise , spoken quietly , should be heard Rather than the shout of a ruler of fools .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war ; But ( P ) one sinner destroys much good. ” Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 9:1 Lit . put - Ecclesiastes 9:2 LXX , Syr. , Vg . good and bad , - Ecclesiastes 9:9 Lit .

NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	10	If the ax is dull , And one does not sharpen the edge , Then he must use more strength ; But wisdom [ e ] brings success .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	2	A wise man ’ s heart is at his right hand , But a fool ’ s heart at his left .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	3	Even when a fool walks along the way , He lacks wisdom , ( A ) And he shows everyone that he is a fool .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	4	If the spirit of the ruler rises against you , ( B ) Do not leave your post ; For ( C ) conciliation [ c ] pacifies great offenses .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	5	There is an evil I have seen under the sun , As an error proceeding from the ruler :
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	6	( D ) Folly is set in [ d ] great dignity , While the rich sit in a lowly place .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have seen servants ( E ) on horses , While princes walk on the ground like servants .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	8	( F ) He who digs a pit will fall into it , And whoever breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	9	He who quarries stones may be hurt by them , And he who splits wood may be endangered by it .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	11	A serpent may bite ( G ) when it is not charmed ; The [ f ] babbler is no different .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	12	( H ) The words of a wise man ’ s mouth are gracious , But ( I ) the lips of a fool shall swallow him up ;
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	13	The words of his mouth begin with foolishness , And the end of his talk is raving madness .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	14	( J ) A fool also multiplies words . No man knows what is to be ; Who can tell him ( K ) what will be after him ?
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	15	The labor of fools wearies them , For they do not even know how to go to the city !
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	16	( L ) Woe to you , O land , when your king is a child , And your princes feast in the morning !
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	17	Blessed are you , O land , when your king is the son of nobles , And your ( M ) princes feast at the proper time— For strength and not for drunkenness !
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	18	Because of laziness the [ g ] building decays , And ( N ) through idleness of hands the house leaks .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	19	A feast is made for laughter , And ( O ) wine makes merry ; But money answers everything .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	10	20	( P ) Do not curse the king , even in your thought ; Do not curse the rich , even in your bedroom ; For a bird of the air may carry your voice , And a bird in flight may tell the matter .

NKJV	Ecclesiastes	11	2	( C ) Give a serving ( D ) to seven , and also to eight , ( E ) For you do not know what evil will be on the earth .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	11	3	If the clouds are full of rain , They empty themselves upon the earth ; And if a tree falls to the south or the north , In the place where the tree falls , there it shall lie .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	11	4	He who observes the wind will not sow , And he who regards the clouds will not reap .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	11	5	As ( F ) you do not know what is the way of the [ a ] wind , ( G ) Or how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child , So you do not know the works of God who makes everything .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	11	6	In the morning sow your seed , And in the evening do not withhold your hand ; For you do not know which will prosper , Either this or that , Or whether both alike will be good .
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	11	7	Truly the light is sweet , And it is pleasant for the eyes ( H ) to behold the sun ;
NKJV	Ecclesiastes	11	8	But if a man lives many years And ( I ) rejoices in them all , Yet let him ( J ) remember the days of darkness , For they will be many . All that is coming is vanity . Seek God in Early Life

NKJV	Isaiah	2	5	O house of Jacob , come and let us ( G ) walk In the light of the Lord .
NKJV	Isaiah	2	6	For You have forsaken Your people , the house of Jacob , Because they are filled ( H ) with eastern ways ; They are ( I ) soothsayers like the Philistines , ( J ) And they [ b ] are pleased with the children of foreigners .
NKJV	Isaiah	2	7	( K ) Their land is also full of silver and gold , And there is no end to their treasures ; Their land is also full of horses , And there is no end to their chariots .

NKJV	Isaiah	2	11	The [ c ] lofty looks of man shall be ( N ) humbled , The haughtiness of men shall be bowed down , And the Lord alone shall be exalted ( O ) in that day .

NKJV	Isaiah	3	2	( C ) The mighty man and the man of war , The judge and the prophet , And the diviner and the elder ;
NKJV	Isaiah	3	4	“ I will give ( D ) children [ c ] to be their princes , And [ d ] babes shall rule over them .
NKJV	Isaiah	3	5	The people will be oppressed , Every one by another and every one by his neighbor ; The child will be insolent toward the [ e ] elder , And the [ f ] base toward the honorable. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	3	6	When a man takes hold of his brother In the house of his father , saying , “ You have clothing ; You be our ruler , And let these ruins be under your [ g ] power , ”
NKJV	Isaiah	3	7	In that day he will protest , saying , “ I can not cure your ills , For in my house is neither food nor clothing ; Do not make me a ruler of the people. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	3	8	For ( E ) Jerusalem stumbled , And Judah is fallen , Because their tongue and their doings Are against the Lord , To provoke the eyes of His glory .
NKJV	Isaiah	3	9	The look on their countenance witnesses against them , And they declare their sin as ( F ) Sodom ; They do not hide it . Woe to their soul ! For they have brought evil upon themselves .

NKJV	Isaiah	3	13	The Lord stands up ( K ) to [ j ] plead , And stands to judge the people .
NKJV	Isaiah	3	14	The Lord will enter into judgment With the elders of His people And His princes : “ For you have [ k ] eaten up ( L ) the vineyard ; The plunder of the poor is in your houses .
NKJV	Isaiah	3	15	What do you mean by ( M ) crushing My people And grinding the faces of the poor ? ” Says the Lord God of hosts .
NKJV	Isaiah	3	16	Moreover the Lord says : “ Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , And walk with [ l ] outstretched necks And [ m ] wanton eyes , Walking and [ n ] mincing as they go , Making a jingling with their feet ,
NKJV	Isaiah	3	17	Therefore the Lord will strike with ( N ) a scab The crown of the head of the daughters of Zion , And the Lord will ( O ) uncover their secret parts. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	3	18	In that day the Lord will take away the finery : The jingling anklets , the [ o ] scarves , and the ( P ) crescents ;

NKJV	Isaiah	4	4	When ( G ) the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion , and purged the [ a ] blood of Jerusalem from her midst , by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning ,

NKJV	Isaiah	5	5	And now , please let Me tell you what I will do to My vineyard : ( E ) I will take away its hedge , and it shall be burned ; And break down its wall , and it shall be trampled down .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	2	He dug it up and cleared out its stones , And planted it with the choicest vine . He built a tower in its midst , And also [ b ] made a winepress in it ; ( B ) So He expected it to bring forth good grapes , But it brought forth wild grapes .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	3	“ And now , O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah , ( C ) Judge , please , between Me and My vineyard .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	4	What more could have been done to My vineyard That I have not done in ( D ) it ? Why then , when I expected it to bring forth good grapes , Did it bring forth wild grapes ?
NKJV	Isaiah	5	6	I will lay it ( F ) waste ; It shall not be pruned or [ c ] dug , But there shall come up briers and ( G ) thorns . I will also command the clouds That they rain no rain on it. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	5	7	For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel , And the men of Judah are His pleasant plant . He looked for justice , but behold , oppression ; For righteousness , but behold , [ d ] a cry for help . Impending Judgment on Excesses
NKJV	Isaiah	5	8	Woe to those who [ e ] join ( H ) house to house ; They add field to field , Till there is no place Where they may dwell alone in the midst of the land !
NKJV	Isaiah	5	9	( I ) In my hearing the Lord of hosts said , “ Truly , many houses shall be desolate , Great and beautiful ones , without inhabitant .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	10	For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one ( J ) bath , [ f ] And a homer of seed shall yield one [ g ] ephah. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	5	11	( K ) Woe to those who rise early in the morning , That they may [ h ] follow intoxicating drink ; Who continue until night , till wine inflames them !
NKJV	Isaiah	5	12	( L ) The harp and the strings , The tambourine and flute , And wine are in their feasts ; But ( M ) they do not regard the work of the Lord , Nor consider the operation of His hands .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	13	( N ) Therefore my people have gone into captivity , Because they have no ( O ) knowledge ; Their honorable men are famished , And their multitude dried up with thirst .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	14	Therefore Sheol has enlarged itself And opened its mouth beyond measure ; Their glory and their multitude and their pomp , And he who is jubilant , shall descend into it .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	15	People shall be brought down , ( P ) Each man shall be humbled , And the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	16	But the Lord of hosts shall be ( Q ) exalted in judgment , And God who is holy shall be hallowed in righteousness .

NKJV	Isaiah	5	22	Woe to men mighty at drinking wine , Woe to men valiant for mixing intoxicating drink ,
NKJV	Isaiah	5	23	Who ( U ) justify the wicked for a bribe , And take away justice from the righteous man !
NKJV	Isaiah	5	24	Therefore , ( V ) as the [ l ] fire devours the stubble , And the flame consumes the chaff , So ( W ) their root will be as rottenness , And their blossom will ascend like dust ; Because they have rejected the law of the Lord of hosts , And despised the word of the Holy One of Israel .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	25	( X ) Therefore the anger of the Lord is aroused against His people ; He has stretched out His hand against them And stricken them , And ( Y ) the hills trembled . Their carcasses were as refuse in the midst of the streets . ( Z ) For all this His anger is not turned away , But His hand is stretched out still .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	26	( AA ) He will lift up a banner to the nations from afar , And will ( AB ) whistle to them from ( AC ) the end of the earth ; Surely ( AD ) they shall come with speed , swiftly .
NKJV	Isaiah	5	27	No one will be weary or stumble among them , No one will slumber or sleep ; Nor ( AE ) will the belt on their loins be loosed , Nor the strap of their sandals be broken ;
NKJV	Isaiah	5	28	( AF ) Whose arrows are sharp , And all their bows bent ; Their horses ’ hooves will [ m ] seem like flint , And their wheels like a whirlwind .

NKJV	Isaiah	6	6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me , having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from ( H ) the altar .
NKJV	Isaiah	6	2	Above it stood seraphim ; each one had six wings : with two he covered his face , ( D ) with two he covered his feet , and with two he flew .
NKJV	Isaiah	6	3	And one cried to another and said :
NKJV	Isaiah	6	4	And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out , and the house was filled with smoke .
NKJV	Isaiah	6	5	So I said : “ Woe is me , for I am [ a ] undone ! Because I am a man of ( G ) unclean lips , And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips ; For my eyes have seen the King , The Lord of hosts. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	6	7	And he ( I ) touched my mouth with it , and said : “ Behold , this has touched your lips ; Your iniquity is taken away , And your sin [ b ] purged. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	6	8	Also I heard the voice of the Lord , saying : “ Whom shall I send , And who will go for ( J ) Us ? ” Then I said , “ Here am I ! Send me. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	6	9	And He said , “ Go , and ( K ) tell this people : ‘ Keep on hearing , but do not understand ; Keep on seeing , but do not perceive. ’
NKJV	Isaiah	6	10	“ Make ( L ) the heart of this people dull , And their ears heavy , And shut their eyes ; ( M ) Lest they see with their eyes , And hear with their ears , And understand with their heart , And return and be healed. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	6	11	Then I said , “ Lord , how long ? ” And He answered : ( N ) “ Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant , The houses are without a man , The land is utterly desolate ,
NKJV	Isaiah	6	12	( O ) The Lord has removed men far away , And the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land .

NKJV	Isaiah	7	7	thus says the Lord God : ( E ) “ It shall not stand , Nor shall it come to pass .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	2	And it was told to the house of David , saying , “ Syria ’ s forces are [ b ] deployed in Ephraim. ” So his heart and the heart of his people were moved as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	3	Then the Lord said to Isaiah , “ Go out now to meet Ahaz , you and [ c ] Shear-Jashub your son , at the end of the aqueduct from the upper pool , on the highway to the Fuller ’ s Field ,
NKJV	Isaiah	7	4	and say to him : [ d ] ‘ Take heed , and [ e ] be ( D ) quiet ; do not fear or be fainthearted for these two stubs of smoking firebrands , for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria , and the son of Remaliah .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	5	Because Syria , Ephraim , and the son of Remaliah have plotted evil against you , saying ,
NKJV	Isaiah	7	6	“ Let us go up against Judah and [ f ] trouble it , and let us make a gap in its wall for ourselves , and set a king over them , the son of Tabel ” —
NKJV	Isaiah	7	8	( F ) For the head of Syria is Damascus , And the head of Damascus is Rezin . Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be [ g ] broken , So that it will not be a people .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	9	The head of Ephraim is Samaria , And the head of Samaria is Remaliah ’ s son . ( G ) If you will not believe , Surely you shall not be established. ” ’ ” The Immanuel Prophecy
NKJV	Isaiah	7	10	Moreover the Lord spoke again to Ahaz , saying ,
NKJV	Isaiah	7	11	( H ) “ Ask a sign for yourself from the Lord your God ; [ h ] ask it either in the depth or in the height above. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	7	12	But Ahaz said , “ I will not ask , nor will I test the Lord ! ”
NKJV	Isaiah	7	13	Then he said , “ Hear now , O house of David ! Is it a small thing for you to weary men , but will you weary my God also ?
NKJV	Isaiah	7	14	Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign : ( I ) Behold , the virgin shall conceive and bear ( J ) a Son , and shall call His name ( K ) Immanuel . [ i ]
NKJV	Isaiah	7	15	Curds and honey He shall eat , that He may know to refuse the evil and choose the good .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	16	( L ) For before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good , the land that you dread will be forsaken by ( M ) both her kings .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	17	( N ) The Lord will bring the king of Assyria upon you and your people and your father ’ s house—days that have not come since the day that ( O ) Ephraim departed from Judah. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	7	18	And it shall come to pass in that day That the Lord ( P ) will whistle for the fly That is in the farthest part of the rivers of Egypt , And for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	19	They will come , and all of them will rest In the desolate valleys and in ( Q ) the clefts of the rocks , And on all thorns and in all pastures .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	20	In the same day the Lord will shave with a ( R ) hired ( S ) razor , With those from beyond [ j ] the River , with the king of Assyria , The head and the hair of the legs , And will also remove the beard .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	21	It shall be in that day That a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep ;
NKJV	Isaiah	7	22	So it shall be , from the abundance of milk they give , That he will eat curds ; For curds and honey everyone will eat who is left in the land .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	23	It shall happen in that day , That wherever there could be a thousand vines Worth a thousand shekels of silver , ( T ) It will be for briers and thorns .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	24	With arrows and bows men will come there , Because all the land will become briers and thorns .
NKJV	Isaiah	7	25	And to any hill which could be dug with the hoe , You will not go there for fear of briers and thorns ; But it will become a range for oxen And a place for sheep to roam .

NKJV	Isaiah	8	2	And I will take for Myself faithful witnesses to record , ( B ) Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	8	3	Then I went to the prophetess , and she conceived and bore a son . Then the Lord said to me , “ Call his name Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz ;
NKJV	Isaiah	8	4	( C ) for before the child [ b ] shall have knowledge to cry ‘ My father ’ and ‘ My mother , ’ ( D ) the riches of Damascus and the [ c ] spoil of Samaria will be taken away before the king of Assyria. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	8	5	The Lord also spoke to me again , saying :
NKJV	Isaiah	8	6	“ Inasmuch as these people refused The waters of ( E ) Shiloah that flow softly , And rejoice ( F ) in Rezin and in Remaliah ’ s son ;
NKJV	Isaiah	8	7	Now therefore , behold , the Lord brings up over them The waters of [ d ] the River , strong and mighty— The king of Assyria and all his glory ; He will [ e ] go up over all his channels And go over all his banks .
NKJV	Isaiah	8	9	“ Be ( I ) shattered , O you peoples , and be broken in pieces ! Give ear , all you from far countries . Gird yourselves , but be broken in pieces ; Gird yourselves , but be broken in pieces .
NKJV	Isaiah	8	10	( J ) Take counsel together , but it will come to nothing ; Speak the word , ( K ) but it will not stand , ( L ) For [ h ] God is with us. ” Fear God , Heed His Word
NKJV	Isaiah	8	11	For the Lord spoke thus to me with [ i ] a strong hand , and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying :
NKJV	Isaiah	8	12	“ Do not say , ‘ A conspiracy , ’ Concerning all that this people call a conspiracy , Nor be afraid of their [ j ] threats , nor be [ k ] troubled .
NKJV	Isaiah	8	13	The Lord of hosts , Him you shall hallow ; Let Him be your fear , And let Him be your dread .
NKJV	Isaiah	8	14	( M ) He will be as a [ l ] sanctuary , But ( N ) a stone of stumbling and a rock of [ m ] offense To both the houses of Israel , As a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
NKJV	Isaiah	8	15	And many among them shall ( O ) stumble ; They shall fall and be broken , Be snared and [ n ] taken. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	8	16	Bind up the testimony , Seal the law among my disciples .
NKJV	Isaiah	8	17	And I will wait on the Lord , Who ( P ) hides His face from the house of Jacob ; And I ( Q ) will hope in Him .
NKJV	Isaiah	8	18	( R ) Here am I and the children whom the Lord has given me ! We ( S ) are for signs and wonders in Israel From the Lord of hosts , Who dwells in Mount Zion .

NKJV	Isaiah	10	13	( Q ) For he says : “ By the strength of my hand I have done it , And by my wisdom , for I am prudent ; Also I have removed the boundaries of the people , And have robbed their treasuries ; So I have put down the inhabitants like a [ c ] valiant man .

NKJV	Isaiah	25	6	And in ( G ) this mountain ( H ) The Lord of hosts will make for ( I ) all people A feast of [ c ] choice pieces , A feast of [ d ] wines on the lees , Of fat things full of marrow , Of well-refined wines on the lees .

NKJV	Isaiah	25	10	For on this mountain the hand of the Lord will rest , And ( O ) Moab shall be trampled down under Him , As straw is trampled down for the refuse heap .

NKJV	Isaiah	26	3	You will keep him in perfect ( D ) peace , Whose mind is stayed on You , Because he trusts in You .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	4	Trust in the Lord forever , ( E ) For in Yah , the Lord , is [ b ] everlasting strength .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	5	For He brings [ c ] down those who dwell on high , ( F ) The lofty city ; He lays it low , He lays it low to the ground , He brings it down to the dust .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	6	The foot shall [ d ] tread it down— The feet of the poor And the steps of the needy. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	26	7	The way of the just is uprightness ; ( G ) O Most Upright , You [ e ] weigh the path of the just .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	8	Yes , ( H ) in the way of Your judgments , O Lord , we have ( I ) waited for You ; The desire of our soul is for Your name And for the remembrance of You .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	9	( J ) With my soul I have desired You in the night , Yes , by my spirit within me I will seek You early ; For when Your judgments are in the earth , The inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	10	( K ) Let grace be shown to the wicked , Yet he will not learn righteousness ; In ( L ) the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly , And will not behold the majesty of the Lord .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	11	Lord , when Your hand is lifted up , ( M ) they will not see . But they will see and be ashamed For [ f ] their envy of people ; Yes , the fire of Your enemies shall devour them .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	12	Lord , You will establish peace for us , For You have also done all our works [ g ] in us .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	13	O Lord our God , ( N ) masters besides You Have had dominion over us ; But by You only we make mention of Your name .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	14	They are dead , they will not live ; They are deceased , they will not rise . Therefore You have punished and destroyed them , And made all their memory to ( O ) perish .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	15	You have increased the nation , O Lord , You have ( P ) increased the nation ; You are glorified ; You have expanded all the [ h ] borders of the land .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	16	Lord , ( Q ) in trouble they have visited You , They poured out a prayer when Your chastening was upon them .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	17	As ( R ) a woman with child Is in pain and cries out in her [ i ] pangs , When she draws near the time of her delivery , So have we been in Your sight , O Lord .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	18	We have been with child , we have been in pain ; We have , as it were , [ j ] brought forth wind ; We have not accomplished any deliverance in the earth , Nor have ( S ) the inhabitants of the world fallen .
NKJV	Isaiah	26	19	( T ) Your dead shall live ; Together with [ k ] my dead body they shall arise . ( U ) Awake and sing , you who dwell in dust ; For your dew is like the dew of herbs , And the earth shall cast out the dead . Take Refuge from the Coming Judgment

NKJV	Isaiah	27	2	In that day ( C ) sing to her , ( D ) “ A vineyard of [ a ] red wine !
NKJV	Isaiah	27	3	( E ) I , the Lord , keep it , I water it every moment ; Lest any hurt it , I keep it night and day .
NKJV	Isaiah	27	4	Fury is not in Me . Who would set ( F ) briers and thorns Against Me in battle ? I would go through them , I would burn them together .
NKJV	Isaiah	27	5	Or let him take hold ( G ) of My strength , That he may ( H ) make peace with Me ; And he shall make peace with Me. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	27	6	Those who come He shall cause ( I ) to take root in Jacob ; Israel shall blossom and bud , And fill the face of the world with fruit .
NKJV	Isaiah	27	7	( J ) Has He struck [ b ] Israel as He struck those who struck him ? Or has He been slain according to the slaughter of those who were slain by Him ?
NKJV	Isaiah	27	8	( K ) In measure , by sending it away , You contended with it . ( L ) He removes it by His rough wind In the day of the east wind .
NKJV	Isaiah	27	9	Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be covered ; And this is all the fruit of taking away his sin : When he makes all the stones of the altar Like chalkstones that are beaten to dust , [ c ] Wooden images and incense altars shall not stand .
NKJV	Isaiah	27	10	Yet the fortified city will be ( M ) desolate , The habitation forsaken and left like a wilderness ; There the calf will feed , and there it will lie down And consume its branches .
NKJV	Isaiah	27	11	When its boughs are withered , they will be broken off ; The women come and set them on fire . For ( N ) it is a people of no understanding ; Therefore He who made them will ( O ) not have mercy on them , And ( P ) He who formed them will show them no favor .
NKJV	Isaiah	27	12	And it shall come to pass in that day That the Lord will thresh , From the channel of [ d ] the River to the Brook of Egypt ; And you will be ( Q ) gathered one by one , O you children of Israel .
NKJV	Isaiah	27	13	( R ) So it shall be in that day : ( S ) The great trumpet will be blown ; They will come , who are about to perish in the land of Assyria , And they who are outcasts in the land of ( T ) Egypt , And shall ( U ) worship the Lord in the holy mount at Jerusalem .

NKJV	Isaiah	28	28	Bread flour must be ground ; Therefore he does not thresh it forever , Break it with his cartwheel , Or crush it with his horsemen .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	2	Behold , the Lord has a mighty and strong one , ( A ) Like a tempest of hail and a destroying storm , Like a flood of mighty waters overflowing , Who will bring them down to the earth with His hand .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	3	The crown of pride , the drunkards of Ephraim , Will be trampled underfoot ;
NKJV	Isaiah	28	4	And the glorious beauty is a fading flower Which is at the head of the [ b ] verdant valley , Like the first fruit before the summer , Which an observer sees ; He eats it up while it is still in his hand .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	5	In that day the Lord of hosts will be For a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty To the remnant of His people ,
NKJV	Isaiah	28	6	For a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment , And for strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	7	But they also ( B ) have erred through wine , And through intoxicating drink are out of the way ; ( C ) The priest and the prophet have erred through intoxicating drink , They are swallowed up by wine , They are out of the way through intoxicating drink ; They err in vision , they stumble in judgment .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	8	For all tables are full of vomit and filth ; No place is clean .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	9	“ Whom ( D ) will he teach knowledge ? And whom will he make to understand the message ? Those just weaned from milk ? Those just drawn from the breasts ?
NKJV	Isaiah	28	10	( E ) For precept must be upon precept , precept upon precept , Line upon line , line upon line , Here a little , there a little. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	28	11	For with ( F ) stammering lips and another tongue He will speak to this people ,
NKJV	Isaiah	28	12	To whom He said , “ This is the ( G ) rest with which You may cause the weary to rest , ” And , “ This is the refreshing ” ; Yet they would not hear .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	13	But the word of the Lord was to them , “ Precept upon precept , precept upon precept , Line upon line , line upon line , Here a little , there a little , ” That they might go and fall backward , and be broken And snared and caught .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	14	Therefore hear the word of the Lord , you scornful men , Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem ,
NKJV	Isaiah	28	15	Because you have said , “ We have made a covenant with death , And with Sheol we are in agreement . When the overflowing scourge passes through , It will not come to us , ( H ) For we have made lies our refuge , And under falsehood we have hidden ourselves. ” A Cornerstone in Zion
NKJV	Isaiah	28	16	Therefore thus says the Lord God : “ Behold , I lay in Zion ( I ) a stone for a foundation , A tried stone , a precious cornerstone , a sure foundation ; Whoever believes will not act hastily .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	17	Also I will make justice the measuring line , And righteousness the plummet ; The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies , And the waters will overflow the hiding place .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	18	Your covenant with death will be annulled , And your agreement with Sheol will not stand ; When the overflowing scourge passes through , Then you will be trampled down by it .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	19	As often as it goes out it will take you ; For morning by morning it will pass over , And by day and by night ; It will be a terror just to understand the report. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	28	20	For the bed is too short to stretch out on , And the covering so narrow that one can not wrap himself in it .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	21	For the Lord will rise up as at Mount ( J ) Perazim , He will be angry as in the Valley of ( K ) Gibeon— That He may do His work , ( L ) His awesome work , And bring to pass His act , His [ c ] unusual act .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	22	Now therefore , do not be mockers , Lest your bonds be made strong ; For I have heard from the Lord God of hosts , ( M ) A [ d ] destruction determined even upon the whole earth . Listen to the Teaching of God
NKJV	Isaiah	28	23	Give ear and hear my voice , Listen and hear my speech .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	24	Does the plowman keep plowing all day to sow ? Does he keep turning his soil and breaking the clods ?
NKJV	Isaiah	28	25	When he has leveled its surface , Does he not sow the black cummin And scatter the cummin , Plant the wheat in rows , The barley in the appointed place , And the [ e ] spelt in its place ?
NKJV	Isaiah	28	26	For He instructs him in right judgment , His God teaches him .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	27	For the black cummin is not threshed with a threshing sledge , Nor is a cartwheel rolled over the cummin ; But the black cummin is beaten out with a stick , And the cummin with a rod .
NKJV	Isaiah	28	29	This also comes from the Lord of hosts , ( N ) Who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in [ f ] guidance .

NKJV	Isaiah	29	29	“ Woe ( A ) to [ a ] Ariel , to Ariel , the city ( B ) where David dwelt ! Add year to year ; Let feasts come around .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	2	Yet I will distress Ariel ; There shall be heaviness and sorrow , And it shall be to Me as Ariel .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	3	I will encamp against you all around , I will lay siege against you with a mound , And I will raise siegeworks against you .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	4	You shall be brought down , You shall speak out of the ground ; Your speech shall be low , out of the dust ; Your voice shall be like a medium ’ s , ( C ) out of the ground ; And your speech shall whisper out of the dust .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	5	“ Moreover the multitude of your ( D ) foes Shall be like fine dust , And the multitude of the terrible ones Like ( E ) chaff that passes away ; Yes , it shall be ( F ) in an instant , suddenly .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	6	( G ) You will be punished by the Lord of hosts With thunder and ( H ) earthquake and great noise , With storm and tempest And the flame of devouring fire .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	7	( I ) The multitude of all the nations who fight against [ b ] Ariel , Even all who fight against her and her fortress , And distress her , Shall be ( J ) as a dream of a night vision .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	8	( K ) It shall even be as when a hungry man dreams , And look—he eats ; But he awakes , and his soul is still empty ; Or as when a thirsty man dreams , And look—he drinks ; But he awakes , and indeed he is faint , And his soul still craves : So the multitude of all the nations shall be , Who fight against Mount Zion. ” The Blindness of Disobedience
NKJV	Isaiah	29	9	Pause and wonder ! Blind yourselves and be blind ! ( L ) They are drunk , ( M ) but not with wine ; They stagger , but not with intoxicating drink .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	10	For ( N ) the Lord has poured out on you The spirit of deep sleep , And has ( O ) closed your eyes , namely , the prophets ; And He has covered your heads , namely , ( P ) the seers .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	11	The whole vision has become to you like the words of a [ c ] book ( Q ) that is sealed , which men deliver to one who is literate , saying , “ Read this , please. ” ( R ) And he says , “ I can not , for it is sealed. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	29	12	Then the book is delivered to one who [ d ] is illiterate , saying , “ Read this , please. ” And he says , “ I am not literate. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	29	13	Therefore the Lord said : ( S ) “ Inasmuch as these people draw near with their mouths And honor Me ( T ) with their lips , But have removed their hearts far from Me , And their fear toward Me is taught by the commandment of men ,
NKJV	Isaiah	29	14	( U ) Therefore , behold , I will again do a marvelous work Among this people , A marvelous work and a wonder ; ( V ) For the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , And the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidden. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	29	15	( W ) Woe to those who seek deep to hide their counsel far from the Lord , And their works are in the dark ; ( X ) They say , “ Who sees us ? ” and , “ Who knows us ? ”
NKJV	Isaiah	29	16	Surely you have things turned around ! Shall the potter be esteemed as the clay ; For shall the ( Y ) thing made say of him who made it , “ He did not make me ” ? Or shall the thing formed say of him who formed it , “ He has no understanding ” ? Future Recovery of Wisdom
NKJV	Isaiah	29	17	Is it not yet a very little while Till ( Z ) Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , And the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest ?
NKJV	Isaiah	29	18	( AA ) In that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book , And the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	19	( AB ) The humble also shall increase their joy in the Lord , And ( AC ) the poor among men shall rejoice In the Holy One of Israel .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	20	For the [ e ] terrible one is brought to nothing , ( AD ) The scornful one is consumed , And all who ( AE ) watch for iniquity are cut off—
NKJV	Isaiah	29	21	Who make a man an offender by a word , And ( AF ) lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate , And turn aside the just ( AG ) by empty words .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	22	Therefore thus says the Lord , ( AH ) who redeemed Abraham , concerning the house of Jacob : “ Jacob shall not now be ( AI ) ashamed , Nor shall his face now grow pale ;
NKJV	Isaiah	29	23	But when he sees his children , ( AJ ) The work of My hands , in his midst , They will hallow My name , And hallow the Holy One of Jacob , And fear the God of Israel .
NKJV	Isaiah	29	24	These also ( AK ) who erred in spirit will come to understanding , And those who complained will learn doctrine. ” Footnotes - Isaiah 29:1 Jerusalem , lit .

NKJV	Isaiah	30	30	( AO ) The Lord will cause His glorious voice to be heard , And show the descent of His arm , With the indignation of His anger And the flame of a devouring fire , With scattering , tempest , ( AP ) and hailstones .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	2	( C ) Who walk to go down to Egypt , And ( D ) have not asked My advice , To strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh , And to trust in the shadow of Egypt !
NKJV	Isaiah	30	3	( E ) Therefore the strength of Pharaoh Shall be your shame , And trust in the shadow of Egypt Shall be your humiliation .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	4	For his princes were at ( F ) Zoan , And his ambassadors came to Hanes .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	5	( G ) They were all ashamed of a people who could not benefit them , Or be help or benefit , But a shame and also a reproach. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	30	6	( H ) The [ b ] burden against the beasts of the South . Through a land of trouble and anguish , From which came the lioness and lion , ( I ) The viper and fiery flying serpent , They will carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys , And their treasures on the humps of camels , To a people who shall not profit ;
NKJV	Isaiah	30	7	( J ) For the Egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose . Therefore I have called her [ c ] Rahab-Hem-Shebeth . A Rebellious People
NKJV	Isaiah	30	8	Now go , ( K ) write it before them on a tablet , And note it on a scroll , That it may be for time to come , Forever and ever :
NKJV	Isaiah	30	9	That ( L ) this is a rebellious people , Lying children , Children who will not hear the law of the Lord ;
NKJV	Isaiah	30	10	( M ) Who say to the seers , “ Do not see , ” And to the prophets , “ Do not prophesy to us right things ; ( N ) Speak to us smooth things , prophesy deceits .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	11	Get out of the way , Turn aside from the path , Cause the Holy One of Israel To cease from before us. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	30	12	Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel : “ Because you ( O ) despise this word , And trust in oppression and perversity , And rely on them ,
NKJV	Isaiah	30	13	Therefore this iniquity shall be to you ( P ) Like a breach ready to fall , A bulge in a high wall , Whose breaking ( Q ) comes suddenly , in an instant .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	14	And ( R ) He shall break it like the breaking of the potter ’ s vessel , Which is broken in pieces ; He shall not spare . So there shall not be found among its fragments [ d ] A shard to take fire from the hearth , Or to take water from the cistern. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	30	15	For thus says the Lord God , the Holy One of Israel : ( S ) “ In returning and rest you shall be saved ; In quietness and confidence shall be your strength. ” ( T ) But you would not ,
NKJV	Isaiah	30	16	And you said , “ No , for we will flee on horses ” — Therefore you shall flee ! And , “ We will ride on swift horses ” — Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift !
NKJV	Isaiah	30	17	( U ) One thousand shall flee at the threat of one , At the threat of five you shall flee , Till you are left as a [ e ] pole on top of a mountain And as a banner on a hill . God Will Be Gracious
NKJV	Isaiah	30	18	Therefore the Lord will wait , that He may be ( V ) gracious to you ; And therefore He will be exalted , that He may have mercy on you . For the Lord is a God of justice ; ( W ) Blessed are all those who ( X ) wait for Him .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	19	For the people ( Y ) shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem ; You shall ( Z ) weep no more . He will be very gracious to you at the sound of your cry ; When He hears it , He will ( AA ) answer you .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	20	And though the Lord gives you ( AB ) The bread of adversity and the water of [ f ] affliction , Yet ( AC ) your teachers will not be moved into a corner anymore , But your eyes shall see your teachers .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	21	Your ears shall hear a word behind you , saying , “ This is the way , walk in it , ” Whenever you ( AD ) turn to the right hand Or whenever you turn to the left .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	22	( AE ) You will also defile the covering of your images of silver , And the ornament of your molded images of gold . You will throw them away as an unclean thing ; ( AF ) You will say to them , “ Get away ! ”
NKJV	Isaiah	30	23	( AG ) Then He will give the rain for your seed With which you sow the ground , And bread of the increase of the earth ; It will be [ g ] fat and plentiful . In that day your cattle will feed In large pastures .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	24	Likewise the oxen and the young donkeys that work the ground Will eat cured fodder , Which has been winnowed with the shovel and fan .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	25	There will be ( AH ) on every high mountain And on every high hill Rivers and streams of waters , In the day of the ( AI ) great slaughter , When the towers fall .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	26	Moreover ( AJ ) the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun , And the light of the sun will be sevenfold , As the light of seven days , In the day that the Lord binds up the bruise of His people And heals the stroke of their wound . Judgment on Assyria
NKJV	Isaiah	30	27	Behold , the name of the Lord comes from afar , Burning with His anger , And His burden is heavy ; His lips are full of indignation , And His tongue like a devouring fire .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	28	( AK ) His breath is like an overflowing stream , ( AL ) Which reaches up to the neck , To sift the nations with the sieve of futility ; And there shall be ( AM ) a bridle in the jaws of the people , Causing them to err .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	29	You shall have a song As in the night when a holy festival is kept , And gladness of heart as when one goes with a flute , To come into ( AN ) the mountain of the Lord , To [ h ] the Mighty One of Israel .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	31	For ( AQ ) through the voice of the Lord Assyria will be [ i ] beaten down , As He strikes with the ( AR ) rod .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	32	And in every place where the staff of punishment passes , Which the Lord lays on him , It will be with tambourines and harps ; And in battles of ( AS ) brandishing He will fight with it .
NKJV	Isaiah	30	33	( AT ) For Tophet was established of old , Yes , for the king it is prepared . He has made it deep and large ; Its pyre is fire with much wood ; The breath of the Lord , like a stream of brimstone , Kindles it .

NKJV	Isaiah	31	31	Woe to those ( A ) who go down to Egypt for help , And ( B ) rely on horses , Who trust in chariots because they are many , And in horsemen because they are very strong , But who do not look to the Holy One of Israel , ( C ) Nor seek the Lord !
NKJV	Isaiah	31	2	Yet He also is wise and will bring disaster , And ( D ) will not [ a ] call back His words , But will arise against the house of evildoers , And against the help of those who work iniquity .
NKJV	Isaiah	31	3	Now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; And their horses are flesh , and not spirit . When the Lord stretches out His hand , Both he who helps will fall , And he who is helped will fall down ; They all will perish ( E ) together . God Will Deliver Jerusalem
NKJV	Isaiah	31	4	For thus the Lord has spoken to me : ( F ) “ As a lion roars , And a young lion over his prey ( When a multitude of shepherds is summoned against him , He will not be afraid of their voice Nor be disturbed by their noise ) , So the Lord of hosts will come down To fight for Mount Zion and for its hill .
NKJV	Isaiah	31	5	( G ) Like birds flying about , So will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem . Defending , He will also deliver it ; Passing over , He will preserve it. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	31	6	Return to Him against whom the children of Israel have ( H ) deeply revolted .
NKJV	Isaiah	31	7	For in that day every man shall ( I ) throw away his idols of silver and his idols of gold— ( J ) sin , which your own hands have made for yourselves .

NKJV	Isaiah	32	2	A man will be as a hiding place from the wind , And ( B ) a [ a ] cover from the tempest , As rivers of water in a dry place , As the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	3	( C ) The eyes of those who see will not be dim , And the ears of those who hear will listen .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	4	Also the heart of the [ b ] rash will ( D ) understand knowledge , And the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	5	The foolish person will no longer be called [ c ] generous , Nor the miser said to be bountiful ;
NKJV	Isaiah	32	6	For the foolish person will speak foolishness , And his heart will work ( E ) iniquity : To practice ungodliness , To utter error against the Lord , To keep the hungry unsatisfied , And he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	7	Also the schemes of the schemer are evil ; He devises wicked plans To destroy the poor with ( F ) lying words , Even when the needy speaks justice .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	8	But a [ d ] generous man devises generous things , And by generosity he shall stand . Consequences of Complacency
NKJV	Isaiah	32	9	Rise up , you women ( G ) who are at ease , Hear my voice ; You complacent daughters , Give ear to my speech .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	10	In a year and some days You will be troubled , you complacent women ; For the vintage will fail , The gathering will not come .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	11	Tremble , you women who are at ease ; Be troubled , you complacent ones ; Strip yourselves , make yourselves bare , And gird sackcloth on your waists .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	12	People shall mourn upon their breasts For the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	13	( H ) On the land of my people will come up thorns and briers , Yes , on all the happy homes in ( I ) the joyous city ;
NKJV	Isaiah	32	14	( J ) Because the palaces will be forsaken , The bustling city will be deserted . The forts and towers will become lairs forever , A joy of wild donkeys , a pasture of flocks—
NKJV	Isaiah	32	15	Until ( K ) the Spirit is poured upon us from on high , And ( L ) the wilderness becomes a fruitful field , And the fruitful field is counted as a forest . The Peace of God ’ s Reign
NKJV	Isaiah	32	16	Then justice will dwell in the wilderness , And righteousness remain in the fruitful field .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	17	( M ) The work of righteousness will be peace , And the effect of righteousness , quietness and assurance forever .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	18	My people will dwell in a peaceful habitation , In secure dwellings , and in quiet ( N ) resting places ,
NKJV	Isaiah	32	19	( O ) Though hail comes down ( P ) on the forest , And the city is brought low in humiliation .
NKJV	Isaiah	32	20	Blessed are you who sow beside all waters , Who send out freely the feet of ( Q ) the ox and the donkey . Footnotes - Isaiah 32:2 shelter - Isaiah 32:4 hasty - Isaiah 32:5 noble - Isaiah 32:8 noble Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Isaiah	33	33	Woe to you ( A ) who plunder , though you have not been plundered ; And you who deal treacherously , though they have not dealt treacherously with you ! ( B ) When you cease plundering , You will be ( C ) plundered ; When you make an end of dealing treacherously , They will deal treacherously with you .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	2	O Lord , be gracious to us ; ( D ) We have waited for You . Be [ a ] their arm every morning , Our salvation also in the time of trouble .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	3	At the noise of the tumult the people ( E ) shall flee ; When You lift Yourself up , the nations shall be scattered ;
NKJV	Isaiah	33	4	And Your plunder shall be gathered Like the gathering of the caterpillar ; As the running to and fro of locusts , He shall run upon them .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	5	( F ) The Lord is exalted , for He dwells on high ; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	6	Wisdom and knowledge will be the stability of your times , And the strength of salvation ; The fear of the Lord is His treasure .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	7	Surely their valiant ones shall cry outside , ( G ) The ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	8	( H ) The highways lie waste , The traveling man ceases . ( I ) He has broken the covenant , [ b ] He has despised the [ c ] cities , He regards no man .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	9	( J ) The earth mourns and languishes , Lebanon is shamed and shriveled ; Sharon is like a wilderness , And Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits . Impending Judgment on Zion
NKJV	Isaiah	33	10	“ Now ( K ) I will rise , ” says the Lord ; “ Now I will be exalted , Now I will lift Myself up .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	11	( L ) You shall conceive chaff , You shall bring forth stubble ; Your breath , as fire , shall devour you .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	12	And the people shall be like the burnings of lime ; ( M ) Like thorns cut up they shall be burned in the fire .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	13	Hear , ( N ) you who are afar off , what I have done ; And you who are near , acknowledge My might. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	33	14	The sinners in Zion are afraid ; Fearfulness has seized the hypocrites : “ Who among us shall dwell with the devouring ( O ) fire ? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings ? ”
NKJV	Isaiah	33	15	He who ( P ) walks righteously and speaks uprightly , He who despises the gain of oppressions , Who gestures with his hands , refusing bribes , Who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed , And ( Q ) shuts his eyes from seeing evil :
NKJV	Isaiah	33	16	He will dwell on [ d ] high ; His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks ; Bread will be given him , His water will be sure . The Land of the Majestic King
NKJV	Isaiah	33	17	Your eyes will see the King in His ( R ) beauty ; They will see the land that is very far off .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	18	Your heart will meditate on terror : ( S ) “ Where is the scribe ? Where is he who weighs ? Where is he who counts the towers ? ”
NKJV	Isaiah	33	19	( T ) You will not see a fierce people , ( U ) A people of obscure speech , beyond perception , Of a [ e ] stammering tongue that you can not understand .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	20	( V ) Look upon Zion , the city of our appointed feasts ; Your eyes will see ( W ) Jerusalem , a quiet home , A tabernacle that will not be taken down ; ( X ) Not one of ( Y ) its stakes will ever be removed , Nor will any of its cords be broken .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	21	But there the majestic Lord will be for us A place of broad rivers and streams , In which no [ f ] galley with oars will sail , Nor majestic ships pass by
NKJV	Isaiah	33	22	( For the Lord is our ( Z ) Judge , The Lord is our ( AA ) Lawgiver , ( AB ) The Lord is our King ; He will save us ) ;
NKJV	Isaiah	33	23	Your tackle is loosed , They could not strengthen their mast , They could not spread the sail . Then the prey of great plunder is divided ; The lame take the prey .
NKJV	Isaiah	33	24	And the inhabitant will not say , “ I am sick ” ; ( AC ) The people who dwell in it will be forgiven their iniquity .

NKJV	Isaiah	34	34	Come ( A ) near , you nations , to hear ; And heed , you people ! ( B ) Let the earth hear , and all that is in it , The world and all things that come forth from it .
NKJV	Isaiah	34	2	For the indignation of the Lord is against all nations , And His fury against all their armies ; He has utterly destroyed them , He has given them over to the ( C ) slaughter .

NKJV	Isaiah	34	12	They shall call its nobles to the kingdom , But none shall be there , and all its princes shall be nothing .
NKJV	Isaiah	34	13	And ( R ) thorns shall come up in its palaces , Nettles and brambles in its fortresses ; ( S ) It shall be a habitation of jackals , A courtyard for ostriches .
NKJV	Isaiah	34	14	The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the [ e ] jackals , And the wild goat shall bleat to its companion ; Also [ f ] the night creature shall rest there , And find for herself a place of rest .
NKJV	Isaiah	34	15	There the arrow snake shall make her nest and lay eggs And hatch , and gather them under her shadow ; There also shall the hawks be gathered , Every one with her mate .
NKJV	Isaiah	34	16	“ Search from ( T ) the book of the Lord , and read : Not one of these shall fail ; Not one shall lack her mate . For My mouth has commanded it , and His Spirit has gathered them .

NKJV	Isaiah	36	36	Now ( B ) it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them .
NKJV	Isaiah	36	2	Then the king of Assyria sent the [ a ] Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem . And he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool , on the highway to the Fuller ’ s Field .
NKJV	Isaiah	36	3	And ( C ) Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , ( D ) Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph , the recorder , came out to him .
NKJV	Isaiah	36	4	( E ) Then the Rabshakeh said to them , “ Say now to Hezekiah , ‘ Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria : “ What confidence is this in which you trust ?
NKJV	Isaiah	36	5	I say you speak of having plans and power for war ; but they are [ b ] mere words . Now in whom do you trust , that you rebel against me ?
NKJV	Isaiah	36	6	Look ! You are trusting in the ( F ) staff of this broken reed , Egypt , on which if a man leans , it will go into his hand and pierce it . So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who ( G ) trust in him .
NKJV	Isaiah	36	7	“ But if you say to me , ‘ We trust in the Lord our God , ’ is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away , and said to Judah and Jerusalem , ‘ You shall worship before this altar ’ ? ” ’
NKJV	Isaiah	36	8	Now therefore , I urge you , give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses—if you are able on your part to put riders on them !
NKJV	Isaiah	36	9	How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master ’ s servants , and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen ?
NKJV	Isaiah	36	10	Have I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it ? The Lord said to me , ‘ Go up against this land , and destroy it. ’ ”
NKJV	Isaiah	36	11	Then Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah said to the Rabshakeh , “ Please speak to your servants in Aramaic , for we understand it ; and do not speak to us in [ c ] Hebrew in the hearing of the people who are on the wall. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	36	12	But the Rabshakeh said , “ Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words , and not to the men who sit on the wall , who will eat and drink their own waste with you ? ”
NKJV	Isaiah	36	13	Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew , and said , “ Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
NKJV	Isaiah	36	14	Thus says the king : ‘ Do not let Hezekiah deceive you , for he will not be able to deliver you ;
NKJV	Isaiah	36	15	nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , “ The Lord will surely deliver us ; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. ” ’
NKJV	Isaiah	36	16	Do not listen to Hezekiah ; for thus says the king of Assyria : ‘ Make peace with me by a present and come out to me ; ( H ) and every one of you eat from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree , and every one of you drink the waters of his own cistern ;
NKJV	Isaiah	36	17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of grain and new wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
NKJV	Isaiah	36	18	Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , “ The Lord will deliver us. ” Has any one of the ( I ) gods of the nations delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria ?
NKJV	Isaiah	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? Indeed , have they delivered ( J ) Samaria from my hand ?
NKJV	Isaiah	36	20	Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their countries from my hand , that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem from my hand ? ’ ”
NKJV	Isaiah	36	21	But they [ d ] held their peace and answered him not a word ; for the king ’ s commandment was , “ Do not answer him. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	36	22	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of the Rabshakeh .

NKJV	Isaiah	37	37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went away , returned home , and remained at Nineveh .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	2	Then he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	3	And they said to him , “ Thus says Hezekiah : ‘ This day is a day of ( C ) trouble and rebuke and [ a ] blasphemy ; for the children have come to birth , but there is no strength to bring them forth .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	4	It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh , whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to ( D ) reproach the living God , and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard . Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left. ’ ”
NKJV	Isaiah	37	5	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	6	And Isaiah said to them , “ Thus you shall say to your master , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard , with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	7	Surely I will send a spirit upon him , and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. ” ’ ” Sennacherib ’ s Threat and Hezekiah ’ s Prayer ( E )
NKJV	Isaiah	37	8	Then the Rabshakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah , for he heard that he had departed from Lachish .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	9	And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , “ He has come out to make war with you. ” So when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
NKJV	Isaiah	37	10	“ Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying : ‘ Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , “ Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	37	11	Look ! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them ; and shall you be delivered ?
NKJV	Isaiah	37	12	Have the ( F ) gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed , Gozan and Haran and Rezeph , and the people of Eden who were in Telassar ?
NKJV	Isaiah	37	13	Where is the king of ( G ) Hamath , the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ? ’ ”
NKJV	Isaiah	37	14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it ; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	15	Then Hezekiah prayed to the Lord , saying :
NKJV	Isaiah	37	16	“ O Lord of hosts , God of Israel , the One who dwells between the cherubim , You are God , You ( H ) alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth . You have made heaven and earth .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	17	( I ) Incline Your ear , O Lord , and hear ; open Your eyes , O Lord , and see ; and ( J ) hear all the words of Sennacherib , which he has sent to reproach the living God .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	18	Truly , Lord , the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their ( K ) lands ,
NKJV	Isaiah	37	19	and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were ( L ) not gods , but the work of men ’ s hands—wood and stone . Therefore they destroyed them .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	20	Now therefore , O Lord our God , ( M ) save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may ( N ) know that You are the Lord , You alone. ” The Word of the Lord Concerning Sennacherib ( O )
NKJV	Isaiah	37	21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , “ Thus says the Lord God of Israel , ‘ Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria ,
NKJV	Isaiah	37	22	this is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him : “ The virgin , the daughter of Zion , Has despised you , laughed you to scorn ; The daughter of Jerusalem Has shaken her head behind your back !
NKJV	Isaiah	37	23	“ Whom have you reproached and blasphemed ? Against whom have you raised your voice , And lifted up your eyes on high ? Against the Holy One of Israel .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	24	By your servants you have reproached the Lord , And said , ‘ By the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains , To the limits of Lebanon ; I will cut down its tall cedars And its choice cypress trees ; I will enter its farthest height , To its fruitful forest .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	25	I have dug and drunk water , And with the soles of my feet I have dried up All the brooks of [ b ] defense. ’
NKJV	Isaiah	37	26	“ Did you not hear ( P ) long ago How I made it , From ancient times that I formed it ? Now I have brought it to pass , That you should be For crushing fortified cities into heaps of ruins .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	27	Therefore their inhabitants had little power ; They were dismayed and confounded ; They were as the grass of the field And the green herb , As the grass on the housetops And grain blighted before it is grown .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	28	“ But I know your dwelling place , Your going out and your coming in , And your rage against Me .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	29	Because your rage against Me and your tumult Have come up to My ears , Therefore ( Q ) I will put My hook in your nose And My bridle in your lips , And I will ( R ) turn you back By the way which you came. ” ’
NKJV	Isaiah	37	30	“ This shall be a sign to you : You shall eat this year such as grows of itself , And the second year what springs from the same ; Also in the third year sow and reap , Plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	31	And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah Shall again take root downward , And bear fruit upward .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	32	For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant , And those who escape from Mount Zion . The ( S ) zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	33	“ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria : ‘ He shall not come into this city , Nor shoot an arrow there , Nor come before it with shield , Nor build a siege mound against it .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	34	By the way that he came , By the same shall he return ; And he shall not come into this city , ’ Says the Lord .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	35	‘ For I will ( T ) defend this city , to save it For My own sake and for My servant ( U ) David ’ s sake. ’ ” Sennacherib ’ s Defeat and Death ( V )
NKJV	Isaiah	37	36	Then the ( W ) angel [ c ] of the Lord went out , and [ d ] killed in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand ; and when people arose early in the morning , there were the corpses—all dead .
NKJV	Isaiah	37	38	Now it came to pass , as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god , that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . Then ( X ) Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place .

NKJV	Isaiah	38	38	In ( B ) those days Hezekiah was sick and near death . And Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , went to him and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord : ( C ) ‘ Set your house in order , for you shall die and not live. ’ ”
NKJV	Isaiah	38	2	Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall , and prayed to the Lord ,
NKJV	Isaiah	38	3	and said , ( D ) “ Remember now , O Lord , I pray , how I have walked before You in truth and with a [ a ] loyal heart , and have done what is good in Your ( E ) sight. ” And Hezekiah wept bitterly .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	4	And the word of the Lord came to Isaiah , saying ,
NKJV	Isaiah	38	5	“ Go and tell Hezekiah , ‘ Thus says the Lord , the God of David your father : “ I have heard your prayer , I have seen your tears ; surely I will add to your days fifteen years .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	6	I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria , and ( F ) I will defend this city. ” ’
NKJV	Isaiah	38	7	And this is ( G ) the sign to you from the Lord , that the Lord will do this thing which He has spoken :
NKJV	Isaiah	38	8	Behold , I will bring the shadow on the sundial , which has gone down with the sun on the sundial of Ahaz , ten degrees backward. ” So the sun returned ten degrees on the dial by which it had gone down .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	9	This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness :
NKJV	Isaiah	38	10	I said , “ In the prime of my life I shall go to the gates of Sheol ; I am deprived of the remainder of my years. ”
NKJV	Isaiah	38	11	I said , “ I shall not see [ b ] Yah , The Lord ( H ) in the land of the living ; I shall observe man no more [ c ] among the inhabitants of [ d ] the world .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	12	( I ) My life span is gone , Taken from me like a shepherd ’ s tent ; I have cut off my life like a weaver . He cuts me off from the loom ; From day until night You make an end of me .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	13	I have considered until morning— Like a lion , So He breaks all my bones ; From day until night You make an end of me .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	14	Like a crane or a swallow , so I chattered ; ( J ) I mourned like a dove ; My eyes fail from looking upward . O [ e ] Lord , I am oppressed ; [ f ] Undertake for me !
NKJV	Isaiah	38	15	“ What shall I say ? [ g ] He has both spoken to me , And He Himself has done it . I shall walk carefully all my years ( K ) In the bitterness of my soul .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	16	O Lord , by these things men live ; And in all these things is the life of my spirit ; So You will restore me and make me live .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	17	Indeed it was for my own peace That I had great bitterness ; But You have lovingly delivered my soul from the pit of corruption , For You have cast all my sins behind Your back .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	18	For ( L ) Sheol can not thank You , Death can not praise You ; Those who go down to the pit can not hope for Your truth .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	19	The living , the living man , he shall praise You , As I do this day ; ( M ) The father shall make known Your truth to the children .
NKJV	Isaiah	38	20	“ The Lord was ready to save me ; Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments All the days of our life , in the house of the Lord. ”

NKJV	Isaiah	53	3	( B ) He is despised and [ d ] rejected by men , A Man of [ e ] sorrows and ( C ) acquainted with [ f ] grief . And we hid , as it were , our faces from Him ; He was despised , and ( D ) we did not esteem Him .

NKJV	Isaiah	53	6	All we like sheep have gone astray ; We have turned , every one , to his own way ; And the Lord [ n ] has laid on Him the iniquity of us all .

NKJV	Isaiah	58	5	Is ( E ) it a fast that I have chosen , ( F ) A day for a man to afflict his soul ? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush , And ( G ) to spread out sackcloth and ashes ? Would you call this a fast , And an acceptable day to the Lord ?

NKJV	Isaiah	59	59	Behold , the Lord ’ s hand is not ( A ) shortened , That it can not save ; Nor His ear heavy , That it can not hear .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	2	But your iniquities have separated you from your God ; And your sins have hidden His face from you , So that He will ( B ) not hear .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	3	For ( C ) your hands are defiled with [ a ] blood , And your fingers with iniquity ; Your lips have spoken lies , Your tongue has muttered perversity .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	4	No one calls for justice , Nor does any plead for truth . They trust in ( D ) empty words and speak lies ; ( E ) They conceive [ b ] evil and bring forth iniquity .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	5	They hatch vipers ’ eggs and weave the spider ’ s web ; He who eats of their eggs dies , And from that which is crushed a viper breaks out .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	6	( F ) Their webs will not become garments , Nor will they cover themselves with their works ; Their works are works of iniquity , And the act of violence is in their hands .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	7	( G ) Their feet run to evil , And they make haste to shed ( H ) innocent blood ; ( I ) Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity ; Wasting and ( J ) destruction are in their paths .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	8	The way of ( K ) peace they have not known , And there is no justice in their ways ; ( L ) They have made themselves crooked paths ; Whoever takes that way shall not know peace . Sin Confessed
NKJV	Isaiah	59	9	Therefore justice is far from us , Nor does righteousness overtake us ; ( M ) We look for light , but there is darkness ! For brightness , but we walk in blackness !
NKJV	Isaiah	59	10	( N ) We grope for the wall like the blind , And we grope as if we had no eyes ; We stumble at noonday as at twilight ; We are as dead men in desolate places .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	11	We all growl like bears , And ( O ) moan sadly like doves ; We look for justice , but there is none ; For salvation , but it is far from us .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	12	For our ( P ) transgressions are multiplied before You , And our sins testify against us ; For our transgressions are with us , And as for our iniquities , we know them :
NKJV	Isaiah	59	13	In transgressing and lying against the Lord , And departing from our God , Speaking oppression and revolt , Conceiving and uttering ( Q ) from the heart words of falsehood .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	14	Justice is turned back , And righteousness stands afar off ; For truth is fallen in the street , And equity can not enter .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	15	So truth fails , And he who departs from evil makes himself a ( R ) prey . The Redeemer of Zion Then the Lord saw it , and [ c ] it displeased Him That there was no justice .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	16	( S ) He saw that there was no man , And ( T ) wondered that there was no intercessor ; ( U ) Therefore His own arm brought salvation for Him ; And His own righteousness , it sustained Him .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	17	( V ) For He put on righteousness as a breastplate , And a helmet of salvation on His head ; He put on the garments of vengeance for clothing , And was clad with zeal as a cloak .
NKJV	Isaiah	59	18	( W ) According to their deeds , accordingly He will repay , Fury to His adversaries , Recompense to His enemies ; The coastlands He will fully repay .

NKJV	Jeremiah	1	10	( Q ) See , I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms , To ( R ) root out and to pull down , To destroy and to throw down , To build and to plant. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	1	11	Moreover the word of the Lord came to me , saying , “ Jeremiah , what do you see ? ” And I said , “ I see a [ c ] branch of an almond tree. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	1	12	Then the Lord said to me , “ You have seen well , for I am [ d ] ready to perform My word. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	1	13	And the word of the Lord came to me the second time , saying , “ What do you see ? ” And I said , “ I see ( S ) a boiling pot , and it is facing away from the north. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	1	14	Then the Lord said to me : “ Out of the ( T ) north calamity shall break forth On all the inhabitants of the land .
NKJV	Jeremiah	1	15	For behold , I am ( U ) calling All the families of the kingdoms of the north , ” says the Lord ; “ They shall come and ( V ) each one set his throne At the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem , Against all its walls all around , And against all the cities of Judah .

NKJV	Jeremiah	2	2	“ Go and cry in the hearing of Jerusalem , saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ I remember you , The kindness of your ( A ) youth , The love of your betrothal , ( B ) When you [ a ] went after Me in the wilderness , In a land not sown .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	3	( C ) Israel was holiness to the Lord , ( D ) The firstfruits of His increase . ( E ) All that devour him will offend ; Disaster will ( F ) come upon them , ” says the Lord. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	4	Hear the word of the Lord , O house of Jacob and all the families of the house of Israel .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	5	Thus says the Lord : ( G ) “ What injustice have your fathers found in Me , That they have gone far from Me , ( H ) Have followed [ b ] idols , And have become idolaters ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	6	Neither did they say , ‘ Where is the Lord , Who ( I ) brought us up out of the land of Egypt , Who led us through ( J ) the wilderness , Through a land of deserts and pits , Through a land of drought and the shadow of death , Through a land that no one crossed And where no one dwelt ? ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	7	I brought you into ( K ) a bountiful country , To eat its fruit and its goodness . But when you entered , you ( L ) defiled My land And made My heritage an abomination .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	8	The priests did not say , ‘ Where is the Lord ? ’ And those who handle the ( M ) law did not know Me ; The rulers also transgressed against Me ; ( N ) The prophets prophesied by Baal , And walked after things that do not profit .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	9	“ Therefore ( O ) I will yet [ c ] bring charges against you , ” says the Lord , “ And against your children ’ s children I will bring charges .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	10	For pass beyond the coasts of [ d ] Cyprus and see , Send to [ e ] Kedar and consider diligently , And see if there has been such a ( P ) thing .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	11	( Q ) Has a nation changed its gods , Which are ( R ) not gods ? ( S ) But My people have changed their Glory For what does not profit .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	12	Be astonished , O heavens , at this , And be horribly afraid ; Be very desolate , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	13	“ For My people have committed two evils : They have forsaken Me , the ( T ) fountain of living waters , And hewn themselves cisterns—broken cisterns that can hold no water .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	14	“ Is Israel ( U ) a servant ? Is he a homeborn slave ? Why is he plundered ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	15	( V ) The young lions roared at him , and growled ; They made his land waste ; His cities are burned , without inhabitant .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	16	Also the people of [ f ] Noph and ( W ) Tahpanhes Have [ g ] broken the crown of your head .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	17	( X ) Have you not brought this on yourself , In that you have forsaken the Lord your God When ( Y ) He led you in the way ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	18	And now why take ( Z ) the road to Egypt , To drink the waters of ( AA ) Sihor ? Or why take the road to ( AB ) Assyria , To drink the waters of [ h ] the River ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	19	Your own wickedness will ( AC ) correct you , And your backslidings will rebuke you . Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing That you have forsaken the Lord your God , And the [ i ] fear of Me is not in you , ” Says the Lord God of hosts .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	20	“ For of old I have ( AD ) broken your yoke and burst your bonds ; And ( AE ) you said , ‘ I will not [ j ] transgress , ’ When ( AF ) on every high hill and under every green tree You lay down , ( AG ) playing the harlot .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	21	Yet I had ( AH ) planted you a noble vine , a seed of highest quality . How then have you turned before Me Into ( AI ) the degenerate plant of an alien vine ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	22	For though you wash yourself with lye , and use much soap , Yet your iniquity is ( AJ ) marked [ k ] before Me , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	23	“ How ( AK ) can you say , ‘ I am not [ l ] polluted , I have not gone after the Baals ’ ? See your way in the valley ; Know what you have done : You are a swift dromedary breaking loose in her ways ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	24	A wild donkey used to the wilderness , That sniffs at the wind in her desire ; In her time of mating , who can turn her away ? All those who seek her will not weary themselves ; In her month they will find her .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	25	Withhold your foot from being unshod , and your throat from thirst . But you said , ( AL ) ‘ There is no hope . No ! For I have loved ( AM ) aliens , and after them I will go. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	26	“ As the thief is ashamed when he is found out , So is the house of Israel ashamed ; They and their kings and their princes , and their priests and their ( AN ) prophets ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	27	Saying to a tree , ‘ You are my father , ’ And to a ( AO ) stone , ‘ You gave birth to me. ’ For they have turned their back to Me , and not their face . But in the time of their ( AP ) trouble They will say , ‘ Arise and save us. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	28	But ( AQ ) where are your gods that you have made for yourselves ? Let them arise , If they ( AR ) can save you in the time of your [ m ] trouble ; For ( AS ) according to the number of your cities Are your gods , O Judah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	29	“ Why will you plead with Me ? You all have transgressed against Me , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	30	“ In vain I have ( AT ) chastened your children ; They ( AU ) received no correction . Your sword has ( AV ) devoured your prophets Like a destroying lion .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	31	“ O generation , see the word of the Lord ! Have I been a wilderness to Israel , Or a land of darkness ? Why do My people say , ‘ We [ n ] are lords ; ( AW ) We will come no more to You ’ ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	32	Can a virgin forget her ornaments , Or a bride her attire ? Yet My people ( AX ) have forgotten Me days without number .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	33	“ Why do you beautify your way to seek love ? Therefore you have also taught The wicked women your ways .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	34	Also on your skirts is found ( AY ) The blood of the lives of the poor innocents . I have not found it by [ o ] secret search , But plainly on all these things .
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	35	( AZ ) Yet you say , ‘ Because I am innocent , Surely His anger shall turn from me. ’ Behold , ( BA ) I will plead My case against you , ( BB ) Because you say , ‘ I have not sinned. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	2	36	( BC ) Why do you gad about so much to change your way ? Also ( BD ) you shall be ashamed of Egypt ( BE ) as you were ashamed of Assyria .

NKJV	Jeremiah	3	3	Therefore the ( H ) showers have been withheld , And there has been no latter rain . You have had a ( I ) harlot ’ s forehead ; You refuse to be ashamed .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	2	“ Lift up your eyes to ( E ) the desolate heights and see : Where have you not [ a ] lain with men ? ( F ) By the road you have sat for them Like an Arabian in the wilderness ; ( G ) And you have polluted the land With your harlotries and your wickedness .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	4	Will you not from this time cry to Me , ‘ My Father , You are ( J ) the guide of ( K ) my youth ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	5	( L ) Will He remain angry forever ? Will He keep it to the end ? ’ Behold , you have spoken and done evil things , As you were able. ” A Call to Repentance
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	6	The Lord said also to me in the days of Josiah the king : “ Have you seen what ( M ) backsliding Israel has done ? She has ( N ) gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree , and there played the harlot .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	7	( O ) And I said , after she had done all these things , ‘ Return to Me. ’ But she did not return . And her treacherous ( P ) sister Judah saw it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	8	Then I saw that ( Q ) for all the causes for which backsliding Israel had committed adultery , I had ( R ) put her away and given her a certificate of divorce ; ( S ) yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear , but went and played the harlot also .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	9	So it came to pass , through her casual harlotry , that she ( T ) defiled the land and committed adultery with ( U ) stones and trees .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	10	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned to Me ( V ) with her whole heart , but in pretense , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	11	Then the Lord said to me , ( W ) “ Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	12	Go and proclaim these words toward ( X ) the north , and say : ‘ Return , backsliding Israel , ’ says the Lord ; ‘ I will not cause My anger to fall on you . For I am ( Y ) merciful , ’ says the Lord ; ‘ I will not remain angry forever .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	13	( Z ) Only acknowledge your iniquity , That you have transgressed against the Lord your God , And have ( AA ) scattered your [ b ] charms To ( AB ) alien deities ( AC ) under every green tree , And you have not obeyed My voice , ’ says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	14	“ Return , O backsliding children , ” says the Lord ; ( AD ) “ for I am married to you . I will take you , ( AE ) one from a city and two from a family , and I will bring you to ( AF ) Zion .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	15	And I will give you ( AG ) shepherds according to My heart , who will ( AH ) feed you with knowledge and understanding .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	16	“ Then it shall come to pass , when you are multiplied and ( AI ) increased in the land in those days , ” says the Lord , “ that they will say no more , ‘ The ark of the covenant of the Lord. ’ ( AJ ) It shall not come to mind , nor shall they remember it , nor shall they visit it , nor shall it be made anymore .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	17	“ At that time Jerusalem shall be called The Throne of the Lord , and all the nations shall be gathered to it , ( AK ) to the name of the Lord , to Jerusalem . No more shall they ( AL ) follow [ c ] the dictates of their evil hearts .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	18	“ In those days ( AM ) the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of ( AN ) the north to ( AO ) the land that I have given as an inheritance to your fathers .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	19	“ But I said : ‘ How can I put you among the children And give you ( AP ) a pleasant land , A beautiful heritage of the hosts of nations ? ’ “ And I said : ‘ You shall call Me , ( AQ ) “ My Father , ” And not turn away from Me. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	20	Surely , as a wife treacherously departs from her [ d ] husband , So ( AR ) have you dealt treacherously with Me , O house of Israel , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	21	A voice was heard on ( AS ) the desolate heights , Weeping and supplications of the children of Israel . For they have perverted their way ; They have forgotten the Lord their God .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	22	“ Return , you backsliding children , And I will ( AT ) heal your backslidings. ” “ Indeed we do come to You , For You are the Lord our God .
NKJV	Jeremiah	3	23	( AU ) Truly , in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills , And from the multitude of mountains ; ( AV ) Truly , in the Lord our God Is the salvation of Israel .

NKJV	Jeremiah	4	4	( H ) Circumcise yourselves to the Lord , And take away the foreskins of your hearts , You men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem , Lest My fury come forth like fire , And burn so that no one can quench it , Because of the evil of your doings. ” An Imminent Invasion
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	2	( B ) And you shall swear , ‘ The Lord lives , ’ ( C ) In truth , in [ a ] judgment , and in righteousness ; ( D ) The nations shall bless themselves in Him , And in Him they shall ( E ) glory. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	3	For thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem : ( F ) “ Break up your [ b ] fallow ground , And ( G ) do not sow among thorns .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	5	Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem , and say : ( I ) “ Blow the trumpet in the land ; Cry , ‘ Gather together , ’ And say , ( J ) ‘ Assemble yourselves , And let us go into the fortified cities. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	6	Set up the [ c ] standard toward Zion . Take refuge ! Do not delay ! For I will bring disaster from the ( K ) north , And great destruction. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	7	( L ) The lion has come up from his thicket , And ( M ) the destroyer of nations is on his way . He has gone forth from his place ( N ) To make your land desolate . Your cities will be laid waste , Without inhabitant .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	8	For this , ( O ) clothe yourself with sackcloth , Lament and wail . For the fierce anger of the Lord Has not turned back from us .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	9	“ And it shall come to pass in that day , ” says the Lord , “ That the heart of the king shall perish , And the heart of the princes ; The priests shall be astonished , And the prophets shall wonder. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	10	Then I said , “ Ah , Lord God ! ( P ) Surely You have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem , ( Q ) Saying , ‘ You shall have peace , ’ Whereas the sword reaches to the [ d ] heart. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	11	At that time it will be said To this people and to Jerusalem , ( R ) “ A dry wind of the desolate heights blows in the wilderness Toward the daughter of My people— Not to fan or to cleanse—
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	12	A wind too strong for these will come for Me ; Now ( S ) I will also speak judgment against them. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	13	“ Behold , he shall come up like clouds , And ( T ) his chariots like a whirlwind . ( U ) His horses are swifter than eagles . Woe to us , for we are plundered ! ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	14	O Jerusalem , ( V ) wash your heart from wickedness , That you may be saved . How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	15	For a voice declares ( W ) from Dan And proclaims [ e ] affliction from Mount Ephraim :
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	16	“ Make mention to the nations , Yes , proclaim against Jerusalem , That watchers come from a ( X ) far country And raise their voice against the cities of Judah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	17	( Y ) Like keepers of a field they are against her all around , Because she has been rebellious against Me , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	18	“ Your ( Z ) ways and your doings Have procured these things for you . This is your wickedness , Because it is bitter , Because it reaches to your heart. ” Sorrow for the Doomed Nation
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	19	O my ( AA ) soul , my soul ! I am pained in my very heart ! My heart makes a noise in me ; I can not hold my peace , Because you have heard , O my soul , The sound of the trumpet , The alarm of war .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	20	( AB ) Destruction upon destruction is cried , For the whole land is plundered . Suddenly ( AC ) my tents are plundered , And my curtains in a moment .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	21	How long will I see the [ f ] standard , And hear the sound of the trumpet ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	22	“ For My people are foolish , They have not known Me . They are [ g ] silly children , And they have no understanding . ( AD ) They are wise to do evil , But to do good they have no knowledge. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	23	( AE ) I beheld the earth , and indeed it was ( AF ) without form , and void ; And the heavens , they had no light .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	24	( AG ) I beheld the mountains , and indeed they trembled , And all the hills moved back and forth .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	25	I beheld , and indeed there was no man , And ( AH ) all the birds of the heavens had fled .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	26	I beheld , and indeed the fruitful land was a ( AI ) wilderness , And all its cities were broken down At the presence of the Lord , By His fierce anger .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	27	For thus says the Lord : “ The whole land shall be desolate ; ( AJ ) Yet I will not make a full end .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	28	For this ( AK ) shall the earth mourn , And ( AL ) the heavens above be black , Because I have spoken . I have ( AM ) purposed and ( AN ) will not relent , Nor will I turn back from it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	29	The whole city shall flee from the noise of the horsemen and bowmen . They shall go into thickets and climb up on the rocks . Every city shall be forsaken , And not a man shall dwell in it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	30	“ And when you are plundered , What will you do ? Though you clothe yourself with crimson , Though you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold , ( AO ) Though you enlarge your eyes with paint , In vain you will make yourself fair ; ( AP ) Your lovers will despise you ; They will seek your life .
NKJV	Jeremiah	4	31	“ For I have heard a voice as of a woman in [ h ] labor , The anguish as of her who brings forth her first child , The voice of the daughter of Zion bewailing herself ; She ( AQ ) spreads her hands , saying , ‘ Woe is me now , for my soul is [ i ] weary Because of murderers ! ’ Footnotes - Jeremiah 4:2 justice - Jeremiah 4:3 untilled - Jeremiah 4:6 banner - Jeremiah 4:10 Lit . soul - Jeremiah 4:15 Or wickedness - Jeremiah 4:21 banner - Jeremiah 4:22 foolish - Jeremiah 4:31 childbirth - Jeremiah 4:31 faint Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Jeremiah	5	5	I will go to the great men and speak to them , For ( K ) they have known the way of the Lord , The judgment of their God. ” But these have altogether ( L ) broken the yoke And burst the bonds .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	2	( D ) Though they say , ‘ As ( E ) the Lord lives , ’ Surely they ( F ) swear falsely. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	3	O Lord , are not ( G ) Your eyes on the truth ? You have ( H ) stricken them , But they have not grieved ; You have consumed them , But ( I ) they have refused to receive correction . They have made their faces harder than rock ; They have refused to return .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	4	Therefore I said , “ Surely these are poor . They are foolish ; For ( J ) they do not know the way of the Lord , The judgment of their God .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	6	Therefore ( M ) a lion from the forest shall slay them , ( N ) A wolf of the deserts shall destroy them ; ( O ) A leopard will watch over their cities .

NKJV	Jeremiah	5	7	“ How shall I pardon you for this ? Your children have forsaken Me And ( P ) sworn by those ( Q ) that are not gods . ( R ) When I had fed them to the full , Then they committed adultery And assembled themselves by troops in the harlots ’ houses .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	8	( S ) They were like well-fed lusty stallions ; Every one neighed after his neighbor ’ s wife .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	9	Shall I not punish them for these things ? ” says the Lord . “ And shall I not ( T ) avenge Myself on such a nation as this ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	10	“ Go up on her walls and destroy , But do not [ b ] make a ( U ) complete end . Take away her branches , For they are not the Lord ’ s .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	11	For ( V ) the house of Israel and the house of Judah Have dealt very treacherously with Me , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	12	( W ) They have lied about the Lord , And said , ( X ) “ It is not He . ( Y ) Neither will [ c ] evil come upon us , Nor shall we see sword or famine .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	13	And the prophets become wind , For the word is not in them . Thus shall it be done to them. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	14	Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts : “ Because you speak this word , ( Z ) Behold , I will make My words in your mouth fire , And this people wood , And it shall devour them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	15	Behold , I will bring a ( AA ) nation against you ( AB ) from afar , O house of Israel , ” says the Lord . “ It is a mighty nation , It is an ancient nation , A nation whose language you do not know , Nor can you understand what they say .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	16	Their quiver is like an open tomb ; They are all mighty men .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	17	And they shall eat up your ( AC ) harvest and your bread , Which your sons and daughters should eat . They shall eat up your flocks and your herds ; They shall eat up your vines and your fig trees ; They shall destroy your fortified cities , In which you trust , with the sword .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	18	“ Nevertheless in those days , ” says the Lord , “ I ( AD ) will not [ d ] make a complete end of you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	19	And it will be when you say , ( AE ) ‘ Why does the Lord our God do all these things to us ? ’ then you shall answer them , ‘ Just as you have ( AF ) forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land , so ( AG ) you shall serve aliens in a land that is not yours. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	5	20	“ Declare this in the house of Jacob And proclaim it in Judah , saying ,

NKJV	Jeremiah	5	23	But this people has a defiant and rebellious heart ; They have revolted and departed .

NKJV	Jeremiah	6	6	For thus has the Lord of hosts said : “ Cut down trees , And build a mound against Jerusalem . This is the city to be punished . She is full of oppression in her midst .
NKJV	Jeremiah	6	2	I have likened the daughter of Zion To a lovely and delicate woman .
NKJV	Jeremiah	6	3	The ( C ) shepherds with their flocks shall come to her . They shall pitch their tents against her all around . Each one shall pasture in his own place. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	6	4	“ Prepare ( D ) war against her ; Arise , and let us go up ( E ) at noon . Woe to us , for the day goes away , For the shadows of the evening are lengthening .
NKJV	Jeremiah	6	5	Arise , and let us go by night , And let us destroy her palaces. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	6	7	( F ) As a fountain [ a ] wells up with water , So she wells up with her wickedness . ( G ) Violence and plundering are heard in her . Before Me continually are [ b ] grief and wounds .
NKJV	Jeremiah	6	8	Be instructed , O Jerusalem , Lest ( H ) My soul depart from you ; Lest I make you desolate , A land not inhabited. ”

NKJV	Jeremiah	6	10	To whom shall I speak and give warning , That they may hear ? Indeed their ( I ) ear is uncircumcised , And they can not give heed . Behold , ( J ) the word of the Lord is a reproach to them ; They have no delight in it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	6	11	Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord . ( K ) I am weary of holding it in . “ I will pour it out ( L ) on the children outside , And on the assembly of young men together ; For even the husband shall be taken with the wife , The aged with him who is full of days .
NKJV	Jeremiah	6	12	And ( M ) their houses shall be turned over to others , Fields and wives together ; For I will stretch out My hand Against the inhabitants of the land , ” says the Lord .

NKJV	Jeremiah	6	15	Were they ( R ) ashamed when they had committed abomination ? No ! They were not at all ashamed ; Nor did they know how to blush . Therefore they shall fall among those who fall ; At the time I punish them , They shall be cast down , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	6	16	Thus says the Lord : “ Stand in the ways and see , And ask for the ( S ) old paths , where the good way is , And walk in it ; Then you will find ( T ) rest for your souls . But they said , ‘ We will not walk in it. ’

NKJV	Jeremiah	9	3	“ And like their bow ( C ) they have bent their tongues for lies . They are not valiant for the truth on the earth . For they proceed from ( D ) evil to evil , And they ( E ) do not know Me , ” says the Lord .

NKJV	Jeremiah	9	6	Your dwelling place is in the midst of deceit ; Through deceit they refuse to know Me , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	9	7	Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts : “ Behold , ( I ) I will refine them and [ b ] try them ; ( J ) For how shall I deal with the daughter of My people ?

NKJV	Jeremiah	9	10	I will take up a weeping and wailing for the mountains , And ( N ) for the [ e ] dwelling places of the wilderness a lamentation , Because they are burned up , So that no one can pass through ; Nor can men hear the voice of the cattle .

NKJV	Jeremiah	10	8	But they are altogether ( J ) dull-hearted and foolish ; A wooden idol is a [ b ] worthless doctrine .
NKJV	Jeremiah	10	9	Silver is beaten into plates ; It is brought from Tarshish , And ( K ) gold from Uphaz , The work of the craftsman And of the hands of the metalsmith ; Blue and purple are their clothing ; They are all ( L ) the work of skillful men .
NKJV	Jeremiah	10	11	Thus you shall say to them : ( O ) “ The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth ( P ) shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens. ”

NKJV	Jeremiah	11	13	For according to the number of your ( N ) cities were your gods , O Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to that shameful thing , altars to burn incense to Baal .
NKJV	Jeremiah	11	14	“ So ( O ) do not pray for this people , or lift up a cry or prayer for them ; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry out to Me because of their trouble .

NKJV	Jeremiah	12	2	You have planted them , yes , they have taken root ; They grow , yes , they bear fruit . ( C ) You are near in their mouth But far from their [ a ] mind .
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	3	But You , O Lord , ( D ) know me ; You have seen me , And You have ( E ) tested my heart toward You . Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , And prepare them for ( F ) the day of slaughter .
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	4	How long will ( G ) the land mourn , And the herbs of every field wither ? ( H ) The beasts and birds are consumed , ( I ) For the wickedness of those who dwell there , Because they said , “ He will not see our final end. ” The Lord Answers Jeremiah
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	5	“ If you have run with the footmen , and they have wearied you , Then how can you contend with horses ? And if in the land of peace , In which you trusted , they wearied you , Then how will you do in ( J ) the [ b ] floodplain of the Jordan ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	6	For even ( K ) your brothers , the house of your father , Even they have dealt treacherously with you ; Yes , they have called [ c ] a multitude after you . ( L ) Do not believe them , Even though they speak [ d ] smooth words to you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	7	“ I have forsaken My house , I have left My heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of My soul into the hand of her enemies .
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	8	My heritage is to Me like a lion in the forest ; It cries out against Me ; Therefore I have ( M ) hated it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	9	My [ e ] heritage is to Me like a speckled vulture ; The vultures all around are against her . Come , assemble all the beasts of the field , ( N ) Bring them to devour !
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	10	“ Many ( O ) rulers [ f ] have destroyed ( P ) My vineyard , They have ( Q ) trodden My portion underfoot ; They have made My [ g ] pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	11	They have made it ( R ) desolate ; Desolate , it mourns to Me ; The whole land is made desolate , Because ( S ) no one takes it to heart .
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	13	( T ) They have sown wheat but reaped thorns ; They have [ h ] put themselves to pain but do not profit . But be ashamed of your harvest Because of the fierce anger of the Lord. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	14	Thus says the Lord : “ Against all My evil neighbors who ( U ) touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit—behold , I will ( V ) pluck them out of their land and pluck out the house of Judah from among them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	15	( W ) Then it shall be , after I have plucked them out , that I will return and have compassion on them ( X ) and bring them back , everyone to his heritage and everyone to his land .
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	16	And it shall be , if they will learn carefully the ways of My people , ( Y ) to swear by My name , ‘ As the Lord lives , ’ as they taught My people to swear by Baal , then they shall be ( Z ) established in the midst of My people .
NKJV	Jeremiah	12	17	But if they do not ( AA ) obey , I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation , ” says the Lord .

NKJV	Jeremiah	13	13	“ Then you shall say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ Behold , I will fill all the inhabitants of this land—even the kings who sit on David ’ s throne , the priests , the prophets , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem— ( I ) with drunkenness !
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	2	So I got a [ b ] sash according to the word of the Lord , and put it around my waist .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	3	And the word of the Lord came to me the second time , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	4	“ Take the [ c ] sash that you acquired , which is [ d ] around your waist , and arise , go to the [ e ] Euphrates , and hide it there in a hole in the rock. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates , as the Lord commanded me .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	6	Now it came to pass after many days that the Lord said to me , “ Arise , go to the Euphrates , and take from there the sash which I commanded you to hide there. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	7	Then I went to the Euphrates and dug , and I took the [ f ] sash from the place where I had hidden it ; and there was the sash , ruined . It was profitable for nothing .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	8	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	9	“ Thus says the Lord : ‘ In this manner ( A ) I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great ( B ) pride of Jerusalem .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	10	This evil people , who ( C ) refuse to hear My words , who ( D ) follow [ g ] the dictates of their hearts , and walk after other gods to serve them and worship them , shall be just like this sash which is profitable for nothing .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	11	For as the sash clings to the waist of a man , so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to Me , ’ says the Lord , ‘ that ( E ) they may become My people , ( F ) for renown , for praise , and for ( G ) glory ; but they would ( H ) not hear. ’ Symbol of the Wine Bottles
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	12	“ Therefore you shall speak to them this word : ‘ Thus says the Lord God of Israel : “ Every bottle shall be filled with wine. ” ’ “ And they will say to you , ‘ Do we not certainly know that every bottle will be filled with wine ? ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	14	And ( J ) I will dash them [ h ] one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , ” says the Lord . “ I will not pity nor spare nor have mercy , but will destroy them. ” ’ ” Pride Precedes Captivity
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	15	Hear and give ear : Do not be proud , For the Lord has spoken .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	16	( K ) Give glory to the Lord your God Before He causes ( L ) darkness , And before your feet stumble On the dark mountains , And while you are ( M ) looking for light , He turns it into ( N ) the shadow of death And makes it dense darkness .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	17	But if you will not hear it , My soul will ( O ) weep in secret for your pride ; My eyes will weep bitterly And run down with tears , Because the Lord ’ s flock has been taken captive .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	18	Say to ( P ) the king and to the queen mother , “ Humble yourselves ; Sit down , For your rule shall collapse , the crown of your glory. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	19	The cities of the South shall be shut up , And no one shall open them ; Judah shall be carried away captive , all of it ; It shall be wholly carried away captive .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	20	Lift up your eyes and see Those who come from the ( Q ) north . Where is the flock that was given to you , Your beautiful sheep ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	21	What will you say when He punishes you ? For you have taught them To be chieftains , to be head over you . Will not ( R ) pangs seize you , Like a woman in [ i ] labor ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	22	And if you say in your heart , ( S ) “ Why have these things come upon me ? ” For the greatness of your iniquity ( T ) Your skirts have been uncovered , Your heels [ j ] made bare .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard its spots ? Then may you also do good who are accustomed to do evil .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	24	“ Therefore I will ( U ) scatter them ( V ) like stubble That passes away by the wind of the wilderness .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	25	( W ) This is your lot , The portion of your measures from Me , ” says the Lord , “ Because you have forgotten Me And trusted in ( X ) falsehood .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	26	Therefore ( Y ) I will uncover your skirts over your face , That your shame may appear .
NKJV	Jeremiah	13	27	I have seen your adulteries And your lustful ( Z ) neighings , The lewdness of your harlotry , Your abominations ( AA ) on the hills in the fields . Woe to you , O Jerusalem !

NKJV	Jeremiah	14	14	And the Lord said to me , ( T ) “ The prophets prophesy lies in My name . ( U ) I have not sent them , commanded them , nor spoken to them ; they prophesy to you a false vision , [ c ] divination , a worthless thing , and the ( V ) deceit of their heart .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	2	“ Judah mourns , And ( A ) her gates languish ; They ( B ) mourn for the land , And ( C ) the cry of Jerusalem has gone up .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	3	Their nobles have sent their lads for water ; They went to the cisterns and found no water . They returned with their vessels empty ; They were ( D ) ashamed and confounded ( E ) And covered their heads .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	4	Because the ground is parched , For there was ( F ) no rain in the land , The plowmen were ashamed ; They covered their heads .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	5	Yes , the deer also gave birth in the field , But [ a ] left because there was no grass .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	6	And ( G ) the wild donkeys stood in the desolate heights ; They sniffed at the wind like jackals ; Their eyes failed because there was no grass. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	7	O Lord , though our iniquities testify against us , Do it ( H ) for Your name ’ s sake ; For our backslidings are many , We have sinned against You .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	8	( I ) O the Hope of Israel , his Savior in time of trouble , Why should You be like a stranger in the land , And like a traveler who turns aside to tarry for a night ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	9	Why should You be like a man astonished , Like a mighty one ( J ) who can not save ? Yet You , O Lord , ( K ) are in our midst , And we are called by Your name ; Do not leave us !
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	10	Thus says the Lord to this people : ( L ) “ Thus they have loved to wander ; They have not restrained their feet . Therefore the Lord does not accept them ; ( M ) He will remember their iniquity now , And punish their sins. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	11	Then the Lord said to me , ( N ) “ Do not pray for this people , for their good .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	12	( O ) When they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and ( P ) when they offer burnt offering and grain offering , I will not accept them . But ( Q ) I will consume them by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	13	( R ) Then I said , “ Ah , Lord God ! Behold , the prophets say to them , ‘ You shall not see the sword , nor shall you have famine , but I will give you [ b ] assured ( S ) peace in this place. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	15	Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name , whom I did not send , ( W ) and who say , ‘ Sword and famine shall not be in this land ’ — ‘ By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed !
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword ; ( X ) they will have no one to bury them—them nor their wives , their sons nor their daughters—for I will pour their wickedness on them. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	17	“ Therefore you shall say this word to them : ( Y ) ‘ Let my eyes flow with tears night and day , And let them not cease ; ( Z ) For the virgin daughter of my people Has been broken with a mighty stroke , with a very severe blow .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	18	If I go out to ( AA ) the field , Then behold , those slain with the sword ! And if I enter the city , Then behold , those sick from famine ! Yes , both prophet and ( AB ) priest go about in a land they do not know. ’ ” The People Plead for Mercy
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	19	( AC ) Have You utterly rejected Judah ? Has Your soul loathed Zion ? Why have You stricken us so that ( AD ) there is no healing for us ? ( AE ) We looked for peace , but there was no good ; And for the time of healing , and there was trouble .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	20	We acknowledge , O Lord , our wickedness And the iniquity of our ( AF ) fathers , For ( AG ) we have sinned against You .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	21	Do not abhor us , for Your name ’ s sake ; Do not disgrace the throne of Your glory . ( AH ) Remember , do not break Your covenant with us .
NKJV	Jeremiah	14	22	( AI ) Are there any among ( AJ ) the idols of the nations that can cause ( AK ) rain ? Or can the heavens give showers ? ( AL ) Are You not He , O Lord our God ? Therefore we will wait for You , Since You have made all these .

NKJV	Jeremiah	15	2	And it shall be , if they say to you , ‘ Where should we go ? ’ then you shall tell them , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( D ) “ Such as are for death , to death ; And such as are for the sword , to the sword ; And such as are for the famine , to the famine ; And such as are for the ( E ) captivity , to the captivity. ” ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	3	“ And I will ( F ) appoint over them four forms of destruction , ” says the Lord : “ the sword to slay , the dogs to drag , ( G ) the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy .
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	4	I will hand them over to ( H ) trouble , to all kingdoms of the earth , because of ( I ) Manasseh the son of Hezekiah , king of Judah , for what he did in Jerusalem .
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	5	“ For who will have pity on you , O Jerusalem ? Or who will bemoan you ? Or who will turn aside to ask how you are doing ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	6	( J ) You have forsaken Me , ” says the Lord , “ You have ( K ) gone backward . Therefore I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you ; ( L ) I am [ b ] weary of relenting !
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	7	And I will winnow them with a winnowing fan in the gates of the land ; I will ( M ) bereave them of children ; I will destroy My people , Since they ( N ) do not return from their ways .
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	8	Their widows will be increased to Me more than the sand of the seas ; I will bring against them , Against the mother of the young men , A plunderer at noonday ; I will cause anguish and terror to fall on them ( O ) suddenly .
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	9	“ She ( P ) languishes who has borne seven ; She has breathed her last ; ( Q ) Her sun has gone down While it was yet day ; She has been ashamed and confounded . And the remnant of them I will deliver to the sword Before their enemies , ” says the Lord . Jeremiah ’ s Dejection

NKJV	Jeremiah	15	11	The Lord said : “ Surely it will be well with your remnant ; Surely I will cause ( S ) the enemy to intercede with you In the time of adversity and in the time of affliction .
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	12	Can anyone break iron , The northern iron and the bronze ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	13	Your wealth and your treasures I will give as ( T ) plunder without price , Because of all your sins , Throughout your territories .
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	14	And I will [ d ] make you cross over with your enemies ( U ) Into a land which you do not know ; For a ( V ) fire is kindled in My anger , Which shall burn upon you. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	16	Your words were found , and I ( Z ) ate them , And ( AA ) Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart ; For I am called by Your name , O Lord God of hosts .
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	17	( AB ) I did not sit in the assembly of the mockers , Nor did I rejoice ; I sat alone because of Your hand , For You have filled me with indignation .
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	18	Why is my ( AC ) pain perpetual And my wound incurable , Which refuses to be healed ? Will You surely be to me ( AD ) like an unreliable stream , As waters that [ f ] fail ? The Lord Reassures Jeremiah
NKJV	Jeremiah	15	19	Therefore thus says the Lord : ( AE ) “ If you return , Then I will bring you back ; You shall ( AF ) stand before Me ; If you ( AG ) take out the precious from the vile , You shall be as My mouth . Let them return to you , But you must not return to them .

NKJV	Jeremiah	16	2	“ You shall not take a wife , nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place. ”

NKJV	Jeremiah	16	10	“ And it shall be , when you show this people all these words , and they say to you , ( L ) ‘ Why has the Lord pronounced all this great disaster against us ? Or what is our iniquity ? Or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God ? ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	16	11	then you shall say to them , ( M ) ‘ Because your fathers have forsaken Me , ’ says the Lord ; ‘ they have walked after other gods and have served them and worshiped them , and have forsaken Me and not kept My law .

NKJV	Jeremiah	18	6	“ O house of Israel , ( A ) can I not do with you as this potter ? ” says the Lord . “ Look , ( B ) as the clay is in the potter ’ s hand , so are you in My hand , O house of Israel !
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	7	The instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom , to ( C ) pluck up , to pull down , and to destroy it ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	8	( D ) if that nation against whom I have spoken turns from its evil , ( E ) I will relent of the disaster that I thought to bring upon it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	9	And the instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant it ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	10	if it does evil in My sight so that it does not obey My voice , then I will relent concerning the good with which I said I would benefit it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	11	“ Now therefore , speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ Behold , I am fashioning a disaster and devising a plan against you . ( F ) Return now every one from his evil way , and make your ways and your doings ( G ) good. ” ’ ” God ’ s Warning Rejected
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	12	And they said , ( H ) “ That is hopeless ! So we will walk according to our own plans , and we will every one [ d ] obey the ( I ) dictates [ e ] of his evil heart. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	13	Therefore thus says the Lord : ( J ) “ Ask now among the Gentiles , Who has heard such things ? The virgin of Israel has done ( K ) a very horrible thing .
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	14	Will a man [ f ] leave the snow water of Lebanon , Which comes from the rock of the field ? Will the cold flowing waters be forsaken for strange waters ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	15	“ Because My people have forgotten ( L ) Me , They have burned incense to worthless idols . And they have caused themselves to stumble in their ways , From the ( M ) ancient paths , To walk in pathways and not on a highway ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	16	To make their land ( N ) desolate and a perpetual ( O ) hissing ; Everyone who passes by it will be astonished And shake his head .
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	17	( P ) I will scatter them ( Q ) as with an east wind before the enemy ; ( R ) I will [ g ] show them the back and not the face In the day of their calamity. ” Jeremiah Persecuted
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	19	Give heed to me , O Lord , And listen to the voice of those who contend with me !
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	20	( U ) Shall evil be repaid for good ? For they have ( V ) dug a pit for my life . Remember that I ( W ) stood before You To speak good [ h ] for them , To turn away Your wrath from them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	21	Therefore ( X ) deliver up their children to the famine , And pour out their blood By the force of the sword ; Let their wives become widows And ( Y ) bereaved of their children . Let their men be put to death , Their young men be slain By the sword in battle .
NKJV	Jeremiah	18	22	Let a cry be heard from their houses , When You bring a troop suddenly upon them ; For they have dug a pit to take me , And hidden snares for my feet .

NKJV	Jeremiah	19	3	( B ) and say , ‘ Hear the word of the Lord , O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem . Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Behold , I will bring such a catastrophe on this place , that whoever hears of it , his ears will ( C ) tingle .
NKJV	Jeremiah	19	4	“ Because they ( D ) have forsaken Me and made this an alien place , because they have burned incense in it to other gods whom neither they , their fathers , nor the kings of Judah have known , and have filled this place with ( E ) the blood of the innocents
NKJV	Jeremiah	19	5	( F ) ( they have also built the high places of Baal , to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal , ( G ) which I did not command or speak , nor did it come into My mind ) ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	19	6	therefore behold , the days are coming , ” says the Lord , “ that this place shall no more be called Tophet or ( H ) the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , but the Valley of Slaughter .
NKJV	Jeremiah	19	7	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place , ( I ) and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those who seek their lives ; their ( J ) corpses I will give as meat for the birds of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth .
NKJV	Jeremiah	19	8	I will make this city ( K ) desolate and a hissing ; everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues .
NKJV	Jeremiah	19	9	And I will cause them to eat the ( L ) flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters , and everyone shall eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the desperation with which their enemies and those who seek their lives shall drive them to despair. ” ’

NKJV	Jeremiah	19	13	And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled ( P ) like the place of Tophet , because of all the houses on whose ( Q ) roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven , and ( R ) poured out drink offerings to other gods. ” ’ ”

NKJV	Jeremiah	20	20	Now ( A ) Pashhur the son of ( B ) Immer , the priest who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord , heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things .
NKJV	Jeremiah	20	2	Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the high ( C ) gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	20	3	And it happened on the next day that Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks . Then Jeremiah said to him , “ The Lord has not called your name Pashhur , but [ a ] Magor-Missabib .

NKJV	Jeremiah	20	5	Moreover I ( E ) will deliver all the wealth of this city , all its produce , and all its precious things ; all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies , who will plunder them , seize them , and ( F ) carry them to Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	20	6	And you , Pashhur , and all who dwell in your house , shall go into captivity . You shall go to Babylon , and there you shall die , and be buried there , you and all your friends , to whom you have ( G ) prophesied lies. ’ ” Jeremiah ’ s Unpopular Ministry
NKJV	Jeremiah	20	7	O Lord , You [ b ] induced me , and I was persuaded ; ( H ) You are stronger than I , and have prevailed . ( I ) I am [ c ] in derision daily ; Everyone mocks me .
NKJV	Jeremiah	20	8	For when I spoke , I cried out ; ( J ) I shouted , “ Violence and plunder ! ” Because the word of the Lord was made to me A reproach and a derision daily .
NKJV	Jeremiah	20	9	Then I said , “ I will not make mention of Him , Nor speak anymore in His name. ” But His word was in my heart like a ( K ) burning fire Shut up in my bones ; I was weary of holding it back , And ( L ) I could not .
NKJV	Jeremiah	20	10	( M ) For I heard many [ d ] mocking : “ Fear on every side ! ” “ Report , ” they say , “ and we will report it ! ” ( N ) All my acquaintances watched for my stumbling , saying , “ Perhaps he can be induced ; Then we will prevail against him , And we will take our revenge on him. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	20	11	But the Lord is ( O ) with me as a mighty , awesome One . Therefore my persecutors will stumble , and will not ( P ) prevail . They will be greatly ashamed , for they will not prosper . Their ( Q ) everlasting confusion will never be forgotten .
NKJV	Jeremiah	20	12	But , O Lord of hosts , You who ( R ) test the righteous , And see the [ e ] mind and heart , ( S ) Let me see Your vengeance on them ; For I have pleaded my cause before You .

NKJV	Jeremiah	23	9	My heart within me is broken Because of the prophets ; ( M ) All my bones shake . I am like a drunken man , And like a man whom wine has overcome , Because of the Lord , And because of His holy words .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	10	For ( N ) the land is full of adulterers ; For ( O ) because of a curse the land mourns . ( P ) The pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up . Their course of life is evil , And their might is not right .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	11	“ For ( Q ) both prophet and priest are profane ; Yes , ( R ) in My house I have found their wickedness , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	12	“ Therefore ( S ) their way shall be to them Like slippery ways ; In the darkness they shall be driven on And fall in them ; For I ( T ) will bring disaster on them , The year of their punishment , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	13	“ And I have seen [ e ] folly in the prophets of Samaria : ( U ) They prophesied by Baal And ( V ) caused My people Israel to err .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	14	Also I have seen a horrible thing in the prophets of Jerusalem : ( W ) They commit adultery and walk in lies ; They also ( X ) strengthen the hands of evildoers , So that no one turns back from his wickedness .

NKJV	Jeremiah	23	15	“ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets : ‘ Behold , I will feed them with ( Z ) wormwood , And make them drink the water of gall ; For from the prophets of Jerusalem [ f ] Profaneness has gone out into all the land. ’ ”

NKJV	Jeremiah	23	21	“ I ( AI ) have not sent these prophets , yet they ran . I have not spoken to them , yet they prophesied .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	22	But if they had stood in My counsel , And had caused My people to hear My words , Then they would have ( AJ ) turned them from their evil way And from the evil of their doings .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	24	Can anyone ( AK ) hide himself in secret places , So I shall not see him ? ” says the Lord ; ( AL ) “ Do I not fill heaven and earth ? ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	25	“ I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in My name , saying , ‘ I have dreamed , I have dreamed ! ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	26	How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies ? Indeed they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	27	who try to make My people forget My name by their dreams which everyone tells his neighbor , ( AM ) as their fathers forgot My name for Baal .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	28	“ The prophet who has a dream , let him tell a dream ; And he who has My word , let him speak My word faithfully . What is the chaff to the wheat ? ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	29	“ Is not My word like a ( AN ) fire ? ” says the Lord , “ And like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	30	“ Therefore behold , ( AO ) I am against the prophets , ” says the Lord , “ who steal My words every one from his neighbor .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	31	Behold , I am ( AP ) against the prophets , ” says the Lord , “ who use their tongues and say , ‘ He says. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	32	Behold , I am against those who prophesy false dreams , ” says the Lord , “ and tell them , and cause My people to err by their ( AQ ) lies and by ( AR ) their recklessness .

NKJV	Jeremiah	23	33	“ So when these people or the prophet or the priest ask you , saying , ‘ What is ( AT ) the [ h ] oracle of the Lord ? ’ you shall then say to them , [ i ] ‘ What oracle ? ’ I will even forsake you , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	34	“ And as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say , ‘ The [ j ] oracle of the Lord ! ’ I will even punish that man and his house .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	35	Thus every one of you shall say to his neighbor , and every one to his brother , ‘ What has the Lord answered ? ’ and , ‘ What has the Lord spoken ? ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	36	And the [ k ] oracle of the Lord you shall mention no more . For every man ’ s word will be his oracle , for you have ( AU ) perverted the words of the living God , the Lord of hosts , our God .
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	37	Thus you shall say to the prophet , ‘ What has the Lord answered you ? ’ and , ‘ What has the Lord spoken ? ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	38	But since you say , ‘ The [ l ] oracle of the Lord ! ’ therefore thus says the Lord : ‘ Because you say this word , “ The oracle of the Lord ! ” and I have sent to you , saying , “ Do not say , ‘ The oracle of the Lord ! ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	23	39	therefore behold , I , even I , ( AV ) will utterly forget you and forsake you , and the city that I gave you and your fathers , and will cast you out of My presence .

NKJV	Jeremiah	24	24	The ( A ) Lord showed me , and there were two baskets of figs set before the temple of the Lord , after Nebuchadnezzar ( B ) king of Babylon had carried away captive ( C ) Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and the princes of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths , from Jerusalem , and had brought them to Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	24	2	One basket had very good figs , like the figs that are first ripe ; and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten , they were so ( D ) bad .
NKJV	Jeremiah	24	3	Then the Lord said to me , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” And I said , “ Figs , the good figs , very good ; and the bad , very bad , which can not be eaten , they are so bad. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	24	4	Again the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	24	5	“ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : ‘ Like these good figs , so will I [ a ] acknowledge those who are carried away captive from Judah , whom I have sent out of this place for their own good , into the land of the Chaldeans .
NKJV	Jeremiah	24	6	For I will set My eyes on them for good , and ( E ) I will bring them back to this land ; ( F ) I will build them and not pull them down , and I will plant them and not pluck them up .
NKJV	Jeremiah	24	7	Then I will give them ( G ) a heart to know Me , that I am the Lord ; and they shall be ( H ) My people , and I will be their God , for they shall return to Me ( I ) with their whole heart .
NKJV	Jeremiah	24	8	‘ And as the bad ( J ) figs which can not be eaten , they are so bad ’ —surely thus says the Lord— ‘ so will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah , his princes , the ( K ) residue of Jerusalem who remain in this land , and ( L ) those who dwell in the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Jeremiah	24	9	I will deliver them to ( M ) trouble into all the kingdoms of the earth , for their harm , ( N ) to be a reproach and a byword , a taunt and a curse , in all places where I shall drive them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	24	10	And I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence among them , till they are [ b ] consumed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 24:5 regard - Jeremiah 24:10 destroyed Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Jeremiah	25	4	And the Lord has sent to you all His servants the prophets , ( E ) rising early and sending them , but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear .
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	5	They said , ( F ) ‘ Repent now everyone of his evil way and his evil doings , and dwell in the land that the Lord has given to you and your fathers forever and ever .
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	6	Do not go after other gods to serve them and worship them , and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands ; and I will not harm you. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	7	Yet you have not listened to Me , ” says the Lord , “ that you might ( G ) provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt .
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	8	“ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts : ‘ Because you have not heard My words ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	9	behold , I will send and take ( H ) all the families of the north , ’ says the Lord , ‘ and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , ( I ) My servant , and will bring them against this land , against its inhabitants , and against these nations all around , and will utterly destroy them , and ( J ) make them an astonishment , a hissing , and perpetual desolations .
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	10	Moreover I will [ a ] take from them the ( K ) voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , ( L ) the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp .
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	11	And this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment , and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy ( M ) years .
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	12	‘ Then it will come to pass , ( N ) when [ b ] seventy years are completed , that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation , the land of the Chaldeans , for their iniquity , ’ says the Lord ; ( O ) ‘ and I will make it a perpetual desolation .
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	13	So I will bring on that land all My words which I have pronounced against it , all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah has prophesied concerning all the nations .

NKJV	Jeremiah	25	15	For thus says the Lord God of Israel to me : “ Take this ( T ) wine cup of [ c ] fury from My hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send you , to drink it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	16	And ( U ) they will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	17	Then I took the cup from the Lord ’ s hand , and made all the nations drink , to whom the Lord had sent me :
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	18	Jerusalem and the cities of Judah , its kings and its princes , to make them ( V ) a desolation , an astonishment , a hissing , and ( W ) a curse , as it is this day ;

NKJV	Jeremiah	25	26	( AH ) all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth . Also the king of [ d ] Sheshach shall drink after them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	27	“ Therefore you shall say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ( AI ) “ Drink , ( AJ ) be drunk , and vomit ! Fall and rise no more , because of the sword which I will send among you. ” ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	28	And it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink , then you shall say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts : “ You shall certainly drink !
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	29	For behold , ( AK ) I begin to bring calamity on the city ( AL ) which is called by My name , and should you be utterly unpunished ? You shall not be unpunished , for ( AM ) I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth , ” says the Lord of hosts. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	30	“ Therefore prophesy against them all these words , and say to them : ‘ The Lord will ( AN ) roar from on high , And utter His voice from ( AO ) His holy habitation ; He will roar mightily against ( AP ) His fold . He will give ( AQ ) a shout , as those who tread the grapes , Against all the inhabitants of the earth .
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	31	A noise will come to the ends of the earth— For the Lord has ( AR ) a controversy with the nations ; ( AS ) He will plead His case with all flesh . He will give those who are wicked to the sword , ’ says the Lord. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	25	32	Thus says the Lord of hosts : “ Behold , disaster shall go forth From nation to nation , And ( AT ) a great whirlwind shall be raised up From the farthest parts of the earth .

NKJV	Jeremiah	25	36	A voice of the cry of the shepherds , And a wailing of the leaders to the flock will be heard . For the Lord has plundered their pasture ,

NKJV	Jeremiah	26	26	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , this word came from the Lord , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	2	“ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Stand in ( B ) the court of the Lord ’ s house , and speak to all the cities of Judah , which come to worship in the Lord ’ s house , ( C ) all the words that I command you to speak to them . ( D ) Do not diminish a word .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	3	( E ) Perhaps everyone will listen and turn from his evil way , that I may ( F ) relent concerning the calamity which I purpose to bring on them because of the evil of their doings. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	4	And you shall say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( G ) “ If you will not listen to Me , to walk in My law which I have set before you ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	5	to heed the words of My servants the prophets ( H ) whom I sent to you , both rising up early and sending them ( but you have not heeded ) ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	6	then I will make this house like ( I ) Shiloh , and will make this city ( J ) a curse to all the nations of the earth. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	7	So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	8	Now it happened , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him , saying , “ You will surely die !
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	9	Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord , saying , ‘ This house shall be like Shiloh , and this city shall be ( K ) desolate , without an inhabitant ’ ? ” And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	10	When the princes of Judah heard these things , they came up from the king ’ s house to the house of the Lord and sat down in the entry of the New Gate of the Lord ’ s house .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	11	And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and all the people , saying , [ a ] “ This man deserves to ( L ) die ! For he has prophesied against this city , as you have heard with your ears. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	12	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people , saying : “ The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city with all the words that you have heard .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	13	Now therefore , ( M ) amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of the Lord your God ; then the Lord will relent concerning the doom that He has pronounced against you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	14	As for me , here ( N ) I am , in your hand ; do with me as seems good and [ b ] proper to you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	15	But know for certain that if you put me to death , you will surely bring innocent blood on yourselves , on this city , and on its inhabitants ; for truly the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	16	So the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets , “ This man does not deserve to die . For he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	17	( O ) Then certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people , saying :
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	18	( P ) “ Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah , and spoke to all the people of Judah , saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts : ( Q ) “ Zion shall be plowed like a field , Jerusalem shall become ( R ) heaps of ruins , And the mountain of the [ c ] temple Like the [ d ] bare hills of the forest. ” ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah ever put him to death ? ( S ) Did he not fear the Lord and ( T ) seek the Lord ’ s favor ? And the Lord ( U ) relented concerning the doom which He had pronounced against them . ( V ) But we are doing great evil against ourselves. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	20	Now there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord , Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath Jearim , who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	21	And when Jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when Urijah heard it , he was afraid and fled , and went to Egypt .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	22	Then Jehoiakim the king sent men to Egypt : Elnathan the son of Achbor , and other men who went with him to Egypt .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	23	And they brought Urijah from Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king , who killed him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the [ e ] common people .
NKJV	Jeremiah	26	24	Nevertheless ( W ) the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , so that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .

NKJV	Jeremiah	27	27	In [ a ] the beginning of the reign of [ b ] Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , ( A ) king of Judah , this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	2	“ Thus says the Lord to me : ‘ Make for yourselves bonds and yokes , ( B ) and put them on your neck ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	3	and send them to the king of Edom , the king of Moab , the king of the Ammonites , the king of Tyre , and the king of Sidon , by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	4	And command them to say to their masters , “ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel—thus you shall say to your masters :
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	5	( C ) ‘ I have made the earth , the man and the beast that are on the ground , by My great power and by My outstretched arm , and ( D ) have given it to whom it seemed proper to Me .
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	6	( E ) And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , ( F ) My servant ; and ( G ) the beasts of the field I have also given him to serve him .
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	7	( H ) So all nations shall serve him and his son and his son ’ s son , ( I ) until the time of his land comes ; ( J ) and then many nations and great kings shall make him serve them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	8	And it shall be , that the nation and kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon , that nation I will punish , ’ says the Lord , ‘ with the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , until I have consumed them by his hand .
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	9	Therefore do not listen to your prophets , your diviners , your [ c ] dreamers , your soothsayers , or your sorcerers , who speak to you , saying , “ You shall not serve the king of Babylon. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	10	For they prophesy a ( K ) lie to you , to remove you far from your land ; and I will drive you out , and you will perish .
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	11	But the nations that bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him , I will let them remain in their own land , ’ says the Lord , ‘ and they shall till it and dwell in it. ’ ” ’ ”

NKJV	Jeremiah	27	13	( M ) Why will you die , you and your people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , as the Lord has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	14	Therefore ( N ) do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you , saying , ‘ You shall not serve the king of Babylon , ’ for they prophesy ( O ) a lie to you ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	15	for I have ( P ) not sent them , ” says the Lord , “ yet they prophesy a lie in My name , that I may drive you out , and that you may perish , you and the prophets who prophesy to you. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	16	Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people , saying , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you , saying , “ Behold , ( Q ) the vessels of the Lord ’ s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon ” ; for they prophesy a lie to you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	17	Do not listen to them ; serve the king of Babylon , and live ! Why should this city be laid waste ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	18	But if they are prophets , and if the word of the Lord is with them , let them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts , that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord , in the house of the king of Judah , and at Jerusalem , do not go to Babylon. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	19	“ For thus says the Lord of hosts ( R ) concerning the pillars , concerning the Sea , concerning the carts , and concerning the remainder of the vessels that remain in this city ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take , when he carried away ( S ) captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , from Jerusalem to Babylon , and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	21	yes , thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the ( T ) vessels that remain in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem :
NKJV	Jeremiah	27	22	‘ They shall be ( U ) carried to Babylon , and there they shall be until the day that I ( V ) visit them , ’ says the Lord . ‘ Then ( W ) I will bring them up and restore them to this place. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 27:1 LXX omits v.

NKJV	Jeremiah	28	3	( E ) Within two full years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the Lord ’ s house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ( F ) took away from this place and carried to Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	4	And I will bring back to this place [ a ] Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah who went to Babylon , ’ says the Lord , ‘ for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	5	Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of the Lord ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	6	and the prophet Jeremiah said , ( G ) “ Amen ! The Lord do so ; the Lord perform your words which you have prophesied , to bring back the vessels of the Lord ’ s house and all who were carried away captive , from Babylon to this place .
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	7	Nevertheless hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people :
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	8	The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms—of war and disaster and pestilence .
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	9	As for ( H ) the prophet who prophesies of ( I ) peace , when the word of the prophet comes to pass , the prophet will be known as one whom the Lord has truly sent. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the ( J ) yoke off the prophet Jeremiah ’ s neck and broke it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	11	And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people , saying , “ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ( K ) from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. ’ ” And the prophet Jeremiah went his way .
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	12	Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	13	“ Go and tell Hananiah , saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ You have broken the yokes of wood , but you have made in their place yokes of iron. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	14	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ( L ) “ I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations , that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ; and they shall serve him . ( M ) I have given him the beasts of the field also. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	15	Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet , “ Hear now , Hananiah , the Lord has not sent you , but ( N ) you make this people trust in a ( O ) lie .
NKJV	Jeremiah	28	16	Therefore thus says the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will cast you from the face of the earth . This year you shall ( P ) die , because you have taught ( Q ) rebellion against the Lord. ’ ”

NKJV	Jeremiah	29	3	The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of ( D ) Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon , to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	4	Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , to all who were carried away captive , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon :
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	5	Build houses and dwell in them ; plant gardens and eat their fruit .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	6	Take wives and beget sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands , so that they may bear sons and daughters—that you may be increased there , and not diminished .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	7	And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive , ( E ) and pray to the Lord for it ; for in its peace you will have peace .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	8	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are in your midst ( F ) deceive you , nor listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	9	For they prophesy ( G ) falsely to you in My name ; I have not sent them , says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	10	For thus says the Lord : After ( H ) seventy years are completed at Babylon , I will visit you and perform My good word toward you , and cause you to ( I ) return to this place .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	11	For I know the thoughts that I think toward you , says the Lord , thoughts of peace and not of evil , to give you a future and a hope .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	12	Then you will ( J ) call upon Me and go and pray to Me , and I will ( K ) listen to you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	13	And ( L ) you will seek Me and find Me , when you search for Me ( M ) with all your heart .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	14	( N ) I will be found by you , says the Lord , and I will bring you back from your captivity ; ( O ) I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you , says the Lord , and I will bring you to the place from which I cause you to be carried away captive .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	15	Because you have said , “ The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon ” —
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	16	( P ) therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king who sits on the throne of David , concerning all the people who dwell in this city , and concerning your brethren who have not gone out with you into captivity—
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	17	thus says the Lord of hosts : Behold , I will send on them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like ( Q ) rotten figs that can not be eaten , they are so bad .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	18	And I will pursue them with the sword , with famine , and with pestilence ; and I ( R ) will deliver them to trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth—to be ( S ) a curse , an astonishment , a hissing , and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	19	because they have not heeded My words , says the Lord , which ( T ) I sent to them by My servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ; neither would you heed , says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	20	Therefore hear the word of the Lord , all you of the captivity , whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	21	Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah , and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah , who prophesy a ( U ) lie to you in My name : Behold , I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he shall slay them before your eyes .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	22	( V ) And because of them a curse shall be taken up by all the captivity of Judah who are in Babylon , saying , “ The Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab , ( W ) whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire ” ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	23	because ( X ) they have done disgraceful things in Israel , have committed adultery with their neighbors ’ wives , and have spoken lying words in My name , which I have not commanded them . Indeed I ( Y ) know , and am a witness , says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	24	You shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	25	Thus speaks the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying : You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are at Jerusalem , ( Z ) to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	26	“ The Lord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest , so that there should be ( AA ) officers in the house of the Lord over every man who is ( AB ) demented and considers himself a prophet , that you should ( AC ) put him in prison and in the stocks .
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	27	Now therefore , why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who makes himself a prophet to you ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	28	For he has sent to us in Babylon , saying , ‘ This captivity is long ; build houses and dwell in them , and plant gardens and eat their fruit. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	30	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , saying :
NKJV	Jeremiah	29	31	Send to all those in captivity , saying , Thus says the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite : Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you , ( AD ) and I have not sent him , and he has caused you to trust in a ( AE ) lie—

NKJV	Jeremiah	30	30	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	2	“ Thus speaks the Lord God of Israel , saying : ‘ Write in a book for yourself all the words that I have spoken to you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	3	For behold , the days are coming , ’ says the Lord , ‘ that ( A ) I will bring back from captivity My people Israel and Judah , ’ says the Lord . ( B ) ‘ And I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers , and they shall possess it. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	4	Now these are the words that the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	5	“ For thus says the Lord : ‘ We have heard a voice of trembling , Of [ a ] fear , and not of peace .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	6	Ask now , and see , Whether a [ b ] man is ever in [ c ] labor with child ? So why do I see every man with his hands on his loins ( C ) Like a woman in labor , And all faces turned pale ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	7	( D ) Alas ! For that day is great , ( E ) So that none is like it ; And it is the time of Jacob ’ s trouble , But he shall be saved out of it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	8	‘ For it shall come to pass in that day , ’ Says the Lord of hosts , ‘ That I will break his yoke from your neck , And will burst your bonds ; Foreigners shall no more enslave them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	9	But they shall serve the Lord their God , And ( F ) David their king , Whom I will ( G ) raise up for them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	10	‘ Therefore ( H ) do not fear , O My servant Jacob , ’ says the Lord , ‘ Nor be dismayed , O Israel ; For behold , I will save you from afar , And your seed ( I ) from the land of their captivity . Jacob shall return , have rest and be quiet , And no one shall make him afraid .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	11	For I am with ( J ) you , ’ says the Lord , ‘ to save you ; ( K ) Though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered you , ( L ) Yet I will not make a complete end of you . But I will correct you ( M ) in justice , And will not let you go altogether unpunished. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	12	“ For thus says the Lord : ( N ) ‘ Your affliction is incurable , Your wound is severe .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	13	There is no one to plead your cause , That you may be bound up ; ( O ) You have no healing medicines .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	14	( P ) All your lovers have forgotten you ; They do not seek you ; For I have wounded you with the wound ( Q ) of an enemy , With the chastisement ( R ) of a cruel one , For the multitude of your iniquities , ( S ) Because your sins have increased .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	15	Why ( T ) do you cry about your affliction ? Your sorrow is incurable . Because of the multitude of your iniquities , Because your sins have increased , I have done these things to you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	16	‘ Therefore all those who devour you ( U ) shall be devoured ; And all your adversaries , every one of them , shall go into ( V ) captivity ; Those who plunder you shall become ( W ) plunder , And all who prey upon you I will make a ( X ) prey .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	17	( Y ) For I will restore health to you And heal you of your wounds , ’ says the Lord , ‘ Because they called you an outcast saying : “ This is Zion ; No one seeks her. ” ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	18	“ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will bring back the captivity of Jacob ’ s tents , And ( Z ) have mercy on his dwelling places ; The city shall be built upon its own [ d ] mound , And the palace shall remain according to its own plan .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	19	Then ( AA ) out of them shall proceed thanksgiving And the voice of those who make merry ; ( AB ) I will multiply them , and they shall not diminish ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	20	Their children also shall be ( AC ) as before , And their congregation shall be established before Me ; And I will punish all who oppress them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	21	Their nobles shall be from among them , ( AD ) And their governor shall come from their midst ; Then I will ( AE ) cause him to draw near , And he shall approach Me ; For who is this who pledged his heart to approach Me ? ’ says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	22	‘ You shall be ( AF ) My people , And I will be your God. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	23	Behold , the ( AG ) whirlwind of the Lord Goes forth with fury , A [ e ] continuing whirlwind ; It will fall violently on the head of the wicked .
NKJV	Jeremiah	30	24	The fierce anger of the Lord will not return until He has done it , And until He has performed the intents of His heart . ( AH ) In the latter days you will consider it .

NKJV	Jeremiah	31	31	“ Behold , the ( AW ) days are coming , says the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah—
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	2	Thus says the Lord : “ The people who survived the sword Found grace in the wilderness— Israel , when ( C ) I went to give him rest. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	3	The Lord has appeared [ a ] of old to me , saying : “ Yes , ( D ) I have loved you with ( E ) an everlasting love ; Therefore with lovingkindness I have ( F ) drawn you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	4	Again ( G ) I will build you , and you shall be rebuilt , O virgin of Israel ! You shall again be adorned with your ( H ) tambourines , And shall go forth in the dances of those who rejoice .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	5	( I ) You shall yet plant vines on the mountains of Samaria ; The planters shall plant and [ b ] eat them as ordinary food .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	6	For there shall be a day When the watchmen will cry on Mount Ephraim , ( J ) ‘ Arise , and let us go up to Zion , To the Lord our God. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	7	For thus says the Lord : ( K ) “ Sing with gladness for Jacob , And shout among the chief of the nations ; Proclaim , give praise , and say , ‘ O Lord , save Your people , The remnant of Israel ! ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	8	Behold , I will bring them ( L ) from the north country , And ( M ) gather them from the ends of the earth , Among them the blind and the lame , The woman with child And the one who labors with child , together ; A great throng shall return there .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	9	( N ) They shall come with weeping , And with supplications I will lead them . I will cause them to walk ( O ) by the rivers of waters , In a straight way in which they shall not stumble ; For I am a Father to Israel , And Ephraim is My ( P ) firstborn .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	10	“ Hear the word of the Lord , O nations , And declare it in the [ c ] isles afar off , and say , ‘ He who scattered Israel ( Q ) will gather him , And keep him as a shepherd does his flock. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	11	For ( R ) the Lord has redeemed Jacob , And ransomed him ( S ) from the hand of one stronger than he .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	12	Therefore they shall come and sing in ( T ) the height of Zion , Streaming to ( U ) the goodness of the Lord— For wheat and new wine and oil , For the young of the flock and the herd ; Their souls shall be like a ( V ) well-watered garden , ( W ) And they shall sorrow no more at all .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	13	“ Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , And the young men and the old , together ; For I will turn their mourning to joy , Will comfort them , And make them rejoice rather than sorrow .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	14	I will [ d ] satiate the soul of the priests with abundance , And My people shall be satisfied with My goodness , says the Lord. ” Mercy on Ephraim
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	15	Thus says the Lord : ( X ) “ A voice was heard in ( Y ) Ramah , Lamentation and bitter ( Z ) weeping , Rachel weeping for her children , Refusing to be comforted for her children , Because ( AA ) they are no more. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	16	Thus says the Lord : “ Refrain your voice from ( AB ) weeping , And your eyes from tears ; For your work shall be rewarded , says the Lord , And they shall come back from the land of the enemy .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	17	There is ( AC ) hope in your future , says the Lord , That your children shall come back to their own border .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	18	“ I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself : ‘ You have ( AD ) chastised me , and I was chastised , Like an untrained bull ; ( AE ) Restore me , and I will return , For You are the Lord my God .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	19	Surely , ( AF ) after my turning , I repented ; And after I was instructed , I struck myself on the thigh ; I was ( AG ) ashamed , yes , even humiliated , Because I bore the reproach of my youth. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	20	Is Ephraim My dear son ? Is he a pleasant child ? For though I spoke against him , I earnestly remember him still ; ( AH ) Therefore My [ e ] heart yearns for him ; ( AI ) I will surely have mercy on him , says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	21	“ Set up signposts , Make landmarks ; ( AJ ) Set your heart toward the highway , The way in which you went . [ f ] Turn back , O virgin of Israel , Turn back to these your cities .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	22	How long will you ( AK ) gad about , O you ( AL ) backsliding daughter ? For the Lord has created a new thing in the earth— A woman shall encompass a man. ” Future Prosperity of Judah
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	23	Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ They shall again use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities , when I bring back their captivity : ( AM ) ‘ The Lord bless you , O home of justice , and ( AN ) mountain of holiness ! ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	24	And there shall dwell in Judah itself , and ( AO ) in all its cities together , farmers and those going out with flocks .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	25	For I have [ g ] satiated the weary soul , and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	26	After this I awoke and looked around , and my sleep was ( AP ) sweet to me .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	27	“ Behold , the days are coming , says the Lord , that ( AQ ) I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	28	And it shall come to pass , that as I have ( AR ) watched over them ( AS ) to pluck up , to break down , to throw down , to destroy , and to afflict , so I will watch over them ( AT ) to build and to plant , says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	29	( AU ) In those days they shall say no more : ‘ The fathers have eaten sour grapes , And the children ’ s teeth are set on edge. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	30	( AV ) But every one shall die for his own iniquity ; every man who eats the sour grapes , his teeth shall be set on edge . A New Covenant
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	32	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that ( AX ) I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt , My covenant which they broke , [ h ] though I was a husband to them , says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	33	( AY ) But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says the Lord : ( AZ ) I will put My law in their minds , and write it on their [ i ] hearts ; ( BA ) and I will be their God , and they shall be My people .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	34	No more shall every man teach his neighbor , and every man his brother , saying , ‘ Know the Lord , ’ for ( BB ) they all shall know Me , from the least of them to the greatest of them , says the Lord . For ( BC ) I will forgive their iniquity , and their sin I will remember no more. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	35	Thus says the Lord , ( BD ) Who gives the sun for a light by day , The ordinances of the moon and the stars for a light by night , Who disturbs ( BE ) the sea , And its waves roar ( BF ) ( The Lord of hosts is His name ) :
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	36	“ If ( BG ) those ordinances depart From before Me , says the Lord , Then the seed of Israel shall also cease From being a nation before Me forever. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	37	Thus says the Lord : ( BH ) “ If heaven above can be measured , And the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also ( BI ) cast off all the seed of Israel For all that they have done , says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	38	“ Behold , the days are coming , says the Lord , that the city shall be built for the Lord ( BJ ) from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	39	( BK ) The surveyor ’ s line shall again extend straight forward over the hill Gareb ; then it shall turn toward Goath .
NKJV	Jeremiah	31	40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes , and all the fields as far as the Brook Kidron , ( BL ) to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east , ( BM ) shall be holy to the Lord .

NKJV	Jeremiah	32	32	because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah , which they have done to provoke Me to anger— ( AH ) they , their kings , their princes , their priests , ( AI ) their prophets , the men of Judah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	2	For then the king of Babylon ’ s army besieged Jerusalem , and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up ( B ) in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Judah ’ s house .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up , saying , “ Why do you ( C ) prophesy and say , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( D ) “ Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	4	and Zedekiah king of Judah ( E ) shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him [ a ] face to face , and see him ( F ) eye to eye ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	5	then he shall ( G ) lead Zedekiah to Babylon , and there he shall be ( H ) until I visit him , ” says the Lord ; ( I ) “ though you fight with the Chaldeans , you shall not succeed ” ’ ? ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	6	And Jeremiah said , “ The word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	7	‘ Behold , Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you , saying , “ Buy my field which is in Anathoth , for the ( J ) right of redemption is yours to buy it. ” ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	8	Then Hanamel my uncle ’ s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord , and said to me , ‘ Please buy my field that is in Anathoth , which is in the country of Benjamin ; for the right of inheritance is yours , and the redemption yours ; buy it for yourself. ’ Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	9	So I bought the field from Hanamel , the son of my uncle who was in Anathoth , and ( K ) weighed out to him the money—seventeen shekels of silver .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	10	And I signed the [ b ] deed and sealed it , took witnesses , and weighed the money on the scales .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	11	So I took the purchase deed , both that which was sealed according to the law and custom , and that which was open ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	12	and I gave the purchase deed to ( L ) Baruch the son of Neriah , son of Mahseiah , in the presence of Hanamel my uncle ’ s son , and in the presence of the ( M ) witnesses who signed the purchase deed , before all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	13	“ Then I charged ( N ) Baruch before them , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	14	‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Take these deeds , both this purchase deed which is sealed and this deed which is open , and put them in an earthen vessel , that they may last many days. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	15	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Houses and fields and vineyards shall be ( O ) possessed again in this land. ” ’ Jeremiah Prays for Understanding
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	16	“ Now when I had delivered the purchase deed to Baruch the son of Neriah , I prayed to the Lord , saying :
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	17	‘ Ah , Lord God ! Behold , ( P ) You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm . ( Q ) There is nothing too [ c ] hard for You .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	18	You show ( R ) lovingkindness to thousands , and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them—the Great , ( S ) the Mighty God , whose name is ( T ) the Lord of hosts .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	19	You are ( U ) great in counsel and mighty in [ d ] work , for Your ( V ) eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men , ( W ) to give everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	20	You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , to this day , and in Israel and among other men ; and You have made Yourself ( X ) a name , as it is this day .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	21	You ( Y ) have brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders , with a strong hand and an outstretched arm , and with great terror ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	22	You have given them this land , of which You swore to their fathers to give them— ( Z ) “ a land flowing with milk and honey. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	23	And they came in and took possession of it , but ( AA ) they have not obeyed Your voice or walked in Your law . They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do ; therefore You have caused all this calamity to come upon them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	24	‘ Look , the siege mounds ! They have come to the city to take it ; and the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it , because of ( AB ) the sword and famine and pestilence . What You have spoken has happened ; there You see it !
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	25	And You have said to me , O Lord God , “ Buy the field for money , and take witnesses ” ! —yet the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans. ’ ” God ’ s Assurance of the People ’ s Return
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	26	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	27	“ Behold , I am the Lord , the ( AC ) God of all flesh . Is there anything too hard for Me ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	28	Therefore thus says the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	29	And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and ( AD ) set fire to this city and burn it , with the houses ( AE ) on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods , to provoke Me to anger ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	30	because the children of Israel and the children of Judah ( AF ) have done only evil before Me from their youth . For the children of Israel have provoked Me only to anger with the work of their hands , ’ says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	31	‘ For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My fury from the day that they built it , even to this day ; ( AG ) so I will remove it from before My face
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	33	And they have turned to Me the ( AJ ) back , and not the face ; though I taught them , ( AK ) rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not listened to receive instruction .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	34	But they ( AL ) set their abominations in [ e ] the house which is called by My name , to defile it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	35	And they built the high places of Baal which are in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , to ( AM ) cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to ( AN ) Molech , ( AO ) which I did not command them , nor did it come into My mind that they should do this abomination , to cause Judah to sin. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	36	“ Now therefore , thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , concerning this city of which you say , ‘ It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence :
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	37	Behold , I will ( AP ) gather them out of all countries where I have driven them in My anger , in My fury , and in great wrath ; I will bring them back to this place , and I will cause them ( AQ ) to dwell safely .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	38	They shall be ( AR ) My people , and I will be their God ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	39	then I will ( AS ) give them one heart and one way , that they may fear Me forever , for the good of them and their children after them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	40	And ( AT ) I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not turn away from doing them good ; but ( AU ) I will put My fear in their hearts so that they will not depart from Me .
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	41	Yes , ( AV ) I will rejoice over them to do them good , and ( AW ) I will [ f ] assuredly plant them in this land , with all My heart and with all My soul. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	32	42	“ For thus says the Lord : ( AX ) ‘ Just as I have brought all this great calamity on this people , so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them .

NKJV	Jeremiah	34	5	You shall die in peace ; as in ( G ) the ceremonies of your fathers , the former kings who were before you , ( H ) so they shall burn incense for you and ( I ) lament for you , saying , “ Alas , lord ! ” For I have pronounced the word , says the Lord. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	7	when the king of Babylon ’ s army fought against Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish and Azekah ; for only ( J ) these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah . Treacherous Treatment of Slaves
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	8	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem to proclaim ( K ) liberty to them :
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	9	( L ) that every man should set free his male and female slave—a Hebrew man or woman— ( M ) that no one should keep a Jewish brother in bondage .
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	10	Now when all the princes and all the people , who had entered into the covenant , heard that everyone should set free his male and female slaves , that no one should keep them in bondage anymore , they obeyed and let them go .
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	11	But afterward they changed their minds and made the male and female slaves return , whom they had set free , and brought them into subjection as male and female slaves .
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	12	Therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	13	“ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : ‘ I made a ( N ) covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	14	“ At the end of ( O ) seven years let every man set free his Hebrew brother , who [ b ] has been sold to him ; and when he has served you six years , you shall let him go free from you. ” But your fathers did not obey Me nor incline their ear .
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	15	Then you [ c ] recently turned and did what was right in My sight—every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor ; and you ( P ) made a covenant before Me ( Q ) in the house which is called by My name .
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	16	Then you turned around and ( R ) profaned My name , and every one of you brought back his male and female slaves , whom you had set at liberty , at their pleasure , and brought them back into subjection , to be your male and female slaves. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	17	“ Therefore thus says the Lord : ‘ You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming liberty , every one to his brother and every one to his neighbor . ( S ) Behold , I proclaim liberty to you , ’ says the Lord— ( T ) ‘ to the sword , to pestilence , and to famine ! And I will deliver you to ( U ) trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth .
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	18	And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant , who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me , when ( V ) they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts of it—
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	19	the princes of Judah , the princes of Jerusalem , the [ d ] eunuchs , the priests , and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf—
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	20	I will ( W ) give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life . Their ( X ) dead bodies shall be for meat for the birds of the heaven and the beasts of the earth .
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	21	And I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hand of their enemies , into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon ’ s army ( Y ) which has gone back from you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	34	22	( Z ) Behold , I will command , ’ says the Lord , ‘ and cause them to return to this city . They will fight against it ( AA ) and take it and burn it with fire ; and ( AB ) I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 34:3 Lit . mouth to mouth - Jeremiah 34:14 Or sold himself - Jeremiah 34:15 Lit . today - Jeremiah 34:19 Or officers Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Jeremiah	35	35	The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	2	“ Go to the house of the ( A ) Rechabites , speak to them , and bring them into the house of the Lord , into one of ( B ) the chambers , and give them wine to drink. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	3	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , his brothers and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	4	and I brought them into the house of the Lord , into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah , a man of God , which was by the chamber of the princes , above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum , ( C ) the keeper of the [ a ] door .
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	5	Then I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine , and cups ; and I said to them , “ Drink wine. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	6	But they said , “ We will drink no wine , for ( D ) Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , commanded us , saying , ‘ You shall drink ( E ) no wine , you nor your sons , forever .
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	7	You shall not build a house , sow seed , plant a vineyard , nor have any of these ; but all your days you shall dwell in tents , ( F ) that you may live many days in the land where you are sojourners. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	8	Thus we have ( G ) obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , in all that he charged us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , or our daughters ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	9	nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in ; nor do we have vineyard , field , or seed .
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	10	But we have dwelt in tents , and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us .
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	11	But it came to pass , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , ‘ Come , let us ( H ) go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians. ’ So we dwell at Jerusalem. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	12	Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	13	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , “ Will you not ( I ) receive instruction to [ b ] obey My words ? ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	14	“ The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab , which he commanded his sons , not to drink wine , are performed ; for to this day they drink none , and obey their father ’ s commandment . ( J ) But although I have spoken to you , ( K ) rising early and speaking , you did not [ c ] obey Me .
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	15	I have also sent to you all My ( L ) servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them , saying , ( M ) ‘ Turn now everyone from his evil way , amend your doings , and do not go after other gods to serve them ; then you will ( N ) dwell in the land which I have given you and your fathers. ’ But you have not inclined your ear , nor obeyed Me .
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	16	Surely the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their ( O ) father , which he commanded them , but this people has not obeyed Me. ” ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	17	“ Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ Behold , I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the doom that I have pronounced against them ; ( P ) because I have spoken to them but they have not heard , and I have called to them but they have not answered. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	18	And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites , “ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father , and kept all his precepts and done according to all that he commanded you ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	35	19	therefore thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to ( Q ) stand before Me forever. ” ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 35:4 Lit . threshold - Jeremiah 35:13 listen to - Jeremiah 35:14 listen to Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Jeremiah	36	36	Now it came to pass in the ( A ) fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , that this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying :
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	2	“ Take a ( B ) scroll of a book and ( C ) write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel , against Judah , and against ( D ) all the nations , from the day I spoke to you , from the days of ( E ) Josiah even to this day .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	3	It ( F ) may be that the house of Judah will hear all the adversities which I purpose to bring upon them , that everyone may ( G ) turn from his evil way , that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	4	Then Jeremiah ( H ) called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and ( I ) Baruch wrote on a scroll of a book , [ a ] at the instruction of Jeremiah , all the words of the Lord which He had spoken to him .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	5	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch , saying , “ I am confined , I can not go into the house of the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	6	You go , therefore , and read from the scroll which you have written [ b ] at my instruction , the words of the Lord , in the hearing of the people in the Lord ’ s house on ( J ) the day of fasting . And you shall also read them in the hearing of all Judah who come from their cities .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	7	It may be that they will present their supplication before the Lord , and everyone will turn from his evil way . For great is the anger and the fury that the Lord has pronounced against this people. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	8	And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him , reading from the book the words of the Lord in the Lord ’ s house .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	9	Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , in the ninth month , that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem , and to all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	10	Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe , in the upper court at the ( K ) entry of the New Gate of the Lord ’ s house , in the [ c ] hearing of all the people . The Scroll Read in the Palace
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	11	When Michaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , heard all the words of the Lord from the book ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	12	he then went down to the king ’ s house , into the scribe ’ s chamber ; and there all the princes were sitting— ( L ) Elishama the scribe , Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , ( M ) Elnathan the son of Achbor , Gemariah the son of Shaphan , Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the princes .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	13	Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the hearing of the people .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Cushi , to Baruch , saying , “ Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read in the hearing of the people , and come. ” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	15	And they said to him , “ Sit down now , and read it in our hearing. ” So Baruch read it in their hearing .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	16	Now it happened , when they had heard all the words , that they looked in fear from one to another , and said to Baruch , “ We will surely tell the king of all these words. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	17	And they asked Baruch , saying , “ Tell us now , how did you write all these words— [ d ] at his instruction ? ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	18	So Baruch answered them , “ He proclaimed with his mouth all these words to me , and I wrote them with ink in the book. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	19	Then the princes said to Baruch , “ Go and hide , you and Jeremiah ; and let no one know where you are. ” The King Destroys Jeremiah ’ s Scroll
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	20	And they went to the king , into the court ; but they stored the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe , and told all the words in the hearing of the king .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	21	So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll , and he took it from Elishama the scribe ’ s chamber . And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	22	Now the king was sitting in ( N ) the winter house in the ninth month , with a fire burning on the hearth before him .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	23	And it happened , when Jehudi had read three or four columns , that the king cut it with the scribe ’ s knife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth , until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	24	Yet they were ( O ) not afraid , nor did they ( P ) tear their garments , the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	25	Nevertheless Elnathan , Delaiah , and Gemariah implored the king not to burn the scroll ; but he would not listen to them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel [ e ] the king ’ s son , Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet , but the Lord hid them . Jeremiah Rewrites the Scroll
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	27	Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch had written [ f ] at the instruction of Jeremiah , the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , saying :
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	28	“ Take yet another scroll , and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	29	And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ You have burned this scroll , saying , ( Q ) ‘ Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land , and cause man and beast to ( R ) cease from here ? ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	30	Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah : ( S ) “ He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David , and his dead body shall be ( T ) cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night .
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	31	I will punish him , his [ g ] family , and his servants for their iniquity ; and I will bring on them , on the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and on the men of Judah all the doom that I have pronounced against them ; but they did not heed. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	36	32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe , the son of Neriah , who wrote on it [ h ] at the instruction of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire . And besides , there were added to them many similar words .

NKJV	Jeremiah	37	37	Now King ( B ) Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	2	( C ) But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land gave heed to the words of the Lord which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	3	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah , and ( D ) Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah , the priest , to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , ( E ) “ Pray now to the Lord our God for us. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	4	Now Jeremiah was coming and going among the people , for they had not yet put him in prison .
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	5	Then ( F ) Pharaoh ’ s army came up from Egypt ; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them , they departed from Jerusalem .
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	6	Then the word of the Lord came to the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	7	“ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , ‘ Thus you shall say to the king of Judah , ( G ) who sent you to Me to inquire of Me : “ Behold , Pharaoh ’ s army which has come up to help you will return to Egypt , to their own land .
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	8	( H ) And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city , and take it and burn it with fire. ” ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	9	Thus says the Lord : ‘ Do not deceive yourselves , saying , “ The Chaldeans will surely depart from us , ” for they will not depart .
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	10	( I ) For though you had defeated the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you , and there remained only wounded men among them , they would rise up , every man in his tent , and burn the city with fire. ’ ” Jeremiah Imprisoned
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	11	And it happened , when the army of the Chaldeans left the siege of Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh ’ s army ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	12	that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to claim his property there among the people .
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	13	And when he was in the Gate of Benjamin , a captain of the guard was there whose name was Irijah the son of Shelemiah , the son of Hananiah ; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet , saying , “ You are defecting to the Chaldeans ! ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	14	Then Jeremiah said , [ a ] “ False ! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans. ” But he did not listen to him . So Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes .
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	15	Therefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah , and they struck him ( J ) and put him in prison in the ( K ) house of Jonathan the scribe . For they had made that the prison .
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	16	When Jeremiah entered ( L ) the dungeon and the cells , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	17	then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out . The king asked him secretly in his house , and said , “ Is there any word from the Lord ? ” And Jeremiah said , “ There is. ” Then he said , “ You shall be ( M ) delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon ! ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	18	Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah , “ What offense have I committed against you , against your servants , or against this people , that you have put me in prison ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	19	Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you , saying , ‘ The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land ’ ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	20	Therefore please hear now , O my lord the king . Please , let my petition be accepted before you , and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	37	21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah ( N ) to the court of the prison , and that they should give him daily a piece of bread from the bakers ’ street , ( O ) until all the bread in the city was gone . Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison . Footnotes - Jeremiah 37:14 a lie Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Jeremiah	38	38	Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan , Gedaliah the son of Pashhur , ( A ) Jucal [ a ] the son of Shelemiah , and ( B ) Pashhur the son of Malchiah ( C ) heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	2	“ Thus says the Lord : ( D ) ‘ He who remains in this city shall die by the sword , by famine , and by pestilence ; but he who goes over to the Chaldeans shall live ; his life shall be as a prize to him , and he shall live. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	3	Thus says the Lord : ( E ) ‘ This city shall surely be ( F ) given into the hand of the king of Babylon ’ s army , which shall take it. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	4	Therefore the princes said to the king , “ Please , ( G ) let this man be put to death , for thus he [ b ] weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city , and the hands of all the people , by speaking such words to them . For this man does not seek the [ c ] welfare of this people , but their harm. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	5	Then Zedekiah the king said , “ Look , he is in your hand . For the king can do nothing against you. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	6	( H ) So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah [ d ] the king ’ s son , which was in the court of the prison , and they let Jeremiah down with ropes . And in the dungeon there was no water , but mire . So Jeremiah sank in the mire .
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	7	( I ) Now Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian , one of the [ e ] eunuchs , who was in the king ’ s house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon . When the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	8	Ebed-Melech went out of the king ’ s house and spoke to the king , saying :
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	9	“ My lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon , and he is likely to die from hunger in the place where he is . For there is ( J ) no more bread in the city. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	10	Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian , saying , “ Take from here thirty men with you , and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	11	So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took from there old clothes and old rags , and let them down by ropes into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	12	Then Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah , “ Please put these old clothes and rags under your armpits , under the ropes. ” And Jeremiah did so .
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	13	So they pulled Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the dungeon . And Jeremiah remained ( K ) in the court of the prison . Zedekiah ’ s Fears and Jeremiah ’ s Advice
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	14	Then Zedekiah the king sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance of the house of the Lord . And the king said to Jeremiah , “ I will ( L ) ask you something . Hide nothing from me. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ If I declare it to you , will you not surely put me to death ? And if I give you advice , you will not listen to me. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	16	So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah , saying , “ As the Lord lives , ( M ) who made our very souls , I will not put you to death , nor will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ If you surely ( N ) surrender [ f ] ( O ) to the king of Babylon ’ s princes , then your soul shall live ; this city shall not be burned with fire , and you and your house shall live .
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	18	But if you do not [ g ] surrender to the king of Babylon ’ s princes , then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans ; they shall burn it with fire , and ( P ) you shall not escape from their hand. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	19	And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah , “ I am afraid of the Jews who have ( Q ) defected to the Chaldeans , lest they deliver me into their hand , and they ( R ) abuse me. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	20	But Jeremiah said , “ They shall not deliver you . Please , obey the voice of the Lord which I speak to you . So it shall be ( S ) well with you , and your soul shall live .
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	21	But if you refuse to [ h ] surrender , this is the word that the Lord has shown me :
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	22	‘ Now behold , all the ( T ) women who are left in the king of Judah ’ s house shall be surrendered to the king of Babylon ’ s princes , and those women shall say : “ Your close friends have [ i ] set upon you And prevailed against you ; Your feet have sunk in the mire , And they have [ j ] turned away again. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	23	‘ So they shall surrender all your wives and ( U ) children to the Chaldeans . ( V ) You shall not escape from their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon . And you shall cause this city to be burned with fire. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ Let no one know of these words , and you shall not die .
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with you , and they come to you and say to you , ‘ Declare to us now what you have said to the king , and also what the king said to you ; do not hide it from us , and we will not put you to death , ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	26	then you shall say to them , ( W ) ‘ I presented my request before the king , that he would not make me return ( X ) to Jonathan ’ s house to die there. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	27	Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him . And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . So they stopped speaking with him , for the conversation had not been heard .
NKJV	Jeremiah	38	28	Now ( Y ) Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken . And he was there when Jerusalem was taken .

NKJV	Jeremiah	39	39	In the ( B ) ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem , and besieged it .
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	2	In the ( C ) eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , on the ninth day of the month , the [ a ] city was penetrated .
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	3	( D ) Then all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate : Nergal-Sharezer , Samgar-Nebo , Sarsechim , [ b ] Rabsaris , Nergal-Sarezer , [ c ] Rabmag , with the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	4	( E ) So it was , when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them , that they fled and went out of the city by night , by way of the king ’ s garden , by the gate between the two walls . And he went out by way of the [ d ] plain .
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	5	But the Chaldean army pursued them and ( F ) overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho . And when they had captured him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , to ( G ) Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he pronounced judgment on him .
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	6	Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his ( H ) eyes in Riblah ; the king of Babylon also killed all the ( I ) nobles of Judah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	7	Moreover ( J ) he put out Zedekiah ’ s eyes , and bound him with bronze [ e ] fetters to carry him off to Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	8	( K ) And the Chaldeans burned the king ’ s house and the houses of the people with ( L ) fire , and broke down the ( M ) walls of Jerusalem .
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	9	( N ) Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people who remained in the city and those who ( O ) defected to him , with the rest of the people who remained .
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	10	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah the ( P ) poor people , who had nothing , and gave them vineyards and fields [ f ] at the same time . Jeremiah Goes Free
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	11	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , saying ,

NKJV	Jeremiah	39	14	then they sent someone ( R ) to take Jeremiah from the court of the prison , and committed him ( S ) to Gedaliah the son of ( T ) Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , that he should take him home . So he dwelt among the people .
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	15	Meanwhile the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	39	16	“ Go and speak to ( U ) Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian , saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Behold , ( V ) I will bring My words upon this city for adversity and not for good , and they shall be performed in that day before you .

NKJV	Jeremiah	40	3	Now the Lord has brought it , and has done just as He said . ( D ) Because you people have sinned against the Lord , and not obeyed His voice , therefore this thing has come upon you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	4	And now look , I free you this day from the chains that [ a ] were on your hand . ( E ) If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon , come , and I will look after you . But if it seems wrong for you to come with me to Babylon , remain here . See , ( F ) all the land is before you ; wherever it seems good and convenient for you to go , go there. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	5	Now while Jeremiah had not yet gone back , Nebuzaradan said , “ Go back to ( G ) Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , ( H ) whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah , and dwell with him among the people . Or go wherever it seems convenient for you to go. ” So the captain of the guard gave him rations and a gift and let him go .
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	6	( I ) Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , to ( J ) Mizpah , and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land .
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	7	( K ) And when all the captains of the armies who were in the fields , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed to him men , women , children , and ( L ) the poorest of the land who had not been carried away captive to Babylon ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	8	then they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah— ( M ) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , ( N ) Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and ( O ) Jezaniah [ b ] the son of a ( P ) Maachathite , they and their men .
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	9	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , took an oath before them and their men , saying , “ Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans . Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be ( Q ) well with you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	10	As for me , I will indeed dwell at Mizpah and serve the Chaldeans who come to us . But you , gather wine and summer fruit and oil , put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that you have taken. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	11	Likewise , when all the Jews who were in Moab , among the Ammonites , in Edom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	12	then all the Jews ( R ) returned out of all places where they had been driven , and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah at Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruit in abundance .
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	13	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to Gedaliah at Mizpah ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	14	and said to him , [ c ] “ Do you certainly know that ( S ) Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to murder you ? ” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah , saying , “ Let me go , please , and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and no one will know it . Why should he murder you , so that all the Jews who are gathered to you would be scattered , and the ( T ) remnant in Judah perish ? ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	40	16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah , “ You shall not do this thing , for you speak falsely concerning Ishmael. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 40:4 Or are - Jeremiah 40:8 Jaazaniah ,

NKJV	Jeremiah	41	41	Now it came to pass in the seventh month ( A ) that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the royal [ a ] family and of the officers of the king , came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , at ( B ) Mizpah . And there they ate bread together in Mizpah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	2	Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men who were with him , arose and ( C ) struck Gedaliah the son of ( D ) Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , with the sword , and killed him whom the king of Babylon had made ( E ) governor over the land .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	3	Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him , that is , with Gedaliah at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans who were found there , the men of war .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	4	And it happened , on the second day after he had killed Gedaliah , when as yet no one knew it ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	5	that certain men came from Shechem , from Shiloh , and from Samaria , eighty men ( F ) with their beards shaved and their clothes torn , having cut themselves , with offerings and incense in their hand , to bring them to ( G ) the house of the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	6	Now Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them , weeping as he went along ; and it happened as he met them that he said to them , “ Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam ! ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	7	So it was , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah ( H ) killed them and cast them into the midst of a [ b ] pit , he and the men who were with him .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	8	But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael , “ Do not kill us , for we have treasures of wheat , barley , oil , and honey in the field. ” So he desisted and did not kill them among their brethren .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	9	Now the [ c ] pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain , because of Gedaliah , was ( I ) the same one Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel . Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	10	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the ( J ) rest of the people who were in Mizpah , ( K ) the king ’ s daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah , ( L ) whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam . And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to ( M ) the Ammonites .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	11	But when ( N ) Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	12	they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah ; and they found him by ( O ) the great pool that is in Gibeon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	13	So it was , when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , that they were glad .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	14	Then all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back , and went to Johanan the son of Kareah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , took from Mizpah all the ( P ) rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah after he had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—the mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs , whom he had brought back from Gibeon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	17	And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of ( Q ) Chimham , which is near Bethlehem , as they went on their way to ( R ) Egypt ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	41	18	because of the Chaldeans ; for they were afraid of them , because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , ( S ) whom the king of Babylon had made governor in the land .

NKJV	Jeremiah	42	42	Now all the captains of the forces , ( A ) Johanan the son of Kareah , Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah , and all the people , from the least to the greatest , came near
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	2	and said to Jeremiah the prophet , ( B ) “ Please , let our petition be acceptable to you , and ( C ) pray for us to the Lord your God , for all this remnant ( since we are left but ( D ) a few of many , as you can see ) ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	3	that the Lord your God may show us ( E ) the way in which we should walk and the thing we should do. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them , “ I have heard . Indeed , I will pray to the Lord your God according to your words , and it shall be , that ( F ) whatever the Lord answers you , I will declare it to you . I will ( G ) keep nothing back from you. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	5	So they said to Jeremiah , ( H ) “ Let the Lord be a true and faithful witness between us , if we do not do according to everything which the Lord your God sends us by you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	6	Whether it is [ a ] pleasing or [ b ] displeasing , we will ( I ) obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we send you , ( J ) that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our God. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	7	And it happened after ten days that the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	8	Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah , all the captains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	9	and said to them , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him :
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	10	‘ If you will still remain in this land , then ( K ) I will build you and not pull you down , and I will plant you and not pluck you up . For I ( L ) relent concerning the disaster that I have brought upon you .
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom you are afraid ; do not be afraid of him , ’ says the Lord , ( M ) ‘ for I am with you , to save you and deliver you from his hand .
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	12	And ( N ) I will show you mercy , that he may have mercy on you and cause you to return to your own land. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	13	“ But if ( O ) you say , ‘ We will not dwell in this land , ’ disobeying the voice of the Lord your God ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	14	saying , ‘ No , but we will go to the land of ( P ) Egypt where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor be hungry for bread , and there we will dwell ’ —
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	15	Then hear now the word of the Lord , O remnant of Judah ! Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ If you ( Q ) wholly [ c ] set ( R ) your faces to enter Egypt , and go to dwell there ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	16	then it shall be that the ( S ) sword which you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt ; the famine of which you were afraid shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	17	So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to dwell there . They shall die by the sword , by famine , and by pestilence . And ( T ) none of them shall remain or escape from the disaster that I will bring upon them. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	18	“ For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ As My anger and My fury have been ( U ) poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so will My fury be poured out on you when you enter Egypt . And ( V ) you shall be an oath , an astonishment , a curse , and a reproach ; and you shall see this place no more. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	19	“ The Lord has said concerning you , O remnant of Judah , ( W ) ‘ Do not go to Egypt ! ’ Know certainly that I have [ d ] admonished you this day .
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	20	For you [ e ] were hypocrites in your hearts when you sent me to the Lord your God , saying , ‘ Pray for us to the Lord our God , and according to all that the Lord your God says , so declare to us and we will do it. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	42	21	And I have this day declared it to you , but you have ( X ) not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God , or anything which He has sent you by me .

NKJV	Jeremiah	43	43	Now it happened , when Jeremiah had stopped speaking to all the people all the ( A ) words of the Lord their God , for which the Lord their God had sent him to them , all these words ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	43	2	( B ) that Azariah the son of Hoshaiah , Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the proud men spoke , saying to Jeremiah , “ You speak falsely ! The Lord our God has not sent you to say , ‘ Do not go to Egypt to dwell there. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	43	3	But ( C ) Baruch the son of Neriah has [ a ] set you against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they may put us to death or carry us away captive to Babylon. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	43	4	So Johanan the son of Kareah , all the captains of the forces , and all the people would ( D ) not obey the voice of the Lord , to remain in the land of Judah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	43	5	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took ( E ) all the remnant of Judah who had returned to dwell in the land of Judah , from all nations where they had been driven—
NKJV	Jeremiah	43	6	men , women , children , ( F ) the king ’ s daughters , ( G ) and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	43	7	( H ) So they went to the land of Egypt , for they did not obey the voice of the Lord . And they went as far as ( I ) Tahpanhes .
NKJV	Jeremiah	43	8	Then the ( J ) word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	43	9	“ Take large stones in your hand , and hide them in the sight of the men of Judah , in the [ b ] clay in the brick courtyard which is at the entrance to Pharaoh ’ s house in Tahpanhes ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	43	10	and say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Behold , I will send and bring Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , ( K ) My servant , and will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden . And he will spread his royal pavilion over them .

NKJV	Jeremiah	43	12	[ c ] I will kindle a fire in the houses of ( N ) the gods of Egypt , and he shall burn them and carry them away captive . And he shall array himself with the land of Egypt , as a shepherd puts on his garment , and he shall go out from there in peace .

NKJV	Jeremiah	44	44	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwell in the land of Egypt , who dwell at ( A ) Migdol , at ( B ) Tahpanhes , at ( C ) Noph , [ a ] and in the country of ( D ) Pathros , saying ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	2	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ You have seen all the calamity that I have brought on Jerusalem and on all the cities of Judah ; and behold , this day they are ( E ) a desolation , and no one dwells in them ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	3	because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me to anger , in that they went ( F ) to burn incense and to ( G ) serve other gods whom they did not know , they nor you nor your fathers .
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	4	However ( H ) I have sent to you all My servants the prophets , rising early and sending them , saying , “ Oh , do not do this abominable thing that I hate ! ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	5	But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their wickedness , to burn no incense to other gods .
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	6	So My fury and My anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they [ b ] are wasted and desolate , as it is this day. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	7	“ Now therefore , thus says the Lord , the God of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ Why do you commit this great evil ( I ) against yourselves , to cut off from you man and woman , child and infant , out of Judah , leaving none to remain ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	8	in that you ( J ) provoke Me to wrath with the works of your hands , burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to dwell , that you may cut yourselves off and be ( K ) a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	9	Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , the wickedness of the kings of Judah , the wickedness of their wives , your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives , which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	10	They have not been ( L ) humbled , [ c ] to this day , nor have they ( M ) feared ; they have not walked in My law or in My statutes that I set before you and your fathers. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	11	“ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘ Behold , ( N ) I will set My face against you for catastrophe and for [ d ] cutting off all Judah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	12	And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to dwell there , and ( O ) they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of Egypt . They shall be consumed by the sword and by famine . They shall die , from the least to the greatest , by the sword and by famine ; and ( P ) they shall be an oath , an astonishment , a curse and a reproach !
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	13	( Q ) For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by famine , and by pestilence ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	14	so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there shall escape or survive , lest they return to the land of Judah , to which they ( R ) desire [ e ] to return and dwell . For ( S ) none shall return except those who escape. ’ ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	15	Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods , with all the women who stood by , a great multitude , and all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt , in Pathros , answered Jeremiah , saying :
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	16	“ As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord , ( T ) we will not listen to you !
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	17	But we will certainly do ( U ) whatever has gone out of our own mouth , to burn incense to the ( V ) queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her , as we have done , we and our fathers , our kings and our princes , in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . For then we had plenty of [ f ] food , were well-off , and saw no trouble .
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	18	But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her , we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	19	The women also said , ( W ) “ And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her , did we make cakes for her , to worship her , and pour out drink offerings to her without our husbands ’ permission ? ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	20	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people—the men , the women , and all the people who had given him that answer—saying :
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	21	“ The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem , you and your fathers , your kings and your princes , and the people of the land , did not the Lord remember them , and did it not come into His mind ?
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	22	So the Lord could no longer bear it , because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which you committed . Therefore your land is a desolation , an astonishment , a curse , and without an inhabitant , ( X ) as it is this day .
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	23	Because you have burned incense and because you have sinned against the Lord , and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord or walked in His law , in His statutes or in His testimonies , ( Y ) therefore this calamity has happened to you , as at this day. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	24	Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women , “ Hear the word of the Lord , all Judah who are in the land of Egypt !
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	25	Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying : ‘ You and your wives have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands , saying , “ We will surely keep our vows that we have made , to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her. ” You will surely keep your vows and perform your vows ! ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	26	Therefore hear the word of the Lord , all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt : ‘ Behold , ( Z ) I have sworn by My ( AA ) great name , ’ says the Lord , ‘ that ( AB ) My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt , saying , “ The Lord God lives. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	27	Behold , I will watch over them for adversity and not for good . And all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt ( AC ) shall be consumed by the sword and by famine , until there is an end to them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	28	Yet ( AD ) a small number who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah ; and all the remnant of Judah , who have gone to the land of Egypt to dwell there , shall know whose words will stand , Mine or theirs .
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	29	And this shall be a sign to you , ’ says the Lord , ‘ that I will punish you in this place , that you may know that My words will surely ( AE ) stand against you for adversity. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	44	30	“ Thus says the Lord : ‘ Behold , ( AF ) I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life , as I gave ( AG ) Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , his enemy who sought his life. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 44:1 Ancient Memphis - Jeremiah 44:6 Or became a ruin - Jeremiah 44:10 Lit . crushed - Jeremiah 44:11 destroying - Jeremiah 44:14 Lit . lift up their soul - Jeremiah 44:17 Lit . bread Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Jeremiah	50	34	( BD ) Their Redeemer is strong ; ( BE ) The Lord of hosts is His name . He will thoroughly plead their ( BF ) case , That He may give rest to the land , And disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	50	35	“ A sword is against the Chaldeans , ” says the Lord , “ Against the inhabitants of Babylon , And ( BG ) against her princes and ( BH ) her wise men .
NKJV	Jeremiah	50	36	A sword is ( BI ) against the soothsayers , and they will be fools . A sword is against her mighty men , and they will be dismayed .
NKJV	Jeremiah	50	37	A sword is against their horses , Against their chariots , And against all ( BJ ) the mixed peoples who are in her midst ; And ( BK ) they will become like women . A sword is against her treasures , and they will be robbed .
NKJV	Jeremiah	50	38	( BL ) A [ j ] drought is against her waters , and they will be dried up . For it is the land of carved images , And they are insane with their idols .

NKJV	Jeremiah	51	51	( BV ) We are ashamed because we have heard reproach . Shame has covered our faces , For strangers ( BW ) have come into the [ f ] sanctuaries of the Lord ’ s house .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	2	And I will send ( C ) winnowers to Babylon , Who shall winnow her and empty her land . ( D ) For in the day of doom They shall be against her all around .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	3	Against her ( E ) let the archer bend his bow , And lift himself up against her in his armor . Do not spare her young men ; ( F ) Utterly destroy all her army .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	4	Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans , ( G ) And those thrust through in her streets .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	5	For Israel is ( H ) not forsaken , nor Judah , By his God , the Lord of hosts , Though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	6	( I ) Flee from the midst of Babylon , And every one save his life ! Do not be cut off in her iniquity , For ( J ) this is the time of the Lord ’ s vengeance ; ( K ) He shall recompense her .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	7	( L ) Babylon was a golden cup in the Lord ’ s hand , That made all the earth drunk . ( M ) The nations drank her wine ; Therefore the nations ( N ) are deranged .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	8	Babylon has suddenly ( O ) fallen and been destroyed . ( P ) Wail for her ! ( Q ) Take balm for her pain ; Perhaps she may be healed .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	9	We would have healed Babylon , But she is not healed . Forsake her , and ( R ) let us go everyone to his own country ; ( S ) For her judgment reaches to heaven and is lifted up to the skies .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	10	The Lord has ( T ) revealed our righteousness . Come and let us ( U ) declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	11	( V ) Make [ b ] the arrows bright ! Gather the shields ! ( W ) The Lord has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes . ( X ) For His plan is against Babylon to destroy it , Because it is ( Y ) the vengeance of the Lord , The vengeance for His temple .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	12	( Z ) Set up the standard on the walls of Babylon ; Make the guard strong , Set up the watchmen , Prepare the ambushes . For the Lord has both devised and done What He spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	13	( AA ) O you who dwell by many waters , Abundant in treasures , Your end has come , The measure of your covetousness .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	14	( AB ) The Lord of hosts has sworn by Himself : “ Surely I will fill you with men , ( AC ) as with locusts , And they shall lift ( AD ) up a shout against you. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	15	( AE ) He has made the earth by His power ; He has established the world by His wisdom , And ( AF ) stretched out the heaven by His understanding .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	16	When He utters His voice— There is a multitude of waters in the heavens : ( AG ) “ He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth ; He makes lightnings for the rain ; He brings the wind out of His treasuries. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	17	( AH ) Everyone is dull-hearted , without knowledge ; Every metalsmith is put to shame by the carved image ; ( AI ) For his molded image is falsehood , And there is no breath in them .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	18	They are futile , a work of errors ; In the time of their punishment they shall perish .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	19	The Portion of Jacob is not like them , For He is the Maker of all things ; And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance . The Lord of hosts is His name .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	20	“ You ( AJ ) are My battle-ax and weapons of war : For with you I will break the nation in pieces ; With you I will destroy kingdoms ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	21	With you I will break in pieces the horse and its rider ; With you I will break in pieces the chariot and its rider ;

NKJV	Jeremiah	51	25	“ Behold , I am against you , ( AM ) O destroying mountain , Who destroys all the earth , ” says the Lord . “ And I will stretch out My hand against you , Roll you down from the rocks , ( AN ) And make you a burnt mountain .

NKJV	Jeremiah	51	27	( AP ) Set up a banner in the land , Blow the trumpet among the nations ! ( AQ ) Prepare the nations against her , Call ( AR ) the kingdoms together against her : Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz .

NKJV	Jeremiah	51	28	Prepare against her the nations , With the kings of the Medes , Its governors and all its rulers , All the land of his dominion .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	29	And the land will tremble and sorrow ; For every ( AS ) purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Babylon , ( AT ) To make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	30	The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting , They have remained in their strongholds ; Their might has failed , ( AU ) They became like women ; They have burned her dwelling places , ( AV ) The bars of her gate are broken .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	31	( AW ) One runner will run to meet another , And one messenger to meet another , To show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on all sides ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	32	( AX ) The passages are blocked , The reeds they have burned with fire , And the men of war are terrified .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	33	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ The daughter of Babylon is ( AY ) like a threshing floor When ( AZ ) it is time to thresh her ; Yet a little while ( BA ) And the time of her harvest will come. ”
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	34	“ Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon Has ( BB ) devoured me , he has crushed me ; He has made me an ( BC ) empty vessel , He has swallowed me up like a monster ; He has filled his stomach with my delicacies , He has spit me out .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	35	Let the violence done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon , ” The inhabitant of Zion will say ; “ And my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea ! ” Jerusalem will say .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	36	Therefore thus says the Lord : “ Behold , ( BD ) I will plead your case and take vengeance for you . ( BE ) I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	37	( BF ) Babylon shall become a heap , A dwelling place for jackals , ( BG ) An astonishment and a hissing , Without an inhabitant .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	38	They shall roar together like lions , They shall growl like lions ’ whelps .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	39	In their excitement I will prepare their feasts ; ( BH ) I will make them drunk , That they may rejoice , And sleep a perpetual sleep And not awake , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	40	“ I will bring them down Like lambs to the slaughter , Like rams with male goats .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	41	“ Oh , how ( BI ) Sheshach [ c ] is taken ! Oh , how ( BJ ) the praise of the whole earth is seized ! How Babylon has become desolate among the nations !
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	42	( BK ) The sea has come up over Babylon ; She is covered with the multitude of its waves .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	43	( BL ) Her cities are a desolation , A dry land and a wilderness , A land where ( BM ) no one dwells , Through which no son of man passes .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	44	I will punish ( BN ) Bel [ d ] in Babylon , And I will bring out of his mouth what he has swallowed ; And the nations shall not stream to him anymore . Yes , ( BO ) the wall of Babylon shall fall .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	45	“ My ( BP ) people , go out of the midst of her ! And let everyone deliver [ e ] himself from the fierce anger of the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	46	And lest your heart faint , And you fear ( BQ ) for the rumor that will be heard in the land ( A rumor will come one year , And after that , in another year A rumor will come , And violence in the land , Ruler against ruler ) ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	47	Therefore behold , the days are coming That I will bring judgment on the carved images of Babylon ; Her whole land shall be ashamed , And all her slain shall fall in her midst .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	48	Then ( BR ) the heavens and the earth and all that is in them Shall sing joyously over Babylon ; ( BS ) For the plunderers shall come to her from the north , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	49	As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall , So at Babylon the slain of all the earth shall fall .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	50	( BT ) You who have escaped the sword , Get away ! Do not stand still ! ( BU ) Remember the Lord afar off , And let Jerusalem come to your mind .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	52	“ Therefore behold , the days are coming , ” says the Lord , “ That I will bring judgment on her carved images , And throughout all her land the wounded shall groan .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	53	( BX ) Though Babylon were to [ g ] mount up to heaven , And though she were to fortify the height of her strength , Yet from Me plunderers would come to her , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	54	( BY ) The sound of a cry comes from Babylon , And great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	55	Because the Lord is plundering Babylon And silencing her loud voice , Though her waves roar like great waters , And the noise of their voice is uttered ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	56	Because the plunderer comes against her , against Babylon , And her mighty men are taken . Every one of their bows is broken ; ( BZ ) For the Lord is the God of recompense , He will surely repay .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	57	“ And I will make drunk Her princes and ( CA ) wise men , Her governors , her deputies , and her mighty men . And they shall sleep a perpetual sleep And not awake , ” says ( CB ) the King , Whose name is the Lord of hosts .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	58	Thus says the Lord of hosts : “ The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly ( CC ) broken , [ h ] And her high gates shall be burned with fire ; ( CD ) The people will labor in vain , And the nations , because of the fire ; And they shall be weary. ” Jeremiah ’ s Command to Seraiah
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of ( CE ) Neriah , the son of Mahseiah , when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign . And Seraiah was the quartermaster .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	60	So Jeremiah ( CF ) wrote in a book all the evil that would come upon Babylon , all these words that are written against Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah , “ When you arrive in Babylon and see it , and read all these words ,
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	62	then you shall say , ‘ O Lord , You have spoken against this place to cut it off , so that ( CG ) none shall remain in it , neither man nor beast , but it shall be desolate forever. ’
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	63	Now it shall be , when you have finished reading this book , ( CH ) that you shall tie a stone to it and throw it out into the Euphrates .
NKJV	Jeremiah	51	64	Then you shall say , ‘ Thus Babylon shall sink and not rise from the catastrophe that I will bring upon her . And they shall be weary. ’ ” Thus far are the words of Jeremiah .

NKJV	Jeremiah	52	4	Now it came to pass in the ( E ) ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , on the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it ; and they built a siege wall against it all around .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	5	So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	6	By the fourth month , on the ninth day of the month , the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	7	Then the city wall was broken through , and all the men of war fled and went out of the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls , which was by the king ’ s garden , even though the Chaldeans were near the city all around . And they went by way of the [ a ] plain .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king , and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho . All his army was scattered from him .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	9	( F ) So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath , and he pronounced judgment on him .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	10	( G ) Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes . And he killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	11	He also ( H ) put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in [ b ] bronze fetters , took him to Babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death . The Temple and City Plundered and Burned
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	12	( I ) Now in the fifth month , on the tenth day of the month ( ( J ) which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) , ( K ) Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , who served the king of Babylon , came to Jerusalem .

NKJV	Jeremiah	52	14	And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	15	( L ) Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poor people , the rest of the people who remained in the city , the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon , and the rest of the craftsmen .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	17	( M ) The ( N ) bronze pillars that were in the house of the Lord , and the carts and the bronze Sea that were in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans broke in pieces , and carried all their bronze to Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	18	inches each - Jeremiah 52:21
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	19	The basins , the firepans , the bowls , the pots , the lampstands , the spoons , and the cups , whatever was solid gold and whatever was solid silver , the captain of the guard took away .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	20	The two pillars , one Sea , the twelve bronze bulls which were under it , and the carts , which King Solomon had made for the house of the Lord— ( P ) the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	21	Now concerning the ( Q ) pillars : the height of one pillar was eighteen [ d ] cubits , a measuring line of twelve cubits could measure its circumference , and its thickness was [ e ] four fingers ; it was hollow .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	22	A capital of bronze was on it ; and the height of one capital was five cubits , with a network and pomegranates all around the capital , all of bronze . The second pillar , with pomegranates was the same .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides ; ( R ) all the pomegranates , all around on the network , were one hundred . The People Taken Captive to Babylonia
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	24	( S ) The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , ( T ) Zephaniah the second priest , and the three doorkeepers .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	25	He also took out of the city an [ f ] officer who had charge of the men of war , seven men of the king ’ s close associates who were found in the city , the principal scribe of the army who mustered the people of the land , and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	26	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	27	Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	28	( U ) These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive : ( V ) in the seventh year , ( W ) three thousand and twenty-three Jews ;
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	29	( X ) in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons ;

NKJV	Jeremiah	52	31	( Z ) Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the twenty-fifth day of the month , that [ g ] Evil-Merodach king of Babylon , in the first year of his reign , ( AA ) lifted [ h ] up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	32	And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who were with him in Babylon .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	33	So [ i ] Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments , ( AB ) and he ate bread regularly before the king all the days of his life .
NKJV	Jeremiah	52	34	And as for his provisions , there was a regular ration given him by the king of Babylon , a portion for each day until the day of his death , all the days of his life .

NKJV	Lamentations	1	2	She ( C ) weeps bitterly in the ( D ) night , Her tears are on her cheeks ; Among all her lovers She has none to comfort her . All her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; They have become her enemies .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	3	( E ) Judah has gone into captivity , Under affliction and hard servitude ; ( F ) She dwells among the [ b ] nations , She finds no ( G ) rest ; All her persecutors overtake her in dire straits .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	4	The roads to Zion mourn Because no one comes to the [ c ] set feasts . All her gates are ( H ) desolate ; Her priests sigh , Her virgins are afflicted , And she is in bitterness .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	5	Her adversaries ( I ) have become [ d ] the master , Her enemies prosper ; For the Lord has afflicted her ( J ) Because of the multitude of her transgressions . Her ( K ) children have gone into captivity before the enemy .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	6	And from the daughter of Zion All her splendor has departed . Her princes have become like deer That find no pasture , That [ e ] flee without strength Before the pursuer .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	7	In the days of her affliction and roaming , Jerusalem ( L ) remembers all her pleasant things That she had in the days of old . When her people fell into the hand of the enemy , With no one to help her , The adversaries saw her And mocked at her [ f ] downfall .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	8	( M ) Jerusalem has sinned gravely , Therefore she has become [ g ] vile . All who honored her despise her Because ( N ) they have seen her nakedness ; Yes , she sighs and turns away .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	9	Her uncleanness is in her skirts ; She ( O ) did not consider her destiny ; Therefore her collapse was awesome ; She had no comforter . “ O Lord , behold my affliction , For the enemy is exalted ! ”
NKJV	Lamentations	1	10	The adversary has spread his hand Over all her [ h ] pleasant things ; For she has seen ( P ) the nations enter her [ i ] sanctuary , Those whom You commanded ( Q ) Not to enter Your assembly .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	11	All her people sigh , ( R ) They [ j ] seek bread ; They have given their [ k ] valuables for food to restore life . “ See , O Lord , and consider , For I am scorned. ”
NKJV	Lamentations	1	12	“ Is it nothing to you , all you who [ l ] pass by ? Behold and see ( S ) If there is any sorrow like my sorrow , Which has been brought on me , Which the Lord has inflicted In the day of His fierce anger .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	13	“ From above He has sent fire into my bones , And it overpowered them ; He has ( T ) spread a net for my feet And turned me back ; He has made me desolate And faint all the day .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	14	“ The ( U ) yoke of my transgressions was [ m ] bound ; They were woven together by His hands , And thrust upon my neck . He made my strength fail ; The Lord delivered me into the hands of those whom I am not able to withstand .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	15	“ The Lord has trampled underfoot all my mighty men in my midst ; He has called an assembly against me To crush my young men ; ( V ) The Lord trampled as in a winepress The virgin daughter of Judah .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	16	“ For these things I weep ; My eye , ( W ) my eye overflows with water ; Because the comforter , who should restore my life , Is far from me . My children are desolate Because the enemy prevailed. ”
NKJV	Lamentations	1	17	( X ) Zion [ n ] spreads out her hands , But no one comforts her ; The Lord has commanded concerning Jacob That those ( Y ) around him become his adversaries ; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them .
NKJV	Lamentations	1	18	“ The Lord is ( Z ) righteous , For I ( AA ) rebelled against His [ o ] commandment . Hear now , all peoples , And behold my sorrow ; My virgins and my young men Have gone into captivity .

NKJV	Lamentations	2	5	( K ) The Lord was like an enemy . He has swallowed up Israel , He has swallowed up all her palaces ; ( L ) He has destroyed her strongholds , And has increased mourning and lamentation In the daughter of Judah .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	6	He has done violence ( M ) to His [ b ] tabernacle , ( N ) As if it were a garden ; He has destroyed His place of assembly ; The Lord has caused The appointed feasts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion . In His burning indignation He has ( O ) spurned the king and the priest .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	7	The Lord has spurned His altar , He has ( P ) abandoned His sanctuary ; He has [ c ] given up the walls of her palaces Into the hand of the enemy . ( Q ) They have made a noise in the house of the Lord As on the day of a set feast .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	8	The Lord has [ d ] purposed to destroy The ( R ) wall of the daughter of Zion . ( S ) He has stretched out a line ; He has not withdrawn His hand from destroying ; Therefore He has caused the rampart and wall to lament ; They languished together .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	9	Her gates have sunk into the ground ; He has destroyed and ( T ) broken her bars . ( U ) Her king and her princes are among the [ e ] nations ; ( V ) The Law is no more , And her ( W ) prophets find no [ f ] vision from the Lord .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	10	The elders of the daughter of Zion ( X ) Sit on the ground and keep silence ; [ g ] They ( Y ) throw dust on their heads And ( Z ) gird themselves with sackcloth . The virgins of Jerusalem Bow their heads to the ground .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	11	( AA ) My eyes fail with tears , My [ h ] heart is troubled ; ( AB ) My [ i ] bile is poured on the ground Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , Because ( AC ) the children and the infants Faint in the streets of the city .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	12	They say to their mothers , “ Where is grain and wine ? ” As they swoon like the wounded In the streets of the city , As their life is poured out In their mothers ’ bosom .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	13	How shall I ( AD ) console [ j ] you ? To what shall I liken you , O daughter of Jerusalem ? What shall I compare with you , that I may comfort you , O virgin daughter of Zion ? For your ruin is spread wide as the sea ; Who can heal you ?
NKJV	Lamentations	2	14	Your ( AE ) prophets have seen for you False and deceptive visions ; They have not ( AF ) uncovered your iniquity , To bring back your captives , But have envisioned for you false ( AG ) prophecies and delusions .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	15	All who [ k ] pass by ( AH ) clap their hands at you ; They hiss ( AI ) and shake their heads At the daughter of Jerusalem : “ Is this the city that is called ( AJ ) ‘ The perfection of beauty , The joy of the whole earth ’ ? ”
NKJV	Lamentations	2	16	( AK ) All your enemies have opened their mouth against you ; They hiss and gnash their teeth . They say , ( AL ) “ We have swallowed her up ! Surely this is the ( AM ) day we have waited for ; We have found it , ( AN ) we have seen it ! ”
NKJV	Lamentations	2	17	The Lord has done what He ( AO ) purposed ; He has fulfilled His word Which He commanded in days of old . He has thrown down and has not pitied , And He has caused an enemy to ( AP ) rejoice over you ; He has exalted the [ l ] horn of your adversaries .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	18	Their heart cried out to the Lord , “ O wall of the daughter of Zion , ( AQ ) Let tears run down like a river day and night ; Give yourself no relief ; Give [ m ] your eyes no rest .
NKJV	Lamentations	2	19	“ Arise , ( AR ) cry out in the night , At the beginning of the watches ; ( AS ) Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord . Lift your hands toward Him For the life of your young children , Who faint from hunger ( AT ) at the head of every street. ”
NKJV	Lamentations	2	20	“ See , O Lord , and consider ! To whom have You done this ? ( AU ) Should the women eat their offspring , The children [ n ] they have cuddled ? Should the priest and prophet be slain In the sanctuary of the Lord ?

NKJV	Ezekiel	1	1	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , on the fifth day of the month , as I was among the captives by ( A ) the River Chebar , that ( B ) the heavens were opened and I saw ( C ) visions [ a ] of God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	2	On the fifth day of the month , which was in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin ’ s captivity ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	3	the word of the Lord came expressly to Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi , in the land of the [ b ] Chaldeans by the River Chebar ; and ( D ) the hand of the Lord was upon him there .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	4	Then I looked , and behold , ( E ) a whirlwind was coming ( F ) out of the north , a great cloud with raging fire engulfing itself ; and brightness was all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber , out of the midst of the fire .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	5	( G ) Also from within it came the likeness of four living creatures . And ( H ) this was their appearance : they had ( I ) the likeness of a man .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	6	Each one had four faces , and each one had four wings .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	7	Their [ c ] legs were straight , and the soles of their feet were like the soles of calves ’ feet . They sparkled ( J ) like the color of burnished bronze .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	8	( K ) The hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides ; and each of the four had faces and wings .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	9	Their wings touched one another . The creatures did not turn when they went , but each one went straight ( L ) forward .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	10	As for ( M ) the likeness of their faces , each ( N ) had the face of a man ; each of the four had ( O ) the face of a lion on the right side , ( P ) each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side , ( Q ) and each of the four had the face of an eagle .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	11	Thus were their faces . Their wings stretched upward ; two wings of each one touched one another , and ( R ) two covered their bodies .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	12	And ( S ) each one went straight forward ; they went wherever the spirit wanted to go , and they did not turn when they went .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	13	As for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , ( T ) like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures . The fire was bright , and out of the fire went lightning .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	14	And the living creatures ran back and forth , ( U ) in appearance like a flash of lightning .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	15	Now as I looked at the living creatures , behold , ( V ) a wheel was on the earth beside each living creature with its four faces .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	16	( W ) The appearance of the wheels and their workings was ( X ) like the color of beryl , and all four had the same likeness . The appearance of their workings was , as it were , a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	17	When they moved , they went toward any one of four directions ; they did not turn aside when they went .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	18	As for their rims , they were so high they were awesome ; and their rims were ( Y ) full of eyes , all around the four of them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	19	( Z ) When the living creatures went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .

NKJV	Ezekiel	1	21	When those went , these went ; when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up together with them , for the spirit of the [ e ] living creatures was in the wheels .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	22	( AB ) The likeness of the [ f ] firmament above the heads of the [ g ] living creatures was like the color of an awesome ( AC ) crystal , stretched out ( AD ) over their heads .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	23	And under the firmament their wings spread out straight , one toward another . Each one had two which covered one side , and each one had two which covered the other side of the body .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	24	( AE ) When they went , I heard the noise of their wings , ( AF ) like the noise of many waters , like ( AG ) the voice of the Almighty , a tumult like the noise of an army ; and when they stood still , they let down their wings .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	25	A voice came from above the firmament that was over their heads ; whenever they stood , they let down their wings .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	26	( AH ) And above the firmament over their heads was the likeness of a throne , ( AI ) in appearance like a sapphire stone ; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man high above ( AJ ) it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	27	Also from the appearance of His waist and upward ( AK ) I saw , as it were , the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it ; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw , as it were , the appearance of fire with brightness all around .
NKJV	Ezekiel	1	28	( AL ) Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day , so was the appearance of the brightness all around it . ( AM ) This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord . Ezekiel Sent to Rebellious Israel So when I saw it , ( AN ) I fell on my face , and I heard a voice of One speaking .

NKJV	Ezekiel	2	2	Then ( B ) the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me , and set me on my feet ; and I heard Him who spoke to me .
NKJV	Ezekiel	2	3	And He said to me : “ Son of man , I am sending you to the children of Israel , to a rebellious nation that has ( C ) rebelled against Me ; ( D ) they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day .
NKJV	Ezekiel	2	4	( E ) For they are [ a ] impudent and stubborn children . I am sending you to them , and you shall say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord God. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	2	5	( F ) As for them , whether they hear or whether they refuse—for they are a ( G ) rebellious house—yet they ( H ) will know that a prophet has been among them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	2	6	“ And you , son of man , ( I ) do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words , though ( J ) briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions ; ( K ) do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks , ( L ) though they are a rebellious house .
NKJV	Ezekiel	2	7	( M ) You shall speak My words to them , whether they hear or whether they refuse , for they are rebellious .
NKJV	Ezekiel	2	8	But you , son of man , hear what I say to you . Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house ; open your mouth and ( N ) eat what I give you. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	2	9	Now when I looked , there was ( O ) a hand stretched out to me ; and behold , ( P ) a scroll of a book was in it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	2	10	Then He spread it before me ; and there was writing on the inside and on the outside , and written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe . Footnotes - Ezekiel 2:4 Lit . stiff-faced and hard-hearted sons Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Ezekiel	3	3	And He said to me , “ Son of man , feed your belly , and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you. ” So I ( B ) ate , and it was in my mouth ( C ) like honey in sweetness .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	2	So I opened my mouth , and He caused me to eat that scroll .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	4	Then He said to me : “ Son of man , go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	5	For you are not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language , but to the house of Israel ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	6	not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language , whose words you can not understand . Surely , ( D ) had I sent you to them , they would have listened to you .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	7	But the house of Israel will not listen to you , ( E ) because they will not listen to Me ; ( F ) for all the house of Israel are [ a ] impudent and hard-hearted .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	8	Behold , I have made your face strong against their faces , and your forehead strong against their foreheads .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	9	( G ) Like adamant stone , harder than flint , I have made your forehead ; ( H ) do not be afraid of them , nor be dismayed at their looks , though they are a rebellious house. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	10	Moreover He said to me : “ Son of man , receive into your heart all My words that I speak to you , and hear with your ears .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	11	And go , get to the captives , to the children of your people , and speak to them and tell them , ( I ) ‘ Thus says the Lord God , ’ whether they hear , or whether they refuse. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	12	Then ( J ) the Spirit lifted me up , and I heard behind me a great thunderous voice : “ Blessed is the ( K ) glory of the Lord from His place ! ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	13	I also heard the ( L ) noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another , and the noise of the wheels beside them , and a great thunderous noise .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	14	So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the [ b ] heat of my spirit ; but ( M ) the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	15	Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib , who dwelt by the River Chebar ; and ( N ) I sat where they sat , and remained there astonished among them seven days . Ezekiel Is a Watchman
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	16	Now it ( O ) came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	17	( P ) “ Son of man , I have made you ( Q ) a watchman for the house of Israel ; therefore hear a word from My mouth , and give them ( R ) warning from Me :
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	18	When I say to the wicked , ‘ You shall surely die , ’ and you give him no warning , nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way , to save his life , that same wicked man ( S ) shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood I will require at your hand .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	19	Yet , if you warn the wicked , and he does not turn from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; ( T ) but you have delivered your soul .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	20	“ Again , when a ( U ) righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity , and I lay a stumbling block before him , he shall die ; because you did not give him warning , he shall die in his sin , and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered ; but his blood I will require at your hand .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	21	Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin , and he does not sin , he shall surely live because he took warning ; also you will have delivered your soul. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	22	( V ) Then the hand of the Lord was upon me there , and He said to me , “ Arise , go out ( W ) into the plain , and there I shall talk with you. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	23	So I arose and went out into the plain , and behold , ( X ) the glory of the Lord stood there , like the glory which I ( Y ) saw by the River Chebar ; ( Z ) and I fell on my face .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	24	Then ( AA ) the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet , and spoke with me and said to me : “ Go , shut yourself inside your house .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	25	And you , O son of man , surely ( AB ) they will put ropes on you and bind you with them , so that you can not go out among them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	26	( AC ) I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth , so that you shall be mute and ( AD ) not be [ c ] one to rebuke them , ( AE ) for they are a rebellious house .
NKJV	Ezekiel	3	27	( AF ) But when I speak with you , I will open your mouth , and you shall say to them , ( AG ) ‘ Thus says the Lord God. ’ He who hears , let him hear ; and he who refuses , let him refuse ; for they are a rebellious house .

NKJV	Ezekiel	4	4	“ Lie also on your left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it . According to the number of the days that you lie on it , you shall bear their iniquity .
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	2	( A ) Lay siege against it , build a ( B ) siege wall against it , and heap up a mound against it ; set camps against it also , and place battering rams against it all around .
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	3	Moreover take for yourself an iron plate , and set it as an iron wall between you and the city . Set your face against it , and it shall be ( C ) besieged , and you shall lay siege against it . ( D ) This will be a sign to the house of Israel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	5	For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and ninety days ; ( E ) so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	6	And when you have completed them , lie again on your right side ; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days . I have laid on you a day for each year .
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	7	“ Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem ; your arm shall be uncovered , and you shall prophesy against it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	8	( F ) And surely I will [ a ] restrain you so that you can not turn from one side to another till you have ended the days of your siege .
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	9	“ Also take for yourself wheat , barley , beans , lentils , millet , and spelt ; put them into one vessel , and make bread of them for yourself . During the number of days that you lie on your side , three hundred and ninety days , you shall eat it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	10	And your food which you eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day ; from time to time you shall eat it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	11	You shall also drink water by measure , one-sixth of a hin ; from time to time you shall drink .
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	12	And you shall eat it as barley cakes ; and bake it using fuel of human waste in their sight. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	13	Then the Lord said , “ So ( G ) shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles , where I will drive them. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	14	So I said , ( H ) “ Ah , Lord God ! Indeed I have never defiled myself from my youth till now ; I have never eaten ( I ) what died of itself or was torn by beasts , nor has ( J ) abominable [ b ] flesh ever come into my mouth. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	15	Then He said to me , “ See , I am giving you cow dung instead of human waste , and you shall prepare your bread over it. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	4	16	Moreover He said to me , “ Son of man , surely I will cut off the ( K ) supply of bread in Jerusalem ; they shall ( L ) eat bread by weight and with anxiety , and shall ( M ) drink water by measure and with dread ,

NKJV	Ezekiel	5	3	( F ) You shall also take a small number of them and bind them in the edge of your garment .
NKJV	Ezekiel	5	4	Then take some of them again and ( G ) throw them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire . From there a fire will go out into all the house of Israel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	5	6	She has rebelled against My judgments by doing wickedness more than the nations , and against My statutes more than the countries that are all around her ; for they have refused My judgments , and they have not walked in My statutes. ’

NKJV	Ezekiel	5	14	Moreover ( V ) I will make you a waste and a reproach among the nations that are all around you , in the sight of all who pass by .
NKJV	Ezekiel	5	15	‘ So [ c ] it shall be a ( W ) reproach , a taunt , a ( X ) lesson , and an astonishment to the nations that are all around you , when I execute judgments among you in anger and in fury and in ( Y ) furious rebukes . I , the Lord , have spoken .

NKJV	Ezekiel	8	8	Then He said to me , “ Son of man , dig into the wall ” ; and when I dug into the wall , there was a door .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	2	( C ) Then I looked , and there was a likeness , like the appearance of fire—from the appearance of His waist and downward , fire ; and from His waist and upward , like the appearance of brightness , ( D ) like the color of amber .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	3	He ( E ) stretched out the form of a hand , and took me by a lock of my hair ; and ( F ) the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven , and ( G ) brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem , to the door of the north gate of the inner court , ( H ) where the seat of the image of jealousy was , which ( I ) provokes [ a ] to jealousy .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	4	And behold , the ( J ) glory of the God of Israel was there , like the vision that I ( K ) saw in the plain .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	5	Then He said to me , “ Son of man , lift your eyes now toward the north. ” So I lifted my eyes toward the north , and there , north of the altar gate , was this image of jealousy in the entrance .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	6	Furthermore He said to me , “ Son of man , do you see what they are doing , the great ( L ) abominations that the house of Israel commits here , to make Me go far away from My sanctuary ? Now turn again , you will see greater abominations. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	7	So He brought me to the door of the court ; and when I looked , there was a hole in the wall .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	9	And He said to me , “ Go in , and see the wicked abominations which they are doing there. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	10	So I went in and saw , and there—every ( M ) sort of ( N ) creeping thing , abominable beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel , [ b ] portrayed all around on the walls .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	11	And there stood before them ( O ) seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel , and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan . Each man had a censer in his hand , and a thick cloud of incense went up .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	12	Then He said to me , “ Son of man , have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in the room of his idols ? For they say , ( P ) ‘ The Lord does not see us , the Lord has forsaken the land. ’ ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	13	And He said to me , “ Turn again , and you will see greater abominations that they are doing. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	14	So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the Lord ’ s house ; and to my dismay , women were sitting there weeping for [ c ] Tammuz .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	15	Then He said to me , “ Have you seen this , O son of man ? Turn again , you will see greater abominations than these. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	16	So He brought me into the inner court of the Lord ’ s house ; and there , at the door of the temple of the Lord , ( Q ) between the porch and the altar , ( R ) were about twenty-five men ( S ) with their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east , and they were worshiping ( T ) the sun toward the east .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	17	And He said to me , “ Have you seen this , O son of man ? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here ? For they have ( U ) filled the land with violence ; then they have returned to provoke Me to anger . Indeed they put the branch to their nose .
NKJV	Ezekiel	8	18	( V ) Therefore I also will act in fury . My ( W ) eye will not spare nor will I have pity ; and though they ( X ) cry in My ears with a loud voice , I will not hear them. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 8:3 Arouses the Lord ’ s jealousy - Ezekiel 8:10 Or carved - Ezekiel 8:14 A Sumerian fertility god similar to the Gr . god Adonis Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Ezekiel	9	9	Then He said to me , “ The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great , and ( M ) the land is full of bloodshed , and the city full of perversity ; for they say , ( N ) ‘ The Lord has forsaken the land , and ( O ) the Lord does not see ! ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	9	2	And suddenly six men came from the direction of the upper gate , which faces north , each with his [ b ] battle-ax in his hand . ( A ) One man among them was clothed with linen and had a writer ’ s inkhorn [ c ] at his side . They went in and stood beside the bronze altar .
NKJV	Ezekiel	9	3	Now ( B ) the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub , where it had been , to the threshold of the [ d ] temple . And He called to the man clothed with linen , who had the writer ’ s inkhorn at his side ;
NKJV	Ezekiel	9	4	and the Lord said to him , “ Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and put ( C ) a mark on the foreheads of the men ( D ) who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	9	5	To the others He said in my [ e ] hearing , “ Go after him through the city and ( E ) kill ; [ f ] ( F ) do not let your eye spare , nor have any pity .
NKJV	Ezekiel	9	6	( G ) Utterly [ g ] slay old and young men , maidens and little children and women ; but ( H ) do not come near anyone on whom is the mark ; and ( I ) begin at My sanctuary. ” ( J ) So they began with the elders who were before the [ h ] temple .
NKJV	Ezekiel	9	7	Then He said to them , “ Defile the [ i ] temple , and fill the courts with the slain . Go out ! ” And they went out and killed in the city .
NKJV	Ezekiel	9	8	So it was , that while they were killing them , I was left alone ; and I ( K ) fell on my face and cried out , and said , ( L ) “ Ah , Lord God ! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem ? ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	9	10	And as for Me also , My ( P ) eye will neither spare , nor will I have pity , but ( Q ) I will recompense their deeds on their own head. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	9	11	Just then , the man clothed with linen , who had the inkhorn at his side , reported back and said , “ I have done as You commanded me. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 9:1 Or destroying - Ezekiel 9:2 Lit . shattering weapon - Ezekiel 9:2 Lit . upon his loins - Ezekiel 9:3 Lit . house - Ezekiel 9:5 Lit . ears - Ezekiel 9:5 Lit . strike - Ezekiel 9:6 Lit .

NKJV	Ezekiel	10	10	As for their appearance , all four looked alike—as it were , a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	2	( B ) Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen , and said , “ Go in among the wheels , under the cherub , fill your hands with ( C ) coals of fire from among the cherubim , and ( D ) scatter them over the city. ” And he went in as I watched .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	3	Now the cherubim were standing on the [ b ] south side of the [ c ] temple when the man went in , and the ( E ) cloud filled the inner court .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	4	( F ) Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub , and paused over the threshold of the [ d ] temple ; and ( G ) the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord ’ s ( H ) glory .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	5	And the ( I ) sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even in the outer court , like ( J ) the voice of Almighty God when He speaks .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	6	Then it happened , when He commanded the man clothed in linen , saying , “ Take fire from among the wheels , from among the cherubim , ” that he went in and stood beside the wheels .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	7	And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim , and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed with linen , who took it and went out .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	8	( K ) The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man ’ s hand under their wings .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	9	( L ) And when I looked , there were four wheels by the cherubim , one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by each other cherub ; the wheels appeared to have the color of a ( M ) beryl stone .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	11	( N ) When they went , they went toward any of their four directions ; they did not turn aside when they went , but followed in the direction the head was facing . They did not turn aside when they went .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	12	And their whole body , with their back , their hands , their wings , and the wheels that the four had , were ( O ) full of eyes all around .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	13	As for the wheels , they were called in my [ e ] hearing , “ Wheel. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	14	( P ) Each one had four faces : the first face was the face of a cherub , the second face the face of a man , the third the face of a lion , and the fourth the face of an eagle .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	15	And the cherubim were lifted up . This was ( Q ) the living creature I saw by the River Chebar .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	16	( R ) When the cherubim went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth , the same wheels also did not turn from beside them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	17	( S ) When [ f ] the cherubim stood still , the wheels stood still , and when [ g ] one was lifted up , [ h ] the other lifted itself up , for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	18	Then ( T ) the glory of the Lord ( U ) departed from the threshold of the [ i ] temple and stood over the cherubim .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	19	And ( V ) the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight . When they went out , the wheels were beside them ; and they stood at the door of the ( W ) east gate of the Lord ’ s house , and the glory of the God of Israel was above them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	20	( X ) This is the living creature I saw under the God of Israel ( Y ) by the River Chebar , and I knew they were cherubim .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	21	( Z ) Each one had four faces and each one four wings , and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
NKJV	Ezekiel	10	22	And ( AA ) the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the River Chebar , their appearance and their persons . ( AB ) They each went straight forward .

NKJV	Ezekiel	11	11	( P ) This city shall not be your [ c ] caldron , nor shall you be the meat in its midst . I will judge you at the border of Israel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	2	And He said to me : “ Son of man , these are the men who devise iniquity and give wicked [ a ] counsel in this city ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	3	who say , ‘ The time is not ( D ) near to build houses ; ( E ) this city is the [ b ] caldron , and we are the meat. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	4	Therefore prophesy against them , prophesy , O son of man ! ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	5	Then ( F ) the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me , and said to me , “ Speak ! ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ Thus you have said , O house of Israel ; for ( G ) I know the things that come into your mind .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	6	( H ) You have multiplied your slain in this city , and you have filled its streets with the slain. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	7	Therefore thus says the Lord God : ( I ) “ Your slain whom you have laid in its midst , they are the meat , and this city is the caldron ; ( J ) but I shall bring you out of the midst of it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	8	You have ( K ) feared the sword ; and I will bring a sword upon you , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	9	“ And I will bring you out of its midst , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and ( L ) execute judgments on you .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	10	( M ) You shall fall by the sword . I will judge you at ( N ) the border of Israel . ( O ) Then you shall know that I am the Lord .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	12	And you shall know that I am the Lord ; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My judgments , but ( Q ) have done according to the customs of the Gentiles which are all around you. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	13	Now it happened , while I was prophesying , that ( R ) Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died . Then ( S ) I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice , and said , “ Ah , Lord God ! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel ? ” God Will Restore Israel
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	14	Again the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	15	“ Son of man , your brethren , your relatives , your countrymen , and all the house of Israel in its entirety , are those about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said , ‘ Get far away from the Lord ; this land has been given to us as a possession. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	16	Therefore say , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ Although I have cast them far off among the Gentiles , and although I have scattered them among the countries , ( T ) yet I shall be a little [ d ] sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone. ” ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	17	Therefore say , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : ( U ) “ I will gather you from the peoples , assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel. ” ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	18	And they will go there , and they will take away all its ( V ) detestable things and all its abominations from there .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	19	Then ( W ) I will give them one heart , and I will put ( X ) a new spirit within [ e ] them , and take ( Y ) the stony heart out of their flesh , and give them a heart of flesh ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	20	( Z ) that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them ; ( AA ) and they shall be My people , and I will be their God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	21	But as for those whose hearts follow the desire for their detestable things and their abominations , ( AB ) I will recompense their deeds on their own heads , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	22	So the cherubim ( AC ) lifted up their wings , with the wheels beside them , and the glory of the God of Israel was high above them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	23	And ( AD ) the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood ( AE ) on the mountain , ( AF ) which is on the east side of the city .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	24	Then ( AG ) the Spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into [ f ] Chaldea , to those in captivity . And the vision that I had seen went up from me .
NKJV	Ezekiel	11	25	So I spoke to those in captivity of all the things the Lord had shown me .

NKJV	Ezekiel	12	12	And ( J ) the prince who is among them shall bear his belongings on his shoulder at twilight and go out . They shall dig through the wall to carry them out through it . He shall cover his face , so that he can not see the ground with his eyes .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	2	“ Son of man , you dwell in the midst of ( A ) a rebellious house , which ( B ) has eyes to see but does not see , and ears to hear but does not hear ; ( C ) for they are a rebellious house .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	3	“ Therefore , son of man , prepare your belongings for captivity , and go into captivity by day in their sight . You shall go from your place into captivity to another place in their sight . It may be that they will consider , though they are a rebellious house .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	4	By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight , as though going into captivity ; and at evening you shall go in their sight , like those who go into captivity .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	5	Dig through the wall in their sight , and carry your belongings out through it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	6	In their sight you shall bear them on your shoulders and carry them out at twilight ; you shall cover your face , so that you can not see the ground , ( D ) for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	7	So I did as I was commanded . I brought out my belongings by day , as though going into captivity , and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand . I brought them out at twilight , and I bore them on my shoulder in their sight .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	8	And in the morning the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	9	“ Son of man , has not the house of Israel , ( E ) the rebellious house , said to you , ( F ) ‘ What are you doing ? ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	10	Say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ This ( G ) burden [ a ] concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are among them. ” ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	11	Say , ( H ) ‘ I am a sign to you . As I have done , so shall it be done to them ; ( I ) they shall be carried away into captivity. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	13	I will also spread My ( K ) net over him , and he shall be caught in My snare . ( L ) I will bring him to Babylon , to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet he shall not see it , though he shall die there .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	14	( M ) I will scatter to every wind all who are around him to help him , and all his troops ; and ( N ) I will draw out the sword after them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	15	( O ) “ Then they shall know that I am the Lord , when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	16	( P ) But I will spare a few of their men from the sword , from famine , and from pestilence , that they may declare all their abominations among the Gentiles wherever they go . Then they shall know that I am the Lord. ” Judgment Not Postponed
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	17	Moreover the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	18	“ Son of man , ( Q ) eat your bread with [ b ] quaking , and drink your water with trembling and anxiety .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	19	And say to the people of the land , ‘ Thus says the Lord God to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the land of Israel : “ They shall eat their bread with anxiety , and drink their water with dread , so that her land may ( R ) be emptied of all who are in it , ( S ) because of the violence of all those who dwell in it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	20	Then the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall become desolate ; and you shall know that I am the Lord. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	21	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	22	“ Son of man , what is this proverb that you people have about the land of Israel , which says , ( T ) ‘ The days are prolonged , and every vision fails ’ ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	23	Tell them therefore , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ I will lay this proverb to rest , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel. ” ’ But say to them , ‘ ( U ) “ The days are at hand , and the [ c ] fulfillment of every vision .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	24	For ( V ) no more shall there be any ( W ) false [ d ] vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	25	For I am the Lord . I speak , and ( X ) the word which I speak will come to pass ; it will no more be postponed ; for in your days , O rebellious house , I will say the word and ( Y ) perform it , ” says the Lord God. ’ ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	26	Again the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	27	( Z ) “ Son of man , look , the house of Israel is saying , ‘ The vision that he sees is ( AA ) for many days from now , and he prophesies of times far off. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	12	28	( AB ) Therefore say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ None of My words will be postponed any more , but the word which I speak ( AC ) will be done , ” says the Lord God. ’ ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 12:10 oracle , prophecy - Ezekiel 12:18 shaking - Ezekiel 12:23 Lit . word - Ezekiel 12:24 Lit . vain Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Ezekiel	13	13	Therefore thus says the Lord God : “ I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury ; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger , and great hailstones in fury to consume it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	2	“ Son of man , prophesy ( A ) against the prophets of Israel who prophesy , and say to ( B ) those who prophesy out of their own ( C ) heart , [ a ] ‘ Hear the word of the Lord ! ’ ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	3	Thus says the Lord God : “ Woe to the foolish prophets , who follow their own spirit and have seen [ b ] nothing !
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	4	O Israel , your prophets are ( D ) like foxes in the deserts .
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	5	You ( E ) have not gone up into the [ c ] gaps to build a wall for the house of Israel to stand in battle on the day of the Lord .
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	6	( F ) They have envisioned futility and false divination , saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord ! ’ But the Lord has ( G ) not sent them ; yet they hope that the word may [ d ] be confirmed .
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	7	Have you not seen a futile vision , and have you not spoken false divination ? You say , ‘ The Lord says , ’ but I have not spoken. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	8	Therefore thus says the Lord God : “ Because you have spoken nonsense and envisioned lies , therefore I am indeed against you , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	9	“ My hand will be ( H ) against the prophets who envision futility and who ( I ) divine lies ; they shall not be in the assembly of My people , ( J ) nor be written in the record of the house of Israel , ( K ) nor shall they enter into the land of Israel . ( L ) Then you shall know that I am the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	10	“ Because , indeed , because they have seduced My people , saying , ( M ) ‘ Peace ! ’ when there is no peace—and one builds a wall , and they ( N ) plaster [ e ] it with untempered mortar—
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	11	say to those who plaster it with untempered mortar , that it will fall . ( O ) There will be flooding rain , and you , O great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall tear it down .
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	12	Surely , when the wall has fallen , will it not be said to you , ‘ Where is the mortar with which you plastered it ? ’ ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	14	So I will break down the wall you have plastered with untempered mortar , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation will be uncovered ; it will fall , and you shall be consumed in the midst of it . ( P ) Then you shall know that I am the Lord .
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	15	“ Thus will I accomplish My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with untempered mortar ; and I will say to you , ‘ The wall is no more , nor those who plastered it ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	16	that is , the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem , and who ( Q ) see visions of peace for her when there is no peace , ’ ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	17	“ Likewise , son of man , ( R ) set your face against the daughters of your people , ( S ) who prophesy out of their own [ f ] heart ; prophesy against them ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	18	and say , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ Woe to the women who sew magic charms [ g ] on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height to hunt souls ! Will you ( T ) hunt the souls of My people , and keep yourselves alive ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	19	And will you profane Me among My people ( U ) for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread , killing people who should not die , and keeping people alive who should not live , by your lying to My people who listen to lies ? ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	20	‘ Therefore thus says the Lord God : “ Behold , I am against your magic charms by which you hunt souls there like [ h ] birds . I will tear them from your arms , and let the souls go , the souls you hunt like birds .
NKJV	Ezekiel	13	21	I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand , and they shall no longer be as prey in your hand . ( V ) Then you shall know that I am the Lord .

NKJV	Ezekiel	14	3	“ Son of man , these men have set up their idols in their hearts , and put before them ( B ) that which causes them to stumble into iniquity . ( C ) Should I let Myself be inquired of at all by them ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	14	4	“ Therefore speak to them , and say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ Everyone of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart , and puts before him what causes him to stumble into iniquity , and then comes to the prophet , I the Lord will answer him who comes , according to the multitude of his idols ,

NKJV	Ezekiel	14	8	( E ) I will set My face against that man and make him a ( F ) sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of My people . ( G ) Then you shall know that I am the Lord .

NKJV	Ezekiel	14	12	The word of the Lord came again to me , saying :
NKJV	Ezekiel	14	13	“ Son of man , when a land sins against Me by persistent unfaithfulness , I will stretch out My hand against it ; I will cut off its ( K ) supply of bread , send famine on it , and cut off man and beast from it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	14	15	“ If I cause ( N ) wild beasts to pass through the land , and they [ a ] empty it , and make it so desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	14	16	even ( O ) though these three men were [ b ] in it , as I live , ” says the Lord God , “ they would deliver neither sons nor daughters ; only they would be delivered , and the land would be ( P ) desolate .
NKJV	Ezekiel	14	17	“ Or if ( Q ) I bring a sword on that land , and say , ‘ Sword , go through the land , ’ and I ( R ) cut off man and beast from it ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	14	18	even ( S ) though these three men were in it , as I live , ” says the Lord God , “ they would deliver neither sons nor daughters , but only they themselves would be delivered .
NKJV	Ezekiel	14	19	“ Or if I send ( T ) a pestilence into that land and ( U ) pour out My fury on it in blood , and cut off from it man and beast ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	14	20	even ( V ) though Noah , Daniel , and Job were in it , as I live , ” says the Lord God , “ they would deliver neither son nor daughter ; they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	14	21	For thus says the Lord God : “ How much more it shall be when ( W ) I send My four [ c ] severe judgments on Jerusalem—the sword and famine and wild beasts and pestilence—to cut off man and beast from it ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	14	22	( X ) Yet behold , there shall be left in it a remnant who will be ( Y ) brought out , both sons and daughters ; surely they will come out to you , and ( Z ) you will see their ways and their doings .

NKJV	Ezekiel	15	15	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
NKJV	Ezekiel	15	2	“ Son of man , how is the wood of the vine better than any other wood , the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	15	3	Is wood taken from it to make any object ? Or can men make a peg from it to hang any vessel on ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	15	4	Instead , ( A ) it is thrown into the fire for fuel ; the fire devours both ends of it , and its middle is burned . Is it useful for any work ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	15	5	Indeed , when it was whole , no object could be made from it . How much less will it be useful for any work when the fire has devoured it , and it is burned ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	15	6	“ Therefore thus says the Lord God : ‘ Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem ;

NKJV	Ezekiel	16	16	( Q ) You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored [ g ] high places for yourself , and played the harlot on them . Such things should not happen , nor be .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	2	“ Son of man , ( A ) cause Jerusalem to know her abominations ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	3	and say , ‘ Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem : “ Your [ a ] birth ( B ) and your nativity are from the land of Canaan ; ( C ) your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	4	As for your nativity , ( D ) on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut , nor were you washed in water to cleanse you ; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	5	No eye pitied you , to do any of these things for you , to have compassion on you ; but you were thrown out into the open field , when you yourself were [ b ] loathed on the day you were born .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	6	“ And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood , I said to you in your blood , ‘ Live ! ’ Yes , I said to you in your blood , ‘ Live ! ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	7	( E ) I made you [ c ] thrive like a plant in the field ; and you grew , matured , and became very beautiful . Your breasts were formed , your hair grew , but you were naked and bare .

NKJV	Ezekiel	16	12	And I put a [ f ] jewel in your nose , earrings in your ears , and a beautiful crown on your head .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	13	Thus you were adorned with gold and silver , and your clothing was of fine linen , silk , and embroidered cloth . ( L ) You ate pastry of fine flour , honey , and oil . You were exceedingly ( M ) beautiful , and succeeded to royalty .

NKJV	Ezekiel	16	25	You built your high places ( Y ) at the head of every road , and made your beauty to be abhorred . You offered yourself to everyone who passed by , and multiplied your acts of harlotry .

NKJV	Ezekiel	16	35	‘ Now then , O harlot , hear the word of the Lord !
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	36	Thus says the Lord God : “ Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers , and with all your abominable idols , and because of ( AH ) the blood of your children which you gave to them ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	37	surely , therefore , ( AI ) I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure , all those you loved , and all those you hated ; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them , that they may see all your nakedness .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	38	And I will judge you as ( AJ ) women who break wedlock or ( AK ) shed blood are judged ; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	39	I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your shrines and break down ( AL ) your [ m ] high places . ( AM ) They shall also strip you of your clothes , take your beautiful jewelry , and leave you naked and bare .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	40	( AN ) “ They shall also bring up an assembly against you , ( AO ) and they shall stone you with stones and thrust you through with their swords .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	41	They shall ( AP ) burn your houses with fire , and ( AQ ) execute judgments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will make you ( AR ) cease playing the harlot , and you shall no longer hire lovers .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	42	So ( AS ) I will lay to rest My fury toward you , and My jealousy shall depart from you . I will be quiet , and be angry no more .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	43	Because ( AT ) you did not remember the days of your youth , but [ n ] agitated Me with all these things , surely ( AU ) I will also recompense your [ o ] deeds on your own head , ” says the Lord God . “ And you shall not commit lewdness in addition to all your abominations . More Wicked than Samaria and Sodom
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	44	“ Indeed everyone who quotes proverbs will use this proverb against you : ‘ Like mother , like daughter ! ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	45	You are your mother ’ s daughter , [ p ] loathing husband and children ; and you are the ( AV ) sister of your sisters , who loathed their husbands and children ; ( AW ) your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	46	“ Your elder sister is Samaria , who dwells with her daughters to the north of you ; and ( AX ) your younger sister , who dwells to the south of you , is Sodom and her daughters .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	47	You did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations ; but , as if that were too little , ( AY ) you became more corrupt than they in all your ways .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	48	“ As I live , ” says the Lord God , “ neither ( AZ ) your sister Sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	49	Look , this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom : She and her daughter had pride , ( BA ) fullness of food , and abundance of idleness ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	50	And they were haughty and ( BB ) committed abomination before Me ; therefore ( BC ) I took them away as [ q ] I saw fit .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	51	“ Samaria did not commit ( BD ) half of your sins ; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they , and ( BE ) have justified your sisters by all the abominations which you have done .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	52	You who judged your sisters , bear your own shame also , because the sins which you committed were more abominable than theirs ; they are more righteous than you . Yes , be disgraced also , and bear your own shame , because you justified your sisters .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	53	( BF ) “ When I bring back their captives , the captives of Sodom and her daughters , and the captives of Samaria and her daughters , then I will also bring back ( BG ) the captives of your captivity among them ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	54	that you may bear your own shame and be disgraced by all that you did when ( BH ) you comforted them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	55	When your sisters , Sodom and her daughters , return to their former state , and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state , then you and your daughters will return to your former state .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	56	For your sister Sodom was not a byword in your mouth in the days of your pride ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	57	before your wickedness was uncovered . It was like the time of the ( BI ) reproach of the daughters of [ r ] Syria and all those around her , and of ( BJ ) the daughters of the Philistines , who despise you everywhere .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	58	( BK ) You have paid for your lewdness and your abominations , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	59	For thus says the Lord God : “ I will deal with you as you have done , who ( BL ) despised ( BM ) the oath by breaking the covenant . An Everlasting Covenant
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	60	“ Nevertheless I will ( BN ) remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth , and I will establish ( BO ) an everlasting covenant with you .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	61	Then ( BP ) you will remember your ways and be ashamed , when you receive your older and your younger sisters ; for I will give them to you for ( BQ ) daughters , ( BR ) but not because of My covenant with you .
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	62	( BS ) And I will establish My covenant with you . Then you shall know that I am the Lord ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	16	63	that you may ( BT ) remember and be ashamed , ( BU ) and never open your mouth anymore because of your shame , when I provide you an atonement for all you have done , ” says the Lord God. ’ ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 16:3 origin and your birth - Ezekiel 16:5 abhorred - Ezekiel 16:7 Lit . a myriad - Ezekiel 16:8 Or the corner of My garment - Ezekiel 16:10 Or dolphin or dugong - Ezekiel 16:12 Lit . ring - Ezekiel 16:16 Places for pagan worship - Ezekiel 16:19 Or a sweet aroma - Ezekiel 16:24 Place for pagan worship - Ezekiel 16:27 Allowance of food - Ezekiel 16:31 Place for pagan worship - Ezekiel 16:33 Or bribed - Ezekiel 16:39 Places for pagan worship - Ezekiel 16:43 So with LXX , Syr. , Tg. , Vg . ; MT were agitated with Me - Ezekiel 16:43 Lit . way - Ezekiel 16:45 Or despising - Ezekiel 16:50 Vg . you saw ; LXX he saw ; Tg . as was revealed to Me - Ezekiel 16:57 Heb .

NKJV	Ezekiel	17	2	“ Son of man , pose a riddle , and speak a ( A ) parable to the house of Israel ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	3	and say , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : ( B ) “ A great eagle with large wings and long pinions , Full of feathers of various colors , Came to Lebanon And ( C ) took from the cedar the highest branch .
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	4	He cropped off its topmost young twig And carried it to a land of trade ; He set it in a city of merchants .
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	5	Then he took some of the seed of the land And planted it in ( D ) a fertile field ; He placed it by abundant waters And set it ( E ) like a willow tree .
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	6	And it grew and became a spreading vine ( F ) of low stature ; Its branches turned toward him , But its roots were under it . So it became a vine , Brought forth branches , And put forth shoots .
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	7	“ But there was [ a ] another great eagle with large wings and many feathers ; And behold , ( G ) this vine bent its roots toward him , And stretched its branches toward him , From the garden terrace where it had been planted , That he might water it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	8	It was planted in [ b ] good soil by many waters , To bring forth branches , bear fruit , And become a majestic vine. ” ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	9	“ Say , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ Will it thrive ? ( H ) Will he not pull up its roots , Cut off its fruit , And leave it to wither ? All of its spring leaves will wither , And no great power or many people Will be needed to pluck it up by its roots .
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	10	Behold , it is planted , Will it thrive ? ( I ) Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it ? It will wither in the garden terrace where it grew. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	11	Moreover the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	12	“ Say now to ( J ) the rebellious house : ‘ Do you not know what these things mean ? ’ Tell them , ‘ Indeed ( K ) the king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and took its king and princes , and led them with him to Babylon .

NKJV	Ezekiel	17	14	that the kingdom might be ( N ) brought low and not lift itself up , but that by keeping his covenant it might stand .
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	15	But ( O ) he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt , ( P ) that they might give him horses and many people . ( Q ) Will he prosper ? Will he who does such things escape ? Can he break a covenant and still be delivered ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	16	‘ As I live , ’ says the Lord God , ‘ surely ( R ) in the place where the king dwells who made him king , whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke—with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
NKJV	Ezekiel	17	18	Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant , and in fact ( U ) gave [ d ] his hand and still did all these things , he shall not escape. ’ ”

NKJV	Ezekiel	20	6	On that day I raised My hand in an oath to them , ( G ) to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , ( H ) ‘ flowing with milk and honey , ’ ( I ) the glory of all lands .
NKJV	Ezekiel	20	7	Then I said to them , ‘ Each of you , ( J ) throw away ( K ) the abominations which are before his eyes , and do not defile yourselves with ( L ) the idols of Egypt . I am the Lord your God. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	20	8	But they rebelled against Me and would not [ a ] obey Me . They did not all cast away the abominations which were before their eyes , nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt .

NKJV	Ezekiel	20	41	I will accept you as a ( BJ ) sweet aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered ; and I will be hallowed in you before the Gentiles .
NKJV	Ezekiel	20	42	( BK ) Then you shall know that I am the Lord , ( BL ) when I bring you into the land of Israel , into the country for which I raised My hand in an oath to give to your fathers .

NKJV	Ezekiel	21	21	For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the road , at the fork of the two roads , to use divination : he shakes the arrows , he consults the [ e ] images , he looks at the liver .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	2	( A ) “ Son of man , set your face toward Jerusalem , ( B ) preach [ a ] against the holy places , and prophesy against the land of Israel ;
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	3	and say to the land of Israel , ‘ Thus says the Lord : “ Behold , I am ( C ) against you , and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off both ( D ) righteous and wicked from you .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	4	Because I will cut off both righteous and wicked from you , therefore My sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh ( E ) from south to north ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	5	that all flesh may know that I , the Lord , have drawn My sword out of its sheath ; it ( F ) shall not return anymore. ” ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	6	( G ) Sigh therefore , son of man , with [ b ] a breaking heart , and sigh with bitterness before their eyes .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	7	And it shall be when they say to you , ‘ Why are you sighing ? ’ that you shall answer , ‘ Because of the news ; when it comes , every heart will melt , ( H ) all hands will be feeble , every spirit will faint , and all knees will be weak as water . Behold , it is coming and shall be brought to pass , ’ says the Lord God. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	8	Again the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	9	“ Son of man , prophesy and say , ‘ Thus says the Lord ! ’ Say : ( I ) ‘ A sword , a sword is sharpened And also polished !
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	10	Sharpened to make a dreadful slaughter , Polished to flash like lightning ! Should we then make mirth ? It despises the scepter of My son , As it does all wood .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	11	And He has given it to be polished , That it may be handled ; This sword is sharpened , and it is polished To be given into the hand of ( J ) the slayer. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	12	“ Cry and wail , son of man ; For it will be against My people , Against all the princes of Israel . Terrors including the sword will be against My people ; Therefore ( K ) strike your thigh .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	13	“ Because it is ( L ) a testing , And what if the sword despises even the scepter ? ( M ) The scepter shall be no more , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	14	“ You therefore , son of man , prophesy , And ( N ) strike your hands together . The third time let the sword do double damage . It is the sword that slays , The sword that slays the great men , That enters their ( O ) private chambers .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	15	I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , That the heart may melt and many may stumble . Ah ! ( P ) It is made bright ; It is grasped for slaughter :
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	16	“ Swords ( Q ) [ c ] at the ready ! Thrust right ! Set your blade ! Thrust left— Wherever your [ d ] edge is ordered !
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	17	“ I also will ( R ) beat My fists together , And ( S ) I will cause My fury to rest ; I , the Lord , have spoken. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	18	The word of the Lord came to me again , saying :
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	19	“ And son of man , appoint for yourself two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to go ; both of them shall go from the same land . Make a sign ; put it at the head of the road to the city .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	20	Appoint a road for the sword to go to ( T ) Rabbah of the Ammonites , and to Judah , into fortified Jerusalem .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	22	In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem : to set up battering rams , to call for a slaughter , to ( U ) lift the voice with shouting , ( V ) to set battering rams against the gates , to heap up a siege mound , and to build a wall .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	23	And it will be to them like a false divination in the eyes of those who ( W ) have sworn oaths with them ; but he will bring their iniquity to remembrance , that they may be taken .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	24	“ Therefore thus says the Lord God : ‘ Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered , in that your transgressions are uncovered , so that in all your doings your sins appear—because you have come to remembrance , you shall be taken in hand .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	25	‘ Now to you , O ( X ) profane , wicked prince of Israel , ( Y ) whose day has come , whose iniquity shall end ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	26	thus says the Lord God : “ Remove the turban , and take off the crown ; Nothing shall remain the same . ( Z ) Exalt the humble , and humble the exalted .
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	27	[ f ] Overthrown , overthrown , I will make it overthrown ! ( AA ) It shall be no longer , Until He comes whose right it is , And I will give it to ( AB ) Him. ” ’ A Sword Against the Ammonites
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	28	“ And you , son of man , prophesy and say , ‘ Thus says the Lord God ( AC ) concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach , ’ and say : ‘ A sword , a sword is drawn , Polished for slaughter , For consuming , for flashing—
NKJV	Ezekiel	21	29	While they ( AD ) see false visions for you , While they divine a lie to you , To bring you on the necks of the wicked , the slain ( AE ) Whose day has come , Whose iniquity shall end .

NKJV	Ezekiel	22	8	You have despised My holy things and ( I ) profaned My Sabbaths .
NKJV	Ezekiel	22	9	In you are ( J ) men who slander to cause bloodshed ; ( K ) in you are those who eat on the mountains ; in your midst they commit lewdness .

NKJV	Ezekiel	22	17	The word of the Lord came to me , saying ,

NKJV	Ezekiel	22	21	Yes , I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath , and you shall be melted in its midst .
NKJV	Ezekiel	22	23	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	22	24	“ Son of man , say to her : ‘ You are a land that is ( AD ) not [ d ] cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	22	25	( AE ) The conspiracy of her [ e ] prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey ; they ( AF ) have devoured [ f ] people ; ( AG ) they have taken treasure and precious things ; they have made many widows in her midst .
NKJV	Ezekiel	22	26	( AH ) Her priests have [ g ] violated My law and ( AI ) profaned My holy things ; they have not ( AJ ) distinguished between the holy and unholy , nor have they made known the difference between the unclean and the clean ; and they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths , so that I am profaned among them .

NKJV	Ezekiel	23	23	The Babylonians , All the Chaldeans , ( V ) Pekod , Shoa , Koa , ( W ) All the Assyrians with them , All of them desirable young men , Governors and rulers , Captains and men of renown , All of them riding on horses .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	2	“ Son of man , there were ( A ) two women , The daughters of one mother .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	3	( B ) They committed harlotry in Egypt , They committed harlotry in ( C ) their youth ; Their breasts were there embraced , Their virgin bosom was there pressed .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	4	Their names : [ a ] Oholah the elder and [ b ] Oholibah ( D ) her sister ; ( E ) They were Mine , And they bore sons and daughters . As for their names , Samaria is Oholah , and Jerusalem is Oholibah . The Older Sister , Samaria
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	5	“ Oholah played the harlot even though she was Mine ; And she lusted for her lovers , the neighboring ( F ) Assyrians ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	6	Who were clothed in purple , Captains and rulers , All of them desirable young men , Horsemen riding on horses .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	7	Thus she committed her harlotry with them , All of them choice men of Assyria ; And with all for whom she lusted , With all their idols , she defiled herself .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	8	She has never given up her harlotry brought ( G ) from Egypt , For in her youth they had lain with her , Pressed her virgin bosom , And poured out their immorality upon her .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	9	“ Therefore I have delivered her Into the hand of her lovers , Into the hand of the ( H ) Assyrians , For whom she lusted .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	10	They uncovered her nakedness , Took away her sons and daughters , And slew her with the sword ; She became a byword among women , For they had executed judgment on her . The Younger Sister , Jerusalem
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	11	“ Now ( I ) although her sister Oholibah saw this , ( J ) she became more corrupt in her lust than she , and in her harlotry more corrupt than her sister ’ s harlotry .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	12	“ She lusted for the neighboring ( K ) Assyrians , ( L ) Captains and rulers , Clothed most gorgeously , Horsemen riding on horses , All of them desirable young men .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	13	Then I saw that she was defiled ; Both took the same way .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	14	But she increased her harlotry ; She looked at men portrayed on the wall , Images of ( M ) Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	15	Girded with belts around their waists , Flowing turbans on their heads , All of them looking like captains , In the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea , The land of their nativity .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	16	( N ) As soon as her eyes saw them , She lusted for them And sent ( O ) messengers to them in Chaldea .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	17	“ Then the [ c ] Babylonians came to her , into the bed of love , And they defiled her with their immorality ; So she was defiled by them , ( P ) and alienated herself from them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	18	She revealed her harlotry and uncovered her nakedness . Then ( Q ) I ( R ) alienated Myself from her , As I had alienated Myself from her sister .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	19	“ Yet she multiplied her harlotry In calling to remembrance the days of her youth , ( S ) When she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	20	For she lusted for her [ d ] paramours , Whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys , And whose issue is like the issue of horses .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	21	Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth , When the ( T ) Egyptians pressed your bosom Because of your youthful breasts . Judgment on Jerusalem
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	22	“ Therefore , Oholibah , thus says the Lord God : ( U ) ‘ Behold , I will stir up your lovers against you , From whom you have alienated yourself , And I will bring them against you from every side :
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	24	And they shall come against you With chariots , wagons , and war-horses , With a horde of people . They shall array against you Buckler , shield , and helmet all around . ‘ I will delegate judgment to them , And they shall judge you according to their judgments .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	25	I will set My ( X ) jealousy against you , And they shall deal furiously with you ; They shall remove your nose and your ears , And your remnant shall fall by the sword ; They shall take your sons and your daughters , And your remnant shall be devoured by fire .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	26	( Y ) They shall also strip you of your clothes And take away your beautiful jewelry .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	27	‘ Thus ( Z ) I will make you cease your lewdness and your ( AA ) harlotry Brought from the land of Egypt , So that you will not lift your eyes to them , Nor remember Egypt anymore. ’

NKJV	Ezekiel	23	29	( AD ) They will deal hatefully with you , take away all you have worked for , and ( AE ) leave you naked and bare . The nakedness of your harlotry shall be uncovered , both your lewdness and your harlotry .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	30	I will do these things to you because you have ( AF ) gone as a harlot after the Gentiles , because you have become defiled by their idols .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	31	You have walked in the way of your sister ; therefore I will put her ( AG ) cup in your hand. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	32	“ Thus says the Lord God : ‘ You shall drink of your sister ’ s cup , The deep and wide one ; ( AH ) You shall be laughed to scorn And held in derision ; It contains much .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	33	You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , The cup of horror and desolation , The cup of your sister Samaria .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	34	You shall ( AI ) drink and drain it , You shall break its [ e ] shards , And tear at your own breasts ; For I have spoken , ’ Says the Lord God .

NKJV	Ezekiel	23	37	For they have committed adultery , and ( AN ) blood is on their hands . They have committed adultery with their idols , and even sacrificed their sons ( AO ) whom they bore to Me , passing them through the fire , to devour them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	38	Moreover they have done this to Me : They have ( AP ) defiled My sanctuary on the same day and ( AQ ) profaned My Sabbaths .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	39	For after they had slain their children for their idols , on the same day they came into My sanctuary to profane it ; and indeed ( AR ) thus they have done in the midst of My house .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	40	“ Furthermore you sent for men to come from afar , ( AS ) to whom a messenger was sent ; and there they came . And you ( AT ) washed yourself for them , ( AU ) painted your eyes , and adorned yourself with ornaments .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	41	You sat on a stately ( AV ) couch , with a table prepared before it , ( AW ) on which you had set My incense and My oil .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	42	The sound of a carefree multitude was with her , and [ f ] Sabeans were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort , who put bracelets on their [ g ] wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	43	Then I said concerning her who had grown old in adulteries , ‘ Will they commit harlotry with her now , and she with them ? ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	44	Yet they went in to her , as men go in to a woman who plays the harlot ; thus they went in to Oholah and Oholibah , the lewd women .
NKJV	Ezekiel	23	45	But righteous men will ( AX ) judge them after the manner of adulteresses , and after the manner of women who shed blood , because they are adulteresses , and ( AY ) blood is on their hands .

NKJV	Ezekiel	24	10	Heap on the wood , Kindle the fire ; Cook the meat well , Mix in the spices , And let the [ b ] cuts be burned up .

NKJV	Ezekiel	24	14	( N ) I , the Lord , have spoken it ; ( O ) It shall come to pass , and I will do it ; I will not hold back , ( P ) Nor will I spare , Nor will I relent ; According to your ways And according to your deeds [ e ] They will judge you , ” Says the Lord God. ’ ” The Prophet ’ s Wife Dies
NKJV	Ezekiel	24	15	Also the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,

NKJV	Ezekiel	30	20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first month , on the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,

NKJV	Ezekiel	31	31	Now it came to pass in the ( B ) eleventh year , in the third month , on the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	2	“ Son of man , say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude : ( C ) ‘ Whom are you like in your greatness ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	3	( D ) Indeed Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon , With fine branches that shaded the forest , And of high stature ; And its top was among the thick boughs .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	4	( E ) The waters made it grow ; Underground waters gave it height , With their rivers running around the place where it was planted , And sent out [ a ] rivulets to all the trees of the field .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	5	‘ Therefore ( F ) its height was exalted above all the trees of the field ; Its boughs were multiplied , And its branches became long because of the abundance of water , As it sent them out .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	6	All the ( G ) birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs ; Under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young ; And in its shadow all great nations [ b ] made their home .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	7	‘ Thus it was beautiful in greatness and in the length of its branches , Because its roots reached to abundant waters .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	8	The cedars in the ( H ) garden of God could not hide it ; The fir trees were not like its boughs , And the [ c ] chestnut trees were not like its branches ; No tree in the garden of God was like it in beauty .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	9	I made it beautiful with a multitude of branches , So that all the trees of Eden envied it , That were in the garden of God. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	10	“ Therefore thus says the Lord God : ‘ Because you have increased in height , and it set its top among the thick boughs , and ( I ) its heart was [ d ] lifted up in its height ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	11	therefore I will deliver it into the hand of the ( J ) mighty one of the nations , and he shall surely deal with it ; I have driven it out for its wickedness .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	12	And aliens , ( K ) the most terrible of the nations , have cut it down and left it ; its branches have fallen ( L ) on the mountains and in all the valleys ; its boughs lie ( M ) broken by all the rivers of the land ; and all the peoples of the earth have gone from under its shadow and left it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	13	‘ On ( N ) its ruin will remain all the birds of the heavens , And all the beasts of the field will come to its branches—
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	14	So that no trees by the waters may ever again exalt themselves for their height , nor set their tops among the thick boughs , that no tree which drinks water may ever be high enough to reach up to them . ‘ For ( O ) they have all been delivered to death , ( P ) To the depths of the earth , Among the children of men who go down to the Pit. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	15	“ Thus says the Lord God : ‘ In the day when it ( Q ) went down to [ e ] hell , I caused mourning . I covered the deep because of it . I restrained its rivers , and the great waters were held back . I caused Lebanon to [ f ] mourn for it , and all the trees of the field wilted because of it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	16	I made the nations ( R ) shake at the sound of its fall , when I ( S ) cast it down to [ g ] hell together with those who descend into the Pit ; and ( T ) all the trees of Eden , the choice and best of Lebanon , all that drink water , ( U ) were comforted in the depths of the earth .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	17	They also went down to hell with it , with those slain by the sword ; and those who were its strong arm ( V ) dwelt in its shadows among the nations .
NKJV	Ezekiel	31	18	( W ) ‘ To which of the trees in Eden will you then be likened in glory and greatness ? Yet you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the depths of the earth ; ( X ) you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised , with those slain by the sword .

NKJV	Ezekiel	32	25	They have set her ( AF ) bed in the midst of the slain , With all her multitude , With her graves all around it , All of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword ; Though their terror was caused In the land of the living , Yet they bear their shame With those who go down to the Pit ; It was put in the midst of the slain .
NKJV	Ezekiel	32	26	“ There are ( AG ) Meshech and Tubal and all their multitudes , With all their graves around it , All of them ( AH ) uncircumcised , slain by the sword , Though they caused their terror in the land of the living .

NKJV	Ezekiel	33	2	“ Son of man , speak to ( A ) the children of your people , and say to them : ( B ) ‘ When I bring the sword upon a land , and the people of the land take a man from their territory and make him their ( C ) watchman ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	3	when he sees the sword coming upon the land , if he blows the trumpet and warns the people ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	4	then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does ( D ) not take warning , if the sword comes and takes him away , ( E ) his blood shall be on his own head .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	5	He heard the sound of the trumpet , but did not take warning ; his blood shall be upon himself . But he who takes warning will [ a ] save his life .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	6	But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet , and the people are not warned , and the sword comes and takes any person from among them , ( F ) he is taken away in his iniquity ; but his blood I will require at the watchman ’ s hand. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	7	( G ) “ So you , son of man : I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel ; therefore you shall hear a word from My mouth and warn them for Me .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	8	When I say to the wicked , ‘ O wicked man , you shall surely die ! ’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way , that wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood I will require at your hand .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	9	Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way , and he does not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but you have [ b ] delivered your soul .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	10	“ Therefore you , O son of man , say to the house of Israel : ‘ Thus you say , “ If our transgressions and our sins lie upon us , and we ( H ) pine [ c ] away in them , ( I ) how can we then live ? ” ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	11	Say to them : ‘ As I live , ’ says the Lord God , ( J ) ‘ I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked , but that the wicked ( K ) turn from his way and live . Turn , turn from your evil ways ! For ( L ) why should you die , O house of Israel ? ’ The Fairness of God ’ s Judgment
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	12	“ Therefore you , O son of man , say to the children of your people : ‘ The ( M ) righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression ; as for the wickedness of the wicked , ( N ) he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness ; nor shall the righteous be able to live because of his righteousness in the day that he sins. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	13	When I say to the righteous that he shall surely live , ( O ) but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity , none of his righteous works shall be remembered ; but because of the iniquity that he has committed , he shall die .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	14	Again , ( P ) when I say to the wicked , ‘ You shall surely die , ’ if he turns from his sin and does [ d ] what is lawful and [ e ] right ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	15	if the wicked ( Q ) restores the pledge , ( R ) gives back what he has stolen , and walks in ( S ) the statutes of life without committing iniquity , he shall surely live ; he shall not die .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	16	( T ) None of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered against him ; he has done what is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	17	( U ) “ Yet the children of your people say , ‘ The way of the Lord is not [ f ] fair. ’ But it is their way which is not fair !
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	18	( V ) When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity , he shall die because of it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	19	But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right , he shall live because of it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	20	Yet you say , ( W ) ‘ The way of the Lord is not [ g ] fair. ’ O house of Israel , I will judge every one of you according to his own ways. ” The Fall of Jerusalem
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year ( X ) of our captivity , in the tenth month , on the fifth day of the month , ( Y ) that one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said , ( Z ) “ The city has been [ h ] captured ! ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	22	Now ( AA ) the hand of the Lord had been upon me the evening before the man came who had escaped . And He had ( AB ) opened my mouth ; so when he came to me in the morning , my mouth was opened , and I was no longer mute . The Cause of Judah ’ s Ruin
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	23	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	24	“ Son of man , ( AC ) they who inhabit those ( AD ) ruins in the land of Israel are saying , ( AE ) ‘ Abraham was only one , and he inherited the land . ( AF ) But we are many ; the land has been given to us as a ( AG ) possession. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	25	“ Therefore say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : ( AH ) “ You eat meat with blood , you ( AI ) lift up your eyes toward your idols , and ( AJ ) shed blood . Should you then possess the ( AK ) land ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	26	You rely on your sword , you commit abominations , and you ( AL ) defile one another ’ s wives . Should you then possess the land ? ” ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	27	“ Say thus to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ As I live , surely ( AM ) those who are in the ruins shall fall by the sword , and the one who is in the open field ( AN ) I will give to the beasts to be devoured , and those who are in the strongholds and ( AO ) caves shall die of the pestilence .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	28	( AP ) For I will make the land most desolate , [ i ] her ( AQ ) arrogant strength shall cease , and ( AR ) the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	29	Then they shall know that I am the Lord , when I have made the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed. ” ’ Hearing and Not Doing
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	30	“ As for you , son of man , the children of your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses ; and they ( AS ) speak to one another , everyone saying to his brother , ‘ Please come and hear what the word is that comes from the Lord. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	31	So ( AT ) they come to you as people do , they ( AU ) sit before you as My people , and they ( AV ) hear your words , but they do not do them ; ( AW ) for with their mouth they show much love , but ( AX ) their hearts pursue their own gain .
NKJV	Ezekiel	33	32	Indeed you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear your words , but they do ( AY ) not do them .

NKJV	Ezekiel	34	34	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	2	“ Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel , prophesy and say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord God to the shepherds : ( A ) “ Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves ! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	3	( B ) You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool ; you ( C ) slaughter the fatlings , but you do not feed the flock .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	4	( D ) The weak you have not strengthened , nor have you healed those who were sick , nor bound up the broken , nor brought back what was driven away , nor ( E ) sought what was lost ; but with ( F ) force and [ a ] cruelty you have ruled them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	5	( G ) So they were ( H ) scattered because there was no shepherd ; ( I ) and they became food for all the beasts of the field when they were scattered .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	6	My sheep ( J ) wandered through all the mountains , and on every high hill ; yes , My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth , and no one was seeking or searching for them. ”

NKJV	Ezekiel	34	9	therefore , O shepherds , hear the word of the Lord !
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	10	Thus says the Lord God : “ Behold , I am ( M ) against the shepherds , and ( N ) I will require My flock at their hand ; I will cause them to cease feeding the sheep , and the shepherds shall ( O ) feed themselves no more ; for I will ( P ) deliver My flock from their mouths , that they may no longer be food for them. ” God , the True Shepherd
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	11	‘ For thus says the Lord God : “ Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	12	As a ( Q ) shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep , so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on ( R ) a cloudy and dark day .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	13	And ( S ) I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land ; I will feed them on the mountains of Israel , [ b ] in the valleys and in all the inhabited places of the country .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	14	( T ) I will feed them in good pasture , and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel . ( U ) There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	15	I will feed My flock , and I will make them lie down , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	16	( V ) “ I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away , bind up the broken and strengthen what was sick ; but I will destroy ( W ) the fat and the strong , and feed them ( X ) in judgment. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	17	‘ And as for you , O My flock , thus says the Lord God : ( Y ) “ Behold , I shall judge between sheep and sheep , between rams and goats .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	18	Is it too little for you to have eaten up the good pasture , that you must tread down with your feet the [ c ] residue of your pasture—and to have drunk of the clear waters , that you must foul the residue with your feet ?
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	19	And as for My flock , they eat what you have trampled with your feet , and they drink what you have fouled with your feet. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	20	‘ Therefore thus says the Lord God to them : ( Z ) “ Behold , I Myself will judge between the fat and the lean sheep .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	21	Because you have pushed with side and shoulder , butted all the weak ones with your horns , and scattered them abroad ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	22	therefore I will save My flock , and they shall no longer be a prey ; and I will judge between sheep and sheep .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	23	I will establish one ( AA ) shepherd over them , and he shall feed them— ( AB ) My servant David . He shall feed them and be their shepherd .
NKJV	Ezekiel	34	24	And ( AC ) I , the Lord , will be their God , and My servant David ( AD ) a prince among them ; I , the Lord , have spoken .

NKJV	Ezekiel	36	36	Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I , the Lord , have rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate . ( AU ) I , the Lord , have spoken it , and I will do it. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	2	Thus says the Lord God : “ Because ( B ) the enemy has said of you , ‘ Aha ! ( C ) The [ a ] ancient heights ( D ) have become our possession , ’ ” ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	3	therefore prophesy , and say , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ Because they made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side , so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations , ( E ) and you are taken up by the lips of ( F ) talkers and slandered by the people ” —
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	4	therefore , O mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God ! Thus says the Lord God to the mountains , the hills , the [ b ] rivers , the valleys , the desolate wastes , and the cities that have been forsaken , which ( G ) became plunder and ( H ) mockery to the rest of the nations all around—
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	5	therefore thus says the Lord God : ( I ) “ Surely I have spoken in My burning jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom , ( J ) who gave My land to themselves as a possession , with wholehearted joy and [ c ] spiteful minds , in order to plunder its open country. ” ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	6	“ Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel , and say to the mountains , the hills , the rivers , and the valleys , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ Behold , I have spoken in My jealousy and My fury , because you have ( K ) borne the shame of the nations. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	7	Therefore thus says the Lord God : “ I have ( L ) raised My hand in an oath that surely the nations that are around you shall ( M ) bear their own shame .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	8	But you , O mountains of Israel , you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel , for they are about to come .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	9	For indeed I am for you , and I will turn to you , and you shall be tilled and sown .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	10	I will multiply men upon you , all the house of Israel , all of it ; and the cities shall be inhabited and ( N ) the ruins rebuilt .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	11	( O ) I will multiply upon you man and beast ; and they shall increase and [ d ] bear young ; I will make you inhabited as in former times , and do ( P ) better for you than at your beginnings . ( Q ) Then you shall know that I am the Lord .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	12	Yes , I will cause men to walk on you , My people Israel ; ( R ) they shall take possession of you , and you shall be their inheritance ; no more shall you ( S ) bereave them of children. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	13	‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ Because they say to you , ( T ) ‘ You devour men and bereave your nation of children , ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	14	therefore you shall devour men no more , nor bereave your nation anymore , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	15	( U ) “ Nor will I let you hear the taunts of the nations anymore , nor bear the reproach of the peoples anymore , nor shall you cause your nation to stumble anymore , ” says the Lord God. ’ ” The Renewal of Israel
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	16	Moreover the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	17	“ Son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , ( V ) they defiled it by their own ways and deeds ; to Me their way was like ( W ) the uncleanness of a woman in her customary impurity .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	18	Therefore I poured out My fury on them ( X ) for the blood they had shed on the land , and for their idols with which they had defiled it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	19	So I ( Y ) scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed throughout the countries ; I judged them ( Z ) according to their ways and their deeds .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	20	When they came to the nations , wherever they went , they ( AA ) profaned My holy name—when they said of them , ‘ These are the people of the Lord , and yet they have gone out of His land. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	21	But I had concern ( AB ) for My holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations wherever they went .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	22	“ Therefore say to the house of Israel , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ I do not do this for your sake , O house of Israel , ( AC ) but for My holy name ’ s sake , which you have profaned among the nations wherever you went .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	23	And I will sanctify My great name , which has been profaned among the nations , which you have profaned in their midst ; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord , ” says the Lord God , “ when I am ( AD ) hallowed in you before their eyes .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	24	For ( AE ) I will take you from among the nations , gather you out of all countries , and bring you into your own land .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	25	( AF ) Then I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you shall be clean ; I will cleanse you ( AG ) from all your filthiness and from all your idols .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	26	I will give you a ( AH ) new heart and put a new spirit within you ; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	27	I will put My ( AI ) Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes , and you will keep My judgments and do them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	28	( AJ ) Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers ; ( AK ) you shall be My people , and I will be your God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	29	I will ( AL ) deliver you from all your uncleannesses . ( AM ) I will call for the grain and multiply it , and ( AN ) bring no famine upon you .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	30	( AO ) And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields , so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	31	Then ( AP ) you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good ; and you ( AQ ) will [ e ] loathe yourselves in your own sight , for your iniquities and your abominations .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	32	( AR ) Not for your sake do I do this , ” says the Lord God , “ let it be known to you . Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways , O house of Israel ! ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	33	‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities , I will also enable you to dwell in the cities , ( AS ) and the ruins shall be rebuilt .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	34	The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by .
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	35	So they will say , ‘ This land that was desolate has become like the garden of ( AT ) Eden ; and the wasted , desolate , and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited. ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	36	37	‘ Thus says the Lord God : ( AV ) “ I will also let the house of Israel inquire of Me to do this for them : I will ( AW ) increase their men like a flock .

NKJV	Ezekiel	37	37	The ( A ) hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me out ( B ) in the Spirit of the Lord , and set me down in the midst of the valley ; and it was full of bones .
NKJV	Ezekiel	37	2	Then He caused me to pass by them all around , and behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and indeed they were very dry .
NKJV	Ezekiel	37	3	And He said to me , “ Son of man , can these bones live ? ” So I answered , “ O Lord God , ( C ) You know. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	37	4	Again He said to me , “ Prophesy to these bones , and say to them , ‘ O dry bones , hear the word of the Lord !
NKJV	Ezekiel	37	5	Thus says the Lord God to these bones : “ Surely I will ( D ) cause breath to enter into you , and you shall live .

NKJV	Ezekiel	37	7	So I prophesied as I was commanded ; and as I prophesied , there was a noise , and suddenly a rattling ; and the bones came together , bone to bone .
NKJV	Ezekiel	37	8	Indeed , as I looked , the sinews and the flesh came upon them , and the skin covered them over ; but there was no breath in them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	37	9	Also He said to me , “ Prophesy to the breath , prophesy , son of man , and say to the [ a ] breath , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : ( F ) “ Come from the four winds , O breath , and breathe on these slain , that they may live. ” ’ ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	37	10	So I prophesied as He commanded me , ( G ) and [ b ] breath came into them , and they lived , and stood upon their feet , an exceedingly great army .
NKJV	Ezekiel	37	11	Then He said to me , “ Son of man , these bones are the ( H ) whole house of Israel . They indeed say , ( I ) ‘ Our bones are dry , our hope is lost , and we ourselves are cut off ! ’
NKJV	Ezekiel	37	12	Therefore prophesy and say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ Behold , ( J ) O My people , I will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves , and ( K ) bring you into the land of Israel .

NKJV	Ezekiel	40	13	Then he measured the gateway from the roof of one gate chamber to the roof of the other ; the width was twenty-five cubits , as door faces door .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	14	He measured the gateposts , sixty cubits high , and the court all around the gateway extended to the gatepost .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	15	From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the vestibule of the inner gate was fifty cubits .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	16	There were ( L ) beveled window frames in the gate chambers and in their intervening archways on the inside of the gateway all around , and likewise in the vestibules . There were windows all around on the inside . And on each gatepost were ( M ) palm trees . The Outer Court
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	17	Then he brought me into ( N ) the outer court ; and there were ( O ) chambers and a pavement made all around the court ; ( P ) thirty chambers faced the pavement .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	18	The pavement was by the side of the gateways , corresponding to the length of the gateways ; this was the lower pavement .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	19	Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gateway to the front of the inner court exterior , one hundred cubits toward the east and the north . The Northern Gateway
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	20	On the outer court was also a gateway facing north , and he measured its length and its width .

NKJV	Ezekiel	40	22	Its windows and those of its archways , and also its palm trees , had the same measurements as the gateway facing east ; it was ascended by seven steps , and its archway was in front of it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	23	A gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gateway , just as the eastern gateway ; and he measured from gateway to gateway , one hundred cubits . The Southern Gateway
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	24	After that he brought me toward the south , and there a gateway was facing south ; and he measured its gateposts and archways according to these same measurements .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	25	There were windows in it and in its archways all around like those windows ; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	26	Seven steps led up to it , and its archway was in front of them ; and it had palm trees on its gateposts , one on this side and one on that side .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	27	There was also a gateway on the inner court , facing south ; and he measured from gateway to gateway toward the south , one hundred cubits . Gateways of the Inner Court
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	28	Then he brought me to the inner court through the southern gateway ; he measured the southern gateway according to these same measurements .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	29	Also its gate chambers , its gateposts , and its archways were according to these same measurements ; there were windows in it and in its archways all around ; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	30	There were archways all around , ( Q ) twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	31	Its archways faced the outer court , palm trees were on its gateposts , and going up to it were eight steps .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	32	And he brought me into the inner court facing east ; he measured the gateway according to these same measurements .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	33	Also its gate chambers , its gateposts , and its archways were according to these same measurements ; and there were windows in it and in its archways all around ; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	34	Its archways faced the outer court , and palm trees were on its gateposts on this side and on that side ; and going up to it were eight steps .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	35	Then he brought me to the north gateway and measured it according to these same measurements—
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	36	also its gate chambers , its gateposts , and its archways . It had windows all around ; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	37	Its gateposts faced the outer court , palm trees were on its gateposts on this side and on that side , and going up to it were eight steps . Where Sacrifices Were Prepared
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	38	There was a chamber and its entrance by the gateposts of the gateway , where they ( R ) washed the burnt offering .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	39	In the vestibule of the gateway were two tables on this side and two tables on that side , on which to slay the burnt offering , ( S ) the sin offering , and ( T ) the trespass offering .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	41	Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side , by the side of the gateway , eight tables on which they slaughtered the sacrifices .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	42	There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering , one cubit and a half long , one cubit and a half wide , and one cubit high ; on these they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	43	Inside were hooks , a handbreadth wide , fastened all around ; and the flesh of the sacrifices was on the tables . Chambers for Singers and Priests
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	44	Outside the inner gate were the chambers for ( U ) the singers in the inner court , one facing south at the side of the northern gateway , and the other facing north at the side of the [ f ] southern gateway .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	45	Then he said to me , “ This chamber which faces south is for ( V ) the priests who have charge of the temple .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	46	The chamber which faces north is for the priests ( W ) who have charge of the altar ; these are the sons of ( X ) Zadok , from the sons of Levi , who come near the Lord to minister to Him. ” Dimensions of the Inner Court and Vestibule ( Y )
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	47	And he measured the court , one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide , foursquare . The altar was in front of the temple .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	48	Then he brought me to the ( Z ) vestibule of the temple and measured the doorposts of the vestibule , five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side ; and the width of the gateway was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side .
NKJV	Ezekiel	40	49	( AA ) The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits , and the width eleven cubits ; and by the steps which led up to it there were ( AB ) pillars by the doorposts , one on this side and another on that side .

NKJV	Ezekiel	41	41	Then he ( A ) brought me into the [ a ] sanctuary and measured the doorposts , six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side—the width of the tabernacle .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	2	The width of the entryway was ten cubits , and the side walls of the entrance were five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side ; and he measured its length , forty cubits , and its width , twenty cubits .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	3	Also he went inside and measured the doorposts , two cubits ; and the entrance , six cubits high ; and the width of the entrance , seven cubits .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	4	( B ) He measured the length , twenty cubits ; and the width , twenty cubits , beyond the sanctuary ; and he said to me , “ This is the Most Holy Place. ” The Side Chambers on the Wall
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	5	Next , he measured the wall of the [ b ] temple , six cubits . The width of each side chamber all around the temple was four cubits on every side .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	6	( C ) The side chambers were in three stories , one above the other , thirty chambers in each story ; they rested on [ c ] ledges which were for the side chambers all around , that they might be supported , but ( D ) not fastened to the wall of the temple .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	7	As one went up from story to story , the side chambers ( E ) became wider all around , because their supporting ledges in the wall of the temple ascended like steps ; therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the middle one .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	8	I also saw an elevation all around the temple ; it was the foundation of the side chambers , ( F ) a full rod , that is , six cubits high .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	9	The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits , and so also the remaining terrace by the place of the side chambers of the [ d ] temple .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	10	And between it and the wall chambers was a width of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	11	The doors of the side chambers opened on the terrace , one door toward the north and another toward the south ; and the width of the terrace was five cubits all around . The Building at the Western End
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	12	The building that faced the separating courtyard at its western end was seventy cubits wide ; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around , and its length ninety cubits . Dimensions and Design of the Temple Area
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	13	So he measured the temple , one ( G ) hundred cubits long ; and the separating courtyard with the building and its walls was one hundred cubits long ;
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	14	also the width of the eastern face of the temple , including the separating courtyard , was one hundred cubits .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	15	He measured the length of the building behind it , facing the separating courtyard , with its ( H ) galleries on the one side and on the other side , one hundred cubits , as well as the inner [ e ] temple and the porches of the court ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	16	their doorposts and ( I ) the beveled window frames . And the galleries all around their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with ( J ) wood from the ground to the windows—the windows were covered—
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	17	from the space above the door , even to the inner [ f ] room , as well as outside , and on every wall all around , inside and outside , by measure .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	18	And it was made ( K ) with cherubim and ( L ) palm trees , a palm tree between cherub and cherub . Each cherub had two faces ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	19	( M ) so that the face of a man was toward a palm tree on one side , and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side ; thus it was made throughout the temple all around .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	20	From the floor to the space above the door , and on the wall of the sanctuary , cherubim and palm trees were carved .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	21	The ( N ) doorposts of the temple were square , as was the front of the sanctuary ; their appearance was similar .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	22	( O ) The altar was of wood , three cubits high , and its length two cubits . Its corners , its length , and its sides were of wood ; and he said to me , “ This is ( P ) the table that is ( Q ) before the Lord. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	23	( R ) The temple and the sanctuary had two doors .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	24	The doors had two ( S ) panels apiece , two folding panels : two panels for one door and two panels for the other door .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	25	Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the temple just as they were carved on the walls . A wooden canopy was on the front of the vestibule outside .
NKJV	Ezekiel	41	26	There were ( T ) beveled window frames and palm trees on one side and on the other , on the sides of the vestibule—also on the side chambers of the temple and on the canopies .

NKJV	Ezekiel	42	42	Then he ( A ) brought me out into the outer court , by the way toward the ( B ) north ; and he brought me into ( C ) the chamber which was opposite the separating courtyard , and which was opposite the building toward the north .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	2	Facing the length , which was one hundred cubits ( the width was fifty cubits ) , was the north door .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	3	Opposite the inner court of twenty cubits , and opposite the ( D ) pavement of the outer court , was ( E ) gallery against gallery in three stories .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	4	In front of the chambers , toward the inside , was a walk ten cubits wide , at a distance of one cubit ; and their doors faced north .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	5	Now the upper chambers were shorter , because the galleries took away space from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	6	For they were in three stories and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts ; therefore the upper level was [ a ] shortened more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	7	And a wall which was outside ran parallel to the chambers , at the front of the chambers , toward the outer court ; its length was fifty cubits .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	8	The length of the chambers toward the outer court was fifty cubits , whereas that facing the temple was one ( F ) hundred cubits .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	9	At the lower chambers was the entrance on the east side , as one goes into them from the outer court .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	10	Also there were chambers in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , opposite the separating courtyard and opposite the building .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	11	( G ) There was a walk in front of them also , and their appearance was like the chambers which were toward the north ; they were as long and as wide as the others , and all their exits and entrances were according to plan .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	12	And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that were facing south , as one enters them , there was a door in front of the walk , the way directly in front of the wall toward the east .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	13	Then he said to me , “ The north chambers and the south chambers , which are opposite the separating courtyard , are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the Lord ( H ) shall eat the most holy offerings . There they shall lay the most holy offerings— ( I ) the grain offering , the sin offering , and the trespass offering—for the place is holy .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	14	( J ) When the priests enter them , they shall not go out of the holy chamber into the outer court ; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister , for they are holy . They shall put on other garments ; then they may approach that which is for the people. ” Outer Dimensions of the Temple
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	15	Now when he had finished measuring the inner [ b ] temple , he brought me out through the gateway that faces toward the ( K ) east , and measured it all around .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	16	He measured the east side with the [ c ] measuring rod , five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	17	He measured the north side , five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	18	He measured the south side , five hundred rods by the measuring rod .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	19	He came around to the west side and measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod .
NKJV	Ezekiel	42	20	He measured it on the four sides ; ( L ) it had a wall all around , ( M ) five hundred cubits long and five hundred wide , to separate the holy areas from the [ d ] common .

NKJV	Ezekiel	43	43	Afterward he brought me to the gate , the gate ( A ) that faces toward the east .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	2	( B ) And behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east . ( C ) His voice was like the sound of many waters ; ( D ) and the earth shone with His glory .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	3	It was ( E ) like the appearance of the vision which I saw—like the vision which I saw when [ a ] I came ( F ) to destroy the city . The visions were like the vision which I saw ( G ) by the River Chebar ; and I fell on my face .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	4	( H ) And the glory of the Lord came into the [ b ] temple by way of the gate which faces toward the east .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	5	( I ) The Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court ; and behold , ( J ) the glory of the Lord filled the [ c ] temple .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	6	Then I heard Him speaking to me from the temple , while ( K ) a man stood beside me .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	7	And He said to me , “ Son of man , this is ( L ) the place of My throne and ( M ) the place of the soles of My feet , ( N ) where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever . ( O ) No more shall the house of Israel defile My holy name , they nor their kings , by their [ d ] harlotry or with ( P ) the carcasses of their kings on their high places .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	8	( Q ) When they set their threshold by My threshold , and their doorpost by My doorpost , with a wall between them and Me , they defiled My holy name by the abominations which they committed ; therefore I have consumed them in My anger .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	9	Now let them put their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far away from Me , and I will dwell in their midst forever .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	10	“ Son of man , ( R ) describe the [ e ] temple to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities ; and let them measure the pattern .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	11	And if they are ashamed of all that they have done , make known to them the design of the [ f ] temple and its arrangement , its exits and its entrances , its entire design and all its ( S ) ordinances , all its forms and all its laws . Write it down in their sight , so that they may keep its whole design and all its ordinances , and ( T ) perform them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	12	This is the law of the [ g ] temple : The whole area surrounding ( U ) the mountaintop is most holy . Behold , this is the law of the temple . Dimensions of the Altar
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	13	“ These are the measurements of the ( V ) altar in cubits ( W ) ( the [ h ] cubit is one cubit and a handbreadth ) : the base one cubit high and one cubit wide , with a rim all around its edge of one span . This is the height of the altar :
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	14	from the base on the ground to the lower ledge , two cubits ; the width of the ledge , one cubit ; from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge , four cubits ; and the width of the ledge , one cubit .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	15	The altar hearth is four cubits high , with four ( X ) horns extending upward from the [ i ] hearth .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	16	The altar hearth is twelve cubits long , twelve wide , ( Y ) square at its four corners ;
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	17	the ledge , fourteen cubits long and fourteen wide on its four sides , with a rim of half a cubit around it ; its base , one cubit all around ; and ( Z ) its steps face toward the east. ” Consecrating the Altar
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	18	And He said to me , “ Son of man , thus says the Lord God : ‘ These are the ordinances for the altar on the day when it is made , for sacrificing ( AA ) burnt offerings on it , and for ( AB ) sprinkling blood on it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	19	You shall give ( AC ) a young bull for a sin offering to ( AD ) the priests , the Levites , who are of the seed of ( AE ) Zadok , who approach Me to minister to Me , ’ says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	43	20	‘ You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar , on the four corners of the ledge , and on the rim around it ; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it .

NKJV	Ezekiel	44	44	Then He brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary ( A ) which faces toward the east , but it was shut .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	2	And the Lord said to me , “ This gate shall be shut ; it shall not be opened , and no man shall enter by it , ( B ) because the Lord God of Israel has entered by it ; therefore it shall be shut .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	3	As for the ( C ) prince , because he is the prince , he may sit in it to ( D ) eat bread before the Lord ; he shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway , and go out the same way. ” Those Admitted to the Temple
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	4	Also He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the [ a ] temple ; so I looked , and ( E ) behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord ; ( F ) and I fell on my face .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	5	And the Lord said to me , ( G ) “ Son of man , [ b ] mark well , see with your eyes and hear with your ears , all that I say to you concerning all the ( H ) ordinances of the house of the Lord and all its laws . Mark well who may enter the house and all who go out from the sanctuary .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	6	“ Now say to the ( I ) rebellious , to the house of Israel , ‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ O house of Israel , ( J ) let Us have no more of all your abominations .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	7	( K ) When you brought in ( L ) foreigners , ( M ) uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in My sanctuary to defile it—My house—and when you offered ( N ) My food , ( O ) the fat and the blood , then they broke My covenant because of all your abominations .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	8	And you have not ( P ) kept charge of My holy things , but you have set others to keep charge of My sanctuary for you. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	9	Thus says the Lord God : ( Q ) “ No foreigner , uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter My sanctuary , including any foreigner who is among the children of Israel . Laws Governing Priests
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	10	( R ) “ And the Levites who went far from Me , when Israel went astray , who strayed away from Me after their idols , they shall bear their iniquity .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	11	Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary , ( S ) as gatekeepers of the house and ministers of the house ; ( T ) they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and ( U ) they shall stand before them to minister to them .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	12	Because they ministered to them before their idols and ( V ) caused [ c ] the house of Israel to fall into iniquity , therefore I have ( W ) raised My hand in an oath against them , ” says the Lord God , “ that they shall bear their iniquity .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	13	( X ) And they shall not come near Me to minister to Me as priest , nor come near any of My holy things , nor into the Most Holy Place ; but they shall ( Y ) bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	14	Nevertheless I will make them ( Z ) keep charge of the temple , for all its work , and for all that has to be done in it .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	15	( AA ) “ But the priests , the Levites , ( AB ) the sons of Zadok , who kept charge of My sanctuary ( AC ) when the children of Israel went astray from Me , they shall come near Me to minister to Me ; and they ( AD ) shall stand before Me to offer to Me the ( AE ) fat and the blood , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	16	“ They shall ( AF ) enter My sanctuary , and they shall come near ( AG ) My table to minister to Me , and they shall keep My charge .

NKJV	Ezekiel	44	18	( AI ) They shall have linen turbans on their heads and linen trousers on their bodies ; they shall not clothe themselves with anything that causes sweat .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	19	When they go out to the outer court , to the outer court to the people , ( AJ ) they shall take off their garments in which they have ministered , leave them in the holy chambers , and put on other garments ; and in their holy garments they shall ( AK ) not sanctify the people .

NKJV	Ezekiel	44	21	( AN ) No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	22	They shall not take as wife a ( AO ) widow or a divorced woman , but take virgins of the descendants of the house of Israel , or widows of priests .

NKJV	Ezekiel	44	26	( AT ) After he is cleansed , they shall count seven days for him .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	27	And on the day that he goes to the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary , ( AU ) he must offer his sin offering ( AV ) in the inner court , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	28	“ It shall be , in regard to their inheritance , that I ( AW ) am their inheritance . You shall give them no ( AX ) possession in Israel , for I am their possession .
NKJV	Ezekiel	44	29	( AY ) They shall eat the grain offering , the sin offering , and the trespass offering ; ( AZ ) every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs .

NKJV	Ezekiel	45	4	It shall be ( E ) a holy section of the land , belonging to the priests , the ministers of the sanctuary , who come near to minister to the Lord ; it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	5	( F ) An area twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide shall belong to the Levites , the ministers of the [ a ] temple ; they shall have ( G ) twenty [ b ] chambers as a possession . Properties of the City and the Prince
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	6	( H ) “ You shall appoint as the property of the city an area five thousand cubits wide and twenty-five thousand long , adjacent to the district of the holy section ; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	7	( I ) “ The prince shall have a section on one side and the other of the holy district and the city ’ s property ; and bordering on the holy district and the city ’ s property , extending westward on the west side and eastward on the east side , the length shall be side by side with one of the tribal portions , from the west border to the east border .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	8	The land shall be his possession in Israel ; and ( J ) My princes shall no more oppress My people , but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel , according to their tribes. ” Laws Governing the Prince
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	9	‘ Thus says the Lord God : ( K ) “ Enough , O princes of Israel ! ( L ) Remove violence and plundering , execute justice and righteousness , and stop dispossessing My people , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	10	“ You shall have ( M ) honest scales , an honest ephah , and an honest bath .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	11	The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure , so that the bath contains one-tenth of a homer , and the ephah one-tenth of a homer ; their measure shall be according to the homer .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	12	The ( N ) shekel shall be twenty gerahs ; twenty shekels , twenty-five shekels , and fifteen shekels shall be your mina .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	13	“ This is the offering which you shall offer : you shall give one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat , and one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	14	The ordinance concerning oil , the bath of oil , is one-tenth of a bath from a kor . A kor is a homer or ten baths , for ten baths are a homer .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	15	And one lamb shall be given from a flock of two hundred , from the rich pastures of Israel . These shall be for grain offerings , burnt offerings , and peace offerings , ( O ) to make atonement for them , ” says the Lord God .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	16	“ All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	17	Then it shall be the ( P ) prince ’ s part to give burnt offerings , grain offerings , and drink offerings , at the feasts , the New Moons , the Sabbaths , and at all the appointed seasons of the house of Israel . He shall prepare the sin offering , the grain offering , the burnt offering , and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel. ” Keeping the Feasts ( Q )
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	18	‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ In the first month , on the first day of the month , you shall take a young bull without blemish and ( R ) cleanse the sanctuary .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	19	( S ) The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the [ c ] temple , on the four corners of the ledge of the altar , and on the gateposts of the gate of the inner court .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	20	And so you shall do on the seventh day of the month ( T ) for everyone who has sinned unintentionally or in ignorance . Thus you shall make atonement for the temple .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	21	( U ) “ In the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month , you shall observe the Passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	22	And on that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land ( V ) a bull for a sin offering .
NKJV	Ezekiel	45	23	On the ( W ) seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord , seven bulls and seven rams without blemish , daily for seven days , ( X ) and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering .

NKJV	Ezekiel	46	46	‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ The gateway of the inner court that faces toward the east shall be shut the six ( A ) working days ; but on the Sabbath it shall be opened , and on the day of the New Moon it shall be opened .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	2	( B ) The prince shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway from the outside , and stand by the gatepost . The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings . He shall worship at the threshold of the gate . Then he shall go out , but the gate shall not be shut until evening .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	3	Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the entrance to this gateway before the Lord on the Sabbaths and the New Moons .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	4	The burnt offering that ( C ) the prince offers to the Lord on the ( D ) Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish , and a ram without blemish ;
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	5	( E ) and the grain offering shall be one ephah for a ram , and the grain offering for the lambs , [ a ] as much as he wants to give , as well as a hin of oil with every ephah .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	6	On the day of the New Moon it shall be a young bull without blemish , six lambs , and a ram ; they shall be without blemish .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	7	He shall prepare a grain offering of an ephah for a bull , an ephah for a ram , [ b ] as much as he wants to give for the lambs , and a hin of oil with every ephah .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	8	( F ) When the prince enters , he shall go in by way of the vestibule of the gateway , and go out the same way .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	9	“ But when the people of the land ( G ) come before the Lord on the appointed feast days , whoever enters by way of the north ( H ) gate to worship shall go out by way of the south gate ; and whoever enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate . He shall not return by way of the gate through which he came , but shall go out through the opposite gate .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	10	The prince shall then be in their midst . When they go in , he shall go in ; and when they go out , he shall go out .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	11	At the festivals and the appointed feast days ( I ) the grain offering shall be an ephah for a bull , an ephah for a ram , as much as he wants to give for the lambs , and a hin of oil with every ephah .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	12	“ Now when the prince makes a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offering to the Lord , the gate that faces toward the east ( J ) shall then be opened for him ; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day . Then he shall go out , and after he goes out the gate shall be shut .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	13	( K ) “ You shall daily make a burnt offering to the Lord of a lamb of the first year without blemish ; you shall prepare it [ c ] every morning .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	14	And you shall prepare a grain offering with it every morning , a sixth of an ephah , and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour . This grain offering is a perpetual ordinance , to be made regularly to the Lord .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	15	Thus they shall prepare the lamb , the grain offering , and the oil , as a ( L ) regular burnt offering every morning. ” The Prince and Inheritance Laws
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	16	‘ Thus says the Lord God : “ If the prince gives a gift of some of his inheritance to any of his sons , it shall belong to his sons ; it is their possession by inheritance .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	17	But if he gives a gift of some of his inheritance to one of his servants , it shall be his until ( M ) the year of liberty , after which it shall return to the prince . But his inheritance shall belong to his sons ; it shall become theirs .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	18	Moreover ( N ) the prince shall not take any of the people ’ s inheritance by evicting them from their property ; he shall provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property , so that none of My people may be scattered from his property. ” ’ ” How the Offerings Were Prepared
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	19	Now he brought me through the entrance , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy ( O ) chambers of the priests which face toward the north ; and there a place was situated at their extreme western end .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	20	And he said to me , “ This is the place where the priests shall ( P ) boil the trespass offering and the sin offering , and where they shall ( Q ) bake the grain offering , so that they do not bring them out into the outer court ( R ) to sanctify the people. ”
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	21	Then he brought me out into the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and in fact , in every corner of the court there was another court .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	22	In the four corners of the court were enclosed courts , forty cubits long and thirty wide ; all four corners were the same size .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	23	There was a row of building stones all around in them , all around the four of them ; and [ d ] cooking hearths were made under the rows of stones all around .
NKJV	Ezekiel	46	24	And he said to me , “ These are the [ e ] kitchens where the ministers of the [ f ] temple shall ( S ) boil the sacrifices of the people. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 46:5 Lit . the gift of his hand - Ezekiel 46:7 Lit . as much as his hand can reach - Ezekiel 46:13 Lit . morning by morning - Ezekiel 46:23 Lit . boiling places - Ezekiel 46:24 Lit . house of those who boil - Ezekiel 46:24 Lit . house Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Ezekiel	47	47	Then he brought me back to the door of the [ a ] temple ; and there was ( A ) water , flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east , for the front of the temple faced east ; the water was flowing from under the right side of the temple , south of the altar .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	2	He brought me out by way of the north gate , and led me around on the outside to the outer gateway that faces ( B ) east ; and there was water , running out on the right side .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	3	And when ( C ) the man went out to the east with the line in his hand , he measured one thousand cubits , and he brought me through the waters ; the water came up to my ankles .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	4	Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters ; the water came up to my knees . Again he measured one thousand and brought me through ; the water came up to my waist .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	5	Again he measured one thousand , and it was a river that I could not cross ; for the water was too deep , water in which one must swim , a river that could not be crossed .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	6	He said to me , “ Son of man , have you seen this ? ” Then he brought me and returned me to the bank of the river .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	7	When I returned , there , along the bank of the river , were very many ( D ) trees on one side and the other .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	8	Then he said to me : “ This water flows toward the eastern region , goes down into the [ b ] valley , and enters the sea . When it reaches the sea , its waters are healed .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	9	And it shall be that every living thing that moves , wherever [ c ] the rivers go , will live . There will be a very great multitude of fish , because these waters go there ; for they will be healed , and everything will live wherever the river goes .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	10	It shall be that fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim ; they will be places for spreading their nets . Their fish will be of the same kinds as the fish ( E ) of the Great Sea , exceedingly many .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	11	But its swamps and marshes will not be healed ; they will be given over to salt .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	12	( F ) Along the bank of the river , on this side and that , will grow all kinds of trees used for food ; ( G ) their leaves will not wither , and their fruit will not fail . They will bear fruit every month , because their water flows from the sanctuary . Their fruit will be for food , and their leaves for ( H ) medicine. ” [ d ] Borders of the Land ( I )
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	13	Thus says the Lord God : “ These are the ( J ) borders by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel . ( K ) Joseph shall have two portions .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	14	You shall inherit it equally with one another ; for I ( L ) raised My hand in an oath to give it to your fathers , and this land shall ( M ) fall to you as your inheritance .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	15	“ This shall be the border of the land on the north : from the Great Sea , by ( N ) the road to Hethlon , as one goes to ( O ) Zedad ,
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	16	( P ) Hamath , ( Q ) Berothah , Sibraim ( which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ) , to Hazar Hatticon ( which is on the border of Hauran ) .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	17	Thus the boundary shall be from the Sea to ( R ) Hazar Enan , the border of Damascus ; and as for the north , northward , it is the border of Hamath . This is the north side .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	18	“ On the east side you shall mark out the border from between Hauran and Damascus , and between Gilead and the land of Israel , along the Jordan , and along the eastern side of the sea . This is the east side .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	19	“ The south side , toward the [ e ] South , shall be from Tamar to ( S ) the waters of [ f ] Meribah by Kadesh , along the brook to the Great Sea . This is the south side , toward the South .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	20	“ The west side shall be the Great Sea , from the southern boundary until one comes to a point opposite Hamath . This is the west side .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	21	“ Thus you shall ( T ) divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	22	It shall be that you will divide it by ( U ) lot as an inheritance for yourselves , ( V ) and for the strangers who dwell among you and who bear children among you . ( W ) They shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel ; they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel .
NKJV	Ezekiel	47	23	And it shall be that in whatever tribe the stranger dwells , there you shall give him his inheritance , ” says the Lord God .

NKJV	Daniel	1	1	In the third year of the reign of ( B ) Jehoiakim king of Judah , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it .
NKJV	Daniel	1	2	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , with ( C ) some of the articles of [ a ] the house of God , which he carried ( D ) into the land of Shinar to the house of his god ; ( E ) and he brought the articles into the treasure house of his god .
NKJV	Daniel	1	3	Then the king instructed Ashpenaz , the master of his eunuchs , to bring ( F ) some of the children of Israel and some of the king ’ s descendants and some of the nobles ,
NKJV	Daniel	1	4	young men ( G ) in whom there was no blemish , but good-looking , gifted in all wisdom , possessing knowledge and quick to understand , who had ability to serve in the king ’ s palace , and ( H ) whom they might teach the language and [ b ] literature of the Chaldeans .
NKJV	Daniel	1	5	And the king appointed for them a daily provision of the king ’ s delicacies and of the wine which he drank , and three years of training for them , so that at the end of that time they might ( I ) serve before the king .
NKJV	Daniel	1	6	Now from among those of the sons of Judah were Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
NKJV	Daniel	1	7	( J ) To them the chief of the eunuchs gave names : ( K ) he gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar ; to Hananiah , Shadrach ; to Mishael , Meshach ; and to Azariah , Abed-Nego .
NKJV	Daniel	1	8	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself ( L ) with the portion of the king ’ s delicacies , nor with the wine which he drank ; therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself .
NKJV	Daniel	1	9	Now ( M ) God had brought Daniel into the favor and [ c ] goodwill of the chief of the eunuchs .
NKJV	Daniel	1	10	And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel , “ I fear my lord the king , who has appointed your food and drink . For why should he see your faces looking worse than the young men who are your age ? Then you would endanger my head before the king. ”
NKJV	Daniel	1	11	So Daniel said to [ d ] the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ,
NKJV	Daniel	1	12	“ Please test your servants for ten days , and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink .
NKJV	Daniel	1	13	Then let our appearance be examined before you , and the appearance of the young men who eat the portion of the king ’ s delicacies ; and as you see fit , so deal with your servants. ”
NKJV	Daniel	1	14	So he consented with them in this matter , and tested them ten days .
NKJV	Daniel	1	15	And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king ’ s delicacies .
NKJV	Daniel	1	16	Thus [ e ] the steward took away their portion of delicacies and the wine that they were to drink , and gave them vegetables .
NKJV	Daniel	1	17	As for these four young men , ( N ) God gave them ( O ) knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom ; and Daniel had ( P ) understanding in all visions and dreams .
NKJV	Daniel	1	18	Now at the end of the days , when the king had said that they should be brought in , the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
NKJV	Daniel	1	19	Then the king [ f ] interviewed them , and among them all none was found like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ; therefore ( Q ) they served before the king .
NKJV	Daniel	1	20	( R ) And in all matters of wisdom and understanding about which the king examined them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers who were in all his realm .
NKJV	Daniel	1	21	( S ) Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus .

NKJV	Daniel	2	2	( C ) Then the king gave the command to call the magicians , the astrologers , the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams . So they came and stood before the king .
NKJV	Daniel	2	3	And the king said to them , “ I have had a dream , and my spirit is anxious to [ a ] know the dream. ”
NKJV	Daniel	2	4	Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic , ( D ) “ O [ b ] king , live forever ! Tell your servants the dream , and we will give the interpretation. ”
NKJV	Daniel	2	5	The king answered and said to the Chaldeans , “ My [ c ] decision is firm : if you do not make known the dream to me , and its interpretation , you shall be ( E ) cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made an ash heap .
NKJV	Daniel	2	6	( F ) However , if you tell the dream and its interpretation , you shall receive from me gifts , rewards , and great honor . Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation. ”
NKJV	Daniel	2	7	They answered again and said , “ Let the king tell his servants the dream , and we will give its interpretation. ”
NKJV	Daniel	2	8	The king answered and said , “ I know for certain that you would gain time , because you see that my decision is firm :
NKJV	Daniel	2	9	if you do not make known the dream to me , there is only one decree for you ! For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the [ d ] time has changed . Therefore tell me the dream , and I shall know that you can [ e ] give me its interpretation. ”
NKJV	Daniel	2	10	The Chaldeans answered the king , and said , “ There is not a man on earth who can tell the king ’ s matter ; therefore no king , lord , or ruler has ever asked such things of any magician , astrologer , or Chaldean .
NKJV	Daniel	2	11	It is a [ f ] difficult thing that the king requests , and there is no other who can tell it to the king ( G ) except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh. ”
NKJV	Daniel	2	12	For this reason the king was angry and very furious , and gave the command to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
NKJV	Daniel	2	13	So the decree went out , and they began killing the wise men ; and they sought ( H ) Daniel and his companions , to kill them . God Reveals Nebuchadnezzar ’ s Dream
NKJV	Daniel	2	14	Then with counsel and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch , the captain of the king ’ s guard , who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon ;
NKJV	Daniel	2	15	he answered and said to Arioch the king ’ s captain , “ Why is the decree from the king so [ g ] urgent ? ” Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel .
NKJV	Daniel	2	16	So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time , that he might tell the king the interpretation .
NKJV	Daniel	2	17	Then Daniel went to his house , and made the decision known to Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , his companions ,
NKJV	Daniel	2	18	( I ) that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret , so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
NKJV	Daniel	2	19	Then the secret was revealed to Daniel ( J ) in a night vision . So Daniel blessed the God of heaven .
NKJV	Daniel	2	20	Daniel answered and said : ( K ) “ Blessed be the name of God forever and ever , ( L ) For wisdom and might are His .
NKJV	Daniel	2	21	And He changes ( M ) the times and the seasons ; ( N ) He removes kings and raises up kings ; ( O ) He gives wisdom to the wise And knowledge to those who have understanding .
NKJV	Daniel	2	22	( P ) He reveals deep and secret things ; ( Q ) He knows what is in the darkness , And ( R ) light dwells with Him .
NKJV	Daniel	2	23	“ I thank You and praise You , O God of my fathers ; You have given me wisdom and might , And have now made known to me what we ( S ) asked of You , For You have made known to us the king ’ s [ h ] demand. ” Daniel Explains the Dream
NKJV	Daniel	2	24	Therefore Daniel went to Arioch , whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon . He went and said thus to him : “ Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon ; take me before the king , and I will tell the king the interpretation. ”
NKJV	Daniel	2	25	Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king , and said thus to him , “ I have found a man of the [ i ] captives of Judah , who will make known to the king the interpretation. ”
NKJV	Daniel	2	26	The king answered and said to Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , “ Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen , and its interpretation ? ”
NKJV	Daniel	2	27	Daniel answered in the presence of the king , and said , “ The secret which the king has demanded , the wise men , the astrologers , the magicians , and the soothsayers can not declare to the king .
NKJV	Daniel	2	28	( T ) But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar ( U ) what will be in the latter days . Your dream , and the visions of your head upon your bed , were these :
NKJV	Daniel	2	29	As for you , O king , thoughts came to your mind while on your bed , about what would come to pass after this ; ( V ) and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will be .
NKJV	Daniel	2	30	( W ) But as for me , this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living , but for our sakes who make known the interpretation to the king , ( X ) and that you may [ j ] know the thoughts of your heart .
NKJV	Daniel	2	31	“ You , O king , were watching ; and behold , a great image ! This great image , whose splendor was excellent , stood before you ; and its form was awesome .
NKJV	Daniel	2	32	( Y ) This image ’ s head was of fine gold , its chest and arms of silver , its belly and [ k ] thighs of bronze ,
NKJV	Daniel	2	33	its legs of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of [ l ] clay .
NKJV	Daniel	2	34	,
NKJV	Daniel	2	35	,
NKJV	Daniel	2	36	“ This is the dream . Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king .
NKJV	Daniel	2	37	( AF ) You , O king , are a king of kings . ( AG ) For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom , power , strength , and glory ;
NKJV	Daniel	2	38	( AH ) and wherever the children of men dwell , or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven , He has given them into your hand , and has made you ruler over them all— ( AI ) you are this head of gold .
NKJV	Daniel	2	39	But after you shall arise ( AJ ) another kingdom ( AK ) inferior to yours ; then another , a third kingdom of bronze , which shall rule over all the earth .
NKJV	Daniel	2	40	And ( AL ) the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron , inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything ; and like iron that crushes , that kingdom will break in pieces and crush all the others .
NKJV	Daniel	2	41	Whereas you saw the feet and toes , partly of potter ’ s clay and partly of iron , the kingdom shall be divided ; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it , just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay .

NKJV	Daniel	2	43	As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay , they will mingle with the seed of men ; but they will not adhere to one another , just as iron does not mix with clay .
NKJV	Daniel	2	44	And in the days of these kings ( AN ) the God of heaven will set up a kingdom ( AO ) which shall never be destroyed ; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people ; ( AP ) it shall [ n ] break in pieces and [ o ] consume all these kingdoms , and it shall stand forever .
NKJV	Daniel	2	45	( AQ ) Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands , and that it broke in pieces the iron , the bronze , the clay , the silver , and the gold—the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this . The dream is certain , and its interpretation is sure. ” Daniel and His Friends Promoted
NKJV	Daniel	2	46	( AR ) Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face , prostrate before Daniel , and commanded that they should present an offering ( AS ) and incense to him .
NKJV	Daniel	2	47	The king answered Daniel , and said , “ Truly ( AT ) your God is the God of ( AU ) gods , the Lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , since you could reveal this secret. ”
NKJV	Daniel	2	48	( AV ) Then the king promoted Daniel ( AW ) and gave him many great gifts ; and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon , and ( AX ) chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon .
NKJV	Daniel	2	49	Also Daniel petitioned the king , ( AY ) and he set Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon ; but Daniel ( AZ ) sat in [ p ] the gate of the king .

NKJV	Daniel	3	3	So the satraps , the administrators , the governors , the counselors , the treasurers , the judges , the magistrates , and all the officials of the provinces gathered together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up ; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
NKJV	Daniel	3	2	And King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to gather together the satraps , the administrators , the governors , the counselors , the treasurers , the judges , the magistrates , and all the officials of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
NKJV	Daniel	3	4	Then a herald cried [ b ] aloud : “ To you it is commanded , ( A ) O peoples , nations , and languages ,
NKJV	Daniel	3	5	that at the time you hear the sound of the horn , flute , harp , lyre , and psaltery , in symphony with all kinds of music , you shall fall down and worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up ;
NKJV	Daniel	3	6	and whoever does not fall down and worship shall ( B ) be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. ”
NKJV	Daniel	3	7	So at that time , when all the people heard the sound of the horn , flute , harp , and lyre , in symphony with all kinds of music , all the people , nations , and languages fell down and worshiped the gold image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up . Daniel ’ s Friends Disobey the King
NKJV	Daniel	3	8	Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans ( C ) came forward and accused the Jews .
NKJV	Daniel	3	9	They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar , ( D ) “ O king , live forever !
NKJV	Daniel	3	10	You , O king , have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn , flute , harp , lyre , and psaltery , in symphony with all kinds of music , shall fall down and worship the gold image ;
NKJV	Daniel	3	11	and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
NKJV	Daniel	3	12	( E ) There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon : Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego ; these men , O king , have ( F ) not paid due regard to you . They do not serve your gods or worship the gold image which you have set up. ”
NKJV	Daniel	3	13	Then Nebuchadnezzar , in ( G ) rage and fury , gave the command to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego . So they brought these men before the king .
NKJV	Daniel	3	14	Nebuchadnezzar spoke , saying to them , “ Is it true , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego , that you do not serve my gods or worship the gold image which I have set up ?
NKJV	Daniel	3	15	Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn , flute , harp , lyre , and psaltery , in symphony with all kinds of music , and you fall down and worship the image which I have made , ( H ) good ! But if you do not worship , you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace . ( I ) And who is the god who will deliver you from my hands ? ”
NKJV	Daniel	3	16	Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king , “ O Nebuchadnezzar , ( J ) we have no need to answer you in this matter .
NKJV	Daniel	3	17	If that is the case , our ( K ) God whom we serve is able to ( L ) deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and He will deliver us from your hand , O king .
NKJV	Daniel	3	18	But if not , let it be known to you , O king , that we do not serve your gods , nor will we ( M ) worship the gold image which you have set up. ” Saved in Fiery Trial
NKJV	Daniel	3	19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury , and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego . He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated .
NKJV	Daniel	3	20	And he commanded certain mighty men of valor who were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego , and cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
NKJV	Daniel	3	21	Then these men were bound in their coats , their trousers , their turbans , and their other garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
NKJV	Daniel	3	22	Therefore , because the king ’ s command was [ c ] urgent , and the furnace exceedingly hot , the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego .
NKJV	Daniel	3	23	And these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
NKJV	Daniel	3	24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished ; and he rose in haste and spoke , saying to his [ d ] counselors , “ Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? ” They answered and said to the king , “ True , O king. ”
NKJV	Daniel	3	25	“ Look ! ” he answered , “ I see four men loose , ( N ) walking in the midst of the fire ; and they are not hurt , and the form of the fourth is like ( O ) the [ e ] Son of God. ” Nebuchadnezzar Praises God
NKJV	Daniel	3	26	Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the [ f ] mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spoke , saying , “ Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego , servants of the ( P ) Most High God , come out , and come here. ” Then Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego came from the midst of the fire .
NKJV	Daniel	3	27	And the satraps , administrators , governors , and the king ’ s counselors gathered together , and they saw these men ( Q ) on whose bodies the fire had no power ; the hair of their head was not singed nor were their garments affected , and the smell of fire was not on them .
NKJV	Daniel	3	28	Nebuchadnezzar spoke , saying , “ Blessed be the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego , who sent His ( R ) Angel [ g ] and delivered His servants who trusted in Him , and they have frustrated the king ’ s word , and yielded their bodies , that they should not serve nor worship any god except their own God !
NKJV	Daniel	3	29	( S ) Therefore I make a decree that any people , nation , or language which speaks anything amiss against the ( T ) God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-Nego shall be ( U ) cut in pieces , and their houses shall be made an ash heap ; ( V ) because there is no other God who can deliver like this. ”

NKJV	Daniel	4	4	I , Nebuchadnezzar , was at rest in my house , and flourishing in my palace .
NKJV	Daniel	4	2	I thought it good to declare the signs and wonders ( B ) that the Most High God has worked for me .
NKJV	Daniel	4	3	( C ) How great are His signs , And how mighty His wonders ! His kingdom is ( D ) an everlasting kingdom , And His dominion is from generation to generation .
NKJV	Daniel	4	5	I saw a dream which made me afraid , ( E ) and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head ( F ) troubled me .
NKJV	Daniel	4	6	Therefore I issued a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
NKJV	Daniel	4	7	( G ) Then the magicians , the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers came in , and I told them the dream ; but they did not make known to me its interpretation .
NKJV	Daniel	4	8	But at last Daniel came before me ( H ) ( his name is Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god ; ( I ) in him is the Spirit of the Holy God ) , and I told the dream before him , saying :
NKJV	Daniel	4	9	“ Belteshazzar , ( J ) chief of the magicians , because I know that the Spirit of the Holy God is in you , and no secret troubles you , explain to me the visions of my dream that I have seen , and its interpretation .
NKJV	Daniel	4	10	“ These were the visions of my head while on my bed : I was looking , and behold , ( K ) A tree in the midst of the earth , And its height was great .
NKJV	Daniel	4	11	The tree grew and became strong ; Its height reached to the heavens , And it could be seen to the ends of all the earth .
NKJV	Daniel	4	12	Its leaves were lovely , Its fruit abundant , And in it was food for all . ( L ) The beasts of the field found shade under it , The birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches , And all flesh was fed from it .
NKJV	Daniel	4	13	“ I saw in the visions of my head while on my bed , and there was ( M ) a watcher , ( N ) a holy one , coming down from heaven .
NKJV	Daniel	4	14	He cried [ a ] aloud and said thus : ( O ) ‘ Chop down the tree and cut off its branches , Strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit . ( P ) Let the beasts get out from under it , And the birds from its branches .
NKJV	Daniel	4	15	Nevertheless leave the stump and roots in the earth , Bound with a band of iron and bronze , In the tender grass of the field . Let it be wet with the dew of heaven , And let him graze with the beasts On the grass of the earth .
NKJV	Daniel	4	16	Let his heart be changed from that of a man , Let him be given the heart of a beast , And let seven ( Q ) times [ b ] pass over him .
NKJV	Daniel	4	17	‘ This decision is by the decree of the watchers , And the sentence by the word of the holy ones , In order ( R ) that the living may know ( S ) That the Most High rules in the kingdom of men , ( T ) Gives it to whomever He will , And sets over it the ( U ) lowest of men. ’
NKJV	Daniel	4	18	“ This dream I , King Nebuchadnezzar , have seen . Now you , Belteshazzar , declare its interpretation , ( V ) since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation ; but you are able , ( W ) for the Spirit of the Holy God is in you. ” Daniel Explains the Second Dream
NKJV	Daniel	4	19	Then Daniel , ( X ) whose name was Belteshazzar , was astonished for a time , and his thoughts ( Y ) troubled him . So the king spoke , and said , “ Belteshazzar , do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you. ” Belteshazzar answered and said , “ My lord , may ( Z ) the dream [ c ] concern those who hate you , and its interpretation [ d ] concern your enemies !
NKJV	Daniel	4	20	( AA ) “ The tree that you saw , which grew and became strong , whose height reached to the heavens and which could be seen by all the earth ,
NKJV	Daniel	4	21	whose leaves were lovely and its fruit abundant , in which was food for all , under which the beasts of the field dwelt , and in whose branches the birds of the heaven had their home—
NKJV	Daniel	4	22	( AB ) it is you , O king , who have grown and become strong ; for your greatness has grown and reaches to the heavens , ( AC ) and your dominion to the end of the earth .
NKJV	Daniel	4	23	( AD ) “ And inasmuch as the king saw a watcher , a holy one , coming down from heaven and saying , ‘ Chop down the tree and destroy it , but leave its stump and roots in the earth , bound with a band of iron and bronze in the tender grass of the field ; let it be wet with the dew of heaven , ( AE ) and let him graze with the beasts of the field , till seven [ e ] times pass over him ’ ;
NKJV	Daniel	4	24	this is the interpretation , O king , and this is the decree of the Most High , which has come upon my lord the king :
NKJV	Daniel	4	25	They shall ( AF ) drive you from men , your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field , and they shall make you ( AG ) eat grass like oxen . They shall wet you with the dew of heaven , and seven [ f ] times shall pass over you , ( AH ) till you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men , and ( AI ) gives it to whomever He chooses .
NKJV	Daniel	4	26	“ And inasmuch as they gave the command to leave the stump and roots of the tree , your kingdom shall be assured to you , after you come to know that ( AJ ) Heaven [ g ] rules .
NKJV	Daniel	4	27	Therefore , O king , let my advice be acceptable to you ; ( AK ) break off your sins by being righteous , and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor . ( AL ) Perhaps there may be ( AM ) a [ h ] lengthening of your prosperity. ” Nebuchadnezzar ’ s Humiliation
NKJV	Daniel	4	28	All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar .
NKJV	Daniel	4	29	At the end of the twelve months he was walking [ i ] about the royal palace of Babylon .
NKJV	Daniel	4	30	The king ( AN ) spoke , saying , “ Is not this great Babylon , that I have built for a royal dwelling by my mighty power and for the honor of my majesty ? ”
NKJV	Daniel	4	31	( AO ) While the word was still in the king ’ s mouth , ( AP ) a voice fell from heaven : “ King Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : the kingdom has departed from you !
NKJV	Daniel	4	32	And ( AQ ) they shall drive you from men , and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field . They shall make you eat grass like oxen ; and seven [ j ] times shall pass over you , until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men , and gives it to whomever He chooses. ”
NKJV	Daniel	4	33	That very hour the word was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar ; he was driven from men and ate grass like oxen ; his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair had grown like eagles ’ feathers and his nails like birds ’ claws . Nebuchadnezzar Praises God
NKJV	Daniel	4	34	And ( AR ) at the end of the [ k ] time I , Nebuchadnezzar , lifted my eyes to heaven , and my understanding returned to me ; and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him ( AS ) who lives forever : For His dominion is ( AT ) an everlasting dominion , And His kingdom is from generation to generation .
NKJV	Daniel	4	35	( AU ) All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing ; ( AV ) He does according to His will in the army of heaven And among the inhabitants of the earth . ( AW ) No one can restrain His hand Or say to Him , ( AX ) “ What have You done ? ”
NKJV	Daniel	4	36	At the same time my reason returned to me , ( AY ) and for the glory of my kingdom , my honor and splendor returned to me . My counselors and nobles resorted to me , I was ( AZ ) restored to my kingdom , and excellent majesty was ( BA ) added to me .
NKJV	Daniel	4	37	Now I , Nebuchadnezzar , ( BB ) praise and extol and honor the King of heaven , ( BC ) all of whose works are truth , and His ways justice . ( BD ) And those who walk in pride He is able to put down .

NKJV	Daniel	5	5	( E ) In the same hour the fingers of a man ’ s hand appeared and wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king ’ s palace ; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
NKJV	Daniel	5	2	While he tasted the wine , Belshazzar gave the command to bring the gold and silver vessels ( B ) which his [ a ] father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple which had been in Jerusalem , that the king and his lords , his wives , and his concubines might drink from them .
NKJV	Daniel	5	3	Then they brought the gold ( C ) vessels that had been taken from the temple of the house of God which had been in Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , his wives , and his concubines drank from them .
NKJV	Daniel	5	4	They drank wine , ( D ) and praised the gods of gold and silver , bronze and iron , wood and stone .
NKJV	Daniel	5	6	Then the king ’ s countenance changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his hips were loosened and his ( F ) knees knocked against each other .
NKJV	Daniel	5	7	( G ) The king cried [ b ] aloud to bring in ( H ) the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers . The king spoke , saying to the wise men of Babylon , “ Whoever reads this writing , and tells me its interpretation , shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck ; ( I ) and he shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. ”
NKJV	Daniel	5	8	Now all the king ’ s wise men came , ( J ) but they could not read the writing , or make known to the king its interpretation .
NKJV	Daniel	5	9	Then King Belshazzar was greatly ( K ) troubled , his countenance was changed , and his lords were [ c ] astonished .
NKJV	Daniel	5	10	The queen , because of the words of the king and his lords , came to the banquet hall . The queen spoke , saying , “ O king , live forever ! Do not let your thoughts trouble you , nor let your countenance change .
NKJV	Daniel	5	11	( L ) There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God . And in the days of your [ d ] father , light and understanding and wisdom , like the wisdom of the gods , were found in him ; and King Nebuchadnezzar your [ e ] father—your father the king—made him chief of the magicians , astrologers , Chaldeans , and soothsayers .
NKJV	Daniel	5	12	Inasmuch as an excellent spirit , knowledge , understanding , interpreting dreams , solving riddles , and [ f ] explaining enigmas were found in this Daniel , ( M ) whom the king named Belteshazzar , now let Daniel be called , and he will give the interpretation. ” The Writing on the Wall Explained
NKJV	Daniel	5	13	Then Daniel was brought in before the king . The king spoke , and said to Daniel , “ Are you that Daniel [ g ] who is one of the captives from Judah , whom my [ h ] father the king brought from Judah ?
NKJV	Daniel	5	14	I have heard of you , that ( N ) the [ i ] Spirit of God is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
NKJV	Daniel	5	15	Now ( O ) the wise men , the astrologers , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing and make known to me its interpretation , but they could not give the interpretation of the thing .
NKJV	Daniel	5	16	And I have heard of you , that you can give interpretations and [ j ] explain enigmas . ( P ) Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation , you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck , and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. ”
NKJV	Daniel	5	17	Then Daniel answered , and said before the king , “ Let your gifts be for yourself , and give your rewards to another ; yet I will read the writing to the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
NKJV	Daniel	5	18	O king , ( Q ) the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your [ k ] father a kingdom and majesty , glory and honor .
NKJV	Daniel	5	19	And because of the majesty that He gave him , ( R ) all peoples , nations , and languages trembled and feared before him . Whomever he wished , he ( S ) executed ; whomever he wished , he kept alive ; whomever he wished , he set up ; and whomever he wished , he put down .
NKJV	Daniel	5	20	( T ) But when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was hardened in pride , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him .
NKJV	Daniel	5	21	Then he was ( U ) driven from the sons of men , his heart was made like the beasts , and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys . They fed him with grass like oxen , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven , ( V ) till he [ l ] knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men , and appoints over it whomever He chooses .
NKJV	Daniel	5	22	“ But you his son , Belshazzar , ( W ) have not humbled your heart , although you knew all this .
NKJV	Daniel	5	23	( X ) And you have [ m ] lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven . They have brought the ( Y ) vessels of [ n ] His house before you , and you and your lords , your wives and your concubines , have drunk wine from them . And you have praised the gods of silver and gold , bronze and iron , wood and stone , ( Z ) which do not see or hear or know ; and the God who holds your breath in His hand ( AA ) and owns all your ways , you have not glorified .
NKJV	Daniel	5	24	Then the [ o ] fingers of the hand were sent from Him , and this writing was written .
NKJV	Daniel	5	25	“ And this is the inscription that was written : [ p ] MENE , MENE , [ q ] TEKEL , [ r ] UPHARSIN .
NKJV	Daniel	5	26	This is the interpretation of each word . MENE : God has numbered your kingdom , and finished it ;

NKJV	Daniel	6	3	Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the governors and satraps , ( A ) because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king gave thought to setting him over the whole realm .
NKJV	Daniel	6	4	( B ) So the governors and satraps sought to find some charge against Daniel concerning the kingdom ; but they could find no charge or fault , because he was faithful ; nor was there any error or fault found in him .
NKJV	Daniel	6	5	Then these men said , “ We shall not find any charge against this Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God. ”
NKJV	Daniel	6	7	All the governors of the kingdom , the administrators and satraps , the counselors and advisors , have ( D ) consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree , that whoever petitions any god or man for thirty days , except you , O king , shall be cast into the den of lions .
NKJV	Daniel	6	8	Now , O king , establish the decree and sign the writing , so that it can not be changed , according to the ( E ) law of the Medes and Persians , which [ a ] does not alter. ”
NKJV	Daniel	6	9	Therefore King Darius signed the written decree . Daniel in the Lions ’ Den
NKJV	Daniel	6	10	Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed , he went home . And in his upper room , with his windows open ( F ) toward Jerusalem , he knelt down on his knees ( G ) three times that day , and prayed and gave thanks before his God , as was his custom since early days .
NKJV	Daniel	6	11	Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God .
NKJV	Daniel	6	12	( H ) And they went before the king , and spoke concerning the king ’ s decree : “ Have you not signed a decree that every man who petitions any god or man within thirty days , except you , O king , shall be cast into the den of lions ? ” The king answered and said , “ The thing is true , ( I ) according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which [ b ] does not alter. ”
NKJV	Daniel	6	13	So they answered and said before the king , “ That Daniel , ( J ) who is [ c ] one of the captives from Judah , ( K ) does not show due regard for you , O king , or for the decree that you have signed , but makes his petition three times a day. ”
NKJV	Daniel	6	14	And the king , when he heard these words , ( L ) was greatly displeased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he [ d ] labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him .
NKJV	Daniel	6	15	Then these men [ e ] approached the king , and said to the king , “ Know , O king , that it is ( M ) the law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which the king establishes may be changed. ”
NKJV	Daniel	6	16	So the king gave the command , and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions . But the king spoke , saying to Daniel , “ Your God , whom you serve continually , He will deliver you. ”
NKJV	Daniel	6	17	( N ) Then a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den , ( O ) and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signets of his lords , that the purpose concerning Daniel might not be changed . Daniel Saved from the Lions
NKJV	Daniel	6	18	Now the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting ; and no [ f ] musicians were brought before him . ( P ) Also his sleep [ g ] went from him .
NKJV	Daniel	6	19	Then the ( Q ) king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions .
NKJV	Daniel	6	20	And when he came to the den , he cried out with a [ h ] lamenting voice to Daniel . The king spoke , saying to Daniel , “ Daniel , servant of the living God , ( R ) has your God , whom you serve continually , been able to deliver you from the lions ? ”
NKJV	Daniel	6	21	Then Daniel said to the king , ( S ) “ O king , live forever !
NKJV	Daniel	6	22	( T ) My God sent His angel and ( U ) shut the lions ’ mouths , so that they have not hurt me , because I was found innocent before Him ; and also , O king , I have done no wrong before you. ”
NKJV	Daniel	6	23	Now the king was exceedingly glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . So Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no injury whatever was found on him , ( V ) because he believed in his God . Darius Honors God
NKJV	Daniel	6	24	And the king gave the command , ( W ) and they brought those men who had accused Daniel , and they cast them into the den of lions—them , ( X ) their children , and their wives ; and the lions overpowered them , and broke all their bones in pieces before they ever came to the bottom of the den .
NKJV	Daniel	6	25	( Y ) Then King Darius wrote : To all peoples , nations , and languages that dwell in all the earth : Peace be multiplied to you .
NKJV	Daniel	6	26	( Z ) I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men must ( AA ) tremble and fear before the God of Daniel . ( AB ) For He is the living God , And steadfast forever ; His kingdom is the one which shall not be ( AC ) destroyed , And His dominion shall endure to the end .
NKJV	Daniel	6	27	He delivers and rescues , ( AD ) And He works signs and wonders In heaven and on earth , Who has delivered Daniel from the [ i ] power of the lions .
NKJV	Daniel	6	28	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius ( AE ) and in the reign of ( AF ) Cyrus the Persian .

NKJV	Daniel	7	7	“ After this I saw in the night visions , and behold , ( H ) a fourth beast , dreadful and terrible , exceedingly strong . It had huge iron teeth ; it was devouring , breaking in pieces , and trampling the residue with its feet . It was different from all the beasts that were before it , ( I ) and it had ten horns .
NKJV	Daniel	7	2	Daniel spoke , saying , “ I saw in my vision by night , and behold , the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea .
NKJV	Daniel	7	3	And four great beasts ( C ) came up from the sea , each different from the other .
NKJV	Daniel	7	4	The first was ( D ) like a lion , and had eagle ’ s wings . I watched till its wings were plucked off ; and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man , and a ( E ) man ’ s heart was given to it .
NKJV	Daniel	7	5	( F ) “ And suddenly another beast , a second , like a bear . It was raised up on one side , and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth . And they said thus to it : ‘ Arise , devour much flesh ! ’
NKJV	Daniel	7	6	“ After this I looked , and there was another , like a leopard , which had on its back four wings of a bird . The beast also had ( G ) four heads , and dominion was given to it .
NKJV	Daniel	7	8	I was considering the horns , and ( J ) there was another horn , a little one , coming up among them , before whom three of the first horns were plucked out by the roots . And there , in this horn , were eyes like the eyes ( K ) of a man , ( L ) and a mouth speaking [ c ] pompous words . Vision of the Ancient of Days
NKJV	Daniel	7	9	“ I ( M ) watched till thrones were [ d ] put in place , And ( N ) the Ancient of Days was seated ; ( O ) His garment was white as snow , And the hair of His head was like pure wool . His throne was a fiery flame , ( P ) Its wheels a burning fire ;
NKJV	Daniel	7	10	( Q ) A fiery stream issued And came forth from before Him . ( R ) A thousand thousands ministered to Him ; Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him . ( S ) The [ e ] court was seated , And the books were opened .
NKJV	Daniel	7	11	“ I watched then because of the sound of the [ f ] pompous words which the horn was speaking ; ( T ) I watched till the beast was slain , and its body destroyed and given to the burning flame .
NKJV	Daniel	7	12	As for the rest of the beasts , they had their dominion taken away , yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time .
NKJV	Daniel	7	13	“ I was watching in the night visions , And behold , ( U ) One like the Son of Man , Coming with the clouds of heaven ! He came to the Ancient of Days , And they brought Him near before Him .
NKJV	Daniel	7	14	( V ) Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom , That all ( W ) peoples , nations , and languages should serve Him . His dominion is ( X ) an everlasting dominion , Which shall not pass away , And His kingdom the one Which shall not be destroyed . Daniel ’ s Visions Interpreted
NKJV	Daniel	7	15	“ I , Daniel , was grieved in my spirit [ g ] within my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
NKJV	Daniel	7	16	I came near to one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth of all this . So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things :
NKJV	Daniel	7	17	‘ Those great beasts , which are four , are four [ h ] kings which arise out of the earth .
NKJV	Daniel	7	18	But ( Y ) the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom , and possess the kingdom forever , even forever and ever. ’
NKJV	Daniel	7	19	“ Then I wished to know the truth about the fourth beast , which was different from all the others , exceedingly dreadful , with its teeth of iron and its nails of bronze , which devoured , broke in pieces , and trampled the residue with its feet ;
NKJV	Daniel	7	20	and the ten horns that were on its head , and the other horn which came up , before which three fell , namely , that horn which had eyes and a mouth which spoke [ i ] pompous words , whose appearance was greater than his fellows .
NKJV	Daniel	7	21	“ I was watching ; ( Z ) and the same horn was making war against the saints , and prevailing against them ,
NKJV	Daniel	7	22	until the Ancient of Days came , ( AA ) and a judgment was made in favor of the saints of the Most High , and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom .

NKJV	Daniel	7	25	( AD ) He shall speak pompous words against the Most High , Shall ( AE ) persecute [ j ] the saints of the Most High , And shall ( AF ) intend to change times and law . Then ( AG ) the saints shall be given into his hand ( AH ) For a time and times and half a time .

NKJV	Daniel	8	8	Therefore the male goat grew very great ; but when he became strong , the large horn was broken , and in place of it ( F ) four notable ones came up toward the four winds of heaven .
NKJV	Daniel	8	2	I saw in the vision , and it so happened while I was looking , that I was in ( B ) Shushan , [ b ] the [ c ] citadel , which is in the province of Elam ; and I saw in the vision that I was by the River Ulai .
NKJV	Daniel	8	3	Then I lifted my eyes and saw , and there , standing beside the river , was a ram which had two horns , and the two horns were high ; but one was ( C ) higher than the other , and the higher one came up last .
NKJV	Daniel	8	4	I saw the ram pushing westward , northward , and southward , so that no animal could [ d ] withstand him ; nor was there any that could deliver from his hand , ( D ) but he did according to his will and became great .
NKJV	Daniel	8	5	And as I was considering , suddenly a male goat came from the west , across the surface of the whole earth , without touching the ground ; and the goat had a notable ( E ) horn between his eyes .
NKJV	Daniel	8	6	Then he came to the ram that had two horns , which I had seen standing beside the river , and ran at him with furious power .
NKJV	Daniel	8	7	And I saw him confronting the ram ; he was moved with rage against him , [ e ] attacked the ram , and broke his two horns . There was no power in the ram to withstand him , but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him ; and there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand .
NKJV	Daniel	8	9	( G ) And out of one of them came a little horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south , ( H ) toward the east , and toward the ( I ) Glorious Land .
NKJV	Daniel	8	10	( J ) And it grew up to ( K ) the host of heaven ; and ( L ) it cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the ground , and trampled them .
NKJV	Daniel	8	11	( M ) He even exalted himself as high as ( N ) the Prince of the host ; ( O ) and by him ( P ) the daily sacrifices were taken away , and the place of [ f ] His sanctuary was cast down .
NKJV	Daniel	8	12	Because of transgression , ( Q ) an army was given over to the horn to oppose the daily sacrifices ; and he cast ( R ) truth down to the ground . He ( S ) did all this and prospered .
NKJV	Daniel	8	13	Then I heard ( T ) a holy one speaking ; and another holy one said to that certain one who was speaking , “ How long will the vision be , concerning the daily sacrifices and the transgression [ g ] of desolation , the giving of both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled underfoot ? ”
NKJV	Daniel	8	14	And he said to me , “ For two thousand three hundred [ h ] days ; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed. ” Gabriel Interprets the Vision
NKJV	Daniel	8	15	Then it happened , when I , Daniel , had seen the vision and ( U ) was seeking the meaning , that suddenly there stood before me ( V ) one having the appearance of a man .
NKJV	Daniel	8	16	And I heard a man ’ s voice ( W ) between the banks of the Ulai , who called , and said , ( X ) “ Gabriel , make this man understand the vision. ”
NKJV	Daniel	8	17	So he came near where I stood , and when he came I was afraid and ( Y ) fell on my face ; but he said to me , “ Understand , son of man , that the vision refers to the time of the end. ”
NKJV	Daniel	8	18	( Z ) Now , as he was speaking with me , I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground ; ( AA ) but he touched me , and stood me upright .
NKJV	Daniel	8	19	And he said , “ Look , I am making known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation ; ( AB ) for at the appointed time the end shall be .
NKJV	Daniel	8	20	The ram which you saw , having the two horns—they are the kings of Media and Persia .
NKJV	Daniel	8	21	And the [ i ] male goat is the [ j ] kingdom of Greece . The large horn that is between its eyes ( AC ) is the first king .
NKJV	Daniel	8	22	( AD ) As for the broken horn and the four that stood up in its place , four kingdoms shall arise out of that nation , but not with its power .

NKJV	Daniel	9	9	( H ) To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness , though we have rebelled against Him .
NKJV	Daniel	9	2	in the first year of his reign I , Daniel , understood by the books the number of the years specified by the word of the Lord through ( B ) Jeremiah the prophet , that He would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem .
NKJV	Daniel	9	3	( C ) Then I set my face toward the Lord God to make request by prayer and supplications , with fasting , sackcloth , and ashes .
NKJV	Daniel	9	4	And I prayed to the Lord my God , and made confession , and said , “ O ( D ) Lord , great and awesome God , who keeps His covenant and mercy with those who love Him , and with those who keep His commandments ,
NKJV	Daniel	9	5	( E ) we have sinned and committed iniquity , we have done wickedly and rebelled , even by departing from Your precepts and Your judgments .
NKJV	Daniel	9	6	( F ) Neither have we heeded Your servants the prophets , who spoke in Your name to our kings and our princes , to our fathers and all the people of the land .
NKJV	Daniel	9	7	O Lord , ( G ) righteousness belongs to You , but to us shame of face , as it is this day—to the men of Judah , to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel , those near and those far off in all the countries to which You have driven them , because of the unfaithfulness which they have committed against You .
NKJV	Daniel	9	8	“ O Lord , to us belongs shame of face , to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , because we have sinned against You .
NKJV	Daniel	9	10	We have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God , to walk in His laws , which He set before us by His servants the prophets .
NKJV	Daniel	9	11	Yes , ( I ) all Israel has transgressed Your law , and has departed so as not to obey Your voice ; therefore the curse and the oath written in the ( J ) Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out on us , because we have sinned against Him .
NKJV	Daniel	9	12	And He has ( K ) confirmed His words , which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us , by bringing upon us a great disaster ; ( L ) for under the whole heaven such has never been done as what has been done to Jerusalem .
NKJV	Daniel	9	13	( M ) “ As it is written in the Law of Moses , all this disaster has come upon us ; ( N ) yet we have not made our prayer before the Lord our God , that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Your truth .
NKJV	Daniel	9	14	Therefore the Lord has ( O ) kept the disaster in mind , and brought it upon us ; for ( P ) the Lord our God is righteous in all the works which He does , though we have not obeyed His voice .
NKJV	Daniel	9	15	And now , O Lord our God , ( Q ) who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and made Yourself ( R ) a name , as it is this day—we have sinned , we have done wickedly !
NKJV	Daniel	9	16	“ O Lord , ( S ) according to all Your righteousness , I pray , let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem , ( T ) Your holy mountain ; because for our sins , ( U ) and for the iniquities of our fathers , ( V ) Jerusalem and Your people ( W ) are a reproach to all those around us .
NKJV	Daniel	9	17	Now therefore , our God , hear the prayer of Your servant , and his supplications , ( X ) and ( Y ) for the Lord ’ s sake [ a ] cause Your face to shine on [ b ] Your sanctuary , ( Z ) which is desolate .
NKJV	Daniel	9	18	( AA ) O my God , incline Your ear and hear ; open Your eyes ( AB ) and see our desolations , and the city ( AC ) which is called by Your name ; for we do not present our supplications before You because of our righteous deeds , but because of Your great mercies .
NKJV	Daniel	9	19	O Lord , hear ! O Lord , forgive ! O Lord , listen and act ! Do not delay for Your own sake , my God , for Your city and Your people are called by Your name. ” The Seventy-Weeks Prophecy
NKJV	Daniel	9	20	Now while I was speaking , praying , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God ,
NKJV	Daniel	9	21	yes , while I was speaking in prayer , the man ( AD ) Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , [ c ] being caused to fly swiftly , reached me about the time of the evening offering .
NKJV	Daniel	9	22	And he informed me , and talked with me , and said , “ O Daniel , I have now come forth to give you skill to understand .
NKJV	Daniel	9	23	At the beginning of your supplications the [ d ] command went out , and I have come to tell you , for you are greatly ( AE ) beloved ; therefore ( AF ) consider the matter , and understand the vision :
NKJV	Daniel	9	24	“ Seventy [ e ] weeks are determined For your people and for your holy city , To finish the transgression , [ f ] To make an end of sins , ( AG ) To make reconciliation for iniquity , ( AH ) To bring in everlasting righteousness , To seal up vision and prophecy , ( AI ) And to anoint [ g ] the Most Holy .
NKJV	Daniel	9	25	“ Know therefore and understand , That from the going forth of the command To restore and build Jerusalem Until ( AJ ) Messiah ( AK ) the Prince , There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks ; The [ h ] street shall be built again , and the [ i ] wall , Even in troublesome times .
NKJV	Daniel	9	26	“ And after the sixty-two weeks ( AL ) Messiah shall [ j ] be cut off , ( AM ) but not for Himself ; And ( AN ) the people of the prince who is to come ( AO ) Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary . The end of it shall be with a flood , And till the end of the war desolations are determined .
NKJV	Daniel	9	27	Then he shall confirm ( AP ) a [ k ] covenant with ( AQ ) many for one week ; But in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering . And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate , ( AR ) Even until the consummation , which is determined , Is poured out on the [ l ] desolate. ” Footnotes - Daniel 9:17 Be gracious - Daniel 9:17 The temple - Daniel 9:21 Or being weary with weariness - Daniel 9:23 Lit . word - Daniel 9:24 Lit . sevens , and so throughout the chapter - Daniel 9:24 So with Qr. , LXX , Syr. , Vg . ; Kt. , Theodotion To seal up - Daniel 9:24 The Most Holy Place - Daniel 9:25 Or open square - Daniel 9:25 Or moat - Daniel 9:26 Suffer the death penalty - Daniel 9:27 Or treaty - Daniel 9:27 Or desolator Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Daniel	10	10	( E ) Suddenly , a hand touched me , which made me tremble on my knees and on the palms of my hands .
NKJV	Daniel	10	2	In those days I , Daniel , was mourning three full weeks .
NKJV	Daniel	10	3	I ate no [ b ] pleasant food , no meat or wine came into my mouth , nor did I anoint myself at all , till three whole weeks were fulfilled .
NKJV	Daniel	10	4	Now on the twenty-fourth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , that is , the [ c ] Tigris ,
NKJV	Daniel	10	5	I lifted my eyes and looked , and behold , a certain man clothed in ( B ) linen , whose waist was ( C ) girded with gold of Uphaz !
NKJV	Daniel	10	6	His body was like beryl , his face like the appearance of lightning , his eyes like torches of fire , his arms and feet like burnished bronze in color , ( D ) and the sound of his words like the voice of a multitude .
NKJV	Daniel	10	7	And I , Daniel , alone saw the vision , for the men who were with me did not see the vision ; but a great terror fell upon them , so that they fled to hide themselves .
NKJV	Daniel	10	8	Therefore I was left alone when I saw this great vision , and no strength remained in me ; for my [ d ] vigor was turned to [ e ] frailty in me , and I retained no strength .
NKJV	Daniel	10	9	Yet I heard the sound of his words ; and while I heard the sound of his words I was in a deep sleep on my face , with my face to the ground . Prophecies Concerning Persia and Greece
NKJV	Daniel	10	11	And he said to me , “ O Daniel , ( F ) man greatly beloved , understand the words that I speak to you , and stand upright , for I have now been sent to you. ” While he was speaking this word to me , I stood trembling .
NKJV	Daniel	10	12	Then he said to me , ( G ) “ Do not fear , Daniel , for from the first day that you set your heart to understand , and to humble yourself before your God , ( H ) your words were heard ; and I have come because of your words .
NKJV	Daniel	10	13	( I ) But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days ; and behold , ( J ) Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me , for I had been left alone there with the kings of Persia .
NKJV	Daniel	10	14	Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people ( K ) in the latter days , ( L ) for the vision refers to many days yet to come. ”
NKJV	Daniel	10	15	When he had spoken such words to me , ( M ) I [ f ] turned my face toward the ground and became speechless .
NKJV	Daniel	10	16	And suddenly , ( N ) one having the likeness of the [ g ] sons of men ( O ) touched my lips ; then I opened my mouth and spoke , saying to him who stood before me , “ My lord , because of the vision ( P ) my sorrows have [ h ] overwhelmed me , and I have retained no strength .
NKJV	Daniel	10	17	For how can this servant of my lord talk with you , my lord ? As for me , no strength remains in me now , nor is any breath left in me. ”
NKJV	Daniel	10	18	Then again , the one having the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me .
NKJV	Daniel	10	19	( Q ) And he said , “ O man greatly beloved , ( R ) fear not ! Peace be to you ; be strong , yes , be strong ! ” So when he spoke to me I was strengthened , and said , “ Let my lord speak , for you have strengthened me. ”
NKJV	Daniel	10	20	Then he said , “ Do you know why I have come to you ? And now I must return to fight ( S ) with the prince of Persia ; and when I have gone forth , indeed the prince of Greece will come .
NKJV	Daniel	10	21	But I will tell you what is noted in the Scripture of Truth . ( No one upholds me against these , ( T ) except Michael your prince .

NKJV	Daniel	11	6	And at the end of some years they shall join forces , for the daughter of the king of the South shall go to the king of the North to make an agreement ; but she shall not retain the power of her [ a ] authority , and neither he nor his [ b ] authority shall stand ; but she shall be given up , with those who brought her , and with him who begot her , and with him who strengthened her in those times .
NKJV	Daniel	11	7	But from a branch of her roots one shall arise in his place , who shall come with an army , enter the fortress of the king of the North , and deal with them and prevail .
NKJV	Daniel	11	8	And he shall also carry their gods captive to Egypt , with their [ c ] princes and their precious articles of silver and gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the North .
NKJV	Daniel	11	9	“ Also the king of the North shall come to the kingdom of the king of the South , but shall return to his own land .
NKJV	Daniel	11	10	However his sons shall stir up strife , and assemble a multitude of great forces ; and one shall certainly come ( G ) and overwhelm and pass through ; then he shall return ( H ) to his fortress and stir up strife .
NKJV	Daniel	11	12	When he has taken away the multitude , his heart will be [ d ] lifted up ; and he will cast down tens of thousands , but he will not prevail .
NKJV	Daniel	11	13	For the king of the North will return and muster a multitude greater than the former , and shall certainly come at the end of some years with a great army and much equipment .
NKJV	Daniel	11	14	“ Now in those times many shall rise up against the king of the South . Also , [ e ] violent men of your people shall exalt themselves [ f ] in fulfillment of the vision , but they shall ( K ) fall .
NKJV	Daniel	11	15	So the king of the North shall come and ( L ) build a siege mound , and take a fortified city ; and the [ g ] forces of the South shall not withstand him . Even his choice troops shall have no strength to resist .
NKJV	Daniel	11	16	But he who comes against him ( M ) shall do according to his own will , and ( N ) no one shall stand against him . He shall stand in the Glorious Land with destruction in his [ h ] power .
NKJV	Daniel	11	17	“ He shall also ( O ) set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom , and [ i ] upright ones with him ; thus shall he do . And he shall give him the daughter of women to destroy it ; but she shall not stand with him , ( P ) or be for him .
NKJV	Daniel	11	18	After this he shall turn his face to the coastlands , and shall take many . But a ruler shall bring the reproach against them to an end ; and with the reproach removed , he shall turn back on him .
NKJV	Daniel	11	19	Then he shall turn his face toward the fortress of his own land ; but he shall ( Q ) stumble and fall , ( R ) and not be found .
NKJV	Daniel	11	20	“ There shall arise in his place one who imposes taxes on the glorious kingdom ; but within a few days he shall be destroyed , but not in anger or in battle .
NKJV	Daniel	11	21	And in his place ( S ) shall arise a vile person , to whom they will not give the honor of royalty ; but he shall come in peaceably , and seize the kingdom by intrigue .
NKJV	Daniel	11	22	With the [ j ] force of a ( T ) flood they shall be swept away from before him and be broken , ( U ) and also the prince of the covenant .
NKJV	Daniel	11	23	And after the league is made with him ( V ) he shall act deceitfully , for he shall come up and become strong with a small number of people .
NKJV	Daniel	11	24	He shall enter peaceably , even into the richest places of the province ; and he shall do what his fathers have not done , nor his forefathers : he shall disperse among them the plunder , [ k ] spoil , and riches ; and he shall devise his plans against the strongholds , but only for a time .
NKJV	Daniel	11	25	“ He shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South with a great army . And the king of the South shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army ; but he shall not stand , for they shall devise plans against him .
NKJV	Daniel	11	26	Yes , those who eat of the portion of his delicacies shall destroy him ; his army shall [ l ] be swept away , and many shall fall down slain .
NKJV	Daniel	11	27	Both these kings ’ hearts shall be bent on evil , and they shall speak lies at the same table ; but it shall not prosper , for the end will still be at the ( W ) appointed time .
NKJV	Daniel	11	28	While returning to his land with great riches , his heart shall be moved against the holy covenant ; so he shall do damage and return to his own land . The Northern King ’ s Blasphemies
NKJV	Daniel	11	29	“ At the appointed time he shall return and go toward the south ; but it shall not be like the former or the latter .
NKJV	Daniel	11	30	( X ) For ships from [ m ] Cyprus shall come against him ; therefore he shall be grieved , and return in rage against the holy covenant , and do damage . “ So he shall return and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant .
NKJV	Daniel	11	31	And [ n ] forces shall be mustered by him , ( Y ) and they shall defile the sanctuary fortress ; then they shall take away the daily sacrifices , and place there the abomination of desolation .
NKJV	Daniel	11	32	Those who do wickedly against the covenant he shall [ o ] corrupt with flattery ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and carry out great exploits .
NKJV	Daniel	11	33	And those of the people who understand shall instruct many ; yet for many days they shall fall by sword and flame , by captivity and plundering .
NKJV	Daniel	11	34	Now when they fall , they shall be aided with a little help ; but many shall join with them by [ p ] intrigue .
NKJV	Daniel	11	35	And some of those of understanding shall fall , ( Z ) to refine them , purify them , and make them white , until the time of the end ; because it is still for the appointed time .
NKJV	Daniel	11	36	“ Then the king shall do according to his own will : he shall ( AA ) exalt and magnify himself above every god , shall speak blasphemies against the God of gods , and shall prosper till the wrath has been accomplished ; for what has been determined shall be done .
NKJV	Daniel	11	37	He shall regard neither the [ q ] God of his fathers nor the desire of women , ( AB ) nor regard any god ; for he shall exalt himself above them all .
NKJV	Daniel	11	38	But in their place he shall honor a god of fortresses ; and a god which his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver , with precious stones and pleasant things .
NKJV	Daniel	11	39	Thus he shall act against the strongest fortresses with a foreign god , which he shall acknowledge , and advance its glory ; and he shall cause them to rule over many , and divide the land for [ r ] gain . The Northern King ’ s Conquests
NKJV	Daniel	11	40	“ At the ( AC ) time of the end the king of the South shall attack him ; and the king of the North shall come against him ( AD ) like a whirlwind , with chariots , ( AE ) horsemen , and with many ships ; and he shall enter the countries , overwhelm them , and pass through .
NKJV	Daniel	11	41	He shall also enter the Glorious Land , and many countries shall be overthrown ; but these shall escape from his hand : ( AF ) Edom , Moab , and the [ s ] prominent people of Ammon .
NKJV	Daniel	11	42	He shall stretch out his hand against the countries , and the land of ( AG ) Egypt shall not escape .
NKJV	Daniel	11	43	He shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt ; also the Libyans and Ethiopians shall follow ( AH ) at his heels .
NKJV	Daniel	11	44	But news from the east and the north shall trouble him ; therefore he shall go out with great fury to destroy and annihilate many .
NKJV	Daniel	11	45	And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the seas and ( AI ) the glorious holy mountain ; ( AJ ) yet he shall come to his end , and no one will help him .

NKJV	Daniel	12	12	Blessed is he who waits , and comes to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days .

NKJV	Daniel	12	3	Those who are wise shall ( F ) shine Like the brightness of the firmament , ( G ) And those who turn many to righteousness ( H ) Like the stars forever and ever .
NKJV	Daniel	12	4	“ But you , Daniel , ( I ) shut up the words , and seal the book until the time of the end ; many shall ( J ) run to and fro , and knowledge shall increase. ”
NKJV	Daniel	12	5	Then I , Daniel , looked ; and there stood two others , one on this riverbank and the other on that ( K ) riverbank .
NKJV	Daniel	12	6	And one said to the man clothed in ( L ) linen , who was above the waters of the river , ( M ) “ How long shall the fulfillment of these wonders be ? ”
NKJV	Daniel	12	7	Then I heard the man clothed in linen , who was above the waters of the river , when he ( N ) held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven , and swore by Him ( O ) who lives forever , ( P ) that it shall be for a time , times , and half a time ; ( Q ) and when the power of ( R ) the holy people has been completely shattered , all these things shall be finished .
NKJV	Daniel	12	8	Although I heard , I did not understand . Then I said , “ My lord , what shall be the end of these things ? ”
NKJV	Daniel	12	9	And he said , “ Go your way , Daniel , for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end .
NKJV	Daniel	12	10	( S ) Many shall be purified , made white , and refined , ( T ) but the wicked shall do wickedly ; and none of the wicked shall understand , but ( U ) the wise shall understand .

NKJV	Hosea	1	1	The word of the Lord that came to Hosea the son of Beeri , in the days of ( A ) Uzziah , ( B ) Jotham , ( C ) Ahaz , and ( D ) Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of ( E ) Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel . The Family of Hosea
NKJV	Hosea	1	2	When the Lord began to speak by Hosea , the Lord said to Hosea : ( F ) “ Go , take yourself a wife of harlotry And children of harlotry , For ( G ) the land has committed great [ a ] harlotry By departing from the Lord. ”
NKJV	Hosea	1	3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim , and she conceived and bore him a son .
NKJV	Hosea	1	4	Then the Lord said to him : “ Call his name Jezreel , For in a little while ( H ) I will avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu , ( I ) And bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel .
NKJV	Hosea	1	5	( J ) It shall come to pass in that day That I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel. ”
NKJV	Hosea	1	6	And she conceived again and bore a daughter . Then God said to him : “ Call her name [ b ] Lo-Ruhamah , ( K ) For I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel , [ c ] But I will utterly take them away .
NKJV	Hosea	1	7	( L ) Yet I will have mercy on the house of Judah , Will save them by the Lord their God , And ( M ) will not save them by bow , Nor by sword or battle , By horses or horsemen. ”
NKJV	Hosea	1	8	Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah , she conceived and bore a son .
NKJV	Hosea	1	9	Then God said : “ Call his name [ d ] Lo-Ammi , For you are not My people , And I will not be your God . The Restoration of Israel
NKJV	Hosea	1	10	“ Yet ( N ) the number of the children of Israel Shall be as the sand of the sea , Which can not be measured or numbered .

NKJV	Hosea	1	11	( R ) Then the children of Judah and the children of Israel Shall be gathered together , And appoint for themselves one head ; And they shall come up out of the land , For great will be the day of Jezreel ! Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Hosea	2	4	“ I will not have mercy on her children , For they are the ( F ) children of harlotry .

NKJV	Hosea	2	6	“ Therefore , behold , ( H ) I will hedge up your way with thorns , And [ e ] wall her in , So that she can not find her paths .
NKJV	Hosea	2	7	She will [ f ] chase her lovers , But not overtake them ; Yes , she will seek them , but not find them . Then she will say , ( I ) ‘ I will go and return to my ( J ) first husband , For then it was better for me than now. ’
NKJV	Hosea	2	8	For she did not ( K ) know That I gave her grain , new wine , and oil , And multiplied her silver and gold— Which they prepared for Baal .

NKJV	Hosea	8	2	( B ) Israel will cry to Me , ‘ My God , ( C ) we know You ! ’
NKJV	Hosea	8	3	Israel has rejected the good ; The enemy will pursue him .
NKJV	Hosea	8	4	“ They ( D ) set up kings , but not by Me ; They made princes , but I did not acknowledge them . From their silver and gold They made idols for themselves— That they might be cut off .
NKJV	Hosea	8	5	Your [ b ] calf [ c ] is rejected , O Samaria ! My anger is aroused against them— ( E ) How long until they attain to innocence ?
NKJV	Hosea	8	6	For from Israel is even this : A ( F ) workman made it , and it is not God ; But the calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces .
NKJV	Hosea	8	7	“ They ( G ) sow the wind , And reap the whirlwind . The stalk has no bud ; It shall never produce meal . If it should produce , ( H ) Aliens would swallow it up .
NKJV	Hosea	8	9	For they have gone up to Assyria , Like ( K ) a wild donkey alone by itself ; Ephraim ( L ) has hired lovers .
NKJV	Hosea	8	10	Yes , though they have hired among the nations , Now ( M ) I will gather them ; And they shall [ d ] sorrow a little , Because of the [ e ] burden of ( N ) the king of princes .
NKJV	Hosea	8	11	“ Because Ephraim has made many altars for sin , They have become for him altars for sinning .
NKJV	Hosea	8	12	I have written for him ( O ) the great things of My law , But they were considered a strange thing .

NKJV	Hosea	9	7	The ( I ) days of punishment have come ; The days of recompense have come . Israel knows ! The prophet is a ( J ) fool , ( K ) The spiritual man is insane , Because of the greatness of your iniquity and great enmity .
NKJV	Hosea	9	8	The ( L ) watchman of Ephraim is with my God ; But the prophet is a [ a ] fowler ’ s snare in all his ways— Enmity in the house of his God .
NKJV	Hosea	9	10	“ I found Israel Like grapes in the ( O ) wilderness ; I saw your fathers As the ( P ) firstfruits on the fig tree in its first season . But they went to ( Q ) Baal Peor , And [ b ] separated themselves to that shame ; ( R ) They became an abomination like the thing they loved .
NKJV	Hosea	9	11	As for Ephraim , their glory shall fly away like a bird— No birth , no pregnancy , and no conception !
NKJV	Hosea	9	12	Though they bring up their children , Yet I will bereave them to the last man . Yes , ( S ) woe to them when I depart from them !
NKJV	Hosea	9	13	Just ( T ) as I saw Ephraim like Tyre , planted in a pleasant place , So Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer. ”
NKJV	Hosea	9	14	Give them , O Lord— What will You give ? Give them ( U ) a miscarrying womb And dry breasts !
NKJV	Hosea	9	15	“ All their wickedness is in ( V ) Gilgal , For there I hated them . Because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them from My house ; I will love them no more . ( W ) All their princes are rebellious .

NKJV	Hosea	10	2	Their heart is ( C ) divided ; [ a ] Now they are held guilty . He will break down their altars ; He will ruin their sacred pillars .

NKJV	Hosea	10	4	They have spoken words , Swearing falsely in making a covenant . Thus judgment springs up ( D ) like hemlock in the furrows of the field .
NKJV	Hosea	10	5	The inhabitants of Samaria fear Because of the ( E ) calf [ b ] of Beth Aven . For its people mourn for it , And [ c ] its priests shriek for it— Because its ( F ) glory has departed from it .

NKJV	Hosea	10	9	“ O Israel , you have sinned from the days of ( K ) Gibeah ; There they stood . The ( L ) battle in Gibeah against the children of [ e ] iniquity Did not [ f ] overtake them .
NKJV	Hosea	10	11	Ephraim is ( N ) a trained heifer That loves to thresh grain ; But I harnessed her fair neck , I will make Ephraim [ h ] pull a plow . Judah shall plow ; Jacob shall break his clods. ”
NKJV	Hosea	10	12	Sow for yourselves righteousness ; Reap in mercy ; ( O ) Break up your fallow ground , For it is time to seek the Lord , Till He ( P ) comes and rains righteousness on you .
NKJV	Hosea	10	13	( Q ) You have plowed wickedness ; You have reaped iniquity . You have eaten the fruit of lies , Because you trusted in your own way , In the multitude of your mighty men .
NKJV	Hosea	10	14	Therefore tumult shall arise among your people , And all your fortresses shall be plundered As Shalman plundered Beth Arbel in the day of battle— A mother dashed in pieces upon her children .

NKJV	Joel	2	2	( D ) A day of darkness and gloominess , A day of clouds and thick darkness , Like the morning clouds spread over the mountains .

NKJV	Joel	2	5	( J ) With a noise like chariots Over mountaintops they leap , Like the noise of a flaming fire that devours the stubble , Like a strong people set in battle array .
NKJV	Joel	2	6	Before them the people writhe in pain ; ( K ) All faces [ c ] are drained of color .
NKJV	Joel	2	7	They run like mighty men , They climb the wall like men of war ; Every one marches in formation , And they do not break ( L ) ranks .
NKJV	Joel	2	8	They do not push one another ; Every one marches in his own [ d ] column . Though they lunge between the weapons , They are not [ e ] cut down .
NKJV	Joel	2	9	They run to and fro in the city , They run on the wall ; They climb into the houses , They ( M ) enter at the windows ( N ) like a thief .
NKJV	Joel	2	10	( O ) The earth quakes before them , The heavens tremble ; ( P ) The sun and moon grow dark , And the stars diminish their brightness .
NKJV	Joel	2	11	( Q ) The Lord gives voice before His army , For His camp is very great ; ( R ) For strong is the One who executes His word . For the ( S ) day of the Lord is great and very terrible ; ( T ) Who can endure it ? A Call to Repentance
NKJV	Joel	2	12	“ Now , therefore , ” says the Lord , ( U ) “ Turn to Me with all your heart , With fasting , with weeping , and with mourning. ”
NKJV	Joel	2	13	So ( V ) rend your heart , and not ( W ) your garments ; Return to the Lord your God , For He is ( X ) gracious and merciful , Slow to anger , and of great kindness ; And He relents from doing harm .
NKJV	Joel	2	14	( Y ) Who knows if He will turn and relent , And leave ( Z ) a blessing behind Him— ( AA ) A grain offering and a drink offering For the Lord your God ?

NKJV	Joel	2	16	Gather the people , ( AD ) Sanctify the congregation , Assemble the elders , Gather the children and nursing babes ; ( AE ) Let the bridegroom go out from his chamber , And the bride from her dressing room .
NKJV	Joel	2	17	Let the priests , who minister to the Lord , Weep ( AF ) between the porch and the altar ; Let them say , ( AG ) “ Spare Your people , O Lord , And do not give Your heritage to reproach , That the nations should [ g ] rule over them . ( AH ) Why should they say among the peoples , ‘ Where is their God ? ’ ” The Land Refreshed ( AI )
NKJV	Joel	2	18	Then the Lord will ( AJ ) be zealous for His land , And pity His people .
NKJV	Joel	2	19	The Lord will answer and say to His people , “ Behold , I will send you ( AK ) grain and new wine and oil , And you will be satisfied by them ; I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations .
NKJV	Joel	2	20	“ But ( AL ) I will remove far from you ( AM ) the northern army , And will drive him away into a barren and desolate land , With his face toward the eastern sea And his back ( AN ) toward the western sea ; His stench will come up , And his foul odor will rise , Because he has done [ h ] monstrous things. ”
NKJV	Joel	2	21	Fear not , O land ; Be glad and rejoice , For the Lord has done [ i ] marvelous things !

NKJV	Jonah	1	1	Now the word of the Lord came to ( A ) Jonah the son of Amittai , saying ,
NKJV	Jonah	1	2	“ Arise , go to ( B ) Nineveh , that ( C ) great city , and cry out against it ; for ( D ) their wickedness has come up before Me. ”
NKJV	Jonah	1	3	But Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord . He went down to ( E ) Joppa , and found a ship going to Tarshish ; so he paid the fare , and went down into it , to go with them to ( F ) Tarshish ( G ) from the presence of the Lord . The Storm at Sea
NKJV	Jonah	1	4	But ( H ) the Lord [ a ] sent out a great wind on the sea , and there was a mighty tempest on the sea , so that the ship was about to be broken up .
NKJV	Jonah	1	5	Then the mariners were afraid ; and every man cried out to his god , and threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea , to lighten [ b ] the load . But Jonah had gone down ( I ) into the lowest parts of the ship , had lain down , and was fast asleep .
NKJV	Jonah	1	6	So the captain came to him , and said to him , “ What do you mean , sleeper ? Arise , ( J ) call on your God ; ( K ) perhaps your God will consider us , so that we may not perish. ”
NKJV	Jonah	1	7	And they said to one another , “ Come , let us ( L ) cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this trouble has come upon us. ” So they cast lots , and the lot fell on Jonah .
NKJV	Jonah	1	8	Then they said to him , ( M ) “ Please tell us ! For whose cause is this trouble upon us ? What is your occupation ? And where do you come from ? What is your country ? And of what people are you ? ”
NKJV	Jonah	1	9	So he said to them , “ I am a Hebrew ; and I fear [ c ] the Lord , the God of heaven , ( N ) who made the sea and the dry land. ” Jonah Thrown into the Sea
NKJV	Jonah	1	10	Then the men were exceedingly afraid , and said to him , “ Why have you done this ? ” For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord , because he had told them .
NKJV	Jonah	1	11	Then they said to him , “ What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us ? ” —for the sea was growing more tempestuous .
NKJV	Jonah	1	12	And he said to them , ( O ) “ Pick me up and [ d ] throw me into the sea ; then the sea will become calm for you . For I know that this great tempest is because of me. ”
NKJV	Jonah	1	13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to land , ( P ) but they could not , for the sea continued to grow more tempestuous against them .
NKJV	Jonah	1	14	Therefore they cried out to the Lord and said , “ We pray , O Lord , please do not let us perish for this man ’ s life , and ( Q ) do not charge us with innocent blood ; for You , O Lord , ( R ) have done as it pleased You. ”
NKJV	Jonah	1	15	So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea , ( S ) and the sea ceased from its raging .

NKJV	Jonah	3	2	“ Arise , go to Nineveh , that great city , and preach to it the message that I tell you. ”
NKJV	Jonah	3	4	And Jonah began to enter the city on the first day ’ s walk . Then ( A ) he cried out and said , “ Yet forty days , and Nineveh shall be overthrown ! ” The People of Nineveh Believe
NKJV	Jonah	3	5	So the ( B ) people of Nineveh believed God , proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest to the least of them .
NKJV	Jonah	3	6	Then word came to the king of Nineveh ; and he arose from his throne and laid aside his robe , covered himself with sackcloth ( C ) and sat in ashes .
NKJV	Jonah	3	7	( D ) And he caused it to be proclaimed and published throughout Nineveh by the decree of the king and his [ b ] nobles , saying , Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock , taste anything ; do not let them eat , or drink water .
NKJV	Jonah	3	8	But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily to God ; yes , ( E ) let every one turn from his evil way and from ( F ) the violence that is in his hands .
NKJV	Jonah	3	9	( G ) Who can tell if God will turn and relent , and turn away from His fierce anger , so that we may not perish ?

NKJV	Jonah	4	4	Then the Lord said , “ Is it right for you to be angry ? ”
NKJV	Jonah	4	2	So he prayed to the Lord , and said , “ Ah , Lord , was not this what I said when I was still in my country ? Therefore I ( A ) fled previously to Tarshish ; for I know that You are a ( B ) gracious and merciful God , slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness , One who relents from doing harm .
NKJV	Jonah	4	3	( C ) Therefore now , O Lord , please take my life from me , for ( D ) it is better for me to die than to live ! ”
NKJV	Jonah	4	5	So Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city . There he made himself a shelter and sat under it in the shade , till he might see what would become of the city .
NKJV	Jonah	4	6	And the Lord God prepared a [ a ] plant and made it come up over Jonah , that it might be shade for his head to deliver him from his misery . So Jonah [ b ] was very grateful for the plant .
NKJV	Jonah	4	7	But as morning dawned the next day God prepared a worm , and it so damaged the plant that it withered .
NKJV	Jonah	4	8	And it happened , when the sun arose , that God prepared a vehement east wind ; and the sun beat on Jonah ’ s head , so that he grew faint . Then he wished death for himself , and said , ( E ) “ It is better for me to die than to live. ”
NKJV	Jonah	4	9	Then God said to Jonah , “ Is it right for you to be angry about the plant ? ” And he said , “ It is right for me to be angry , even to death ! ”
NKJV	Jonah	4	10	But the Lord said , “ You have had pity on the plant for which you have not labored , nor made it grow , which [ c ] came up in a night and perished in a night .

NKJV	Micah	7	2	The ( C ) faithful [ a ] man has perished from the earth , And there is no one upright among men . They all lie in wait for blood ; ( D ) Every man hunts his brother with a net .
NKJV	Micah	7	3	That they may successfully do evil with both hands— The prince asks for gifts , The judge seeks a ( E ) bribe , And the great man utters his evil desire ; So they scheme together .

NKJV	Micah	7	5	( G ) Do not trust in a friend ; Do not put your confidence in a companion ; Guard the doors of your mouth From her who lies in your ( H ) bosom .

NKJV	Nahum	1	1	The [ a ] burden ( A ) against Nineveh . The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite . God ’ s Wrath on His Enemies
NKJV	Nahum	1	2	God is ( B ) jealous , and the Lord avenges ; The Lord avenges and is furious . The Lord will take vengeance on His adversaries , And He reserves wrath for His enemies ;
NKJV	Nahum	1	3	The Lord is ( C ) slow to anger and ( D ) great in power , And will not at all acquit the wicked . ( E ) The Lord has His way In the whirlwind and in the storm , And the clouds are the dust of His feet .
NKJV	Nahum	1	4	( F ) He rebukes the sea and makes it dry , And dries up all the rivers . ( G ) Bashan and Carmel wither , And the flower of Lebanon wilts .
NKJV	Nahum	1	5	The mountains quake before Him , The hills melt , And the earth [ b ] heaves at His presence , Yes , the world and all who dwell in it .
NKJV	Nahum	1	6	Who can stand before His indignation ? And ( H ) who can endure the fierceness of His anger ? His fury is poured out like fire , And the rocks are thrown down by Him .
NKJV	Nahum	1	7	( I ) The Lord is good , A stronghold in the day of trouble ; And ( J ) He knows those who trust in Him .
NKJV	Nahum	1	8	But with an overflowing flood He will make an utter end of its place , And darkness will pursue His enemies .
NKJV	Nahum	1	9	( K ) What do you [ c ] conspire against the Lord ? ( L ) He will make an utter end of it . Affliction will not rise up a second time .
NKJV	Nahum	1	10	For while tangled ( M ) like thorns , ( N ) And while drunken like drunkards , ( O ) They shall be devoured like stubble fully dried .
NKJV	Nahum	1	11	From you comes forth one Who plots evil against the Lord , A [ d ] wicked counselor .
NKJV	Nahum	1	12	Thus says the Lord : “ Though they are [ e ] safe , and likewise many , Yet in this manner they will be ( P ) cut down When he passes through . Though I have afflicted you , I will afflict you no more ;
NKJV	Nahum	1	13	For now I will break off his yoke from you , And burst your bonds apart. ”
NKJV	Nahum	1	14	The Lord has given a command concerning you : [ f ] “ Your name shall be perpetuated no longer . Out of the house of your gods I will cut off the carved image and the molded image . I will dig your ( Q ) grave , For you are ( R ) vile. ” [ g ]
NKJV	Nahum	1	15	Behold , on the mountains The ( S ) feet of him who brings good tidings , Who proclaims peace ! O Judah , keep your appointed feasts , Perform your vows .

NKJV	Nahum	2	2	For the Lord will restore the excellence of Jacob Like the excellence of Israel , For the emptiers have emptied them out And ruined their vine branches .
NKJV	Nahum	2	3	The shields of his mighty men are made red , The valiant men are in scarlet . The chariots come with flaming torches In the day of his preparation , And [ b ] the spears are brandished .
NKJV	Nahum	2	4	The chariots rage in the streets , They jostle one another in the broad roads ; They seem like torches , They run like lightning .
NKJV	Nahum	2	5	He remembers his nobles ; They stumble in their walk ; They make haste to her walls , And the defense is prepared .
NKJV	Nahum	2	6	The gates of the rivers are opened , And the palace is dissolved .
NKJV	Nahum	2	7	[ c ] It is decreed : She shall be led away captive , She shall be brought up ; And her maidservants shall lead her as with the voice of doves , Beating their breasts .
NKJV	Nahum	2	8	Though Nineveh of old was like a pool of water , Now they flee away . [ d ] “ Halt ! Halt ! ” they cry ; But no one turns back .
NKJV	Nahum	2	9	[ e ] Take spoil of silver ! Take spoil of ( A ) gold ! There is no end of treasure , Or wealth of every desirable prize .
NKJV	Nahum	2	10	She is empty , desolate , and waste ! The heart melts , and the knees shake ; Much pain is in every side , And all their faces [ f ] are drained of color .
NKJV	Nahum	2	11	Where is the dwelling of the ( B ) lions , And the feeding place of the young lions , Where the lion walked , the lioness and lion ’ s cub , And no one made them afraid ?
NKJV	Nahum	2	12	The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs , [ g ] Killed for his lionesses , ( C ) Filled his caves with prey , And his dens with [ h ] flesh .
NKJV	Nahum	2	13	“ Behold , ( D ) I am against you , ” says the Lord of hosts , “ I will burn [ i ] your chariots in smoke , and the sword shall devour your young lions ; I will cut off your prey from the earth , and the voice of your ( E ) messengers shall be heard no more. ” Footnotes - Nahum 2:1 Vg .

NKJV	Nahum	3	3	Horsemen charge with bright sword and glittering spear . There is a multitude of slain , A great number of bodies , Countless corpses— They stumble over the corpses—
NKJV	Nahum	3	2	The noise of a whip And the noise of rattling wheels , Of galloping horses , Of [ b ] clattering chariots !
NKJV	Nahum	3	4	Because of the multitude of [ c ] harlotries of the [ d ] seductive harlot , ( B ) The mistress of sorceries , Who sells nations through her harlotries , And families through her sorceries .
NKJV	Nahum	3	5	“ Behold , I am ( C ) against you , ” says the Lord of hosts ; ( D ) “ I will lift your skirts over your face , I will show the nations your nakedness , And the kingdoms your shame .
NKJV	Nahum	3	6	I will cast abominable filth upon you , Make you ( E ) vile , [ e ] And make you ( F ) a spectacle .
NKJV	Nahum	3	7	It shall come to pass that all who look upon you ( G ) Will flee from you , and say , ( H ) ‘ Nineveh is laid waste ! ( I ) Who will bemoan her ? ’ Where shall I seek comforters for you ? ”
NKJV	Nahum	3	8	( J ) Are you better than ( K ) No [ f ] Amon That was situated by the [ g ] River , That had the waters around her , Whose rampart was the sea , Whose wall was the sea ?
NKJV	Nahum	3	9	Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength , And it was boundless ; ( L ) Put and Lubim were [ h ] your helpers .
NKJV	Nahum	3	10	Yet she was carried away , She went into captivity ; ( M ) Her young children also were dashed to pieces ( N ) At the head of every street ; They ( O ) cast lots for her honorable men , And all her great men were bound in chains .
NKJV	Nahum	3	11	You also will be ( P ) drunk ; You will be hidden ; You also will seek refuge from the enemy .
NKJV	Nahum	3	12	All your strongholds are ( Q ) fig trees with ripened figs : If they are shaken , They fall into the mouth of the eater .
NKJV	Nahum	3	13	Surely , ( R ) your people in your midst are women ! The gates of your land are wide open for your enemies ; Fire shall devour the ( S ) bars of your gates .
NKJV	Nahum	3	14	Draw your water for the siege ! ( T ) Fortify your strongholds ! Go into the clay and tread the mortar ! Make strong the brick kiln !
NKJV	Nahum	3	15	There the fire will devour you , The sword will cut you off ; It will eat you up like a ( U ) locust . Make yourself many—like the locust ! Make yourself many—like the swarming locusts !
NKJV	Nahum	3	16	You have multiplied your ( V ) merchants more than the stars of heaven . The locust plunders and flies away .
NKJV	Nahum	3	17	( W ) Your commanders are like swarming locusts , And your generals like great grasshoppers , Which camp in the hedges on a cold day ; When the sun rises they flee away , And the place where they are is not known .
NKJV	Nahum	3	18	( X ) Your shepherds slumber , O ( Y ) king of Assyria ; Your nobles rest in the dust . Your people are ( Z ) scattered on the mountains , And no one gathers them .
NKJV	Nahum	3	19	Your injury has no healing , ( AA ) Your wound is severe . ( AB ) All who hear news of you Will clap their hands over you , For upon whom has not your wickedness passed continually ? Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Habakkuk	1	1	The [ a ] burden which the prophet Habakkuk saw . The Prophet ’ s Question
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	2	O Lord , how long shall I cry , ( A ) And You will not hear ? Even cry out to You , ( B ) “ Violence ! ” And You will ( C ) not save .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	3	Why do You show me iniquity , And cause me to see [ b ] trouble ? For plundering and violence are before me ; There is strife , and contention arises .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	4	Therefore the law is powerless , And justice never goes forth . For the ( D ) wicked surround the righteous ; Therefore perverse judgment proceeds . The Lord ’ s Reply
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	5	“ Look ( E ) among the nations and watch— Be utterly astounded ! For I will work a work in your days Which you would not believe , though it were told you .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	6	For indeed I am ( F ) raising up the Chaldeans , A bitter and hasty ( G ) nation Which marches through the breadth of the earth , To possess dwelling places that are not theirs .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	7	They are terrible and dreadful ; Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	8	Their horses also are ( H ) swifter than leopards , And more fierce than evening wolves . Their [ c ] chargers [ d ] charge ahead ; Their cavalry comes from afar ; They fly as the ( I ) eagle that hastens to eat .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	9	“ They all come for violence ; Their faces are set like the east wind . They gather captives like sand .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	10	They scoff at kings , And princes are scorned by them . They deride every stronghold , For they heap up earthen mounds and seize it .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	11	Then his [ e ] mind changes , and he transgresses ; He commits offense , ( J ) Ascribing this power to his god. ” The Prophet ’ s Second Question
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	12	Are You not ( K ) from everlasting , O Lord my God , my Holy One ? We shall not die . O Lord , ( L ) You have appointed them for judgment ; O Rock , You have marked them for ( M ) correction .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	13	You are of purer eyes than to behold evil , And can not look on wickedness . Why do You look on those who deal treacherously , And hold Your tongue when the wicked devours A person more righteous than he ?
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	14	Why do You make men like fish of the sea , Like creeping things that have no ruler over them ?
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	15	They take up all of them with a hook , They catch them in their net , And gather them in their dragnet . Therefore they rejoice and are glad .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	16	Therefore ( N ) they sacrifice to their net , And burn incense to their dragnet ; Because by them their share is [ f ] sumptuous And their food plentiful .
NKJV	Habakkuk	1	17	Shall they therefore empty their net , And continue to slay nations without pity ?

NKJV	Habakkuk	2	2	Then the Lord answered me and said : ( B ) “ Write the vision And make it plain on tablets , That he may run who reads it .
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	3	For ( C ) the vision is yet for an appointed time ; But at the end it will speak , and it will ( D ) not lie . Though it tarries , ( E ) wait for it ; Because it will ( F ) surely come , It will not tarry .
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	4	“ Behold the proud , His soul is not upright in him ; But the ( G ) just shall live by his faith . Woe to the Wicked
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	5	“ Indeed , because he transgresses by wine , He is a proud man , And he does not stay at home . Because he ( H ) enlarges his desire as [ a ] hell , And he is like death , and can not be satisfied , He gathers to himself all nations And heaps up for himself all peoples .
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	6	“ Will not all these ( I ) take up a proverb against him , And a taunting riddle against him , and say , ‘ Woe to him who increases What is not his—how long ? And to him who loads himself with [ b ] many pledges ’ ?
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	7	Will not [ c ] your creditors rise up suddenly ? Will they not awaken who oppress you ? And you will become their booty .
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	8	( J ) Because you have plundered many nations , All the remnant of the people shall plunder you , Because of men ’ s [ d ] blood And the violence of the land and the city , And of all who dwell in it .
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	9	“ Woe to him who covets evil gain for his house , That he may ( K ) set his nest on high , That he may be delivered from the [ e ] power of disaster !
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	10	You give shameful counsel to your house , Cutting off many peoples , And sin against your soul .
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	11	For the stone will cry out from the wall , And the beam from the timbers will answer it .
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	12	“ Woe to him who builds a town with bloodshed , Who establishes a city by iniquity !
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	13	Behold , is it not of the Lord of hosts That the peoples labor [ f ] to feed the fire , And nations weary themselves in vain ?
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	14	For the earth will be filled With the knowledge of the glory of the Lord , As the waters cover the sea .
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	15	“ Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbor , [ g ] Pressing him to your ( L ) bottle , Even to make him drunk , That you may look on [ h ] his nakedness !
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	16	You are filled with shame instead of glory . You also—drink ! And [ i ] be exposed as uncircumcised ! The cup of the Lord ’ s right hand will be turned against you , And utter shame will be on your glory .
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	17	For the violence done to Lebanon will cover you , And the plunder of beasts which made them afraid , Because of men ’ s blood And the violence of the land and the city , And of all who dwell in it .
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	18	“ What profit is the image , that its maker should carve it , The molded image , a teacher of lies , That the maker of its mold should trust in it , To make mute idols ?
NKJV	Habakkuk	2	19	Woe to him who says to wood , ‘ Awake ! ’ To silent stone , ‘ Arise ! It shall teach ! ’ Behold , it is overlaid with gold and silver , Yet in it there is no breath at all .

NKJV	Habakkuk	3	2	O Lord , I have heard Your speech and was afraid ; O Lord , revive Your work in the midst of the years ! In the midst of the years make it known ; In wrath remember mercy .
NKJV	Habakkuk	3	4	His brightness was like the light ; He had rays flashing from His hand , And there His power was hidden .
NKJV	Habakkuk	3	5	Before Him went pestilence , And fever followed at His feet .
NKJV	Habakkuk	3	6	He stood and measured the earth ; He looked and startled the nations . ( A ) And the everlasting mountains were scattered , The perpetual hills bowed . His ways are everlasting .
NKJV	Habakkuk	3	7	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction ; The curtains of the land of Midian trembled .

NKJV	Habakkuk	3	9	Your bow was made quite ready ; Oaths were sworn over Your [ b ] arrows . Selah You divided the earth with rivers .
NKJV	Habakkuk	3	10	The mountains saw You and trembled ; The overflowing of the water passed by . The deep uttered its voice , And ( B ) lifted its hands on high .
NKJV	Habakkuk	3	11	The ( C ) sun and moon stood still in their habitation ; At the light of Your arrows they went , At the shining of Your glittering spear .
NKJV	Habakkuk	3	12	You marched through the land in indignation ; You [ c ] trampled the nations in anger .
NKJV	Habakkuk	3	13	You went forth for the salvation of Your people , For salvation with Your Anointed . You struck the head from the house of the wicked , By laying bare from foundation to neck . Selah

NKJV	Zechariah	4	7	‘ Who are you , ( H ) O great mountain ? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain ! And he shall bring forth ( I ) the capstone ( J ) With shouts of “ Grace , grace to it ! ” ’ ”

NKJV	Malachi	1	2	“ I ( A ) have loved you , ” says the Lord . “ Yet you say , ‘ In what way have You loved us ? ’ Was not Esau Jacob ’ s brother ? ” Says the Lord . “ Yet ( B ) Jacob I have loved ;
NKJV	Malachi	1	3	But Esau I have hated , And ( C ) laid waste his mountains and his heritage For the jackals of the wilderness. ”
NKJV	Malachi	1	4	Even though Edom has said , “ We have been impoverished , But we will return and build the desolate places , ” Thus says the Lord of hosts : “ They may build , but I will ( D ) throw down ; They shall be called the Territory of Wickedness , And the people against whom the Lord will have indignation forever .
NKJV	Malachi	1	5	Your eyes shall see , And you shall say , ( E ) ‘ The Lord is magnified beyond the border of Israel. ’ Polluted Offerings
NKJV	Malachi	1	6	“ A son ( F ) honors his father , And a servant his master . ( G ) If then I am the Father , Where is My honor ? And if I am a Master , Where is My reverence ? Says the Lord of hosts To you priests who despise My name . ( H ) Yet you say , ‘ In what way have we despised Your name ? ’
NKJV	Malachi	1	7	“ You offer ( I ) defiled food on My altar , But say , ‘ In what way have we defiled You ? ’ By saying , ( J ) ‘ The table of the Lord is [ c ] contemptible. ’
NKJV	Malachi	1	8	And ( K ) when you offer the blind as a sacrifice , Is it not evil ? And when you offer the lame and sick , Is it not evil ? Offer it then to your governor ! Would he be pleased with you ? Would he ( L ) accept [ d ] you favorably ? ” Says the Lord of hosts .
NKJV	Malachi	1	9	“ But now entreat God ’ s favor , That He may be gracious to us . ( M ) While this is being done by your hands , Will He accept you favorably ? ” Says the Lord of hosts .
NKJV	Malachi	1	10	“ Who is there even among you who would shut the doors , ( N ) So that you would not kindle fire on My altar in vain ? I have no pleasure in you , ” Says the Lord of hosts , ( O ) “ Nor will I accept an offering from your hands .
NKJV	Malachi	1	11	For ( P ) from the rising of the sun , even to its going down , My name shall be great ( Q ) among the Gentiles ; ( R ) In every place ( S ) incense shall be offered to My name , And a pure offering ; ( T ) For My name shall be great among the nations , ” Says the Lord of hosts .
NKJV	Malachi	1	12	“ But you profane it , In that you say , ( U ) ‘ The table of the [ e ] Lord is defiled ; And its fruit , its food , is contemptible. ’
NKJV	Malachi	1	13	You also say , ‘ Oh , what a ( V ) weariness ! ’ And you sneer at it , ” Says the Lord of hosts . “ And you bring the stolen , the lame , and the sick ; Thus you bring an offering ! ( W ) Should I accept this from your hand ? ” Says the Lord .
NKJV	Malachi	1	14	“ But cursed be ( X ) the deceiver Who has in his flock a male , And takes a vow , But sacrifices to the Lord ( Y ) what is blemished— For ( Z ) I am a great King , ” Says the Lord of hosts , “ And My name is to be feared among the nations .

NKJV	Malachi	2	2	( B ) If you will not hear , And if you will not take it to heart , To give glory to My name , ” Says the Lord of hosts , “ I will send a curse upon you , And I will curse your blessings . Yes , I have cursed them ( C ) already , Because you do not take it to heart .
NKJV	Malachi	2	3	“ Behold , I will rebuke your descendants And spread ( D ) refuse on your faces , The refuse of your solemn feasts ; And one will ( E ) take you away [ a ] with it .
NKJV	Malachi	2	4	Then you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you , That My covenant with Levi may continue , ” Says the Lord of hosts .
NKJV	Malachi	2	5	“ My ( F ) covenant was with him , one of life and peace , And I gave them to him ( G ) that he might fear Me ; So he feared Me And was reverent before My name .
NKJV	Malachi	2	6	( H ) The [ b ] law of truth was in his mouth , And [ c ] injustice was not found on his lips . He walked with Me in peace and equity , And ( I ) turned many away from iniquity .
NKJV	Malachi	2	7	“ For ( J ) the lips of a priest should keep knowledge , And people should seek the law from his mouth ; ( K ) For he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts .
NKJV	Malachi	2	8	But you have departed from the way ; You ( L ) have caused many to stumble at the law . ( M ) You have corrupted the covenant of Levi , ” Says the Lord of hosts .
NKJV	Malachi	2	9	“ Therefore ( N ) I also have made you contemptible and base Before all the people , Because you have not kept My ways But have shown ( O ) partiality in the law. ” Treachery of Infidelity
NKJV	Malachi	2	10	( P ) Have we not all one Father ? ( Q ) Has not one God created us ? Why do we deal treacherously with one another By profaning the covenant of the fathers ?
NKJV	Malachi	2	11	Judah has dealt treacherously , And an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem , For Judah has ( R ) profaned The Lord ’ s holy institution which He loves : He has married the daughter of a foreign god .
NKJV	Malachi	2	12	May the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob The man who does this , being [ d ] awake and aware , Yet ( S ) who brings an offering to the Lord of hosts !
NKJV	Malachi	2	13	And this is the second thing you do : You cover the altar of the Lord with tears , With weeping and crying ; So He does not regard the offering anymore , Nor receive it with goodwill from your hands .
NKJV	Malachi	2	14	Yet you say , “ For what reason ? ” Because the Lord has been witness Between you and ( T ) the wife of your youth , With whom you have dealt treacherously ; ( U ) Yet she is your companion And your wife by covenant .
NKJV	Malachi	2	15	But ( V ) did He not make them one , Having a remnant of the Spirit ? And why one ? He seeks ( W ) godly offspring . Therefore take heed to your spirit , And let none deal treacherously with the wife of his youth .
NKJV	Malachi	2	16	“ For ( X ) the Lord God of Israel says That He hates divorce , For it covers one ’ s garment with violence , ” Says the Lord of hosts . “ Therefore take heed to your spirit , That you do not deal treacherously. ”
NKJV	Malachi	2	17	( Y ) You have wearied the Lord with your words ; Yet you say , “ In what way have we wearied Him ? ” In that you say , ( Z ) “ Everyone who does evil Is good in the sight of the Lord , And He delights in them , ” Or , “ Where is the God of justice ? ” Footnotes - Malachi 2:3 Lit . to it - Malachi 2:6 Or True instruction - Malachi 2:6 Or unrighteousness - Malachi 2:12 Talmud , Vg . teacher and student Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Malachi	3	3	( H ) He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver ; He will purify the sons of Levi , And [ a ] purge them as gold and silver , That they may ( I ) offer to the Lord An offering in righteousness .
NKJV	Malachi	3	2	“ But who can endure ( E ) the day of His coming ? And ( F ) who can stand when He appears ? For ( G ) He is like a refiner ’ s fire And like launderers ’ soap .
NKJV	Malachi	3	4	“ Then ( J ) the offering of Judah and Jerusalem Will be [ b ] pleasant to the Lord , As in the days of old , As in former years .
NKJV	Malachi	3	5	And I will come near you for judgment ; I will be a swift witness Against sorcerers , Against adulterers , ( K ) Against perjurers , Against those who ( L ) exploit wage earners and ( M ) widows and orphans , And against those who turn away an alien— Because they do not fear Me , ” Says the Lord of hosts .
NKJV	Malachi	3	6	“ For I am the Lord , ( N ) I do not change ; ( O ) Therefore you are not consumed , O sons of Jacob .
NKJV	Malachi	3	7	Yet from the days of ( P ) your fathers You have gone away from My ordinances And have not kept them . ( Q ) Return to Me , and I will return to you , ” Says the Lord of hosts . ( R ) “ But you said , ‘ In what way shall we return ? ’ Do Not Rob God
NKJV	Malachi	3	8	“ Will a man rob God ? Yet you have robbed Me ! But you say , ‘ In what way have we robbed You ? ’ ( S ) In tithes and offerings .
NKJV	Malachi	3	9	You are cursed with a curse , For you have robbed Me , Even this whole nation .
NKJV	Malachi	3	10	( T ) Bring all the tithes into the ( U ) storehouse , That there may be food in My house , And try Me now in this , ” Says the Lord of hosts , “ If I will not open for you the ( V ) windows of heaven And ( W ) pour out for you such blessing That there will not be room enough to receive it .
NKJV	Malachi	3	11	“ And I will rebuke ( X ) the devourer for your sakes , So that he will not destroy the fruit of your ground , Nor shall the vine fail to bear fruit for you in the field , ” Says the Lord of hosts ;
NKJV	Malachi	3	12	“ And all nations will call you blessed , For you will be ( Y ) a delightful land , ” Says the Lord of hosts . The People Complain Harshly
NKJV	Malachi	3	13	“ Your ( Z ) words have been [ c ] harsh against Me , ” Says the Lord , “ Yet you say , ‘ What have we spoken against You ? ’
NKJV	Malachi	3	14	( AA ) You have said , ‘ It is useless to serve God ; What profit is it that we have kept His ordinance , And that we have walked as mourners Before the Lord of hosts ?
NKJV	Malachi	3	15	So now ( AB ) we call the proud blessed , For those who do wickedness are [ d ] raised up ; They even ( AC ) tempt God and go free. ’ ” A Book of Remembrance
NKJV	Malachi	3	16	Then those ( AD ) who feared the Lord ( AE ) spoke to one another , And the Lord listened and heard them ; So ( AF ) a book of remembrance was written before Him For those who fear the Lord And who [ e ] meditate on His name .
NKJV	Malachi	3	17	“ They ( AG ) shall be Mine , ” says the Lord of hosts , “ On the day that I make them My ( AH ) jewels . [ f ] And ( AI ) I will spare them As a man spares his own son who serves him. ”
