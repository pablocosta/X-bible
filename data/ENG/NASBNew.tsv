NASB	Matthew	1	17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; from David to the ( J ) deportation to Babylon , fourteen generations ; and from the ( K ) deportation to Babylon to the [ o ] Messiah , fourteen generations . Conception and Birth of Jesus
NASB	Matthew	1	18	Now the birth of Jesus the [ p ] Messiah was as follows : when His ( L ) mother Mary had been [ q ] betrothed to Joseph , before they came together she was ( M ) found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit .
NASB	Matthew	1	19	And her husband Joseph , since he was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her , planned to [ r ] ( N ) send her away secretly .
NASB	Matthew	1	20	But when he had thought this over , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , “ ( O ) Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife ; for [ s ] the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit .
NASB	Matthew	1	21	She will give birth to a Son ; and ( P ) you shall name Him Jesus , for [ t ] He ( Q ) will save His people from their sins. ”
NASB	Matthew	1	22	Now all this [ u ] took place so that what was ( R ) spoken by the Lord through [ v ] the prophet would be fulfilled :
NASB	Matthew	1	23	“ ( S ) Behold , the virgin will [ w ] ( T ) conceive and give birth to a Son , and they shall name Him [ x ] Immanuel , ” which translated means , “ ( U ) God with us. ”
NASB	Matthew	1	24	And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took Mary as his wife ,
NASB	Matthew	1	25	[ y ] but kept her a virgin until she ( V ) gave birth to a Son ; and ( W ) he named Him Jesus .

NASB	Matthew	2	2	“ Where is He who has been born ( C ) King of the Jews ? For we saw ( D ) His star in the east and have come to worship Him. ”
NASB	Matthew	2	3	When Herod the king heard this , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
NASB	Matthew	2	4	And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he inquired of them where the [ b ] Messiah was to be born .
NASB	Matthew	2	5	They said to him , “ ( E ) In Bethlehem of Judea ; for this is what has been written [ c ] by [ d ] the prophet :
NASB	Matthew	2	6	‘ ( F ) And you , Bethlehem , land of Judah , Are by no means least among the leaders of Judah ; For from you will come forth a Ruler Who will ( G ) shepherd My people Israel. ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod secretly called for the magi and determined from them the exact [ e ] time ( H ) the star appeared .
NASB	Matthew	2	8	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said , “ Go and search carefully for the Child ; and when you have found Him , report to me , so that I too may come and worship Him. ”
NASB	Matthew	2	9	After hearing the king , they went on their way ; and behold , the star , which they had seen in the east , went on ahead of them until it came to a stop over the place where the Child was to be found .
NASB	Matthew	2	10	When they saw the star , they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy .
NASB	Matthew	2	11	And after they came into the house , they saw the Child with ( I ) His mother Mary ; and they fell down and [ f ] ( J ) worshiped Him . Then they opened their treasures and presented to Him gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
NASB	Matthew	2	12	And after being ( K ) warned by God ( L ) in a dream not to return to Herod , the magi left for their own country by another way . The Escape to Egypt
NASB	Matthew	2	13	Now when they had gone , behold , an ( M ) angel of the Lord * ( N ) appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , “ Get up ! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt , and stay there until I tell you ; for Herod is going to search for the Child to kill Him. ”
NASB	Matthew	2	14	So [ g ] Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night , and left for Egypt .
NASB	Matthew	2	15	He [ h ] stayed there until the death of Herod ; this happened so that what had been spoken by the Lord through [ i ] the prophet would be fulfilled : “ ( O ) Out of Egypt I called ( P ) My Son. ” Herod Slaughters Babies
NASB	Matthew	2	16	Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by ( Q ) the magi , he became very enraged , and sent men and ( R ) killed all the boys who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity [ j ] who were two years old or under , according to the time which he had determined from the magi .
NASB	Matthew	2	17	Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled :
NASB	Matthew	2	18	“ ( S ) A voice was heard in Ramah , Weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children ; And she refused to be comforted , Because they were no more. ”
NASB	Matthew	2	19	But when Herod died , behold , an angel of the Lord * ( T ) appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , and said ,
NASB	Matthew	2	20	“ Get up , take the Child and His mother , and go to the land of Israel ; for those who sought the Child ’ s life are dead. ”
NASB	Matthew	2	21	So [ k ] Joseph got up , took the Child and His mother , and came into the land of Israel .
NASB	Matthew	2	22	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there . Then after being ( U ) warned by God in a dream , he left for the regions of Galilee ,
NASB	Matthew	2	23	and came and settled in a city called ( V ) Nazareth . This happened so that what was spoken through the prophets would be fulfilled : “ He will be called a ( W ) Nazarene. ” Footnotes - Matthew 2:1 A caste of educated men specializing in astronomy , astrology , and natural science - Matthew 2:4 From Gr Christos , which means Messiah ( Heb for Anointed One ) - Matthew 2:5 Or through - Matthew 2:5 I.e. , Micah - Matthew 2:7 Lit time of the appearing star - Matthew 2:11 Lit prostrated themselves to ; i.e. , lay face down in a prone position to indicate worship - Matthew 2:14 Lit he - Matthew 2:15 Lit was - Matthew 2:15 I.e. , Hosea - Matthew 2:16 Lit from two ... and under - Matthew 2:21 Lit he New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Matthew	3	3	For this is the ( F ) one referred to [ d ] by Isaiah the prophet when he said , “ ( G ) The voice of one [ e ] calling [ f ] out in the wilderness , ‘ ( H ) Prepare the way of the Lord , Make His paths straight ! ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	3	2	“ ( D ) Repent , for ( E ) the kingdom of heaven [ c ] is at hand. ”
NASB	Matthew	3	4	Now John himself had [ g ] ( I ) a garment of camel ’ s hair and a leather belt around his waist ; and his food was ( J ) locusts and wild honey .
NASB	Matthew	3	5	At that time Jerusalem ( K ) was going out to him , and all Judea and all ( L ) the region around the Jordan ;
NASB	Matthew	3	6	and they were being ( M ) baptized by him in the Jordan River , as they confessed their sins .
NASB	Matthew	3	7	But when he saw many of the ( N ) Pharisees and ( O ) Sadducees coming for [ h ] baptism , he said to them , “ You [ i ] ( P ) offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from ( Q ) the wrath to come ?
NASB	Matthew	3	8	( R ) Therefore produce fruit ( S ) consistent with repentance ;
NASB	Matthew	3	9	and do not assume that you can say to yourselves , ‘ ( T ) We have Abraham as our father ’ ; for I tell you that God is able , from these stones , to raise up children for Abraham .
NASB	Matthew	3	10	And the ( U ) axe is already laid at the root of the trees ; therefore , ( V ) every tree that does not bear good fruit is being cut down and thrown into the fire .
NASB	Matthew	3	11	“ As for me , ( W ) I baptize you [ j ] with water for repentance , but He who is coming after me is mightier than I , and I am not fit to remove His sandals ; ( X ) He will baptize you [ k ] with the Holy Spirit and fire .
NASB	Matthew	3	12	His ( Y ) winnowing fork is in His hand , and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor ; and He will ( Z ) gather His wheat into the barn , but He will burn up the ( AA ) chaff with ( AB ) unquenchable fire. ” The Baptism of Jesus
NASB	Matthew	3	13	( AC ) Then Jesus * arrived ( AD ) from Galilee at the Jordan , coming to John to be baptized by him .
NASB	Matthew	3	14	But John tried to prevent Him , saying , “ I have the need to be baptized by You , and yet You are coming to me ? ”
NASB	Matthew	3	15	But Jesus , answering , said to him , “ Allow it at this time ; for in this way it is fitting for us ( AE ) to fulfill all righteousness. ” Then he * allowed Him .
NASB	Matthew	3	16	After He was baptized , Jesus came up immediately from the water ; and behold , the heavens were opened , and [ l ] ( AF ) he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and [ m ] settling on Him ,
NASB	Matthew	3	17	and behold , a voice from the heavens said , “ ( AG ) This is [ n ] My beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased. ” Footnotes - Matthew 3:1 Or arrived ; or appeared - Matthew 3:1 Or proclaiming as a herald - Matthew 3:2 Lit has come near - Matthew 3:3 Or through - Matthew 3:3 Or shouting - Matthew 3:3 Or out , Prepare in the wilderness the way - Matthew 3:4 Lit his garment - Matthew 3:7 Later mss his baptism - Matthew 3:7 Or brood - Matthew 3:11 The Gr here can be translated in , with , or by - Matthew 3:11 The Gr here can be translated in , with , or by - Matthew 3:16 Or He - Matthew 3:16 Lit coming upon Him - Matthew 3:17 Or My Son , the Beloved New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Matthew	4	4	But He answered and said , “ It is written : ‘ ( F ) Man shall not live on bread alone , but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God. ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	4	2	And after He had ( C ) fasted for forty days and forty nights , He [ a ] then became hungry .
NASB	Matthew	4	3	And ( D ) the tempter came and said to Him , “ If You are the ( E ) Son of God , command that these stones become bread. ”
NASB	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil * took Him along into ( G ) the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple ,
NASB	Matthew	4	6	and he * said to Him , “ If You are the Son of God , throw Yourself down ; for it is written : ‘ ( H ) He will give His angels orders concerning You ’ ; and ‘ On their hands they will lift You up , So that You do not strike Your foot against a stone. ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said to him , “ [ b ] On the other hand , it is written : ‘ ( I ) You shall not put the Lord your God to the test. ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	4	8	( J ) Again , the devil * took Him along to a very high mountain and * showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory ;
NASB	Matthew	4	9	and he said to Him , “ ( K ) All these things I will give You , if You fall down and [ c ] worship me. ”
NASB	Matthew	4	10	Then Jesus * said to him , “ Go away , Satan ! For it is written : ‘ ( L ) You shall worship the Lord your God , and [ d ] serve Him only. ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil * left Him ; and behold , ( M ) angels came and began to serve Him . Jesus Begins His Ministry
NASB	Matthew	4	12	Now when Jesus heard that ( N ) John had been taken into custody , ( O ) He withdrew into Galilee ;
NASB	Matthew	4	13	and leaving Nazareth , He came and ( P ) settled in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali .
NASB	Matthew	4	14	This happened so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled :
NASB	Matthew	4	15	“ ( Q ) The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , [ e ] By the way of the sea , on the other side of the Jordan , Galilee of the [ f ] Gentiles—
NASB	Matthew	4	16	( R ) The people who were sitting in darkness saw a great Light , And those who were sitting in the land and shadow of death , Upon them a Light dawned. ”
NASB	Matthew	4	17	( S ) From that time Jesus began to [ g ] preach and say , “ ( T ) Repent , for the kingdom of heaven [ h ] is at hand. ” The First Disciples
NASB	Matthew	4	18	( U ) Now as Jesus was walking by ( V ) the Sea of Galilee , He saw two brothers , ( W ) Simon , who was called Peter , and his brother Andrew , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fishermen .
NASB	Matthew	4	19	And He * said to them , “ [ i ] Follow Me , and I will make you fishers of people. ”
NASB	Matthew	4	20	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him .
NASB	Matthew	4	21	Going on from there He saw two other brothers , [ j ] ( X ) James the son of Zebedee , and his brother [ k ] John , in the boat with their father Zebedee , mending their nets ; and He called them .
NASB	Matthew	4	22	Immediately they left the boat and their father , and followed Him . Ministry in Galilee
NASB	Matthew	4	23	Jesus was going ( Y ) about in all of Galilee , ( Z ) teaching in their synagogues and ( AA ) proclaiming the [ l ] gospel of the kingdom , and ( AB ) healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
NASB	Matthew	4	24	And the news about Him spread ( AC ) throughout Syria ; and they brought to Him all who were ill , those suffering with various diseases and severe pain , ( AD ) demon-possessed , people with ( AE ) epilepsy , and people who were ( AF ) paralyzed ; and He healed them .

NASB	Matthew	6	10	[ e ] ( M ) Your kingdom come . ( N ) Your will be done , [ f ] On earth as it is in heaven .
NASB	Matthew	6	11	( O ) Give us this day [ g ] our daily bread .
NASB	Matthew	6	12	And ( P ) forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors .
NASB	Matthew	6	13	And do not lead us into temptation , but ( Q ) deliver us from [ h ] ( R ) evil . [ i ] ’
NASB	Matthew	6	14	( S ) For if you forgive other people for their [ j ] offenses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
NASB	Matthew	6	15	But ( T ) if you do not forgive other people , then your Father will not forgive your [ k ] offenses . Fasting ; The True Treasure ; Wealth
NASB	Matthew	6	16	“ Now ( U ) whenever you fast , do not make a gloomy face as the hypocrites do , for they [ l ] distort their faces so that they will be noticed by people when they are fasting . ( V ) Truly I say to you , they have their reward in full .
NASB	Matthew	6	17	But as for you , when you fast , [ m ] ( W ) anoint your head and wash your face ,
NASB	Matthew	6	18	in . or
NASB	Matthew	6	19	“ ( Y ) Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust destroy , and where thieves break in and steal .
NASB	Matthew	6	20	But store up for yourselves ( Z ) treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust destroys , and where thieves do not break in or steal ;
NASB	Matthew	6	21	for ( AA ) where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
NASB	Matthew	6	22	“ ( AB ) The eye is the lamp of the body ; so then , if your eye is [ n ] clear , your whole body will be full of light .
NASB	Matthew	6	23	But if ( AC ) your eye is [ o ] bad , your whole body will be full of darkness . So if the light that is in you is darkness , how great is the darkness !
NASB	Matthew	6	24	“ ( AD ) No one can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to one and despise the other . You can not serve God and [ p ] ( AE ) wealth . The Cure for Anxiety
NASB	Matthew	6	25	“ ( AF ) For this reason I say to you , [ q ] do not be ( AG ) worried about your [ r ] life , as to what you will eat or what you will drink ; nor for your body , as to what you will put on . Is life not more than food , and the body more than clothing ?
NASB	Matthew	6	26	( AH ) Look at the birds of the sky , that they do not sow , nor reap , nor gather crops into barns , and yet your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you not much more important than they ?
NASB	Matthew	6	27	And which of you by ( AI ) worrying can ( AJ ) add a single [ s ] day to his [ t ] life ’ s span ?
NASB	Matthew	6	28	And why are you ( AK ) worried about clothing ? Notice how the lilies of the field grow ; they do not labor nor do they spin thread for cloth ,
NASB	Matthew	6	29	yet I say to you that not even ( AL ) Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these .
NASB	Matthew	6	30	But if God so clothes the ( AM ) grass of the field , which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , will He not much more clothe you ? ( AN ) You of little faith !
NASB	Matthew	6	31	Do not ( AO ) worry then , saying , ‘ What are we to eat ? ’ or ‘ What are we to drink ? ’ or ‘ What are we to wear for clothing ? ’
NASB	Matthew	6	32	For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things ; for ( AP ) your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things .
NASB	Matthew	6	33	But [ u ] seek first [ v ] His kingdom and His righteousness , and ( AQ ) all these things will be [ w ] provided to you .

NASB	Matthew	7	7	“ [ g ] ( F ) Ask , and ( G ) it will be given to you ; [ h ] seek , and you will find ; [ i ] knock , and it will be opened to you .
NASB	Matthew	7	2	For in the way you judge , you will be judged ; and [ b ] ( B ) by your standard of measure , it will be measured to you .
NASB	Matthew	7	3	Why do you ( C ) look at the [ c ] speck that is in your brother ’ s eye , but do not notice the log that is in your own eye ?
NASB	Matthew	7	4	( D ) Or how [ d ] can you say to your brother , ‘ Let me take the [ e ] speck out of your eye , ’ and look , the log is in your own eye ?
NASB	Matthew	7	5	You hypocrite , first take the log out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take the [ f ] speck out of your brother ’ s eye !

NASB	Matthew	7	9	Or what person is there among you [ j ] who , when his son asks for a loaf of bread , [ k ] will give him a stone ?
NASB	Matthew	7	10	Or [ l ] if he asks for a fish , he will not give him a snake , will he ?
NASB	Matthew	7	11	So if you , despite being [ m ] evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , ( H ) how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him !
NASB	Matthew	7	12	“ In everything , ( I ) therefore , [ n ] treat people the same way you want [ o ] them to treat you , for ( J ) this is the Law and the Prophets . The Narrow and Wide Gates
NASB	Matthew	7	13	“ ( K ) Enter through the narrow gate ; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction , and there are many who enter through it .
NASB	Matthew	7	14	For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life , and there are few who find it . A Tree and Its Fruit
NASB	Matthew	7	15	“ Beware of the ( L ) false prophets , who come to you in sheep ’ s clothing , but inwardly are ( M ) ravenous wolves .
NASB	Matthew	7	16	You will [ p ] ( N ) know them by their fruits . [ q ] Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes , nor figs from thistles , are they ?
NASB	Matthew	7	17	So ( O ) every good tree bears good fruit , but the bad tree bears bad fruit .
NASB	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can not bear bad fruit , nor can a bad tree bear good fruit .

NASB	Matthew	8	16	Now when evening came , they brought to Him many ( P ) who were demon-possessed ; and He cast out the spirits with a word , and ( Q ) healed all who were ill.

NASB	Matthew	8	18	Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him , ( S ) He gave orders to depart to the other side of the sea .
NASB	Matthew	8	19	( T ) Then a scribe came and said to Him , “ Teacher , I will follow You wherever You go. ”
NASB	Matthew	8	20	And Jesus * said to him , “ The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests , but ( U ) the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head. ”

NASB	Matthew	8	23	( W ) When He got into the boat , His disciples followed Him .
NASB	Matthew	8	24	And behold , a [ v ] violent storm developed on the sea , so that the boat was being covered by the waves ; but Jesus Himself was asleep .
NASB	Matthew	8	25	And they came to Him and woke Him , saying , “ ( X ) Save us , Lord ; we are perishing ! ”
NASB	Matthew	8	26	He * said to them , “ Why are you [ w ] afraid , ( Y ) you men of little faith ? ” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea , and [ x ] it became perfectly calm .

NASB	Matthew	8	31	And the demons begged Him , saying , “ If You are going to cast us out , send us into the herd of pigs. ”
NASB	Matthew	8	32	And He said to them , “ Go ! ” And they came out and went into the pigs ; and behold , the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and [ aa ] drowned in the waters .

NASB	Matthew	9	2	( B ) And they brought to Him a ( C ) paralyzed man lying on a stretcher . And seeing their faith , Jesus said to the man who was paralyzed , “ ( D ) Take courage , [ a ] son ; ( E ) your sins are forgiven. ”
NASB	Matthew	9	3	And some of the scribes said [ b ] to themselves , “ This man is ( F ) blaspheming ! ”
NASB	Matthew	9	4	And Jesus , ( G ) perceiving their thoughts , said , “ Why are you thinking evil in your hearts ?
NASB	Matthew	9	5	For which is easier , to say , ‘ ( H ) Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
NASB	Matthew	9	6	But so that you may know that ( I ) the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —then He * said to the ( J ) paralyzed man , “ Get up , pick up your stretcher and go home. ”

NASB	Matthew	9	10	Then it happened that as [ e ] Jesus was reclining at the table in the house , behold , many tax collectors and [ f ] sinners came and began dining with Jesus and His disciples .
NASB	Matthew	9	11	And when the Pharisees saw this , they said to His disciples , “ ( O ) Why is your Teacher eating with the tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NASB	Matthew	9	12	But when Jesus heard this , He said , “ It is not ( P ) those who are healthy who need a physician , but those who are sick .
NASB	Matthew	9	13	Now go and learn [ g ] ( Q ) what this means : ‘ ( R ) I desire [ h ] compassion , [ i ] rather than sacrifice , ’ for ( S ) I did not come to call the righteous , but sinners. ” The Question about Fasting
NASB	Matthew	9	14	Then the disciples of John * came to Him , asking , “ Why do we and ( T ) the Pharisees fast , but Your disciples do not fast ? ”
NASB	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said to them , “ The [ j ] attendants of the groom can not mourn as long as the groom is with them , can they ? But the days will come when the groom is taken away from them , and then they will fast .
NASB	Matthew	9	16	But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment ; for [ k ] the patch pulls away from the garment , and a worse tear results .
NASB	Matthew	9	17	Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins ; otherwise the wineskins burst , and the wine pours out and the wineskins are ruined ; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved. ” Miracles of Healing
NASB	Matthew	9	18	( U ) While He was saying these things to them , behold , [ l ] a synagogue [ m ] official came and [ n ] ( V ) bowed down before Him , and said , “ My daughter has just died ; but come and lay Your hand on her , and she will become alive again. ”
NASB	Matthew	9	19	Jesus got up from the table and began to accompany him , along with His disciples .
NASB	Matthew	9	20	And behold , a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind Him , and touched ( W ) the [ o ] border of His [ p ] cloak ;
NASB	Matthew	9	21	for she was [ q ] saying [ r ] to herself , “ If I only ( X ) touch His cloak , I will [ s ] get well. ”
NASB	Matthew	9	22	But Jesus , turning and seeing her , said , “ Daughter , ( Y ) take courage ; ( Z ) your faith has [ t ] made you well. ” And [ u ] at once the woman was [ v ] made well .
NASB	Matthew	9	23	When Jesus came into the [ w ] official ’ s house and saw ( AA ) the flute players and the crowd in noisy disorder ,
NASB	Matthew	9	24	He said , “ Leave ; for the girl ( AB ) has not died , but is asleep. ” And they began laughing at Him .
NASB	Matthew	9	25	But ( AC ) when the crowd had been sent out , He entered and ( AD ) took her by the hand , and the girl [ x ] got up .
NASB	Matthew	9	26	And ( AE ) this news spread throughout that land .
NASB	Matthew	9	27	As Jesus went on from there , two men who were blind followed Him , crying out , “ Have mercy on us , ( AF ) Son of David ! ”
NASB	Matthew	9	28	And after He entered the house , the men who were blind came up to Him , and Jesus * said to them , “ Do you believe that I am able to do this ? ” They * said to Him , “ Yes , Lord. ”
NASB	Matthew	9	29	Then He touched their eyes , saying , “ [ y ] It shall be done for you ( AG ) according to your faith. ”
NASB	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened . And Jesus ( AH ) sternly warned them , saying , “ See that no one knows about this ! ”
NASB	Matthew	9	31	But they went out and ( AI ) spread the news about Him throughout that land .
NASB	Matthew	9	32	And as they were going out , behold , ( AJ ) a ( AK ) demon-possessed man who was unable to speak [ z ] was brought to Him .
NASB	Matthew	9	33	And after the demon was cast out , the man who was previously unable to speak talked ; and the crowds were amazed , and were saying , “ ( AL ) Nothing like this has ever [ aa ] been seen in Israel. ”
NASB	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees were saying , “ He ( AM ) casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons. ”
NASB	Matthew	9	35	Jesus was going through all the cities and villages , ( AN ) teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness .
NASB	Matthew	9	36	( AO ) Seeing the crowds , He felt compassion for them , ( AP ) because they were [ ab ] distressed and downcast , like sheep [ ac ] without a shepherd .

NASB	Matthew	10	23	“ But whenever they ( AJ ) persecute you in [ r ] one city , flee to the [ s ] next ; for truly I say to you , you will not finish going through the cities of Israel ( AK ) until the Son of Man comes . The Meaning of Discipleship
NASB	Matthew	10	24	“ ( AL ) A [ t ] disciple is not above his teacher , nor a slave above his master .
NASB	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for the disciple that he may become like his teacher , and the slave like his master . ( AM ) If they have called the head of the house [ u ] ( AN ) Beelzebul , how much more will they insult the members of his household !
NASB	Matthew	10	26	“ So do not ( AO ) fear them , ( AP ) for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed , or hidden that will not be known .
NASB	Matthew	10	27	( AQ ) What I tell you in the darkness , tell in the light ; and what you hear whispered in your ear , proclaim ( AR ) on the housetops .
NASB	Matthew	10	28	And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul ; but rather ( AS ) fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in [ v ] ( AT ) hell .
NASB	Matthew	10	29	( AU ) Are two sparrows not sold for an [ w ] assarion ? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father .
NASB	Matthew	10	30	But ( AV ) even the hairs of your head are all counted .
NASB	Matthew	10	31	So do not fear ; ( AW ) you are more valuable than a great number of sparrows .
NASB	Matthew	10	32	“ Therefore , ( AX ) everyone who [ x ] confesses Me before people , I will also confess [ y ] him before My Father who is in heaven .
NASB	Matthew	10	33	But ( AY ) whoever denies Me before people , I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven .
NASB	Matthew	10	34	“ ( AZ ) Do not think that I came to [ z ] bring peace on the earth ; I did not come to [ aa ] bring peace , but a sword .
NASB	Matthew	10	35	For I came to ( BA ) turn a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ;
NASB	Matthew	10	36	and ( BB ) a person ’ s enemies will be the members of his household .
NASB	Matthew	10	37	“ ( BC ) The one who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me ; and the one who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me .
NASB	Matthew	10	38	And ( BD ) the one who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me .
NASB	Matthew	10	39	( BE ) The one who has found his [ ab ] life will lose it , and the one who has lost his [ ac ] life on My account will find it . The Reward for Service
NASB	Matthew	10	40	“ ( BF ) The one who [ ad ] receives you [ ae ] receives Me , and ( BG ) the one who [ af ] receives Me [ ag ] receives Him who sent Me .
NASB	Matthew	10	41	( BH ) The one who [ ah ] receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet ’ s reward ; and the one who [ ai ] receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person shall receive a righteous person ’ s reward .

NASB	Matthew	11	11	Truly I say to you , among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist ! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
NASB	Matthew	11	2	( C ) Now while in prison , ( D ) John heard about the works of Christ , and he sent word by his disciples ,
NASB	Matthew	11	3	and said to Him , “ Are You ( E ) the Coming One , or are we to [ c ] look for someone else ? ”
NASB	Matthew	11	4	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Go and report to John what you hear and see :
NASB	Matthew	11	5	( F ) those who are blind receive sight and those who limp walk , those with leprosy are cleansed and those who are deaf hear , the dead are raised , and the ( G ) poor have the [ d ] gospel preached to them .
NASB	Matthew	11	6	And blessed is [ e ] any person who ( H ) does not [ f ] take offense at Me. ” Jesus ’ Tribute to John
NASB	Matthew	11	7	As these disciples of John were going away , Jesus began speaking to the crowds about John : “ What did you go out into ( I ) the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
NASB	Matthew	11	8	[ g ] But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothing ? Those who wear soft clothing are in kings ’ [ h ] palaces !
NASB	Matthew	11	9	[ i ] But what did you go out to see ? ( J ) A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and one who is more than a prophet .
NASB	Matthew	11	10	This is the one about whom it [ j ] is written :
NASB	Matthew	11	12	And ( L ) from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been treated violently , and violent men take it by force .
NASB	Matthew	11	13	For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John .
NASB	Matthew	11	14	And if you are willing to accept it , John himself is ( M ) Elijah who [ l ] was to come .
NASB	Matthew	11	15	( N ) The one who has ears to hear , [ m ] let him hear .
NASB	Matthew	11	16	“ But to what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces , who call out to the other children ,
NASB	Matthew	11	17	and say , ‘ We played the flute for you , and you did not dance ; we sang a song of mourning , and you did not [ n ] mourn. ’
NASB	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither ( O ) eating nor ( P ) drinking , and they say , ‘ ( Q ) He has a demon ! ’
NASB	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Behold , a gluttonous man and a [ o ] heavy drinker , ( R ) a friend of tax collectors and [ p ] sinners ! ’ And yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds. ” The Unrepenting Cities
NASB	Matthew	11	20	Then He began to reprimand the cities in which most of His [ q ] ( S ) miracles were done , because they did not repent .
NASB	Matthew	11	21	“ ( T ) Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , ( U ) Bethsaida ! For if the [ r ] miracles that occurred in you had occurred in ( V ) Tyre and ( W ) Sidon , they would have repented long ago in [ s ] ( X ) sackcloth and ashes .
NASB	Matthew	11	22	Nevertheless I say to you , ( Y ) it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on ( Z ) the day of judgment than for you .
NASB	Matthew	11	23	And you , ( AA ) Capernaum , will not be exalted to heaven , will you ? You will be ( AB ) brought down to ( AC ) Hades ! For if the [ t ] miracles that occurred in you had occurred in ( AD ) Sodom , it would have remained to this day .
NASB	Matthew	11	24	Nevertheless I say to you that ( AE ) it will be more tolerable for the land of ( AF ) Sodom on the day of judgment , than for you. ” Come to Me
NASB	Matthew	11	25	[ u ] ( AG ) At that time Jesus said , “ I praise You , ( AH ) Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that ( AI ) You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent , and have revealed them to infants .
NASB	Matthew	11	26	Yes , ( AJ ) Father , for this way was well pleasing in Your sight .
NASB	Matthew	11	27	( AK ) All things have been handed over to Me by My Father ; and no one knows the Son except the Father ; nor does anyone know the Father ( AL ) except the Son , and anyone to whom the Son determines to reveal Him .
NASB	Matthew	11	28	“ ( AM ) Come to Me , all [ v ] who are weary and burdened , and I will give you rest .
NASB	Matthew	11	29	Take My yoke upon you and ( AN ) learn from Me , for I am gentle and humble in heart , and ( AO ) you will find [ w ] rest for your souls .

NASB	Matthew	12	12	( K ) How much more valuable then is a person than a sheep ! So then , it is lawful to do [ k ] good on the Sabbath. ”
NASB	Matthew	12	2	Now when the Pharisees saw this , they said to Him , “ Look , Your disciples are doing what ( C ) is not lawful to do on a Sabbath ! ”
NASB	Matthew	12	3	But He said to them , “ Have you not read what David did when he became hungry , he and his companions—
NASB	Matthew	12	4	how he entered the house of God , and ( D ) they ate the [ b ] consecrated bread , which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him , but for the priests alone ?
NASB	Matthew	12	5	Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple [ c ] violate the Sabbath , and yet are innocent ?
NASB	Matthew	12	6	But I say to you that something ( E ) greater than the temple is here .
NASB	Matthew	12	7	But if you had known what this [ d ] means : ‘ ( F ) I desire [ e ] compassion , [ f ] rather than sacrifice , ’ you would not have condemned [ g ] the innocent . Lord of the Sabbath
NASB	Matthew	12	8	For ( G ) the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. ”
NASB	Matthew	12	9	( H ) Departing from there , He went into their synagogue .
NASB	Matthew	12	10	And a man was there whose hand was withered . And they questioned [ h ] Jesus , asking , “ ( I ) Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? ” —so that they might bring charges against Him .
NASB	Matthew	12	11	But He said to them , “ ( J ) What man [ i ] is there among you who [ j ] has a sheep , and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will he not take hold of it and lift it out ?
NASB	Matthew	12	13	Then He * said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand ! ” ( L ) He stretched it out , and it was restored to [ l ] normal , like the other .
NASB	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and [ m ] ( M ) conspired against Him , as to how they might destroy Him .
NASB	Matthew	12	15	But Jesus , [ n ] aware of this , withdrew from there . Many followed Him , and ( N ) He healed them all ,
NASB	Matthew	12	16	and ( O ) warned them not to [ o ] tell who He was .
NASB	Matthew	12	17	This happened so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled :
NASB	Matthew	12	18	“ ( P ) Behold , My [ p ] Servant whom I [ q ] have chosen ; ( Q ) My Beloved in whom My soul [ r ] delights ; ( R ) I will put My Spirit upon Him , ( S ) And He will proclaim [ s ] justice to the [ t ] Gentiles .
NASB	Matthew	12	19	( T ) He will not quarrel , nor cry out ; Nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets .
NASB	Matthew	12	20	( U ) A bent reed He will not break off , And a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish , Until He [ u ] leads [ v ] justice to victory .
NASB	Matthew	12	21	( V ) And in His name the [ w ] Gentiles will hope. ” The Pharisees Rebuked
NASB	Matthew	12	22	( W ) Then a ( X ) demon-possessed man who was blind and unable to speak was brought to [ x ] Jesus , and He healed him so that the man who was unable to speak talked and [ y ] could see .

NASB	Matthew	12	25	( AA ) And ( AB ) knowing their thoughts , Jesus said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste ; and no city or house divided against itself will stand .

NASB	Matthew	12	27	And if ( AD ) by [ ab ] Beelzebul I cast out the demons , ( AE ) by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore , they will be your judges .

NASB	Matthew	12	29	Or , how can anyone enter the strong man ’ s house and carry off his property , unless he first ties up the strong man ? And then he will plunder his house . The Unpardonable Sin
NASB	Matthew	12	30	( AG ) The one who is not with Me is against Me ; and the one who does not gather with Me scatters .
NASB	Matthew	12	31	“ ( AH ) Therefore I say to you , every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people , but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven .
NASB	Matthew	12	32	( AI ) And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it shall be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , either in ( AJ ) this age or in the age to come . Words Reveal Character
NASB	Matthew	12	33	“ Either [ ac ] assume the tree to be good as well as its fruit good , or [ ad ] assume the tree to be bad as well as its fruit bad ; for ( AK ) the tree is known by its fruit .
NASB	Matthew	12	34	( AL ) You [ ae ] offspring of vipers , how can you , being evil , express any good things ? ( AM ) For the mouth speaks from that which fills the heart .
NASB	Matthew	12	35	( AN ) The good person brings out of his good treasure good things ; and the evil person brings out of his evil treasure evil things .
NASB	Matthew	12	36	But I tell you that for every [ af ] careless word that people [ ag ] speak , they will give an account of it on the ( AO ) day of judgment .
NASB	Matthew	12	37	For [ ah ] by your words you will be justified , and [ ai ] by your words you will be condemned. ” The Desire for Signs
NASB	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him , “ Teacher , ( AP ) we want to see a [ aj ] sign from You. ”
NASB	Matthew	12	39	But He answered and said to them , “ ( AQ ) An evil and adulterous generation craves a [ ak ] sign ; and so no [ al ] sign will be given to it except the [ am ] sign of Jonah the prophet ;
NASB	Matthew	12	40	for just as ( AR ) Jonah was in the stomach of the sea monster for three days and three nights , so will ( AS ) the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for ( AT ) three days and three nights .
NASB	Matthew	12	41	( AU ) The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment , and will condemn it because ( AV ) they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , something ( AW ) greater than Jonah is here .
NASB	Matthew	12	42	( AX ) The Queen of the South will rise up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , something ( AY ) greater than Solomon is here .
NASB	Matthew	12	43	“ ( AZ ) Now when the unclean spirit comes out of a person , it passes through waterless places seeking rest , and does not find it .
NASB	Matthew	12	44	Then it says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came ’ ; and when it comes , it finds it unoccupied , swept , and put in order .
NASB	Matthew	12	45	Then it goes and brings along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they come in and live there ; and ( BA ) the last condition of that person becomes worse than the first . That is the way it will also be with this evil generation. ” Changed Relationships
NASB	Matthew	12	46	( BB ) While He was still speaking to the crowds , behold , His ( BC ) mother and ( BD ) brothers were standing outside , seeking to speak to Him .
NASB	Matthew	12	47	[ [ an ] Someone said to Him , “ Look , Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , seeking to speak to You. ” ]
NASB	Matthew	12	48	But [ ao ] Jesus replied to the one who was telling Him and said , “ Who is My mother , and who are My brothers ? ”
NASB	Matthew	12	49	And extending His hand toward His disciples , He said , “ Behold : My mother and My brothers !

NASB	Matthew	13	13	Therefore I speak to them in parables ; because while ( I ) seeing they do not see , and while hearing they do not hear , nor do they understand .
NASB	Matthew	13	2	And large crowds gathered to Him , so ( C ) He got into a boat and sat down , and the whole crowd was standing on the beach .
NASB	Matthew	13	3	And He told them many things in ( D ) parables , saying , “ Behold , the sower went out to sow ;
NASB	Matthew	13	4	and as he sowed , some seeds fell beside the road , and the birds came and ate them up .
NASB	Matthew	13	5	Others fell on the rocky places , where they did not have much soil ; and they sprang up immediately , because they had no depth of soil .
NASB	Matthew	13	6	But after the sun rose , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
NASB	Matthew	13	7	Others fell [ a ] among the thorns , and the thorns came up and choked them out .
NASB	Matthew	13	8	But others fell on the good soil and yielded a crop , some a ( E ) hundred , some sixty , and some thirty times as much .
NASB	Matthew	13	9	( F ) The one who has ears , [ b ] let him hear. ” An Explanation for Parables
NASB	Matthew	13	10	And the disciples came up and said to Him , “ Why do You speak to them in parables ? ”
NASB	Matthew	13	11	And [ c ] Jesus answered them , “ ( G ) To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been granted .
NASB	Matthew	13	12	( H ) For whoever has , to him more shall be given , and he will have an abundance ; but whoever does not have , even what he has shall be taken away from him .
NASB	Matthew	13	14	And [ d ] in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled , which says , ‘ [ e ] ( J ) You shall keep on listening , [ f ] but shall not understand ; And [ g ] you shall keep on looking , [ h ] but shall not perceive ;
NASB	Matthew	13	15	( K ) For the heart of this people has become dull , With their ears they scarcely hear , And they have closed their eyes , Otherwise they might see with their eyes , Hear with their ears , Understand with their heart , and return , And I would heal them. ’
NASB	Matthew	13	16	( L ) But blessed are your eyes , because they see ; and your ears , because they hear .
NASB	Matthew	13	17	For truly I say to you that ( M ) many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it . The Sower Explained
NASB	Matthew	13	18	“ ( N ) Listen then to the parable of the sower .
NASB	Matthew	13	19	When anyone hears ( O ) the [ i ] word of the kingdom and does not understand it , ( P ) the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart . This is the one sown with seed beside the road .
NASB	Matthew	13	20	The one sown with seed on the rocky places , this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy ;
NASB	Matthew	13	21	yet he has no firm root in himself , but is only temporary , and when affliction or persecution occurs because of the [ j ] word , immediately he [ k ] ( Q ) falls away .

NASB	Matthew	13	24	Jesus presented another parable to them , saying , “ ( U ) The kingdom of heaven [ n ] is like a man who sowed good seed in his field .
NASB	Matthew	13	25	But while his men were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed [ o ] weeds among the wheat , and left .
NASB	Matthew	13	26	And when the [ p ] wheat sprouted and produced grain , then the weeds also became evident .
NASB	Matthew	13	27	And the slaves of the landowner came and said to him , ‘ Sir , did you not sow good seed in your field ? [ q ] How then does it have weeds ? ’
NASB	Matthew	13	28	And he said to them , ‘ [ r ] An enemy has done this ! ’ The slaves * said to him , ‘ Do you want us , then , to go and gather them up ? ’
NASB	Matthew	13	29	But he * said , ‘ No ; while you are gathering up the weeds , you may uproot the wheat with them .
NASB	Matthew	13	30	Allow both to grow together until the harvest ; and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers , “ First gather up the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them ; but ( V ) gather the wheat into my barn. ” ’ ” The Mustard Seed
NASB	Matthew	13	31	He presented another parable to them , saying , “ ( W ) The kingdom of heaven is like ( X ) a mustard seed , which a person took and sowed in his field ;
NASB	Matthew	13	32	and this is smaller than all the other seeds , but when it is fully grown , it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree , so that ( Y ) the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches. ” The Leaven
NASB	Matthew	13	33	He spoke another parable to them : “ ( Z ) The kingdom of heaven is like [ s ] leaven , which a woman took and hid in ( AA ) three [ t ] sata of flour until it was all leavened. ”
NASB	Matthew	13	34	All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables , and He did not speak anything to them ( AB ) without a parable .
NASB	Matthew	13	35	This was so that what was spoken through the prophet would be [ u ] fulfilled : “ ( AC ) I will open My mouth in parables ; I will proclaim things hidden since the foundation of the world. ” The Weeds Explained
NASB	Matthew	13	36	Then He left the crowds and went into ( AD ) the house . And His disciples came to Him and said , “ ( AE ) Explain to us the parable of the [ v ] weeds of the field. ”
NASB	Matthew	13	37	And He said , “ The one who sows the good seed is ( AF ) the Son of Man ,
NASB	Matthew	13	38	and the field is the world ; and as for the good seed , these are ( AG ) the sons of the kingdom ; and the weeds are ( AH ) the sons of ( AI ) the evil one ;
NASB	Matthew	13	39	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil , and the harvest is ( AJ ) the [ w ] end of the age ; and the reapers are angels .
NASB	Matthew	13	40	So just as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire , so shall it be at ( AK ) the [ x ] end of the age .

NASB	Matthew	13	53	( AZ ) When Jesus had finished these parables , He departed from there .
NASB	Matthew	13	54	And ( BA ) He came to [ ad ] His hometown and ( BB ) began teaching them in their synagogue , with the result that ( BC ) they were astonished , and said , “ Where did this man acquire this wisdom and these [ ae ] miraculous powers ?

NASB	Matthew	14	14	When He came [ j ] ashore , He ( L ) saw a large crowd , and felt compassion for them and ( M ) healed their sick .
NASB	Matthew	14	2	and said to his servants , “ ( C ) This is John the Baptist ; he himself has been raised from the dead , and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him. ”
NASB	Matthew	14	3	For when ( D ) Herod had John arrested , he bound him and put him ( E ) in prison because of ( F ) Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip .
NASB	Matthew	14	4	For John had been saying to him , “ ( G ) It is not lawful for you to have her. ”
NASB	Matthew	14	5	Although Herod wanted to put him to death , he feared the crowd , because they regarded [ d ] John as ( H ) a prophet .
NASB	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod ’ s birthday came , the daughter of ( I ) Herodias danced [ e ] before them and pleased ( J ) Herod ,
NASB	Matthew	14	7	so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked .
NASB	Matthew	14	8	And after being prompted by her mother , she * said , “ Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter. ”
NASB	Matthew	14	9	And although he was grieved , the king commanded it to be given because of his oaths and [ f ] his dinner guests .
NASB	Matthew	14	10	He sent word and had John beheaded in the prison .
NASB	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl , and she brought it to her mother .
NASB	Matthew	14	12	[ g ] John ’ s disciples came and took away the body and buried [ h ] it ; and they went and reported to Jesus . Five Thousand Men Fed
NASB	Matthew	14	13	( K ) Now when Jesus heard about John , He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself ; and when the [ i ] people heard about this , they followed Him on foot from the cities .
NASB	Matthew	14	15	Now when it was evening , the disciples came to Him and said , “ This place is secluded and the hour is already past to eat ; send the crowds away , so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves. ”
NASB	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said to them , “ They do not need to go ; you give them something to eat ! ”
NASB	Matthew	14	17	They * said to Him , “ We have nothing here except ( N ) five loaves and two fish. ”
NASB	Matthew	14	18	And He said , “ Bring them here to Me. ”
NASB	Matthew	14	19	And ordering the crowds to [ k ] sit down on the grass , He took the five loaves and the two fish , and looked up toward heaven . He ( O ) blessed the food and breaking the loaves , He gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds .
NASB	Matthew	14	20	And they all ate and were satisfied , and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces : twelve full ( P ) baskets .
NASB	Matthew	14	21	There were about five thousand men who ate , besides women and children . Jesus Walks on the Water
NASB	Matthew	14	22	( Q ) Immediately afterward He compelled the disciples to get into the boat and to go ahead of Him to the other side , while He sent the crowds away .
NASB	Matthew	14	23	After He had sent the crowds away , ( R ) He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray ; and when it was evening , He was there alone .
NASB	Matthew	14	24	But the boat was already [ l ] a long distance from the land , [ m ] battered by the waves ; for the wind was [ n ] ( S ) contrary .
NASB	Matthew	14	25	And in ( T ) the [ o ] fourth watch of the night He came to them , walking on the sea .
NASB	Matthew	14	26	When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea , they were terrified , and said , “ It is ( U ) a ghost ! ” And they cried out [ p ] in fear .
NASB	Matthew	14	27	But immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying , “ ( V ) Take courage , [ q ] it is I ; ( W ) do not be afraid. ”
NASB	Matthew	14	28	Peter responded and said to Him , “ Lord , if [ r ] it is You , command me to come to You on the water. ”
NASB	Matthew	14	29	And He said , “ Come ! ” And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water , and came toward Jesus .
NASB	Matthew	14	30	But seeing the wind , he became frightened , and when he began to sink , he cried out , saying , “ Lord , save me ! ”
NASB	Matthew	14	31	Immediately Jesus reached out with His hand and took hold of him , and * said to him , “ ( X ) You of little faith , why did you doubt ? ”
NASB	Matthew	14	32	When they got into the boat , the wind stopped .
NASB	Matthew	14	33	And those who were in the boat worshiped Him , saying , “ You are truly ( Y ) God ’ s Son ! ”
NASB	Matthew	14	34	( Z ) When they had crossed over , they came to land at ( AA ) Gennesaret .
NASB	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place [ s ] recognized Him , they sent word into all that surrounding region and brought to Him all who were sick ;
NASB	Matthew	14	36	and they pleaded with Him that they might just touch ( AB ) the [ t ] border of His cloak ; and all who ( AC ) touched it were cured .

NASB	Matthew	15	15	Peter [ f ] said to Him , “ ( L ) Explain the parable to us. ”
NASB	Matthew	15	2	“ Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders ? For they ( C ) do not wash their hands when they eat bread. ”
NASB	Matthew	15	3	And He answered and said to them , “ Why do you yourselves also break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition ?
NASB	Matthew	15	4	For God said , ‘ ( D ) Honor your father and mother , ’ and , ‘ ( E ) The one who speaks evil of father or mother is to [ a ] be put to death. ’
NASB	Matthew	15	5	But you say , ‘ Whoever says to his father or mother , “ Whatever I have that would help you has been [ b ] given to God , ”
NASB	Matthew	15	6	he is not to [ c ] honor his father or mother. ’ And by this you have invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition .
NASB	Matthew	15	7	You hypocrites , rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you , by saying :
NASB	Matthew	15	8	‘ ( F ) This people honors Me with their lips , But their heart is far away from Me .
NASB	Matthew	15	9	And in vain do they worship Me , Teaching as ( G ) doctrines the commandments of men. ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	15	10	After Jesus called the crowd to Him , He said to them , “ Hear and understand !
NASB	Matthew	15	11	( H ) It is not what enters the mouth that defiles the person , but what comes out of the mouth , this defiles the person. ”
NASB	Matthew	15	12	Then the disciples came and * said to Him , “ Do You know that the Pharisees were [ d ] offended when they heard this statement ? ”
NASB	Matthew	15	13	But He answered and said , “ ( I ) Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted .
NASB	Matthew	15	14	Leave them alone ; ( J ) they are blind guides [ e ] of blind people . And ( K ) if a person who is blind guides another who is blind , both will fall into a pit. ” The Heart of Man
NASB	Matthew	15	16	[ g ] Jesus said , “ Are you also still lacking in understanding ?
NASB	Matthew	15	17	Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach , and is [ h ] eliminated ?
NASB	Matthew	15	18	But ( M ) the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart , and those things defile the person .
NASB	Matthew	15	19	( N ) For out of the heart come evil thoughts , murders , acts of adultery , other immoral sexual acts , thefts , false testimonies , and [ i ] slanderous statements .
NASB	Matthew	15	20	These are the things that defile the person ; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the person. ” The Faith of a Canaanite Woman
NASB	Matthew	15	21	( O ) Jesus went away from there , and withdrew into the region of ( P ) Tyre and ( Q ) Sidon .
NASB	Matthew	15	22	And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out , saying , “ Have mercy on me , Lord , ( R ) Son of David ; my daughter is severely ( S ) demon-possessed. ”
NASB	Matthew	15	23	But He did not answer her with even a word . And His disciples came up and urged Him , saying , “ Send her away , because she keeps shouting [ j ] at us ! ”
NASB	Matthew	15	24	But He answered and said , “ I was sent only to ( T ) the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ”
NASB	Matthew	15	25	But she came and ( U ) began [ k ] to bow down before Him , saying , “ Lord , help me ! ”
NASB	Matthew	15	26	Yet He answered and said , “ It is not [ l ] good to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the dogs. ”
NASB	Matthew	15	27	And she said , “ Yes , Lord ; but please help , for even the dogs feed on the crumbs that fall from their masters ’ table. ”
NASB	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus said to her , “ O woman , ( V ) your faith is great ; it shall be done for you as you desire. ” And her daughter was healed [ m ] at once . Healing Crowds
NASB	Matthew	15	29	( W ) Departing from there , Jesus went along ( X ) the Sea of Galilee , and after going up on the mountain , He was sitting there .
NASB	Matthew	15	30	And [ n ] large crowds came to Him bringing with them those who were limping , had impaired limbs , were blind , or were unable to speak , and many others , and they laid them down at His feet ; and ( Y ) He healed them .
NASB	Matthew	15	31	So the crowd was astonished as they saw those who were unable to speak talking , those with impaired limbs [ o ] restored , those who were limping walking around , and those who were blind seeing ; and they ( Z ) glorified the God of Israel . Four Thousand Men Fed
NASB	Matthew	15	32	( AA ) Now Jesus called His disciples to Him and said , “ ( AB ) I feel compassion for the [ p ] people , because they [ q ] have remained with Me now for three days and have nothing to eat ; and I do not want to send them away hungry , for they might faint on the way. ”
NASB	Matthew	15	33	The disciples * said to Him , “ Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd ? ”
NASB	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus * said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” And they said , “ Seven , and a few small fish. ”
NASB	Matthew	15	35	And He directed the [ r ] people to [ s ] sit down on the ground ;
NASB	Matthew	15	36	and He took the seven loaves and the fish ; and after ( AC ) giving thanks , He broke them and started giving them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds .
NASB	Matthew	15	37	And they all ate and were satisfied , and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces , seven large ( AD ) baskets full .
NASB	Matthew	15	38	And those who ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .

NASB	Matthew	16	5	And the disciples came to the other side of the sea , but they had forgotten to bring any bread .
NASB	Matthew	16	6	And Jesus said to them , “ Watch out and ( G ) beware of the [ f ] leaven of the ( H ) Pharisees and Sadducees. ”
NASB	Matthew	16	7	They began to discuss this among themselves , saying , “ He said that because we did not bring any bread. ”
NASB	Matthew	16	8	But Jesus , aware of this , said , “ ( I ) You men of little faith , why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread ?
NASB	Matthew	16	9	Do you not yet understand nor remember ( J ) the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets you picked up ?

NASB	Matthew	16	13	( O ) Now when Jesus came into the region of ( P ) Caesarea Philippi , He was asking His disciples , “ Who do people say that ( Q ) the Son of Man is ? ”
NASB	Matthew	16	14	And they said , “ Some say ( R ) John the Baptist ; and others , [ i ] ( S ) Elijah ; and still others , [ j ] Jeremiah , or one of the other prophets. ”
NASB	Matthew	16	15	He * said to them , “ But who do you yourselves say that I am ? ”
NASB	Matthew	16	17	And Jesus said to him , “ Blessed are you , ( W ) Simon [ l ] Barjona , because ( X ) flesh and blood did not reveal this to you , but My Father who is in heaven .
NASB	Matthew	16	18	And I also say to you that you are [ m ] ( Y ) Peter , and upon this [ n ] rock I will build My church ; and the gates of ( Z ) Hades will not overpower it .

NASB	Matthew	16	20	( AC ) Then He gave the disciples strict orders that they were to tell no one that He was ( AD ) the [ s ] Christ . Jesus Foretells His Death
NASB	Matthew	16	21	( AE ) From that time [ t ] Jesus began to [ u ] point out to His disciples that it was necessary for Him to go to Jerusalem and to ( AF ) suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and to be killed , and to be raised up on the third day .
NASB	Matthew	16	22	And yet Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him , saying , “ [ v ] God forbid it , Lord ! This shall never [ w ] happen to You ! ”
NASB	Matthew	16	23	But He turned and said to Peter , “ Get behind Me , ( AG ) Satan ! You are a stumbling block to Me ; for you are not setting your mind on [ x ] God ’ s purposes , but men ’ s. ” Discipleship Is Costly
NASB	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus said to His disciples , “ If anyone wants to come after Me , he must deny himself , ( AH ) take up his cross , and follow Me .
NASB	Matthew	16	25	For ( AI ) whoever wants to save his [ y ] life will lose it ; but whoever loses his [ z ] life for My sake will find it .
NASB	Matthew	16	26	For what good will it do a person if he gains the whole world , but [ aa ] forfeits his soul ? Or what will a person give in exchange for his soul ?
NASB	Matthew	16	27	For the ( AJ ) Son of Man ( AK ) is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels , and ( AL ) will then repay every person according to his [ ab ] deeds .

NASB	Matthew	17	17	And Jesus answered and said , “ You unbelieving and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring him here to Me. ”
NASB	Matthew	17	2	And He was transfigured before them ; and His face shone like the sun , and His garments became as white as light .
NASB	Matthew	17	3	And behold , Moses and Elijah appeared to them , talking with Him .
NASB	Matthew	17	4	Peter responded and said to Jesus , “ Lord , it is good that we are here . If You want , ( C ) I will make three [ b ] tabernacles here : one for You , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
NASB	Matthew	17	5	While he was still speaking , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and behold , ( D ) a voice from the cloud said , “ ( E ) This is My beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased ; listen to Him ! ”
NASB	Matthew	17	6	When the disciples heard this , they fell [ c ] face down to the ground and were terrified .
NASB	Matthew	17	7	And Jesus came to them and touched them and said , “ Get up , and ( F ) do not be afraid. ”
NASB	Matthew	17	8	And raising their eyes , they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone .
NASB	Matthew	17	9	( G ) When they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , “ ( H ) Tell the vision to no one until ( I ) the Son of Man has ( J ) risen from the dead. ”
NASB	Matthew	17	10	And His disciples asked Him , “ Why then do the scribes say that ( K ) Elijah must come first ? ”
NASB	Matthew	17	11	And He answered and said , “ Elijah is coming and will restore all things ;
NASB	Matthew	17	12	but I say to you that Elijah already came , and they did not recognize him , but did [ d ] to him whatever they wanted . So also ( L ) the Son of Man is going to suffer [ e ] at their hands. ”
NASB	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist . The Demon-possessed Boy
NASB	Matthew	17	14	( M ) When they came to the crowd , a man came up to [ f ] Jesus , falling on his knees before Him and saying ,
NASB	Matthew	17	15	“ [ g ] Lord , have mercy on my son , because he ( N ) has seizures and suffers terribly ; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water .
NASB	Matthew	17	16	And I brought him to Your disciples , and they could not cure him. ”
NASB	Matthew	17	18	And Jesus rebuked him , and the demon came out of him , and the boy was healed [ h ] at once .
NASB	Matthew	17	19	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said , “ Why could we not cast it out ? ”
NASB	Matthew	17	20	And He * said to them , “ Because of your meager faith ; for truly I say to you , ( O ) if you have faith [ i ] the size of ( P ) a mustard seed , you will say to ( Q ) this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it will move ; and ( R ) nothing will be impossible for you . [ j ] ”
NASB	Matthew	17	22	( S ) And while they were gathering together in Galilee , Jesus said to them , “ The Son of Man is going to be [ k ] handed over to men ;
NASB	Matthew	17	23	and ( T ) they will kill Him , and He will be raised on the third day. ” And they were deeply grieved . The Temple Tax
NASB	Matthew	17	24	Now when they came to Capernaum , those who collected ( U ) the [ l ] two-drachma tax came to Peter and said , “ Does your teacher not pay ( V ) the [ m ] two-drachma tax ? ”
NASB	Matthew	17	25	He * said , “ Yes. ” And when he came into the house , Jesus spoke to him first , saying , “ What do you think , Simon ? From whom do the kings of the earth collect ( W ) customs or [ n ] ( X ) poll-tax , from their sons or from strangers ? ”
NASB	Matthew	17	26	When Peter said , “ From strangers , ” Jesus said to him , “ Then the sons are [ o ] exempt .
NASB	Matthew	17	27	However , so that we do not ( Y ) offend them , go to the sea and throw in a hook , and take the first fish that comes up ; and when you open its mouth , you will find a [ p ] stater .

NASB	Matthew	18	18	Truly I say to you , ( P ) whatever you [ r ] bind on earth [ s ] shall have been bound in heaven ; and whatever you [ t ] loose on earth [ u ] shall have been loosed in heaven .
NASB	Matthew	18	2	And He called a child to Himself and set him among them ,
NASB	Matthew	18	3	and said , “ Truly I say to you , unless you [ b ] change and ( C ) become like children , you will not enter the kingdom of heaven .
NASB	Matthew	18	4	So whoever will humble himself like this child , he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
NASB	Matthew	18	5	And whoever receives one such child in My name , receives Me ;
NASB	Matthew	18	6	but ( D ) whoever ( E ) causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to [ c ] sin , it is better for him that a [ d ] heavy millstone be hung around his neck , and that he be drowned in the depths of the sea . Stumbling Blocks
NASB	Matthew	18	7	“ Woe to the world because of its [ e ] stumbling blocks ! For ( F ) it is inevitable that [ f ] stumbling blocks come ; but woe to the person through whom the [ g ] stumbling block comes !
NASB	Matthew	18	8	“ And ( G ) if your hand or your foot is causing you to sin , cut it off and throw it away from you ; it is better for you to enter life maimed or without a foot , than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire .
NASB	Matthew	18	9	And ( H ) if your eye is causing you to sin , tear it out and throw it away from you . It is better for you to enter life with one eye , than to have two eyes and be thrown into the [ h ] ( I ) fiery hell .
NASB	Matthew	18	10	“ See that you do not look down on one of these little ones ; for I say to you that ( J ) their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven . [ i ] Ninety-nine Plus One
NASB	Matthew	18	12	“ What do you think ? ( K ) If any man has a hundred sheep , and one of them goes astray , will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains , and go and search for the one that is lost ?
NASB	Matthew	18	13	And if it turns out that he finds it , truly I say to you , he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray .
NASB	Matthew	18	14	So it is not the will [ j ] of your Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish . Discipline and Prayer
NASB	Matthew	18	15	“ Now ( L ) if your brother sins [ k ] , go and [ l ] show him his fault [ m ] in private ; if he listens to you , you have gained your brother .
NASB	Matthew	18	16	But if he does not listen to you , take one or two more with you , so that ( M ) on the [ n ] testimony of two or three witnesses every [ o ] matter may be confirmed .
NASB	Matthew	18	17	And if he refuses to listen to them , ( N ) tell it to the church ; and if he refuses to listen even to the church , ( O ) he is to be to you as [ p ] a Gentile and [ q ] a tax collector .
NASB	Matthew	18	19	“ Again I say to you , that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask , ( Q ) it shall be done for them [ v ] by My Father who is in heaven .
NASB	Matthew	18	20	For where two or three have gathered together in My name , ( R ) I am there in their midst. ” Forgiveness
NASB	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter came up and said to Him , “ Lord , ( S ) how many times shall my brother sin against me and I still forgive him ? Up to ( T ) seven times ? ”
NASB	Matthew	18	22	Jesus * said to him , “ I do not say to you , up to seven times , but up to [ w ] ( U ) seventy-seven times .
NASB	Matthew	18	23	“ For this reason ( V ) the kingdom of heaven [ x ] is like a king who wanted to ( W ) settle accounts with his slaves .
NASB	Matthew	18	24	And when he had begun to settle them , one who owed him [ y ] ten thousand talents was brought to him .
NASB	Matthew	18	25	But since he [ z ] ( X ) did not have the means to repay , his master commanded that he ( Y ) be sold , along with his wife and children and all that he had , and repayment be made .
NASB	Matthew	18	26	So the slave fell to the ground and ( Z ) prostrated himself before him , saying , ‘ Have patience with me and I will repay you everything. ’
NASB	Matthew	18	27	And the master of that slave felt compassion , and he released him and ( AA ) forgave him the [ aa ] debt .
NASB	Matthew	18	28	But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred [ ab ] denarii ; and he seized him and began to choke him , saying , ‘ Pay back what you owe ! ’
NASB	Matthew	18	29	So his fellow slave fell to the ground and began to plead with him , saying , ‘ Have patience with me and I will repay you. ’
NASB	Matthew	18	30	But he was unwilling , [ ac ] and went and threw him in prison until he would pay back what was owed .
NASB	Matthew	18	31	So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened , they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their master all that had happened .
NASB	Matthew	18	32	Then summoning him , his master * said to him , ‘ You wicked slave , I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me .
NASB	Matthew	18	33	( AB ) Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave , in the same way that I had mercy on you ? ’
NASB	Matthew	18	34	And his master , moved with anger , handed him over to the [ ad ] torturers until he would repay all that was owed him .
NASB	Matthew	18	35	( AC ) My heavenly Father will also do the same to you , if each of you does not forgive his brother from your [ ae ] heart. ” Footnotes - Matthew 18:1 Lit hour - Matthew 18:3 Lit turn - Matthew 18:6 Or stumble , and so throughout the ch - Matthew 18:6 Lit millstone turned by a donkey - Matthew 18:7 I.e. , enticements to sin - Matthew 18:7 I.e. , enticements to sin - Matthew 18:7 I.e. , enticements to sin - Matthew 18:9 Lit Gehenna of fire - Matthew 18:10 Late mss add ( traditionally v

NASB	Matthew	19	19	( S ) Honor your father and mother ; and ( T ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”
NASB	Matthew	19	2	and [ a ] large crowds followed Him , and ( C ) He healed them there .
NASB	Matthew	19	3	Some Pharisees came to [ b ] Jesus , testing Him and [ c ] asking , “ ( D ) Is it lawful for a man to [ d ] divorce his wife for any reason at all ? ”
NASB	Matthew	19	4	And He answered and said , “ Have you not read ( E ) that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female ,
NASB	Matthew	19	5	and said , ‘ ( F ) For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife , and ( G ) the two shall become one flesh ’ ?
NASB	Matthew	19	6	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . Therefore , what God has joined together , no person is to separate. ”
NASB	Matthew	19	7	They * said to Him , “ ( H ) Why , then , did Moses command to give her a certificate of divorce and send her away ? ”
NASB	Matthew	19	8	He * said to them , “ Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to [ e ] divorce your wives ; but from the beginning it has not been this way .
NASB	Matthew	19	9	And I say to you , ( I ) whoever [ f ] divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , and marries another woman [ g ] commits adultery [ h ] . ”
NASB	Matthew	19	10	The disciples * said to Him , “ If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this , it is better not to marry. ”
NASB	Matthew	19	11	But He said to them , “ ( J ) Not all men can accept this statement , but ( K ) only those to whom it has been given .
NASB	Matthew	19	12	For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother ’ s womb ; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by people ; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . The one who is able to accept this , let him accept it. ” Jesus Blesses Little Children
NASB	Matthew	19	13	( L ) Then some children were brought to Him so that He would lay His hands on them and pray ; and the disciples rebuked them .
NASB	Matthew	19	14	But Jesus said , “ [ i ] ( M ) Leave the children alone , and do not [ j ] forbid them to come to Me ; for ( N ) the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these. ”
NASB	Matthew	19	15	After laying His hands on them , He departed from there . The Rich Young Ruler
NASB	Matthew	19	16	( O ) And someone came to Him and said , “ Teacher , what good thing shall I do so that I may obtain ( P ) eternal life ? ”
NASB	Matthew	19	17	And He said to him , “ Why are you asking Me about what is good ? There is only One who is good ; but ( Q ) if you want to enter life , keep the commandments. ”
NASB	Matthew	19	18	Then he * said to Him , “ Which ones ? ” And Jesus said , “ ( R ) You shall not commit murder ; You shall not commit adultery ; You shall not steal ; You shall not give false testimony ;
NASB	Matthew	19	20	The young man * said to Him , “ All these I have kept ; what am I still lacking ? ”
NASB	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said to him , “ If you want to be [ k ] complete , go and ( U ) sell your possessions and give to the poor , and you will have ( V ) treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me. ”
NASB	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard this statement , he went away grieving ; for he was one who owned much property .
NASB	Matthew	19	23	And Jesus said to His disciples , “ Truly I say to you , ( W ) it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven .
NASB	Matthew	19	24	And again I say to you , ( X ) it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NASB	Matthew	19	25	When the disciples heard this , they were very astonished and said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
NASB	Matthew	19	26	And looking at them , Jesus said to them , “ ( Y ) With people this is impossible , but with God all things are possible. ” The Disciples ’ Reward
NASB	Matthew	19	27	Then Peter responded and said to Him , “ Behold , we have left everything and followed You ; what then will there be for us ? ”
NASB	Matthew	19	28	And Jesus said to them , “ Truly I say to you , that you who have followed Me , in the [ l ] regeneration when ( Z ) the Son of Man will sit on [ m ] His glorious throne , ( AA ) you also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
NASB	Matthew	19	29	And ( AB ) everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother [ n ] or children or farms on account of My name , will receive [ o ] many times as much , and will inherit eternal life .

NASB	Matthew	20	7	They * said to him , ‘ Because no one hired us. ’ He * said to them , ‘ You go into the vineyard too. ’
NASB	Matthew	20	8	“ Now when ( C ) evening came , the [ g ] owner of the vineyard * said to his ( D ) foreman , ‘ Call the laborers and pay them their wages , starting with the last group to the first. ’

NASB	Matthew	20	12	saying , ‘ These who were hired last worked only one hour , and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day ’ s work and the ( E ) scorching heat. ’
NASB	Matthew	20	13	But he answered and said to one of them , ‘ ( F ) Friend , I am doing you no wrong ; did you not agree with me for a denarius ?
NASB	Matthew	20	14	Take what is yours and go ; but I want to give to this last person the same as to you .
NASB	Matthew	20	15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with what is my own ? Or is your ( G ) eye [ j ] envious because I am [ k ] generous ? ’
NASB	Matthew	20	16	So ( H ) the last shall be first , and the first , last. ” Death , Resurrection Foretold
NASB	Matthew	20	17	( I ) As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem , He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves , and on the road He said to them ,
NASB	Matthew	20	18	“ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man ( J ) will be [ l ] handed over to the chief priests and scribes , and they will condemn Him to death ,
NASB	Matthew	20	19	and they ( K ) will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and flog and crucify , and on ( L ) the third day He will be raised up. ” Request for Preferred Treatment
NASB	Matthew	20	21	And He said to her , “ What do you desire ? ” She * said to Him , “ Say that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine ( P ) shall sit , one at Your right , and one at Your left. ”
NASB	Matthew	20	22	But Jesus replied , “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able ( Q ) to drink the cup that I am about to drink ? ” They * said to Him , “ We are able. ”
NASB	Matthew	20	23	He * said to them , “ ( R ) My cup you shall drink ; but to sit at My right and at My left is not Mine to give , ( S ) but it is for those for whom it has been ( T ) prepared by My Father. ”
NASB	Matthew	20	24	And after hearing this , the other ten disciples became indignant with the two brothers .
NASB	Matthew	20	25	( U ) But Jesus called them to Himself and said , “ You know that the rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them , and [ o ] those in high position exercise authority over them .
NASB	Matthew	20	26	It [ p ] is not this way among you , ( V ) but whoever wants to become [ q ] prominent among you shall be your servant ,
NASB	Matthew	20	27	and whoever desires to be first among you shall be your slave ;
NASB	Matthew	20	28	just as ( W ) the Son of Man ( X ) did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His [ r ] life as a ransom for many. ” Sight for Those Who Are Blind
NASB	Matthew	20	29	( Y ) As they were leaving Jericho , a large crowd followed Him .
NASB	Matthew	20	30	And two people who were blind , sitting by the road , hearing that Jesus was passing by , cried out , “ Lord , ( Z ) have mercy on us , ( AA ) Son of David ! ”
NASB	Matthew	20	31	But the crowd sternly warned them to be quiet ; yet they cried out all the more , “ Lord , ( AB ) Son of David , have mercy on us ! ”
NASB	Matthew	20	32	And Jesus stopped and called them , and said , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ”
NASB	Matthew	20	33	They * said to Him , “ Lord , we want our eyes to be opened. ”
NASB	Matthew	20	34	Moved with compassion , Jesus touched their eyes ; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him . Footnotes - Matthew 20:1 Lit a man , a landowner - Matthew 20:2 The denarius was a day ’ s wages for a laborer - Matthew 20:3 I.e. ,

NASB	Matthew	21	21	And Jesus answered and said to them , “ Truly I say to you , ( V ) if you have faith and do not doubt , you will not only do what was done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and cast into the sea , ’ it will happen .
NASB	Matthew	21	2	saying to them , “ Go into the village opposite you , and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with it . Untie them and bring them to Me .
NASB	Matthew	21	3	And if anyone says anything to you , you shall say , ‘ The Lord needs them , ’ and he will send them on immediately. ”
NASB	Matthew	21	4	Now ( C ) this [ a ] took place so that what was spoken through [ b ] the prophet would be fulfilled :
NASB	Matthew	21	5	“ ( D ) Say to the daughter of Zion , ‘ Behold your King is coming to you , Humble , and mounted on a donkey , Even on a colt , the foal of a donkey. ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	21	6	The disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them ,
NASB	Matthew	21	7	and brought the donkey and the colt , and laid their cloaks on them ; and He sat on [ c ] the cloaks .
NASB	Matthew	21	8	Most of the crowd ( E ) spread their cloaks on the road , and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road .
NASB	Matthew	21	9	Now the crowds going ahead of Him , and those who followed , were shouting , “ [ d ] Hosanna to the ( F ) Son of David ; ( G ) Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord ; [ e ] Hosanna ( H ) in the highest ! ”
NASB	Matthew	21	10	When He had entered Jerusalem , all the city was stirred , saying , “ Who is this ? ”
NASB	Matthew	21	11	And the crowds were saying , “ This is ( I ) Jesus the prophet , from ( J ) Nazareth in Galilee. ” Cleansing the Temple
NASB	Matthew	21	12	( K ) And Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all those who were selling and buying on the temple grounds , and He overturned the tables of the ( L ) money changers and the seats of those who were selling ( M ) doves .
NASB	Matthew	21	13	And He * said to them , “ It is written : ‘ ( N ) My house will be called a house of prayer ’ ; but you are making it a ( O ) den of robbers. ”
NASB	Matthew	21	14	And those who were blind and those who limped came to Him in the temple area , and ( P ) He healed them .
NASB	Matthew	21	15	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done , and the children who were shouting in the temple area , “ [ f ] Hosanna to the ( Q ) Son of David , ” they became indignant ,
NASB	Matthew	21	16	and they said to Him , “ Do You hear what these children are saying ? ” And Jesus * said to them , “ Yes . Have you never read , ‘ ( R ) From the mouths of infants and nursing babies You have prepared praise for Yourself ’ ? ”
NASB	Matthew	21	17	And He left them and went out of the city to ( S ) Bethany , and spent the night there . The Barren Fig Tree
NASB	Matthew	21	18	( T ) Now in the early morning , when He was returning to the city , He became hungry .
NASB	Matthew	21	19	And seeing a lone ( U ) fig tree by the road , He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves alone ; and He * said to it , “ No longer shall there ever be any fruit from you. ” And at once the fig tree withered .
NASB	Matthew	21	20	Seeing this , the disciples were amazed and [ g ] asked , “ How did the fig tree wither all at once ? ”
NASB	Matthew	21	22	And ( W ) whatever you ask in prayer , believing , you will receive it all. ” Authority Challenged
NASB	Matthew	21	23	( X ) When He entered the temple area , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him ( Y ) while He was teaching , and said , “ By what authority are You doing these things , and who gave You this authority ? ”
NASB	Matthew	21	24	But Jesus responded and said to them , “ I will also ask you one [ h ] question , which , if you tell Me , I will also tell you by what authority I do these things .
NASB	Matthew	21	25	The baptism of John was from what source : from heaven or from men ? ” And they began considering the implications among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say to us , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
NASB	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we fear the [ i ] people ; for they all regard John as ( Z ) a prophet. ”
NASB	Matthew	21	27	And answering Jesus , they said , “ We do not know. ” He also said to them , “ Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things . Parable of Two Sons
NASB	Matthew	21	28	“ But what do you think ? A man had two [ j ] sons , and he came to the first and said , ‘ [ k ] Son , go work today in the ( AA ) vineyard. ’
NASB	Matthew	21	29	But he replied , ‘ I do not want to. ’ Yet afterward he regretted it and went .
NASB	Matthew	21	30	And the man came to his second son and said the same thing ; and he replied , ‘ I will , sir ’ ; and yet he did not go .
NASB	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two did the will of his father ? ” They * said , “ The first. ” Jesus * said to them , “ Truly I say to you that ( AB ) the tax collectors and prostitutes [ l ] will get into the kingdom of God before you .
NASB	Matthew	21	32	For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him ; but ( AC ) the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him ; and you , seeing this , did not even [ m ] have second thoughts afterward so as to believe him . Parable of the Landowner
NASB	Matthew	21	33	“ Listen to another parable . ( AD ) There was a [ n ] landowner who ( AE ) planted a ( AF ) vineyard and put a [ o ] fence around it , and dug a wine press in it , and built a tower , and he leased it to [ p ] vine-growers and ( AG ) went on a journey .

NASB	Matthew	22	5	But they paid no attention and went their separate ways , one to his own [ d ] farm , another to his business ,
NASB	Matthew	22	6	and the rest seized his slaves and treated them abusively , and then killed them .
NASB	Matthew	22	7	Now the king was angry , and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire .
NASB	Matthew	22	8	Then he * said to his slaves , ‘ The wedding feast is ready , but those who were invited were not worthy .
NASB	Matthew	22	9	So go to ( E ) the main roads , and invite whomever you find there to the wedding feast. ’
NASB	Matthew	22	10	Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all whom they found , both bad and good ; and the wedding hall was filled with [ e ] dinner guests .
NASB	Matthew	22	11	“ But when the king came in to look over the [ f ] dinner guests , he saw ( F ) a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes ,
NASB	Matthew	22	12	and he * said to him , ‘ ( G ) Friend , how did you get in here without wedding clothes ? ’ And the man was speechless .
NASB	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the servants , ‘ Tie his hands and feet , and throw him into ( H ) the outer darkness ; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth in that place. ’
NASB	Matthew	22	14	For many are [ g ] ( I ) called , but few are ( J ) chosen. ” Poll-tax to Caesar
NASB	Matthew	22	15	( K ) Then the Pharisees went and [ h ] plotted together how they might trap Him [ i ] in what He said .
NASB	Matthew	22	16	And they * sent their disciples to Him , along with the ( L ) Herodians , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth , and [ j ] do not care what anyone thinks ; for You [ k ] are not partial to anyone .
NASB	Matthew	22	17	Tell us then , what do You think ? Is it [ l ] permissible to pay a [ m ] ( M ) poll-tax to ( N ) Caesar , or not ? ”
NASB	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus perceived their [ n ] malice , and said , “ Why are you testing Me , you hypocrites ?
NASB	Matthew	22	19	Show Me the ( O ) coin used for the poll-tax. ” And they brought Him a [ o ] denarius .
NASB	Matthew	22	20	And He * said to them , “ Whose image and inscription is this ? ”
NASB	Matthew	22	21	They * said to Him , “ Caesar ’ s. ” Then He * said to them , “ ( P ) Then pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s ; and to God the things that are God ’ s. ”
NASB	Matthew	22	23	( R ) On that day some ( S ) Sadducees ( who say ( T ) there is no resurrection ) came to [ p ] Jesus and questioned Him ,
NASB	Matthew	22	24	saying , “ Teacher , Moses said , ‘ ( U ) If a man dies having no children , his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife , and raise up [ q ] children for his brother. ’
NASB	Matthew	22	25	Now there were seven brothers among us ; and the first married and died , and having no [ r ] children , he left his wife to his brother .
NASB	Matthew	22	26	It was the same also with the second brother , and the third , down to the seventh .
NASB	Matthew	22	27	Last of all , the woman died .
NASB	Matthew	22	28	In the resurrection , therefore , whose wife of the seven will she be ? For they all had her in marriage. ”
NASB	Matthew	22	29	But Jesus answered and said to them , “ You are mistaken , ( V ) since you do not [ s ] understand the Scriptures nor the power of God .
NASB	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither ( W ) marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
NASB	Matthew	22	31	But regarding the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was spoken to you by God :
NASB	Matthew	22	32	‘ ( X ) I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? He is not the God of the dead , but of the living. ”
NASB	Matthew	22	33	When the crowds heard this , ( Y ) they were astonished at His teaching .
NASB	Matthew	22	34	( Z ) But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced ( AA ) the Sadducees , they gathered together .
NASB	Matthew	22	35	And one of them , [ t ] ( AB ) a lawyer , asked Him a question , testing Him :
NASB	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , which is the great commandment in the Law ? ”
NASB	Matthew	22	37	And He said to him , “ ‘ ( AC ) You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind. ’
NASB	Matthew	22	38	This is the great and [ u ] foremost commandment .
NASB	Matthew	22	39	The second is like it , ‘ ( AD ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’
NASB	Matthew	22	40	( AE ) Upon these two commandments [ v ] hang the whole Law and the Prophets. ”
NASB	Matthew	22	41	( AF ) Now while the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them a question :
NASB	Matthew	22	42	“ What do you think about the [ w ] Christ ? Whose son is He ? ” They * said to Him , “ ( AG ) The son of David. ”
NASB	Matthew	22	43	He * said to them , “ Then [ x ] how does David [ y ] ( AH ) in the Spirit call Him ‘ Lord , ’ saying ,
NASB	Matthew	22	44	‘ ( AI ) The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand , Until I put Your enemies under Your feet ” ’ ?
NASB	Matthew	22	45	Therefore , if David calls Him ‘ Lord , ’ [ z ] how is He his son ? ”
NASB	Matthew	22	46	( AJ ) No one was able to offer Him a word in answer , nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him any more questions .

NASB	Matthew	23	17	You fools and blind men ! ( T ) Which is [ m ] more important , the gold or the [ n ] temple that sanctified the gold ?

NASB	Matthew	24	24	For false christs and ( AB ) false prophets will arise and will provide great [ t ] ( AC ) signs and wonders , so as to mislead , if possible , even ( AD ) the [ u ] elect .
NASB	Matthew	24	2	But He responded and said to them , “ Do you not see all these things ? Truly I say to you , ( C ) not one stone here will be left upon another , which will not be torn down. ”
NASB	Matthew	24	3	And as He was sitting on ( D ) the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to Him privately , saying , “ Tell us , when will these things happen , and what will be the sign of ( E ) Your coming , and of the [ b ] end of the age ? ”
NASB	Matthew	24	4	And Jesus answered and said to them , “ ( F ) See to it that no one [ c ] misleads you .
NASB	Matthew	24	5	For ( G ) many will come in My name , saying , ‘ I am the [ d ] Christ , ’ and they will [ e ] mislead many people .
NASB	Matthew	24	6	And you will be hearing of ( H ) wars and rumors of wars . See that you are not alarmed , for those things must take place , but that is not yet the end .
NASB	Matthew	24	7	For ( I ) nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there will be ( J ) famines and earthquakes in various places .
NASB	Matthew	24	8	( K ) But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pains .
NASB	Matthew	24	9	“ ( L ) Then they will hand you over to tribulation and kill you , and ( M ) you will be hated by all nations because of My name .
NASB	Matthew	24	10	And at that time many will [ f ] ( N ) fall away , and they will [ g ] betray one another and hate one another .
NASB	Matthew	24	11	And many ( O ) false prophets will rise up and [ h ] mislead many people .
NASB	Matthew	24	12	And because lawlessness is increased , [ i ] most people ’ s love will become cold .

NASB	Matthew	24	14	This ( Q ) gospel of the kingdom ( R ) shall be preached in the whole [ j ] ( S ) world as a testimony to all the nations , and then the end will come . Perilous Times
NASB	Matthew	24	15	“ Therefore when you see the ( T ) abomination of desolation which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in ( U ) the holy place— [ k ] ( V ) let the [ l ] reader understand—
NASB	Matthew	24	16	then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains .
NASB	Matthew	24	17	[ m ] Whoever is on ( W ) the [ n ] housetop must not go down to get things out of his house .
NASB	Matthew	24	18	And [ o ] whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak .
NASB	Matthew	24	19	But ( X ) woe to those women who are pregnant , and to those who are nursing babies in those days !
NASB	Matthew	24	20	Moreover , pray that [ p ] when you flee , it will not be in the winter , or on a Sabbath .
NASB	Matthew	24	21	For then there will be a ( Y ) great tribulation , such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now , nor ever will again .
NASB	Matthew	24	22	And if those days had not been cut short , no [ q ] life would have been saved ; but for ( Z ) the sake of the [ r ] elect those days will be cut short .
NASB	Matthew	24	23	( AA ) Then if anyone says to you , ‘ Behold , here is the [ s ] Christ , ’ or ‘ He is over here , ’ do not believe him .
NASB	Matthew	24	25	Behold , I have told you in advance .

NASB	Matthew	24	29	“ But immediately after the ( AI ) tribulation of those days ( AJ ) the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light , and ( AK ) the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
NASB	Matthew	24	30	And then ( AL ) the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky , and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and they will see ( AM ) the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory .
NASB	Matthew	24	31	And ( AN ) He will send forth His angels with ( AO ) a great trumpet blast , and they will gather together His [ x ] ( AP ) elect from ( AQ ) the four winds , from one end of the sky to the other . Parable of the Fig Tree
NASB	Matthew	24	32	“ Now learn the parable from the fig tree : as soon as its branch has become tender and sprouts its leaves , you know that summer is near ;
NASB	Matthew	24	33	so you too , when you see all these things , [ y ] recognize that [ z ] He is near , right ( AR ) at the [ aa ] door .
NASB	Matthew	24	34	Truly I say to you , ( AS ) this generation will not pass away until all these things take place .
NASB	Matthew	24	35	( AT ) Heaven and earth will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
NASB	Matthew	24	36	“ But ( AU ) about that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven , nor the Son , but the Father alone .
NASB	Matthew	24	37	For [ ab ] the ( AV ) coming of the Son of Man will be ( AW ) just like the days of Noah .
NASB	Matthew	24	38	For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking , ( AX ) marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that ( AY ) Noah entered the ark ,
NASB	Matthew	24	39	and they did not [ ac ] understand until the flood came and took them all away ; so will the ( AZ ) coming of the Son of Man be .
NASB	Matthew	24	40	At that time there will be two men in the field ; one [ ad ] will be taken and one [ ae ] will be left .
NASB	Matthew	24	41	( BA ) Two women will be grinding at the [ af ] ( BB ) mill ; one [ ag ] will be taken and one [ ah ] will be left . Be Ready for His Coming
NASB	Matthew	24	42	“ Therefore ( BC ) be on the alert , for you do not know which day your Lord is coming .
NASB	Matthew	24	43	But [ ai ] be sure of this , that ( BD ) if the head of the house had known ( BE ) at what time of the night the thief was coming , he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
NASB	Matthew	24	44	For this reason ( BF ) you must be ready as well ; for ( BG ) the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will .
NASB	Matthew	24	45	“ ( BH ) Who then is the ( BI ) faithful and ( BJ ) sensible slave whom his [ aj ] master ( BK ) put in charge of his household slaves , to give them their food at the proper time ?
NASB	Matthew	24	46	Blessed is that slave whom his [ ak ] master finds so doing when he comes .
NASB	Matthew	24	47	Truly I say to you that ( BL ) he will put him in charge of all his possessions .
NASB	Matthew	24	48	But if that evil slave says in his heart , ‘ My [ al ] master [ am ] is not coming for a long time , ’
NASB	Matthew	24	49	and he begins to beat his fellow slaves , and he eats and drinks with those habitually drunk ;
NASB	Matthew	24	50	then the [ an ] master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect , and at an hour that he does not know ,
NASB	Matthew	24	51	and he will [ ao ] cut him in two and assign [ ap ] him a place with the hypocrites ; in that place there will be ( BM ) weeping and gnashing of teeth .

NASB	Matthew	25	25	And I was afraid , so I went away and hid your talent in the ground . See , you still have what is yours. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	2	Five of them were foolish , and five were ( C ) prudent .
NASB	Matthew	25	3	For when the foolish took their lamps , they did not take extra oil with them ;
NASB	Matthew	25	4	but the ( D ) prudent ones took oil in flasks with their lamps .
NASB	Matthew	25	5	Now while the groom was delaying , they all became drowsy and began to sleep .
NASB	Matthew	25	6	But at midnight [ a ] there finally was a shout : ‘ Behold , the groom ! Come out to meet him. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	7	Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps .
NASB	Matthew	25	8	But the foolish virgins said to the prudent ones , ‘ Give us some of your oil , because our lamps are going out. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	9	However , the ( E ) prudent ones answered , ‘ No , there most certainly would not be enough for us and you too ; go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	10	But while they were [ b ] on their way to buy the oil , the groom came , and those who were ( F ) ready went in with him to ( G ) the wedding feast ; and ( H ) the door was shut .
NASB	Matthew	25	11	Yet later , the other virgins also came , saying , ‘ ( I ) Lord , lord , open up for us. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	12	But he answered , ‘ Truly I say to you , I do not know you. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	13	( J ) Be on the alert then , because you do not know the day nor the hour . Parable of the Talents
NASB	Matthew	25	14	“ ( K ) For it is just like a man ( L ) about to go on a journey , who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them .
NASB	Matthew	25	15	To one he gave five [ c ] ( M ) talents , to another , two , and to another , one , each according to his own ability ; and he ( N ) went on his journey .
NASB	Matthew	25	16	The one who had received the five ( O ) talents immediately went and did business with them , and earned five more talents .
NASB	Matthew	25	17	In the same way the one who had received the two talents earned two more .
NASB	Matthew	25	18	But he who received the one talent went away and dug a hole in the ground , and hid his [ d ] master ’ s money .
NASB	Matthew	25	19	“ Now after a long time the master of those slaves * came and * ( P ) settled accounts with them .
NASB	Matthew	25	20	The one who had received the five ( Q ) talents came up and brought five more talents , saying , ‘ Master , you entrusted five talents to me . See , I have earned five more talents. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	21	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and ( R ) faithful slave . You were faithful with a few things , I will ( S ) put you in charge of many things ; enter the joy of your [ e ] master. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	22	“ Also the one who had received the two ( T ) talents came up and said , ‘ Master , you entrusted two talents to me . See , I have earned two more talents. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	23	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and ( U ) faithful slave . You were faithful with a few things , I will put you in charge of many things ; enter the joy of your master. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	24	“ Now the one who had received the one ( V ) talent also came up and said , ‘ Master , I knew you to be a hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not scatter seed .
NASB	Matthew	25	26	“ But his master answered and said to him , ‘ You [ f ] worthless , lazy slave ! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow , and gather where I did not scatter seed ?
NASB	Matthew	25	27	Then you ought to have [ g ] put my money in the bank , and [ h ] on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest .
NASB	Matthew	25	28	Therefore : take the talent away from him , and give it to the one who has the ten talents. ’
NASB	Matthew	25	29	“ ( W ) For to everyone who has , more shall be given , and he will have an abundance ; but from the one who does not have , even what he does have shall be taken away .
NASB	Matthew	25	30	And throw the worthless slave into ( X ) the outer darkness ; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . The Judgment
NASB	Matthew	25	31	“ But when ( Y ) the Son of Man comes in His glory , and all the angels with Him , then ( Z ) He will sit on His glorious throne .
NASB	Matthew	25	32	And all the nations will be ( AA ) gathered before Him ; and He will separate them from one another , ( AB ) just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats ;
NASB	Matthew	25	33	and He will put the sheep ( AC ) on His right , but the goats ( AD ) on the left .
NASB	Matthew	25	34	“ Then the King will say to those on His right , ‘ Come , you who are blessed of My Father , ( AE ) inherit the kingdom prepared for you ( AF ) from the foundation of the world .

NASB	Matthew	25	37	Then the righteous will answer Him , ‘ Lord , when did we see You hungry , and feed You , or thirsty , and give You something to drink ?

NASB	Matthew	26	26	( AF ) Now while they were eating , Jesus took some bread , and [ k ] ( AG ) after a blessing , He broke it and gave it to the disciples , and said , “ Take , eat ; this is My body. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	2	“ ( B ) You know that after two days ( C ) the Passover is coming , and the Son of Man is to be ( D ) handed over for crucifixion. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	3	( E ) At that time the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in ( F ) the courtyard of the high priest named ( G ) Caiaphas ;
NASB	Matthew	26	4	and they ( H ) plotted together to arrest Jesus covertly and kill Him .
NASB	Matthew	26	5	But they were saying , “ Not during the festival , ( I ) otherwise a riot might occur among the people. ” The Precious Ointment
NASB	Matthew	26	6	( J ) Now when Jesus was in ( K ) Bethany , at the home of Simon [ a ] the Leper ,
NASB	Matthew	26	7	( L ) a woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very expensive perfume , and she poured it on His head as He was reclining at the table .
NASB	Matthew	26	8	But the disciples were indignant when they saw this , and said , “ Why this waste ?
NASB	Matthew	26	9	For this perfume could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	10	But Jesus , aware of this , said to them , “ Why are you bothering the woman ? For she has done a good deed for Me .
NASB	Matthew	26	11	For you always have ( M ) the poor with you ; but you do not always have Me .
NASB	Matthew	26	12	For when she poured this perfume on My body , she did it ( N ) to prepare Me for burial .
NASB	Matthew	26	13	Truly I say to you , ( O ) wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her. ” Judas ’ Bargain
NASB	Matthew	26	14	( P ) Then one of the twelve , named ( Q ) Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests
NASB	Matthew	26	15	and said , “ What are you willing to give me [ b ] to [ c ] ( R ) betray Him to you ? ” And ( S ) they set out for him thirty [ d ] pieces of silver .
NASB	Matthew	26	16	And from then on he looked for a good opportunity to [ e ] betray [ f ] Jesus .
NASB	Matthew	26	17	( T ) Now on the first day of [ g ] ( U ) Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and [ h ] asked , “ Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover ? ”
NASB	Matthew	26	18	And He said , “ Go into the city to ( V ) a certain man , and say to him , ‘ The Teacher says , “ ( W ) My time is near ; I am keeping the Passover at your house with My disciples. ” ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	26	19	The disciples did as Jesus had directed them ; and they prepared the Passover . The Last Passover
NASB	Matthew	26	20	( X ) Now when evening came , Jesus was reclining at the table with the [ i ] twelve .
NASB	Matthew	26	21	And as they were eating , He said , “ ( Y ) Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	22	Being deeply grieved , they began saying to Him , each one : “ Surely it is not I , Lord ? ”
NASB	Matthew	26	23	And He answered , “ ( Z ) He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me .
NASB	Matthew	26	24	The Son of Man is going away ( AA ) just as it is written about Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! ( AB ) It would have been good [ j ] for that man if he had not been born. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	25	And ( AC ) Judas , who was betraying Him , said , “ Surely it is not I , ( AD ) Rabbi ? ” Jesus * said to him , “ ( AE ) You have said it yourself. ” The Lord ’ s Supper Instituted
NASB	Matthew	26	27	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks , He gave it to them , saying , “ Drink from it , all of you ;
NASB	Matthew	26	28	for ( AH ) this is My blood of the covenant , which is being poured out for ( AI ) many for forgiveness of sins .
NASB	Matthew	26	29	But I say to you , I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it with you , new , in My Father ’ s kingdom. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	30	( AJ ) And after singing a [ l ] hymn , they went out to ( AK ) the Mount of Olives .
NASB	Matthew	26	31	Then Jesus * said to them , “ You will all [ m ] ( AL ) fall away because of Me this night , for it is written : ‘ ( AM ) I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be ( AN ) scattered. ’
NASB	Matthew	26	32	But after I have been raised , ( AO ) I will go ahead of you to Galilee. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	33	But Peter replied to Him , “ Even if they all [ n ] fall away because of You , I will never fall away ! ”
NASB	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said to him , “ ( AP ) Truly I say to you that ( AQ ) this very night , before a rooster crows , you will deny Me three times. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	35	Peter * said to Him , “ ( AR ) Even if I have to die with You , I will not deny You ! ” All the disciples said the same thing as well . The Garden of Gethsemane
NASB	Matthew	26	36	( AS ) Then Jesus * came with them to a place called [ o ] ( AT ) Gethsemane , and * told His disciples , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	37	And He took ( AU ) Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him , and began to be grieved and distressed .
NASB	Matthew	26	38	Then He * said to them , “ ( AV ) My soul is deeply grieved , to the point of death ; remain here and ( AW ) keep watch with Me. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	39	And He went a little beyond them , and fell on His face and prayed , saying , “ My Father , if it is possible , let ( AX ) this cup pass from Me ; ( AY ) yet not as I will , but as You will. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	40	And He * came to the disciples and * found them sleeping , and He * said to Peter , “ So , you men could not ( AZ ) keep watch with Me for one hour ?
NASB	Matthew	26	41	( BA ) Keep watching and praying , so that you do not come into temptation ; ( BB ) the spirit is [ p ] willing , but the flesh is weak. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	42	He went away again a second time and prayed , saying , “ My Father , if this cup ( BC ) can not pass away unless I drink from it , ( BD ) Your will be done. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	43	Again He came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
NASB	Matthew	26	44	And He left them again , and went away and prayed a third time , saying the same thing once more .
NASB	Matthew	26	45	Then He * came to the disciples and * said to them , “ [ q ] Are you still sleeping and resting ? Behold , ( BE ) the hour [ r ] is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners .
NASB	Matthew	26	46	Get up , let ’ s go ; behold , the one who is betraying Me is near ! ” Jesus ’ Betrayal and Arrest
NASB	Matthew	26	47	( BF ) And while He was still speaking , behold , ( BG ) Judas , one of the twelve , came [ s ] accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs , who came from the chief priests and elders of the people .
NASB	Matthew	26	48	Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign previously , saying , “ Whomever I kiss , He is the one ; arrest Him. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	49	And immediately Judas went up to Jesus and said , “ Greetings , ( BH ) Rabbi ! ” and kissed Him .
NASB	Matthew	26	50	But Jesus said to him , “ ( BI ) Friend , do what you have come for. ” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested Him .
NASB	Matthew	26	51	And behold , ( BJ ) one of those who were with Jesus [ t ] reached and drew his ( BK ) sword , and struck the ( BL ) slave of the high priest and [ u ] cut off his ear .
NASB	Matthew	26	52	Then Jesus * said to him , “ Put your sword back into its place ; for ( BM ) all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword .
NASB	Matthew	26	53	Or do you think that I can not appeal to My Father , and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve [ v ] ( BN ) legions of ( BO ) angels ?
NASB	Matthew	26	54	How then would ( BP ) the Scriptures be fulfilled , which say that it must happen this way ? ”
NASB	Matthew	26	55	At that time Jesus said to the crowds , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would against a man inciting a revolt ? ( BQ ) Every day I used to sit within the temple grounds teaching , and you did not arrest Me .
NASB	Matthew	26	56	But all this has taken place so that ( BR ) the Scriptures of the prophets will be fulfilled. ” Then all the disciples left Him and fled . Jesus before Caiaphas
NASB	Matthew	26	57	( BS ) Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to ( BT ) Caiaphas , the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together .
NASB	Matthew	26	58	But ( BU ) Peter was following Him at a distance , as far as the ( BV ) courtyard of the high priest , and he came inside and sat down with the [ w ] ( BW ) officers to see the outcome .
NASB	Matthew	26	59	Now the chief priests and the entire [ x ] ( BX ) Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus , so that they might put Him to death .
NASB	Matthew	26	60	They did not find any , even though many false witnesses came forward . But later on ( BY ) two came forward ,
NASB	Matthew	26	61	and said , “ This man stated , ‘ ( BZ ) I am able to destroy the [ y ] temple of God and to rebuild it [ z ] in three days. ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	26	62	The high priest stood up and said to Him , “ Do You offer no answer for what these men are testifying against You ? ”
NASB	Matthew	26	63	But ( CA ) Jesus kept silent . ( CB ) And the high priest said to Him , “ I ( CC ) place You under oath by ( CD ) the living God , to tell us whether You are the [ aa ] Christ , ( CE ) the Son of God. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	64	Jesus * said to him , “ ( CF ) You have said it yourself . But I tell you , from now on you will see ( CG ) the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power , and ( CH ) coming on the clouds of heaven. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest ( CI ) tore his [ ab ] robes and said , “ He has blasphemed ! What further need do we have of witnesses ? See , you have now heard the blasphemy ;
NASB	Matthew	26	66	what do you think ? ” They answered , “ ( CJ ) He deserves death ! ”
NASB	Matthew	26	67	( CK ) Then they ( CL ) spit in His face and beat Him with their fists ; and others [ ac ] slapped Him ,
NASB	Matthew	26	68	and said , “ ( CM ) Prophesy to us , You [ ad ] Christ ; who is the one who hit You ? ” Peter ’ s Denials
NASB	Matthew	26	69	( CN ) Now Peter was sitting outside in the ( CO ) courtyard , and a slave woman came to him and said , “ You too were with Jesus the Galilean. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it before them all , saying , “ I do not know what you are talking about. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	71	When he had gone out to the gateway , another slave woman saw him and * said to those who were there , “ This man was with Jesus of Nazareth. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied it , with an oath : “ I do not know the man. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	73	A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter , “ You really are one of them as well , ( CP ) since even the way you talk [ ae ] gives you away. ”
NASB	Matthew	26	74	Then he began to curse and swear , “ I do not know the man ! ” And immediately a rooster crowed .
NASB	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered the statement that Jesus had [ af ] made : “ ( CQ ) Before a rooster crows , you will deny Me three times. ” And he went out and wept bitterly .

NASB	Matthew	27	4	saying , “ I have sinned by betraying innocent blood. ” But they said , “ What is that to us ? ( F ) You shall see to it yourself ! ”
NASB	Matthew	27	5	And he threw the pieces of silver into ( G ) the temple sanctuary and left ; and ( H ) he went away and hanged himself .
NASB	Matthew	27	6	The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said , “ It is not lawful to put them in the temple treasury , since it is money paid for blood. ”
NASB	Matthew	27	7	And they conferred together and [ b ] with the money bought the Potter ’ s Field as a burial place for strangers .
NASB	Matthew	27	8	( I ) For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day .
NASB	Matthew	27	9	Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled : “ ( J ) And [ c ] they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of the One whose price had been set by the sons of Israel ;
NASB	Matthew	27	10	( K ) and [ d ] they gave them for the Potter ’ s Field , just as the Lord directed me. ” Jesus before Pilate
NASB	Matthew	27	11	( L ) Now Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor questioned Him , saying , “ So You are the ( M ) King of the Jews ? ” And Jesus said to him , “ ( N ) It is as you say. ”
NASB	Matthew	27	12	And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders , ( O ) He did not offer any answer .
NASB	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate * said to Him , “ Do You not hear how many things they are testifying against You ? ”
NASB	Matthew	27	14	And still ( P ) He did not answer him in regard to even a single [ e ] charge , so the governor was greatly amazed .
NASB	Matthew	27	15	( Q ) Now at the Passover Feast the governor was accustomed to release for the [ f ] people any one prisoner whom they wanted .
NASB	Matthew	27	16	And at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called Barabbas .
NASB	Matthew	27	17	So when the people gathered together , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you want me to release for you : Barabbas , or Jesus ( R ) who is called Christ ? ”
NASB	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that it was because of envy that [ g ] they had handed Him over .
NASB	Matthew	27	19	And ( S ) while he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent him a message , saying , “ See that you have nothing to do with that ( T ) righteous Man ; for [ h ] last night I suffered greatly ( U ) in a dream because of Him. ”
NASB	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ( V ) ask for Barabbas , and to put Jesus to death .
NASB	Matthew	27	21	And the governor [ i ] said to them , “ Which of the two do you want me to release for you ? ” And they said , “ Barabbas. ”
NASB	Matthew	27	22	Pilate * said to them , “ Then what shall I do with Jesus ( W ) who is called Christ ? ” They all * said , “ [ j ] Crucify Him ! ”
NASB	Matthew	27	23	But he said , “ Why , what evil has He done ? ” Yet they kept shouting all the more , saying , “ [ k ] Crucify Him ! ”
NASB	Matthew	27	24	Now when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing , but rather that ( X ) a riot was starting , he took water and ( Y ) washed his hands in front of the crowd , saying , “ I am innocent of ( Z ) this Man ’ s blood ; ( AA ) you yourselves shall see. ”
NASB	Matthew	27	25	And all the people replied , “ ( AB ) His blood shall be on us and on our children ! ”
NASB	Matthew	27	26	Then he released Barabbas [ l ] for them ; but after having Jesus ( AC ) flogged , he handed Him over to be crucified . Jesus Is Mocked
NASB	Matthew	27	28	And they stripped Him and ( AG ) put a red [ o ] cloak on Him .
NASB	Matthew	27	29	( AH ) And after twisting together a crown of thorns , they put it on His head , and put a [ p ] reed in His right hand ; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him , saying , “ ( AI ) Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
NASB	Matthew	27	30	And ( AJ ) they spit on Him , and took the reed and beat Him on the head .
NASB	Matthew	27	31	( AK ) And after they had mocked Him , they took the cloak off Him and put His own garments back on Him , and led Him away to crucify Him .
NASB	Matthew	27	32	( AL ) As they were coming out , they found a man of ( AM ) Cyrene named Simon , [ q ] whom they compelled to carry His [ r ] cross . The Crucifixion
NASB	Matthew	27	33	( AN ) And when they came to a place called ( AO ) Golgotha , which means Place of a Skull ,
NASB	Matthew	27	34	( AP ) they gave Him ( AQ ) wine mixed with [ s ] bile to drink ; and after tasting it , He was unwilling to drink it .
NASB	Matthew	27	35	And when they had crucified Him , ( AR ) they divided His garments among themselves by casting [ t ] lots .
NASB	Matthew	27	36	And sitting down , they began to ( AS ) keep watch over Him there .
NASB	Matthew	27	37	And above His head they put up the charge against Him [ u ] which read , “ ( AT ) THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. ”
NASB	Matthew	27	38	At that time two [ v ] rebels * were being crucified with Him , one on the right and one on the left .
NASB	Matthew	27	39	And those passing by were [ w ] speaking abusively to Him , ( AU ) shaking their heads ,
NASB	Matthew	27	40	and saying , “ ( AV ) You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , save Yourself ! ( AW ) If You are the Son of God , come down from the cross. ”
NASB	Matthew	27	41	In the same way the chief priests also , along with the scribes and elders , were mocking Him and saying ,
NASB	Matthew	27	42	“ ( AX ) He saved others ; [ x ] He can not save Himself ! ( AY ) He is the King of Israel ; let Him now come down from the cross , and we will believe in Him .
NASB	Matthew	27	43	( AZ ) He has trusted in God ; let God rescue Him now , if He [ y ] takes pleasure in Him ; for He said , ‘ I am the Son of God. ’ ”
NASB	Matthew	27	44	( BA ) And the [ z ] rebels who had been crucified with Him were also insulting Him in the same way .
NASB	Matthew	27	45	( BB ) Now from the [ aa ] sixth hour darkness [ ab ] fell upon all the land until the [ ac ] ninth hour .
NASB	Matthew	27	46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ ( BC ) Eli , Eli , lema sabaktanei ? ” that is , “ My God , My God , why have You forsaken Me ? ”
NASB	Matthew	27	47	And some of those who were standing there , when they heard it , said , “ This man is calling for Elijah. ”
NASB	Matthew	27	48	And ( BD ) immediately one of them ran , and taking a sponge , he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed , and gave Him a drink .
NASB	Matthew	27	49	But the rest of them said , “ [ ad ] Let us see if Elijah comes to save Him [ ae ] . ”
NASB	Matthew	27	50	And Jesus ( BE ) cried out again with a loud voice , and gave up His spirit .
NASB	Matthew	27	51	( BF ) And behold , ( BG ) the [ af ] veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom ; and ( BH ) the earth shook and the rocks were split .
NASB	Matthew	27	52	Also the tombs were opened , and many bodies of the [ ag ] saints who had ( BI ) fallen asleep were raised ;
NASB	Matthew	27	53	and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection , they entered ( BJ ) the holy city and appeared to many .
NASB	Matthew	27	54	( BK ) Now as for the centurion and those who were with him ( BL ) keeping guard over Jesus , when they saw ( BM ) the earthquake and the other things that were happening , they became extremely frightened and said , “ Truly this was [ ah ] ( BN ) the Son of God ! ”
NASB	Matthew	27	55	( BO ) And many women were there watching from a distance , who had followed Jesus from Galilee while ( BP ) caring for Him .
NASB	Matthew	27	56	Among them were ( BQ ) Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and ( BR ) the mother of the sons of Zebedee . Jesus Is Buried
NASB	Matthew	27	57	( BS ) Now when it was evening , a rich man from Arimathea came , named Joseph , who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus .
NASB	Matthew	27	58	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him .
NASB	Matthew	27	59	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
NASB	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had cut out in the rock ; and he rolled ( BT ) a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away .
NASB	Matthew	27	61	And ( BU ) Mary Magdalene was there , and the other Mary , sitting opposite the tomb .
NASB	Matthew	27	62	Now on the next day , that is , the day which is after ( BV ) the preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate ,
NASB	Matthew	27	63	and they said , “ Sir , we remember that when that deceiver was still alive , He said , ‘ ( BW ) After three days I am rising. ’
NASB	Matthew	27	64	Therefore , give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day ; otherwise , His disciples may come and steal Him , and say to the people , ‘ He has risen from the dead , ’ and the last deception will be worse than the first. ”

NASB	Matthew	28	28	( A ) Now after the Sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , ( B ) Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb .
NASB	Matthew	28	2	And behold , a severe earthquake had occurred , for ( C ) an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away ( D ) the stone , and sat upon it .
NASB	Matthew	28	3	And ( E ) his appearance was like lightning , and his clothing as white as snow .
NASB	Matthew	28	4	The guards shook from fear of him and became like dead men .
NASB	Matthew	28	5	And the angel said to the women , “ [ a ] ( F ) Do not be afraid ; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified .
NASB	Matthew	28	6	He is not here , for He has risen , ( G ) just as He said . Come , see the place where He was lying .
NASB	Matthew	28	7	And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead ; and behold , He is going ahead of you ( H ) to Galilee . There you will see Him ; behold , I have told you. ”
NASB	Matthew	28	8	And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy , and ran to report to His disciples .
NASB	Matthew	28	9	And behold , Jesus met them [ b ] and said , “ [ c ] Rejoice ! ” And they came up and took hold of His feet , and worshiped Him .
NASB	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus * said to them , “ [ d ] ( I ) Do not be afraid ; go , bring word to ( J ) My brothers to leave ( K ) for Galilee , and there they will see Me. ”
NASB	Matthew	28	11	Now while they were on their way , some of ( L ) the men from the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened .
NASB	Matthew	28	12	And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together , they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers ,
NASB	Matthew	28	13	and said , “ You are to say , ‘ His disciples came at night and stole Him while we were asleep. ’
NASB	Matthew	28	14	And if this comes to ( M ) the governor ’ s ears , we will appease him and [ e ] keep you out of trouble. ”
NASB	Matthew	28	15	And they took the money and did as they had been instructed ; and this story was widely ( N ) spread among the Jews and is ( O ) to this day . The Great Commission
NASB	Matthew	28	16	But the eleven disciples proceeded ( P ) to Galilee , to the mountain which Jesus had designated to them .

NASB	Mark	1	1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , ( A ) the Son of God ,
NASB	Mark	1	2	( B ) just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet : “ ( C ) Behold , I am sending My messenger [ a ] before You , Who will prepare Your way ;
NASB	Mark	1	3	( D ) The voice of one calling [ b ] out in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way of the Lord , Make His paths straight ! ’ ”
NASB	Mark	1	4	John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness , [ c ] ( E ) preaching a baptism of repentance for the ( F ) forgiveness of sins .
NASB	Mark	1	5	And all the country of Judea was going out to him , and all the people of Jerusalem ; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River , confessing their sins .
NASB	Mark	1	6	John was clothed with camel ’ s hair and wore ( G ) a leather belt around his waist , and [ d ] his diet was locusts and wild honey .
NASB	Mark	1	7	And he was [ e ] preaching , saying , “ After me One is coming who is mightier than I , and I am not fit to bend down and untie the straps of His sandals .
NASB	Mark	1	8	I baptized you [ f ] with water ; but He will baptize you [ g ] with the Holy Spirit. ” The Baptism of Jesus
NASB	Mark	1	9	( H ) In those days Jesus ( I ) came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
NASB	Mark	1	10	And immediately coming up out of the water , He saw the heavens [ h ] opening , and the Spirit , like a dove , descending upon Him ;
NASB	Mark	1	11	and a voice came from the heavens : “ ( J ) You are My beloved Son ; in You I [ i ] am well pleased. ”
NASB	Mark	1	12	( K ) And immediately the Spirit * brought Him out into the wilderness .

NASB	Mark	1	14	( M ) Now after John was [ j ] taken into custody , Jesus came into Galilee , [ k ] ( N ) preaching the gospel of God ,
NASB	Mark	1	15	and saying , “ ( O ) The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God [ l ] is at hand ; ( P ) repent and [ m ] believe in the gospel. ”
NASB	Mark	1	16	( Q ) As He was going along the Sea of Galilee , He saw Simon and Andrew , the brother of Simon , casting a net in the sea ; for they were fishermen .
NASB	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said to them , “ Follow Me , and I will have you become fishers of people. ”
NASB	Mark	1	18	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him .
NASB	Mark	1	19	And going on a little farther , He saw [ n ] James the son of Zebedee , and his brother John , [ o ] who were also in the boat mending the nets .
NASB	Mark	1	20	Immediately He called them ; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men , and went away [ p ] to follow Him .
NASB	Mark	1	21	( R ) They * went into Capernaum ; and immediately on the Sabbath Jesus ( S ) entered the synagogue and began to teach .
NASB	Mark	1	22	And ( T ) they were amazed at His teaching ; for He was teaching them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .
NASB	Mark	1	23	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
NASB	Mark	1	24	saying , “ ( U ) What [ q ] business do you have with us , Jesus [ r ] of ( V ) Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are : ( W ) the Holy One of God ! ”
NASB	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be quiet , and come out of him ! ”
NASB	Mark	1	26	After throwing him into convulsions and crying out with a loud voice , the unclean spirit came out of him .
NASB	Mark	1	27	And they were all ( X ) amazed , so they debated among themselves , saying , “ What is this ? A new teaching with authority ! He commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey Him. ”
NASB	Mark	1	28	Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding region of Galilee . Crowds Healed
NASB	Mark	1	29	( Y ) And immediately after they left ( Z ) the synagogue , they entered the house of Simon and Andrew , with [ s ] James and John .
NASB	Mark	1	30	Now Simon ’ s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever ; and they immediately * spoke to [ t ] Jesus about her .
NASB	Mark	1	31	And He came to her and raised her up , taking her by the hand , and the fever left her , and she served them .
NASB	Mark	1	32	Now ( AA ) when evening came , ( AB ) after the sun had set , they began bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were ( AC ) demon-possessed .
NASB	Mark	1	33	And the whole ( AD ) city had gathered at the door .
NASB	Mark	1	34	And He ( AE ) healed many who were ill with various diseases , and cast out many demons ; and He would not permit the demons to speak , because they knew [ u ] who He was .
NASB	Mark	1	35	( AF ) And in the early morning , while it was still dark , Jesus got up , left the house , and went away to a secluded place , and ( AG ) prayed there for a time .
NASB	Mark	1	36	Simon and his companions eagerly searched for Him ;
NASB	Mark	1	37	and they found Him and * said to Him , “ Everyone is looking for You. ”
NASB	Mark	1	38	He * said to them , “ Let ’ s go somewhere else to the towns nearby , so that I may also [ v ] preach there ; for this is why I came. ”
NASB	Mark	1	39	( AH ) And He went into their synagogues [ w ] preaching throughout Galilee , and casting out the demons .
NASB	Mark	1	40	( AI ) And a man with [ x ] leprosy * came to [ y ] Jesus , imploring Him and ( AJ ) kneeling down , and saying to Him , “ If You are willing , You can make me clean. ”
NASB	Mark	1	41	Moved with compassion , Jesus reached out with His hand and touched him , and * said to him , “ I am willing ; be cleansed. ”
NASB	Mark	1	42	And immediately the leprosy left him , and he was cleansed .
NASB	Mark	1	43	And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away ,
NASB	Mark	1	44	and He * said to him , “ ( AK ) See that you say nothing to anyone ; but ( AL ) go , show yourself to the priest and ( AM ) offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded , as a testimony to them. ”
NASB	Mark	1	45	But he went out and began to ( AN ) proclaim it [ z ] freely and to ( AO ) spread the news around , to such an extent that [ aa ] Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city , but [ ab ] stayed out in unpopulated areas ; and ( AP ) they were coming to Him from everywhere .

NASB	Mark	2	2	And ( A ) many were gathered together , so that there was no longer space , not even near the door ; and He was speaking the word to them .
NASB	Mark	2	3	( B ) And some people * came , bringing to Him a man who was ( C ) paralyzed , carried by four men .
NASB	Mark	2	4	And when they were unable to [ a ] get to Him because of the crowd , they ( D ) removed the roof [ b ] above Him ; and after digging an opening , they let down the pallet on which the ( E ) paralyzed man was lying .
NASB	Mark	2	5	And Jesus , seeing their faith , * said to the paralyzed man , “ Son , ( F ) your sins are forgiven. ”
NASB	Mark	2	6	But some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking it over in their hearts ,
NASB	Mark	2	7	“ Why does this man speak that way ? He is blaspheming ! ( G ) Who can forgive sins except God alone ? ”
NASB	Mark	2	8	Immediately Jesus , aware [ c ] in His spirit that they were thinking that way within themselves , * said to them , “ Why are you thinking about these things in your hearts ?
NASB	Mark	2	9	Which is easier , to say to the ( H ) paralyzed man , ‘ Your sins are forgiven ’ ; or to say , ‘ Get up , and pick up your pallet and walk ’ ?
NASB	Mark	2	10	But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —He * said to the paralyzed man ,
NASB	Mark	2	11	“ I say to you , get up , pick up your pallet , and go home. ”
NASB	Mark	2	12	And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone , so that they were all amazed and ( I ) were glorifying God , saying , “ ( J ) We have never seen anything like this ! ”
NASB	Mark	2	13	And He went out again by the seashore ; and ( K ) all the [ d ] people were coming to Him , and He was teaching them . Levi ( Matthew ) Called
NASB	Mark	2	14	( L ) As He passed by , He saw [ e ] ( M ) Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax office , and He * said to him , “ ( N ) Follow Me ! ” And he got up and followed Him .
NASB	Mark	2	15	And it * happened that He was reclining at the table in his house , and many tax collectors and [ f ] sinners were [ g ] dining with Jesus and His disciples ; for there were many of them , and they were following Him .
NASB	Mark	2	16	When ( O ) the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with the [ h ] sinners and tax collectors , they said to His disciples , “ ( P ) Why is He eating with tax collectors and [ i ] sinners ? ”
NASB	Mark	2	17	And hearing this , Jesus * said to them , “ ( Q ) It is not those who are healthy who need a physician , but those who are sick ; I did not come to call the righteous , but sinners. ”
NASB	Mark	2	18	( R ) John ’ s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting ; and they * came and * said to Him , “ Why do John ’ s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but Your disciples do not fast ? ”
NASB	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said to them , “ While the groom is with them , [ j ] the attendants of the groom can not fast , can they ? As long as they have the groom with them , they can not fast .
NASB	Mark	2	20	But the ( S ) days will come when the groom is taken away from them , and then they will fast , on that day .
NASB	Mark	2	21	“ No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment ; otherwise , [ k ] the patch pulls away from it , the new from the old , and a worse tear results .
NASB	Mark	2	22	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins ; otherwise the wine will burst the skins , and the wine is lost and the skins as well ; but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins. ” Question of the Sabbath
NASB	Mark	2	23	( T ) And it happened that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath , and His disciples began to make their way along while ( U ) picking the heads of grain .
NASB	Mark	2	24	The Pharisees were saying to Him , “ Look , ( V ) why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath ? ”
NASB	Mark	2	25	And He * said to them , “ Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions became hungry ;
NASB	Mark	2	26	how he entered the house of God in the [ l ] time of ( W ) Abiathar the high priest , and ate the [ m ] consecrated bread , which ( X ) is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests , and he also gave it to those who were with him ? ”
NASB	Mark	2	27	Jesus said to them , “ ( Y ) The Sabbath [ n ] was made [ o ] for man , and ( Z ) not man [ p ] for the Sabbath .

NASB	Mark	3	13	And He * went up on ( Q ) the mountain and * ( R ) summoned those whom He Himself wanted , and they came to Him .

NASB	Mark	3	16	And He appointed the twelve : ( S ) Simon ( to whom He gave the name Peter ) ,
NASB	Mark	3	17	[ f ] James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of [ g ] James ( to them He gave the name Boanerges , which means , “ Sons of Thunder ” ) ;

NASB	Mark	4	5	Other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil ; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil .

NASB	Mark	4	9	And He was saying , “ ( E ) He who has ears to hear , [ a ] let him hear. ”
NASB	Mark	4	10	As soon as He was alone , [ b ] His followers , along with the twelve disciples , began asking Him about the parables .

NASB	Mark	4	15	These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown ; and when they hear , immediately ( J ) Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
NASB	Mark	4	16	And in a similar way these are the ones sown with seed on the rocky places , who , when they hear the word , immediately receive it with joy ;
NASB	Mark	4	17	and yet they have no firm root in themselves , but are only temporary ; then , when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word , immediately they [ c ] fall away .
NASB	Mark	4	18	And others are the ones sown with seed among the thorns ; these are the ones who have heard the word ,
NASB	Mark	4	19	but the worries of ( K ) the [ d ] world , and the ( L ) deceitfulness of wealth , and the desires for other things enter and choke the word , and it [ e ] becomes unfruitful .
NASB	Mark	4	20	And those are the ones sown with seed on the good soil ; and they hear the word and accept it and ( M ) bear fruit , thirty , sixty , and a hundred times as much. ”
NASB	Mark	4	21	And He was saying to them , “ ( N ) A lamp is not brought to be put under a [ f ] basket , or under a bed , is it ? Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand ?
NASB	Mark	4	22	( O ) For nothing is hidden , except to be revealed ; nor has anything been secret , but that it would come to light .

NASB	Mark	4	24	And He was saying to them , “ Take care what you listen to . [ h ] ( Q ) By your standard of measure it will be measured to you ; and more will be given you besides .
NASB	Mark	4	25	( R ) For whoever has , to him more will be given ; and whoever does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him. ” Parable of the Seed
NASB	Mark	4	26	And He was saying , “ The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil ;
NASB	Mark	4	27	and he goes to bed at night and gets up daily , and the seed sprouts and grows—how , he himself does not know .
NASB	Mark	4	28	The soil produces crops by itself ; first the stalk , then the head , then the mature grain in the head .
NASB	Mark	4	29	Now when the crop permits , he immediately [ i ] ( S ) puts in the sickle , because the harvest has come. ” Parable of the Mustard Seed
NASB	Mark	4	30	( T ) And He was saying , “ How shall we [ j ] ( U ) picture the kingdom of God , or by what parable shall we present it ?
NASB	Mark	4	31	It is like a mustard seed , which , when sown upon the soil , though it is the smallest of all the seeds that are upon the soil ,
NASB	Mark	4	32	yet when it is sown , it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants , and forms large branches , with the result that ( V ) the birds of the sky can nest under its shade. ”
NASB	Mark	4	33	And with many such parables He was speaking the word to them , so far as they were able to [ k ] understand it ;
NASB	Mark	4	34	and He did not speak to them ( W ) without a parable ; but He was ( X ) explaining everything privately to His own disciples . Jesus Stills the Sea
NASB	Mark	4	35	( Y ) On that day , when evening came , He * said to them , “ Let ’ s go over to the other side. ”
NASB	Mark	4	36	After dismissing the crowd , they * took Him along with them ( Z ) in the boat , just as He was ; and other boats were with Him .
NASB	Mark	4	37	And a fierce gale of wind * developed , and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling with water .
NASB	Mark	4	38	And yet Jesus Himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion ; and they * woke Him and * said to Him , “ Teacher , do You not care that we are perishing ? ”
NASB	Mark	4	39	And He got up and ( AA ) rebuked the wind and said to the sea , “ Hush , be still. ” And the wind died down and [ l ] it became perfectly calm .
NASB	Mark	4	40	And He said to them , “ Why are you [ m ] afraid ? ( AB ) Do you still have no faith ? ”
NASB	Mark	4	41	They became very much afraid and said to one another , “ Who , then , is this , that even the wind and the sea obey Him ? ” Footnotes - Mark 4:9 Or hear ! or listen ! - Mark 4:10 Lit those about Him - Mark 4:17 I.e. , from the faith - Mark 4:19 Or age - Mark 4:19 Or proves to be unfruitful - Mark 4:21 Lit peck-measure - Mark 4:23 Or hear ! or listen ! - Mark 4:24 Lit By what measure you measure - Mark 4:29 Lit sends forth - Mark 4:30 Lit compare - Mark 4:33 Lit hear - Mark 4:39 Lit a great calm occurred - Mark 4:40 Lit cowardly New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Mark	5	5	Constantly , night and day , he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains , and cutting himself with stones .
NASB	Mark	5	2	When He got out of ( B ) the boat , immediately a man from the tombs ( C ) with an unclean spirit met Him .
NASB	Mark	5	3	He lived among the tombs ; and no one was able to bind him anymore , not even with a chain ,
NASB	Mark	5	4	because he had often been bound with shackles and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces ; and no one was strong enough to subdue him .
NASB	Mark	5	6	Seeing Jesus from a distance , he ran up and bowed down before Him ;
NASB	Mark	5	7	and shouting with a loud voice , he * said , “ [ a ] ( D ) What business do You have with me , Jesus , ( E ) Son of ( F ) the Most High God ? I implore You by God , do not torment me ! ”
NASB	Mark	5	8	For He had already been saying to him , “ Come out of the man , you unclean spirit ! ”
NASB	Mark	5	9	And He was asking him , “ What is your name ? ” And he * said to Him , “ My name is ( G ) Legion , for we are many. ”
NASB	Mark	5	10	And he begged Him earnestly not to send them out of the region .
NASB	Mark	5	11	Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding [ b ] nearby on the mountain .
NASB	Mark	5	12	And the demons begged Him , saying , “ Send us into the pigs so that we may enter them. ”
NASB	Mark	5	13	Jesus gave them permission . And coming out , the unclean spirits entered the pigs ; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea , about two thousand of them ; and they were drowned in the sea .
NASB	Mark	5	14	Their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and in the countryside . And the people came to see what it was that had happened .
NASB	Mark	5	15	And then they * came to Jesus and * saw the man who had been ( H ) demon-possessed sitting down , ( I ) clothed and ( J ) in his right mind , the very man who had previously had the “ ( K ) legion ” ; and they became frightened .
NASB	Mark	5	16	Those who had seen it described to them how it had happened to the ( L ) demon-possessed man , and all about the pigs .
NASB	Mark	5	17	And they began to ( M ) beg Him to leave their region .
NASB	Mark	5	18	( N ) And as He was getting into the boat , the man who had been ( O ) demon-possessed was begging Him that he might [ c ] accompany Him .
NASB	Mark	5	19	And He did not let him , but He * said to him , “ ( P ) Go home to your people and report to them [ d ] what great things the Lord has done for you , and how He had mercy on you. ”
NASB	Mark	5	20	And he went away and began to ( Q ) proclaim in ( R ) Decapolis [ e ] what great things Jesus had done for him ; and everyone was amazed . Miracles and Healing
NASB	Mark	5	21	( S ) When Jesus had crossed over again in ( T ) the boat to the other side , a large crowd gathered around Him ; and He [ f ] stayed ( U ) by the seashore .
NASB	Mark	5	22	( V ) And one of ( W ) the synagogue [ g ] officials , named Jairus , * came , and upon seeing Him , * fell at His feet
NASB	Mark	5	23	and * pleaded with Him earnestly , saying , “ My little daughter is at the point of death ; please come and ( X ) lay Your hands on her , so that she will [ h ] get well and live. ”
NASB	Mark	5	24	And He went off with him ; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him .
NASB	Mark	5	25	A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years ,
NASB	Mark	5	26	and had endured much at the hands of many physicians , and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all , but instead had become worse—
NASB	Mark	5	27	after hearing about Jesus , she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His [ i ] cloak .
NASB	Mark	5	28	For she had been saying to herself , “ If I just touch His garments , I will [ j ] get well. ”
NASB	Mark	5	29	And immediately the flow of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her ( Y ) disease .
NASB	Mark	5	30	And immediately Jesus , perceiving in Himself that ( Z ) power from Him had gone out , turned around in the crowd and said , “ Who touched My garments ? ”
NASB	Mark	5	31	And His disciples said to Him , “ You see the crowd pressing in on You , and You say , ‘ Who touched Me ? ’ ”
NASB	Mark	5	32	And He looked around to see the woman who had done this .
NASB	Mark	5	33	But the woman , fearing and trembling , aware of what had happened to her , came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth .
NASB	Mark	5	34	And He said to her , “ Daughter , ( AA ) your faith has [ k ] made you well ; ( AB ) go in peace and be cured of your ( AC ) disease. ”
NASB	Mark	5	35	While He was still speaking , people * came from the house of the ( AD ) synagogue official , saying , “ Your daughter has died ; why bother the Teacher further ? ”
NASB	Mark	5	36	But Jesus , overhearing what was being spoken , * said to the ( AE ) synagogue official , “ ( AF ) Do not be afraid , only [ l ] believe. ”
NASB	Mark	5	37	And He allowed no one to accompany Him except ( AG ) Peter , [ m ] James , and John the brother of [ n ] James .
NASB	Mark	5	38	They * came to the house of the ( AH ) synagogue official , and He * saw a commotion , and people loudly weeping and wailing .
NASB	Mark	5	39	And after entering , He * said to them , “ Why are you making a commotion and weeping ? The child has not died , but is asleep. ”
NASB	Mark	5	40	And they began laughing at Him . But putting them all outside , He * took along the child ’ s father and mother and His own companions , and * entered the room where the child was in bed .
NASB	Mark	5	41	And taking the child by the hand , He * said to her , “ Talitha , kum ! ” ( which translated means , “ Little girl , ( AI ) I say to you , get up ! ” ) .
NASB	Mark	5	42	And immediately the girl got up and began to walk , for she was twelve years old . And immediately they were completely astonished .
NASB	Mark	5	43	And He ( AJ ) gave them strict orders that no one was to know about this , and He told them to have something given her to eat .

NASB	Mark	6	6	And He was amazed at their unbelief . ( L ) And He was going around the villages , teaching . The Twelve Sent Out
NASB	Mark	6	2	And when the Sabbath came , He began ( C ) to teach in the synagogue ; and [ b ] the ( D ) many listeners were astonished , saying , “ Where did this man learn these things , and what is this wisdom that has been given to Him , and such [ c ] miracles as these performed by His hands ?
NASB	Mark	6	3	Is this not ( E ) the carpenter , ( F ) the son of Mary and brother of [ d ] James , Joses , Judas , and Simon ? And are ( G ) His sisters not here with us ? ” And they took ( H ) offense at Him .
NASB	Mark	6	4	Jesus said to them , “ ( I ) A prophet is not dishonored except in [ e ] ( J ) his hometown and among his own relatives , and in his own household. ”
NASB	Mark	6	5	And He could not do any [ f ] miracle there except that He ( K ) laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them .
NASB	Mark	6	7	( M ) And ( N ) He * summoned the twelve and began to send them out ( O ) in pairs , and gave them authority over the unclean spirits ;
NASB	Mark	6	8	( P ) and He instructed them that they were to take nothing for their journey , except a mere staff—no bread , no [ g ] bag , no money in their belt—
NASB	Mark	6	9	but [ h ] to wear sandals ; and He added , “ Do not wear two [ i ] tunics. ”
NASB	Mark	6	10	And He said to them , “ Wherever you enter a house , stay there until you [ j ] leave town .
NASB	Mark	6	11	Any place that does not receive you or listen to you , as you go out from there , ( Q ) shake the dust [ k ] off the soles of your feet as a testimony against them. ”
NASB	Mark	6	12	( R ) And they went out and [ l ] preached that people are to repent .
NASB	Mark	6	13	And they were casting out many demons and ( S ) were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them . John ’ s Fate Recalled
NASB	Mark	6	14	( T ) And King Herod heard about it , for His name had become well known ; and people were saying , “ ( U ) John the Baptist has risen from the dead , and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him. ”
NASB	Mark	6	15	But others were saying , “ He is ( V ) Elijah. ” And others were saying , “ He is ( W ) a prophet , like one of the prophets of old. ”
NASB	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard about it , he kept saying , “ John , whom I beheaded , has risen ! ”
NASB	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent men and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of ( X ) Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip , because he had married her .
NASB	Mark	6	18	For John had been saying to Herod , “ ( Y ) It is not lawful for you to have your brother ’ s wife. ”
NASB	Mark	6	19	And ( Z ) Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death , and could not do so ;
NASB	Mark	6	20	for ( AA ) Herod was afraid of John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and he had been protecting him . And when he heard him , he was very perplexed ; and yet he [ m ] used to enjoy listening to him .
NASB	Mark	6	21	An opportune day came when Herod , on his birthday , ( AB ) held a banquet for his nobles and military commanders , and the leading people ( AC ) of Galilee ;
NASB	Mark	6	22	and when the daughter of ( AD ) Herodias herself came in and danced , she pleased Herod and [ n ] his dinner guests ; and the king said to the girl , “ Ask me for whatever you want , and I will give it to you. ”
NASB	Mark	6	23	And he swore to her , “ Whatever you ask of me , I will give it to you , up to ( AE ) half of my kingdom. ”
NASB	Mark	6	24	And she went out and said to her mother , “ What shall I ask for ? ” And she said , “ The head of John the Baptist. ”
NASB	Mark	6	25	Immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked , saying , “ I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter. ”
NASB	Mark	6	26	And although the king was very sorry , because of his oaths and [ o ] his dinner guests , he was unwilling to refuse her .
NASB	Mark	6	27	Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded him to bring back his head . And he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
NASB	Mark	6	28	and brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the girl ; and the girl gave it to her mother .
NASB	Mark	6	29	When his disciples heard about this , they came and carried away his body , and laid it in a tomb .
NASB	Mark	6	30	( AF ) The ( AG ) apostles * gathered together with Jesus ; and they reported to Him all that they had done and taught .
NASB	Mark	6	31	And He * said to them , “ Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a little while. ” ( For there were many people coming and going , and ( AH ) they did not even have time to eat . )
NASB	Mark	6	32	( AI ) And they went away in ( AJ ) the boat to a secluded place by themselves . Five Thousand Men Fed
NASB	Mark	6	33	The people saw them going , and many recognized them and ran there together on foot from all the cities , and got there ahead of them .
NASB	Mark	6	34	When Jesus went [ p ] ashore , He ( AK ) saw a large crowd , and He felt compassion for them because ( AL ) they were like sheep without a shepherd ; and He began to teach them many things .
NASB	Mark	6	35	And when it was already late , His disciples came up to Him and said , “ [ q ] This place is secluded and it is already late ;
NASB	Mark	6	36	send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves [ r ] something to eat. ”
NASB	Mark	6	37	But He answered them , “ You give them something to eat ! ” ( AM ) And they * said to Him , “ Shall we go and spend two hundred [ s ] ( AN ) denarii on bread , and give it to them to eat ? ”
NASB	Mark	6	38	But He * said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go look ! ” And when they found out , they * said , “ Five , and two fish. ”
NASB	Mark	6	39	And He ordered them all to recline by groups on the green grass .
NASB	Mark	6	40	They reclined in groups of hundreds and fifties .
NASB	Mark	6	41	And He took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up toward heaven , He ( AO ) blessed the food and broke the loaves and He gave them to the disciples again and again to set before them ; and He divided the two fish among them all .
NASB	Mark	6	42	And they all ate and were satisfied ;
NASB	Mark	6	43	and they picked up twelve full ( AP ) baskets of the broken pieces of bread , and of the fish .
NASB	Mark	6	44	There were ( AQ ) five thousand [ t ] men who ate the loaves . Jesus Walks on the Water
NASB	Mark	6	45	( AR ) And immediately Jesus had His disciples get into ( AS ) the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side , to ( AT ) Bethsaida , while He Himself * dismissed the crowd .
NASB	Mark	6	46	And after ( AU ) saying goodbye to them , He left ( AV ) for the mountain to pray .
NASB	Mark	6	47	When it was evening , the boat was in the middle of the sea , and He was alone on the land .
NASB	Mark	6	48	Seeing them [ u ] straining at the oars—for the wind was against them—at about the [ v ] ( AW ) fourth watch of the night , He * came to them , walking on the sea ; and He intended to pass by them .
NASB	Mark	6	49	But when they saw Him walking on the sea , they thought that it was a ghost , and they cried out ;
NASB	Mark	6	50	for they all saw Him and were [ w ] terrified . But immediately He spoke with them and * said to them , “ ( AX ) Take courage ; it is I , ( AY ) do not be afraid. ”
NASB	Mark	6	51	Then He got into ( AZ ) the boat with them , and the wind stopped ; and they were utterly astonished ,
NASB	Mark	6	52	for ( BA ) they [ x ] had not gained any insight from the incident of the loaves , but [ y ] their hearts ( BB ) were hardened . Healing at Gennesaret
NASB	Mark	6	53	( BC ) When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret , and moored at the shore .
NASB	Mark	6	54	And when they got out of the boat , immediately the people recognized Him ,
NASB	Mark	6	55	and ran about that entire country and began carrying here and there on their pallets those who were sick , [ z ] to wherever they heard He was .
NASB	Mark	6	56	And wherever He entered villages , or cities , or a countryside , they were laying the sick in the marketplaces and imploring Him that they might just ( BD ) touch ( BE ) the fringe of His cloak ; and all who touched it were being [ aa ] healed .

NASB	Mark	7	7	( I ) And in vain do they worship Me , Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men. ’
NASB	Mark	7	2	and saw that some of His disciples were eating their bread with [ a ] ( C ) unholy hands , that is , unwashed .
NASB	Mark	7	3	( For the Pharisees and all the other Jews do not eat unless they [ b ] carefully wash their hands , thereby holding firmly to the ( D ) tradition of the elders ;
NASB	Mark	7	4	and when they come from the marketplace , they do not eat unless they [ c ] completely cleanse themselves ; and there are many other things which they have received as traditions to firmly hold , such as the [ d ] washing of ( E ) cups , pitchers , and copper pots . )
NASB	Mark	7	5	And the Pharisees and the scribes * asked Him , “ Why do Your disciples not walk in accordance with the ( F ) tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with ( G ) [ e ] unholy hands ? ”
NASB	Mark	7	6	But He said to them , “ Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites , as it is written : ‘ ( H ) This people honors Me with their lips , But their heart is far away from Me .
NASB	Mark	7	8	Neglecting the commandment of God , you hold to the ( J ) tradition of men. ”
NASB	Mark	7	9	He was also saying to them , “ You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your ( K ) tradition .
NASB	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , ‘ ( L ) Honor your father and your mother ’ ; and , ‘ ( M ) The one who speaks evil of father or mother , is [ f ] certainly to be put to death ’ ;
NASB	Mark	7	11	but you say , ‘ If a person says to his father or his mother , whatever I have that would help you is ( N ) Corban ( that is , [ g ] given to God ) , ’
NASB	Mark	7	12	you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother ;
NASB	Mark	7	13	thereby invalidating the word of God by your ( O ) tradition which you have handed down ; and you do many things such as that. ” The Heart of Man
NASB	Mark	7	14	After He called the crowd to Him again , He began saying to them , “ Listen to Me , all of you , and understand :
NASB	Mark	7	15	there is nothing outside the person which can defile him if it goes into him ; but the things which come out of the person are what defile the person [ h ] . ”
NASB	Mark	7	17	And when He later entered a house , away from the crowd , ( P ) His disciples asked Him about the parable .
NASB	Mark	7	18	And He * said to them , “ Are you so lacking in understanding as well ? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the person from outside can not defile him ,
NASB	Mark	7	19	because it does not go into his heart , but into his stomach , and [ i ] is eliminated ? ” ( Thereby He declared ( Q ) all foods ( R ) clean . )
NASB	Mark	7	20	And He was saying , “ ( S ) That which comes out of the person , that is what defiles the person .
NASB	Mark	7	21	For from within , out of the [ j ] hearts of people , come the evil thoughts , acts of sexual immorality , thefts , murders , acts of adultery ,
NASB	Mark	7	22	deeds of greed , wickedness , deceit , indecent behavior , [ k ] ( T ) envy , slander , [ l ] pride , and foolishness .
NASB	Mark	7	23	All these evil things come from within and defile the person. ” The Syrophoenician Woman
NASB	Mark	7	24	( U ) Now Jesus got up and went from there to the region of ( V ) Tyre [ m ] . And when He had entered a house , He wanted no one to know about it ; and yet He could not escape notice .
NASB	Mark	7	25	But after hearing about Him , a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet .
NASB	Mark	7	26	Now the woman was a [ n ] Gentile , of Syrophoenician descent . And she repeatedly asked Him to cast the demon out of her daughter .
NASB	Mark	7	27	And He was saying to her , “ Let the children be satisfied first , for it is not [ o ] good to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the [ p ] dogs. ”
NASB	Mark	7	28	But she answered and * said to Him , “ Yes , Lord , but even the dogs under the table feed on the children ’ s crumbs. ”
NASB	Mark	7	29	And He said to her , “ Because of this [ q ] answer , go ; the demon has gone out of your daughter. ”
NASB	Mark	7	30	And after going back to her home , she found the child [ r ] lying on the bed , and the demon gone .
NASB	Mark	7	31	( W ) Again He left the region of ( X ) Tyre and came through Sidon to ( Y ) the Sea of Galilee , within the region of ( Z ) Decapolis .
NASB	Mark	7	32	And they * brought to Him one who was deaf and had difficulty speaking , and they * begged Him to ( AA ) lay His hand on him .
NASB	Mark	7	33	And Jesus ( AB ) took him aside from the crowd , by himself , and put His fingers in his ears , and after ( AC ) spitting , He touched his tongue with the saliva ;
NASB	Mark	7	34	and looking up to heaven with a deep ( AD ) sigh , He * said to him , “ Ephphatha ! ” that is , “ Be opened ! ”
NASB	Mark	7	35	And his ears were opened , and the [ s ] impediment of his tongue was [ t ] removed , and he began speaking plainly .
NASB	Mark	7	36	And ( AE ) He gave them orders not to tell anyone ; but the more He ordered them , the more widely they ( AF ) continued to proclaim it .
NASB	Mark	7	37	And they were utterly astonished , saying , “ He has done all things well ; He makes even those who are deaf hear , and those who are unable to talk , speak. ” Footnotes - Mark 7:2 Lit common ; i.e. , ritually unclean - Mark 7:3 Lit with a fist ( following a prescribed ritual ) - Mark 7:4 Lit baptize ; i.e. , immerse ; two early mss purify - Mark 7:4 Lit baptisms - Mark 7:5 Lit common ; i.e. , ritually unclean - Mark 7:10 Lit to die with death - Mark 7:11 Lit a gift ; i.e. , an offering - Mark 7:15 Late mss add , as v

NASB	Mark	8	7	They also had a few small fish ; and ( C ) after He had blessed them , He told the disciples to serve these as well .
NASB	Mark	8	9	About four thousand [ e ] men were there ; and He dismissed them .
NASB	Mark	8	10	And immediately He got into the boat with His disciples and came to the region of ( E ) Dalmanutha .
NASB	Mark	8	11	( F ) And the Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him , ( G ) demanding from Him a [ f ] sign from heaven , [ g ] to test Him .
NASB	Mark	8	12	( H ) Sighing deeply in His spirit , He * said , “ Why does this generation demand a [ h ] sign ? Truly I say to you , [ i ] ( I ) no [ j ] sign will be given to this generation ! ”
NASB	Mark	8	13	And leaving them , He again embarked and went away to the other side .
NASB	Mark	8	14	And the disciples had forgotten to take bread , and did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them .
NASB	Mark	8	15	And He was giving orders to them , saying , “ ( J ) Watch out ! Beware of the [ k ] leaven of the Pharisees , and the leaven of ( K ) Herod. ”
NASB	Mark	8	16	And they began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread .
NASB	Mark	8	17	And Jesus , aware of this , * said to them , “ Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread ? ( L ) Do you not yet comprehend or understand ? Do you still have your heart [ l ] hardened ?
NASB	Mark	8	18	( M ) Having eyes , do you not see ? And having ears , do you not hear ? And do you not remember ,
NASB	Mark	8	19	when I broke ( N ) the five loaves for the five thousand , how many ( O ) baskets full of broken pieces you picked up ? ” They * said to Him , “ Twelve. ”
NASB	Mark	8	20	“ When I broke ( P ) the seven for the four thousand , how many large ( Q ) baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up ? ” And they * said to Him , “ Seven. ”
NASB	Mark	8	21	And He was saying to them , “ ( R ) Do you not yet understand ? ”
NASB	Mark	8	22	And they * came to ( S ) Bethsaida . And some people * brought a man who was blind to [ m ] Jesus and * begged Him to ( T ) touch him .
NASB	Mark	8	23	Taking the man who was blind by the hand , He ( U ) brought him out of the village ; and after ( V ) spitting in his eyes and ( W ) laying His hands on him , He asked him , “ Do you see anything ? ”
NASB	Mark	8	24	And he [ n ] looked up and said , “ I see people , for I see them like trees , walking around. ”
NASB	Mark	8	25	Then again He laid His hands on his eyes ; and he looked intently and was restored , and began to see everything clearly .
NASB	Mark	8	26	And He sent him to his home , saying , “ Do not even enter ( X ) the village. ” Peter ’ s Confession of Christ
NASB	Mark	8	27	( Y ) Jesus went out , along with His disciples , to the villages of ( Z ) Caesarea Philippi ; and on the way He questioned His disciples , saying to them , “ Who do people say that I am ? ”
NASB	Mark	8	28	( AA ) They told Him , saying , “ John the Baptist ; and others say Elijah ; and others , one of the prophets. ”
NASB	Mark	8	29	And He continued questioning them : “ But who do you say that I am ? ” ( AB ) Peter answered and * said to Him , “ You are the [ o ] Christ. ”
NASB	Mark	8	30	And ( AC ) He [ p ] warned them to tell no one about Him .
NASB	Mark	8	31	( AD ) And He began to teach them that ( AE ) the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise from the dead .
NASB	Mark	8	32	And He was stating the matter ( AF ) plainly . And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him .
NASB	Mark	8	33	But turning around and seeing His disciples , He rebuked Peter and * said , “ Get behind Me , ( AG ) Satan ; for you are not setting your mind on [ q ] God ’ s purposes , but on man ’ s. ”
NASB	Mark	8	34	And He summoned the crowd together with His disciples , and said to them , “ If anyone wants to come after Me , he must deny himself , ( AH ) take up his cross , and follow Me .
NASB	Mark	8	35	For ( AI ) whoever wants to save his [ r ] life will lose it , but whoever loses his [ s ] life for My sake and the gospel ’ s will save it .
NASB	Mark	8	36	For what does it benefit a person to gain the whole world , and forfeit his soul ?
NASB	Mark	8	37	For what could a person give in exchange for his soul ?
NASB	Mark	8	38	For ( AJ ) whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation , ( AK ) the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He ( AL ) comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels. ” Footnotes - Mark 8:2 Lit crowd - Mark 8:4 Lit loaves - Mark 8:6 Lit crowd - Mark 8:6 Lit crowd - Mark 8:9 I.e. , 4,000 men plus women and children , cf .

NASB	Mark	9	9	( I ) As they were coming down from the mountain , He ( J ) gave them orders not to relate to anyone what they had seen , [ g ] until the Son of Man rose from the dead .
NASB	Mark	9	2	v
NASB	Mark	9	3	and ( D ) His garments became radiant and exceedingly white , as no launderer on earth can whiten them .
NASB	Mark	9	4	And Elijah appeared to them along with Moses ; and they were talking with Jesus .
NASB	Mark	9	5	Peter responded and * said to Jesus , “ ( E ) Rabbi , it is good that we are here ; ( F ) let ’ s make three [ c ] tabernacles , one for You , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
NASB	Mark	9	6	For he did not know how to reply ; for they became terrified .
NASB	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud [ d ] formed , overshadowing them , and ( G ) a voice [ e ] came out of the cloud : “ ( H ) This is My beloved Son ; [ f ] listen to Him ! ”
NASB	Mark	9	8	And suddenly they looked around and saw no one with them anymore , except Jesus alone .
NASB	Mark	9	10	They [ h ] seized upon [ i ] that statement , discussing with one another [ j ] what rising from the dead meant .
NASB	Mark	9	11	And they asked Him , saying , “ Why is it that the scribes say that ( K ) Elijah must come first ? ”
NASB	Mark	9	12	And He said to them , “ Elijah does come first and he restores all things . And yet how is it written of ( L ) the Son of Man that ( M ) He will suffer many things and be treated with contempt ?
NASB	Mark	9	13	But I say to you that Elijah has [ k ] indeed come , and they did to him whatever they wanted , just as it is written of him. ” All Things Possible
NASB	Mark	9	14	( N ) And when they came back to the other disciples , they saw a large crowd around them , and some scribes arguing with them .
NASB	Mark	9	15	Immediately , when the entire crowd saw Him , they were ( O ) amazed and began running up to greet Him .
NASB	Mark	9	16	And He asked them , “ What are you disputing with them ? ”
NASB	Mark	9	17	And one person from the crowd answered Him , “ Teacher , I brought You my son , because he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak ;
NASB	Mark	9	18	and [ l ] whenever it seizes him , it slams him to the ground , and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes stiff . And I told Your disciples so that they would cast it out , but they could not do it. ”
NASB	Mark	9	19	And He answered them and * said , “ O unbelieving generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring him to Me ! ”
NASB	Mark	9	20	And they brought [ m ] the boy to Him . When he saw Him , the spirit immediately threw him into convulsions , and falling to the ground , he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth .
NASB	Mark	9	21	And He asked his father , “ How long has this been happening to him ? ” And he said , “ From childhood .
NASB	Mark	9	22	It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to kill him . But if You can do anything , take pity on us and help us ! ”
NASB	Mark	9	23	But Jesus said to him , “ ‘ If You can ? ’ ( P ) All things are possible for the one who believes. ”
NASB	Mark	9	24	Immediately the boy ’ s father cried out and said , “ I do believe ; help my unbelief ! ”
NASB	Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that ( Q ) a crowd was [ n ] rapidly gathering , He rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , “ You mute and deaf spirit , I [ o ] command you , come out of him and do not enter him [ p ] again ! ”
NASB	Mark	9	26	And after crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions , it came out ; and the boy became so much like a corpse that most of them said , “ He is dead ! ”
NASB	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him , and he got up .
NASB	Mark	9	28	When He came ( R ) into the house , His disciples began asking Him privately , “ Why is it that we could not cast it out ? ”
NASB	Mark	9	29	And He said to them , “ This kind can not come out by anything except prayer. ” Death and Resurrection Foretold
NASB	Mark	9	30	( S ) And from there they went out and began to go through Galilee , and He did not want anyone to know about it .
NASB	Mark	9	31	For He was teaching His disciples and telling them , “ ( T ) The Son of Man is to be [ q ] handed over to men , and they will kill Him ; and when He has been killed , He will rise three days later. ”
NASB	Mark	9	32	But ( U ) they [ r ] did not understand this statement , and they were afraid to ask Him .
NASB	Mark	9	33	( V ) They came to Capernaum ; and when He was in ( W ) the house , He began to question them : “ What were you discussing on the way ? ”
NASB	Mark	9	34	But they kept silent , for on the way ( X ) they had discussed with one another which of them was the greatest .
NASB	Mark	9	35	And sitting down , He called the twelve and * said to them , “ ( Y ) If anyone wants to be first , he shall be last of all and servant of all. ”
NASB	Mark	9	36	And He took a child and placed him among them , and taking him in His arms , He said to them ,
NASB	Mark	9	37	“ ( Z ) Whoever [ s ] receives [ t ] one child like this in My name [ u ] receives Me ; and whoever [ v ] receives Me does not [ w ] receive Me , but Him who sent Me. ” Dire Warnings
NASB	Mark	9	38	( AA ) John said to Him , “ Teacher , we saw someone casting out demons in Your name , and ( AB ) we tried to prevent him because he was not following us. ”
NASB	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , “ Do not hinder him , for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name , and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me .
NASB	Mark	9	40	( AC ) For the one who is not against us is [ x ] for us .
NASB	Mark	9	41	For ( AD ) whoever gives you a cup of water to drink [ y ] because of your name as followers of Christ , truly I say to you , he shall by no means lose his reward .
NASB	Mark	9	42	“ ( AE ) Whoever causes one of these [ z ] little ones who believe in Me to [ aa ] sin , it is better for him if a heavy millstone is hung around his neck and he [ ab ] is thrown into the sea .

NASB	Mark	10	10	And in the house the disciples again began questioning Him about this .
NASB	Mark	10	2	And some Pharisees came up to Jesus , testing Him , and began questioning Him whether it was lawful for a man to [ a ] divorce his wife .
NASB	Mark	10	3	And He answered and said to them , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
NASB	Mark	10	4	They said , “ ( C ) Moses permitted a man to write a [ b ] certificate of divorce and [ c ] send his wife away. ”
NASB	Mark	10	5	But Jesus said to them , “ [ d ] ( D ) Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment .
NASB	Mark	10	6	But ( E ) from the beginning of creation , God ( F ) created them male and female .
NASB	Mark	10	7	( G ) For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother [ e ] ,
NASB	Mark	10	8	( H ) and the two shall become one flesh ; so they are no longer two , but one flesh .
NASB	Mark	10	9	Therefore , what God has joined together , no person is to separate. ”
NASB	Mark	10	11	And He * said to them , “ ( I ) Whoever [ f ] divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her ;
NASB	Mark	10	12	and ( J ) if she herself [ g ] divorces her husband and marries another man , she is committing adultery. ” Jesus Blesses Little Children
NASB	Mark	10	13	( K ) And they were bringing children to Him so that He would touch them ; but the disciples rebuked them .
NASB	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw this , He was indignant and said to them , “ Allow the children to come to Me ; do not [ h ] forbid them , ( L ) for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
NASB	Mark	10	15	Truly I say to you , ( M ) whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all. ”
NASB	Mark	10	16	And He ( N ) took them in His arms and began blessing them , laying His hands on them . The Rich Young Ruler
NASB	Mark	10	17	( O ) As He was setting out on a journey , a man ran up to Him and ( P ) knelt before Him , and asked Him , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do so that I may ( Q ) inherit eternal life ? ”
NASB	Mark	10	18	But Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is good except God alone .
NASB	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments : ‘ ( R ) Do not murder , Do not commit adultery , Do not steal , Do not give false testimony , Do not defraud , Honor your father and mother. ’ ”
NASB	Mark	10	20	And he said to Him , “ Teacher , I have kept ( S ) all these things from my youth. ”
NASB	Mark	10	21	Looking at him , Jesus showed love to him and said to him , “ One thing you lack : go and sell all you possess and give to the poor , and you will have ( T ) treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me. ”
NASB	Mark	10	22	But he [ i ] was deeply dismayed by [ j ] these words , and he went away grieving ; for he was one who owned much property .
NASB	Mark	10	23	And Jesus , looking around , * said to His disciples , “ ( U ) How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
NASB	Mark	10	24	And the disciples ( V ) were amazed at His words . But Jesus responded again and * said to them , “ Children , how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God !
NASB	Mark	10	25	( W ) It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NASB	Mark	10	26	And they were even more astonished , and said to Him , “ [ k ] Then who can be saved ? ”
NASB	Mark	10	27	Looking at them , Jesus * said , “ ( X ) With people it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God. ”
NASB	Mark	10	28	( Y ) Peter began to say to Him , “ Behold , we have left everything and have followed You. ”
NASB	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , “ Truly I say to you , ( Z ) there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms , for My sake and for the gospel ’ s sake ,
NASB	Mark	10	30	[ l ] but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in [ m ] the present age , houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms , along with persecutions ; and in ( AA ) the age to come , eternal life .
NASB	Mark	10	31	But ( AB ) many who are first will be last , and the last , first. ” Jesus ’ Sufferings Foretold
NASB	Mark	10	32	( AC ) Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was walking on ahead of them ; and they ( AD ) were amazed , and those who followed were fearful . And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him ,
NASB	Mark	10	33	saying , “ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and ( AE ) the Son of Man will be [ n ] handed over to the chief priests and the scribes ; and they will condemn Him to death and will [ o ] hand Him over to the Gentiles .
NASB	Mark	10	34	And they will mock Him and ( AF ) spit on Him , and flog Him and kill Him ; and three days later He will rise from the dead. ”
NASB	Mark	10	35	[ p ] ( AG ) James and John , the two sons of Zebedee , * came up to [ q ] Jesus , saying to Him , “ Teacher , we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You. ”
NASB	Mark	10	36	And He said to them , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ”
NASB	Mark	10	37	They said to Him , “ [ r ] Grant that we ( AH ) may sit , one on Your right and one on Your left , in Your glory. ”
NASB	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said to them , “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able ( AI ) to drink the cup that I drink , or ( AJ ) to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ? ”
NASB	Mark	10	39	They said to Him , “ We are able. ” And Jesus said to them , “ The cup that I drink ( AK ) you shall drink ; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized .
NASB	Mark	10	40	But to sit on My right or on My left is not Mine to give ; ( AL ) but it is for those for whom it has been prepared. ”
NASB	Mark	10	41	( AM ) Hearing this , the other ten began to feel indignant with [ s ] James and John .
NASB	Mark	10	42	Calling them to Himself , Jesus * said to them , “ You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them ; and their [ t ] people in high position exercise authority over them .
NASB	Mark	10	43	But it is not this way among you ; ( AN ) rather , whoever wants to become [ u ] prominent among you shall be your servant ;
NASB	Mark	10	44	and whoever wants to be first among you shall be slave of all .
NASB	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of Man ( AO ) did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His [ v ] life as a ransom for many. ” Bartimaeus Receives His Sight
NASB	Mark	10	46	( AP ) Then they * came to Jericho . And later , ( AQ ) as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd , a beggar who was blind named Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , was sitting by the road .
NASB	Mark	10	47	And when he heard that it was Jesus the ( AR ) Nazarene , he began to cry out and say , “ Jesus , ( AS ) Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NASB	Mark	10	48	Many were sternly telling him to be quiet , but he kept crying out all the more , “ ( AT ) Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NASB	Mark	10	49	And Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him here. ” So they * called the man who was blind , saying to him , “ ( AU ) Take courage , stand up ! He is calling for you. ”
NASB	Mark	10	50	And throwing off his cloak , he jumped up and came to Jesus .
NASB	Mark	10	51	And replying to him , Jesus said , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” And the man who was blind said to Him , “ [ w ] ( AV ) Rabboni , I want to regain my sight ! ”
NASB	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said to him , “ Go ; ( AW ) your faith has [ x ] made you well. ” And immediately he regained his sight and began following Him on the road .

NASB	Mark	11	11	( G ) And Jesus entered Jerusalem and came into the temple area ; and after looking around at everything , ( H ) He left for Bethany with the twelve , since it was already late .
NASB	Mark	11	2	and * said to them , “ Go into the village opposite you , and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied there , on which no one has ever sat ; untie it and bring it here .
NASB	Mark	11	3	And if anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ The Lord has need of it ’ ; and immediately he [ a ] will send it back here. ”
NASB	Mark	11	4	They went away and found a colt tied at the door , outside in the street ; and they * untied it .
NASB	Mark	11	5	And some of the bystanders were saying to them , “ What are you doing , untying the colt ? ”
NASB	Mark	11	6	And they told them just as Jesus had said , and they gave them permission .
NASB	Mark	11	7	( D ) They * brought the colt to Jesus and * put their cloaks on it ; and He sat on it .
NASB	Mark	11	8	And many people spread their cloaks on the road , and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields .
NASB	Mark	11	9	And those who went in front and those who followed were shouting : “ [ b ] Hosanna ! ( E ) Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord ;
NASB	Mark	11	10	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David ; [ c ] Hosanna ( F ) in the highest ! ”
NASB	Mark	11	12	( I ) On the next day , when they had left Bethany , He became hungry .
NASB	Mark	11	13	Seeing from a distance a fig tree in leaf , He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it ; and when He came to it , He found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
NASB	Mark	11	14	And He said to it , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again ! ” And His disciples were listening . Jesus Drives Money Changers from the Temple
NASB	Mark	11	15	( J ) Then they * came to Jerusalem . And He entered the temple area and began to drive out those who were selling and buying on the temple grounds , and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling [ d ] doves ;
NASB	Mark	11	16	and He would not allow anyone to carry [ e ] merchandise through the temple grounds .
NASB	Mark	11	17	And He began to teach and say to them , “ Is it not written : ‘ ( K ) My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations ’ ? ( L ) But you have made it a den of robbers. ”
NASB	Mark	11	18	And the chief priests and the scribes heard this , and they ( M ) began seeking how to put Him to death ; for they were afraid of Him , because all ( N ) the crowd was astonished at His teaching .
NASB	Mark	11	19	And ( O ) whenever evening came , [ f ] they would leave the city .
NASB	Mark	11	20	( P ) As they were passing by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up .
NASB	Mark	11	21	And being reminded , Peter * said to Him , “ ( Q ) Rabbi , look , the fig tree that You cursed has withered. ”
NASB	Mark	11	22	And Jesus answered and * said to them , “ ( R ) Have faith in God .
NASB	Mark	11	23	( S ) Truly I say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and thrown into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says is going to happen , it will be granted to him .
NASB	Mark	11	24	Therefore , I say to you , ( T ) all things for which you pray and ask , believe that you have received them , and they will be granted to you .
NASB	Mark	11	25	And whenever you ( U ) stand praying , ( V ) forgive , if you have anything against anyone , so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you for your [ g ] offenses .

NASB	Mark	11	31	And they began considering the implications among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
NASB	Mark	11	32	But should we say , ‘ From men ’ ? ” —they were afraid of the [ j ] people , for they all considered John to have been a real prophet .

NASB	Mark	12	10	Have you not even read this Scripture : ‘ ( D ) A stone which the builders rejected , This has become the [ d ] chief cornerstone ;
NASB	Mark	12	11	( E ) This came about from the Lord , And it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ? ”
NASB	Mark	12	13	( H ) Then they * sent some of the Pharisees and ( I ) Herodians to Him in order to ( J ) trap Him in a statement .
NASB	Mark	12	14	They came and * said to Him , “ Teacher , we know that You are truthful and [ f ] do not care what anyone thinks ; for You [ g ] are not partial to anyone , but You teach the way of God in truth . Is it [ h ] permissible to pay a [ i ] poll-tax to Caesar , or not ?
NASB	Mark	12	15	Are we to pay , or not pay ? ” But He , knowing their hypocrisy , said to them , “ Why are you testing Me ? Bring Me a [ j ] denarius to look at. ”
NASB	Mark	12	16	And they brought one . And He * said to them , “ Whose image and inscription is this ? ” And they said to Him , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NASB	Mark	12	17	And Jesus said to them , “ ( K ) Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and to God the things that are God ’ s. ” And they were utterly amazed at Him .
NASB	Mark	12	18	( L ) Some Sadducees ( who say that there is no resurrection ) * came to [ k ] Jesus , and began questioning Him , saying ,
NASB	Mark	12	19	“ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that ( M ) if a man ’ s brother dies and leaves behind a wife and does not leave a child , his brother is to [ l ] marry the wife and raise up [ m ] children for his brother .
NASB	Mark	12	20	There were seven brothers ; and the first took a wife , and died leaving no children .
NASB	Mark	12	21	The second one [ n ] married her , and died leaving behind no children ; and the third likewise ;
NASB	Mark	12	22	and so the seven together left no children . Last of all the woman also died .
NASB	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection , which one ’ s wife will she be ? For each of the seven had her as his wife. ”
NASB	Mark	12	24	Jesus said to them , “ Is this not the reason you are mistaken , that you do not [ o ] understand the Scriptures nor the power of God ?
NASB	Mark	12	25	For when they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
NASB	Mark	12	26	But [ p ] regarding the fact that the dead rise , have you not read in the book of Moses , ( N ) in the passage about the burning bush , how God spoke to him , saying , ‘ ( O ) I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ?
NASB	Mark	12	27	( P ) He is not the God [ q ] of the dead , but of the living ; you are greatly mistaken. ”
NASB	Mark	12	28	( Q ) One of the scribes came up and heard them arguing , and ( R ) recognizing that He had answered them well , asked Him , “ What commandment is the [ r ] foremost of all ? ”
NASB	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered , “ The [ s ] foremost is , ‘ ( S ) Hear , Israel ! The Lord is our God , the Lord is one ;
NASB	Mark	12	30	( T ) and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength. ’
NASB	Mark	12	31	The second is this : ‘ ( U ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’ There is no other commandment greater than these. ”
NASB	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said to Him , “ Well said , Teacher ; You have truly stated that ( V ) He is One , and there is no other besides Him ;
NASB	Mark	12	33	( W ) and to love Him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the strength , and to love one ’ s neighbor as oneself , ( X ) is much more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices. ”
NASB	Mark	12	34	When Jesus saw that he had answered intelligently , He said to him , “ You are not far from the kingdom of God. ” ( Y ) And then , no one dared any longer to question Him .
NASB	Mark	12	35	( Z ) And Jesus responded and began saying , as He ( AA ) taught in the temple area , “ How is it that the scribes say that the [ t ] Christ is the ( AB ) son of David ?
NASB	Mark	12	36	David himself said [ u ] in the Holy Spirit , ‘ ( AC ) The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand , Until I put Your enemies under Your feet. ” ’
NASB	Mark	12	37	David himself calls Him ‘ Lord ’ ; so in what sense is He his son ? ” And ( AD ) the large crowd [ v ] enjoyed listening to Him .
NASB	Mark	12	38	( AE ) And in His teaching He was saying : “ Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes , and like ( AF ) personal greetings in the marketplaces ,
NASB	Mark	12	39	and seats of honor in the synagogues , and places of honor at banquets ,
NASB	Mark	12	40	( AG ) who devour widows ’ houses , and for appearance ’ s sake offer long prayers . These will receive all the more condemnation. ” The Widow ’ s Coins
NASB	Mark	12	41	( AH ) And Jesus sat down opposite ( AI ) the treasury , and began watching how the [ w ] people were ( AJ ) putting [ x ] money into the treasury ; and many rich people were putting in large amounts .
NASB	Mark	12	42	And a poor widow came and put in two [ y ] lepta coins , which amount to a [ z ] quadrans .
NASB	Mark	12	43	Calling His disciples to Him , He said to them , “ Truly I say to you , this poor widow put in more than all [ aa ] the contributors to the treasury ;
NASB	Mark	12	44	for they all put in out of their [ ab ] surplus , but she , out of her poverty , put in all she owned , [ ac ] all she had ( AK ) to live on. ” Footnotes - Mark 12:1 Or hedge - Mark 12:1 Or tenant farmers , also vv

NASB	Mark	13	2	And Jesus said to him , “ Do you see these great buildings ? ( B ) Not one stone will be left upon another , which will not be torn down. ”
NASB	Mark	13	3	As He was sitting on ( C ) the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , ( D ) Peter , [ c ] James , John , and Andrew were questioning Him privately ,
NASB	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , when will these things come about , and what will be the [ d ] sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled ? ”
NASB	Mark	13	5	And Jesus began to say to them , “ See to it that no one misleads you .
NASB	Mark	13	6	Many will come in My name , saying , ‘ ( E ) I am He ! ’ and they will mislead many .
NASB	Mark	13	7	When you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be alarmed ; those things must take place ; but that is not yet the end .

NASB	Mark	13	18	Moreover , pray that it will not happen in winter .
NASB	Mark	13	19	For those days will be such a time of tribulation as has not occurred ( N ) since the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will again .
NASB	Mark	13	20	And if the Lord had not shortened those days , no [ n ] life would have been saved ; but for the sake of the [ o ] elect , whom He chose , He shortened the days .
NASB	Mark	13	21	And then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the [ p ] Christ ’ ; or , ‘ Look , there He is ’ ; do not believe it ;
NASB	Mark	13	22	for false christs and ( O ) false prophets will arise , and will provide ( P ) signs and ( Q ) wonders , in order to mislead , if possible , the elect .
NASB	Mark	13	23	But beware ; I have told you everything in advance . The Return of Christ
NASB	Mark	13	24	“ But in those days , after that tribulation , ( R ) the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light ,
NASB	Mark	13	25	( S ) and the stars will be falling from heaven , and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken .
NASB	Mark	13	26	And then they will see ( T ) the Son of Man ( U ) coming in clouds with great power and glory .
NASB	Mark	13	27	And then He will send forth the angels , and ( V ) will gather together His [ q ] elect from the four winds , ( W ) from the end of the earth to the end of heaven .

NASB	Mark	14	3	( D ) While He was in ( E ) Bethany at the home of Simon [ a ] the Leper , He was reclining at the table , and a woman came with an alabaster vial of very ( F ) expensive perfume of pure [ b ] nard . She broke the vial and poured the perfume over His head .
NASB	Mark	14	4	But there were some indignantly remarking to one another , “ Why has this perfume been wasted ?
NASB	Mark	14	5	For this perfume could have been sold for over three hundred [ c ] denarii , and the money given to the poor. ” And they were scolding her .
NASB	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said , “ Leave her alone ! Why are you bothering her ? She has done a good deed for Me .
NASB	Mark	14	7	For you always have ( G ) the poor with you , and whenever you want , you can do good to them ; but you do not always have Me .
NASB	Mark	14	8	She has done what she could ; ( H ) she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial .
NASB	Mark	14	9	Truly I say to you , ( I ) wherever the gospel is preached in the entire world , what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her. ”
NASB	Mark	14	10	( J ) Then Judas Iscariot , ( K ) who was one of the twelve , went off to the chief priests in order to [ d ] betray Him to them .
NASB	Mark	14	11	They were delighted when they heard this , and promised to give him money . And he began seeking how to betray Him at an opportune time . The Last Passover
NASB	Mark	14	12	( L ) On the first day of [ e ] ( M ) Unleavened Bread , when [ f ] the Passover lamb was being ( N ) sacrificed , His disciples * said to Him , “ Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover ? ”
NASB	Mark	14	13	And He * sent two of His disciples and * said to them , “ Go into the city , and a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you ; follow him ;
NASB	Mark	14	15	And he himself will show you a large upstairs room furnished and ready ; prepare for us there. ”
NASB	Mark	14	16	The disciples left and came to the city , and found everything just as He had told them ; and they prepared the Passover .
NASB	Mark	14	17	( P ) When it was evening He * came with the twelve .
NASB	Mark	14	18	And as they were reclining at the table and eating , Jesus said , “ Truly I say to you that one of you will [ g ] betray Me— [ h ] one who is eating with Me. ”
NASB	Mark	14	19	They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one , “ Surely not I ? ”
NASB	Mark	14	20	But He said to them , “ It is one of the twelve , the one who dips bread with Me in the bowl .
NASB	Mark	14	21	For the Son of Man is going away just as it is written about Him ; but woe to that man [ i ] by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been good [ j ] for that man if he had not been born. ” The Lord ’ s Supper
NASB	Mark	14	22	( Q ) While they were eating , He took some bread , and [ k ] after a ( R ) blessing He broke it , and gave it to them , and said , “ Take it ; this is My body. ”
NASB	Mark	14	23	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks , He gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
NASB	Mark	14	24	And He said to them , “ This is My ( S ) blood of the ( T ) covenant , which is being poured out for many .
NASB	Mark	14	25	Truly I say to you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again , until that day when I drink it , new , in the kingdom of God. ”
NASB	Mark	14	26	( U ) And after singing a [ l ] hymn , they went out to ( V ) the Mount of Olives .
NASB	Mark	14	27	( W ) And Jesus * said to them , “ You will all [ m ] fall away , because it is written : ‘ ( X ) I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered. ’
NASB	Mark	14	28	But after I am raised , ( Y ) I will go ahead of you to Galilee. ”
NASB	Mark	14	29	But Peter said to Him , “ Even if they all [ n ] fall away , yet I will not ! ”
NASB	Mark	14	30	And Jesus * said to him , “ Truly I say to you , that [ o ] ( Z ) this very night , before ( AA ) a rooster crows twice , you yourself will deny Me three times. ”
NASB	Mark	14	31	But [ p ] Peter repeatedly said insistently , “ Even if I have to die with You , I will not deny You ! ” And they all were saying the same thing as well . Jesus in Gethsemane
NASB	Mark	14	32	( AB ) They * came to a place named [ q ] Gethsemane ; and He * said to His disciples , “ Sit here until I have prayed. ”
NASB	Mark	14	33	And He * took with Him Peter , [ r ] James , and John , and began to be very ( AC ) distressed and troubled .
NASB	Mark	14	34	And He * said to them , “ ( AD ) My soul is deeply grieved , to the point of death ; remain here and [ s ] keep watch. ”
NASB	Mark	14	35	And He went a little beyond them , and fell to the ground and began praying that if it were possible , ( AE ) the hour might [ t ] pass Him by .
NASB	Mark	14	36	And He was saying , “ ( AF ) Abba ! [ u ] Father ! All things are possible for You ; remove this cup from Me ; ( AG ) yet not what I will , but what You will. ”
NASB	Mark	14	37	And He * came and * found them sleeping , and * said to Peter , “ Simon , are you asleep ? Could you not [ v ] keep watch for one hour ?
NASB	Mark	14	38	[ w ] ( AH ) Keep watching and praying , so that you will not come into temptation ; the spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak. ”
NASB	Mark	14	39	And again He went away and prayed , saying the same [ x ] words .
NASB	Mark	14	40	And again He came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy ; and they did not know what to say in reply to Him .
NASB	Mark	14	41	And He * came the third time , and * said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? That is enough . ( AI ) The hour has come ; behold , the Son of Man is being [ y ] betrayed into the hands of sinners .
NASB	Mark	14	42	Get up , let ’ s go ; behold , the one who is betraying Me is near ! ” Betrayal and Arrest
NASB	Mark	14	43	( AJ ) And immediately , while He was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve , * came up , [ z ] accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs who were from the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders .
NASB	Mark	14	44	Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal , saying , “ Whomever I kiss , He is the one ; arrest Him and lead Him away [ aa ] under guard. ”
NASB	Mark	14	45	And after coming , Judas immediately went to Him and * said , “ ( AK ) Rabbi ! ” and kissed Him .
NASB	Mark	14	46	And they laid hands on Him and arrested Him .
NASB	Mark	14	47	But one of those who stood by drew his sword , and struck the slave of the high priest and [ ab ] cut off his ear .
NASB	Mark	14	48	And Jesus said to them , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me , as you would against a man inciting a revolt ?
NASB	Mark	14	49	Every day I was with you ( AL ) within the temple grounds teaching , and you did not arrest Me ; but this has taken place so that the Scriptures will be fulfilled. ”
NASB	Mark	14	50	And [ ac ] His disciples all left Him and fled .
NASB	Mark	14	51	A young man was following Him , wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body ; and they * seized him .
NASB	Mark	14	52	But he [ ad ] pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked . Jesus before His Accusers
NASB	Mark	14	53	( AM ) They led Jesus away to the high priest ; and all the chief priests , the elders , and the scribes * gathered together .
NASB	Mark	14	54	And Peter had followed Him at a distance , ( AN ) right into ( AO ) the courtyard of the high priest ; and he was sitting with the [ ae ] officers and ( AP ) warming himself at the [ af ] fire .
NASB	Mark	14	55	Now the chief priests and the entire [ ag ] ( AQ ) Council were trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death , and they were not finding any .
NASB	Mark	14	56	For many people were giving false testimony against Him , and so their testimonies were not consistent .
NASB	Mark	14	57	And then some stood up and began giving false testimony against Him , saying ,
NASB	Mark	14	58	“ We heard Him say , ‘ ( AR ) I will destroy this [ ah ] temple that was made by hands , and in three days I will build another , made without hands. ’ ”
NASB	Mark	14	59	And not even in this respect was their testimony consistent .
NASB	Mark	14	60	And then the high priest stood up and came forward and questioned Jesus , saying , “ Do You not offer any answer for what these men are testifying against You ? ”
NASB	Mark	14	61	( AS ) But He kept silent and did not offer any answer . ( AT ) Again the high priest was questioning Him , and * said to Him , “ Are You the [ ai ] Christ , the Son of [ aj ] the Blessed One ? ”
NASB	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said , “ I am ; and you shall see ( AU ) the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power , and ( AV ) coming with the clouds of heaven. ”
NASB	Mark	14	63	( AW ) Tearing his clothes , the high priest * said , “ What further need do we have of witnesses ?
NASB	Mark	14	64	You have heard the ( AX ) blasphemy ; how does it seem to you ? ” And they all condemned Him as deserving of death .
NASB	Mark	14	65	And some began to ( AY ) spit on Him , and [ ak ] ( AZ ) to blindfold Him , and to beat Him with their fists and say to Him , “ ( BA ) Prophesy ! ” Then the officers took custody of Him [ al ] and slapped Him in the face . Peter ’ s Denials
NASB	Mark	14	66	( BB ) And while Peter was below in ( BC ) the courtyard , one of the slave women of the high priest * came ,
NASB	Mark	14	67	and seeing Peter ( BD ) warming himself , she looked at him and * said , “ You were with Jesus the ( BE ) Nazarene as well. ”
NASB	Mark	14	68	But he denied it , saying , “ I neither know nor understand what you are talking about. ” And he ( BF ) went out onto the [ am ] porch . [ an ]
NASB	Mark	14	69	The slave woman saw him , and began once more to say to the bystanders , “ This man is one of them ! ”
NASB	Mark	14	70	But again ( BG ) he denied it . And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter , “ You really are one of them , ( BH ) for you are a Galilean as well. ”
NASB	Mark	14	71	But he began to [ ao ] curse himself and to swear , “ I do not know this man of whom you speak ! ”

NASB	Mark	16	14	Later ( Q ) He appeared ( R ) to the eleven disciples themselves as they were reclining at the table ; and He reprimanded them for their ( S ) unbelief and hardness of heart , because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen from the dead .

NASB	Luke	1	2	just as they were handed down to us by those who ( B ) from the beginning [ b ] were ( C ) eyewitnesses and [ c ] ( D ) servants of ( E ) the [ d ] word ,
NASB	Luke	1	3	it seemed fitting to me as well , ( F ) having [ e ] investigated everything carefully from the beginning , to write it out for you ( G ) in an orderly sequence , ( H ) most excellent ( I ) Theophilus ;
NASB	Luke	1	4	so that you may know the exact truth about the [ f ] things you have been [ g ] ( J ) taught . John the Baptist ’ s Birth Foretold
NASB	Luke	1	5	( K ) In the days of Herod , king of Judea , there was a priest named Zechariah , of the ( L ) division of [ h ] Abijah ; and he had a wife [ i ] from the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
NASB	Luke	1	6	They were both ( M ) righteous in the sight of God , walking ( N ) blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord .
NASB	Luke	1	7	And yet they had no child , because Elizabeth was infertile , and they were both advanced in [ j ] years .
NASB	Luke	1	8	Now it happened that while ( O ) he was performing his priestly service before God in the appointed order of his division ,
NASB	Luke	1	9	according to the custom of the priestly office , he was chosen by lot ( P ) to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
NASB	Luke	1	10	And the whole multitude of the people were in prayer ( Q ) outside at the hour of the incense offering .
NASB	Luke	1	11	Now ( R ) an angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing to the right of the altar of incense .
NASB	Luke	1	12	Zechariah was troubled when he saw the angel , and ( S ) fear [ k ] gripped him .
NASB	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him , “ ( T ) Do not be afraid , Zechariah , for your prayer has been heard , and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and ( U ) you shall [ l ] name him John .
NASB	Luke	1	14	You will have joy and gladness , and many will rejoice over his birth .
NASB	Luke	1	15	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord ; and he will ( V ) drink no wine or liquor , and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit [ m ] while still in his mother ’ s womb .
NASB	Luke	1	16	And he will ( W ) turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God .
NASB	Luke	1	17	And it is he who will ( X ) go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit and power of ( Y ) Elijah , ( Z ) to turn the hearts of fathers back to their children , and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous , to ( AA ) make ready a people prepared for the Lord. ”
NASB	Luke	1	18	Zechariah said to the angel , “ How will I know this ? For ( AB ) I am an old man , and my wife is advanced in her [ n ] years. ”
NASB	Luke	1	19	The angel answered and said to him , “ I am ( AC ) Gabriel , who [ o ] ( AD ) stands in the presence of God , and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news .
NASB	Luke	1	20	And behold , you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place , because you did not believe my words , which will be fulfilled at their proper time. ”
NASB	Luke	1	21	And meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah , and were wondering at his delay in the temple .
NASB	Luke	1	22	But when he came out , he was unable to speak to them ; and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple , and he repeatedly ( AE ) [ p ] made signs to them , and remained speechless .
NASB	Luke	1	23	When the days of his priestly service were concluded , he went back home .
NASB	Luke	1	24	Now after these days his wife Elizabeth became pregnant , and she kept herself [ q ] in seclusion for five months , saying ,
NASB	Luke	1	25	“ This is the way the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He looked with favor upon me , to ( AF ) take away my disgrace among people. ” Jesus ’ Birth Foretold
NASB	Luke	1	26	Now in the sixth month the angel ( AG ) Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee named ( AH ) Nazareth ,
NASB	Luke	1	27	to ( AI ) a virgin [ r ] betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph , ( AJ ) of the [ s ] descendants of David ; and the virgin ’ s name was [ t ] Mary .
NASB	Luke	1	28	And coming in , he said to her , “ Greetings , favored one ! The Lord [ u ] is with you. ”
NASB	Luke	1	29	But she ( AK ) was very perplexed at this statement , and was pondering what kind of greeting this was .
NASB	Luke	1	30	And the angel said to her , “ ( AL ) Do not be afraid , Mary , for you have found favor with God .
NASB	Luke	1	31	And behold , you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son , and you ( AM ) shall name Him Jesus .
NASB	Luke	1	32	He will be great and will be called the Son of ( AN ) the Most High ; and the Lord God will give Him ( AO ) the throne of His father David ;
NASB	Luke	1	33	( AP ) and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever , ( AQ ) and His kingdom will have no end. ”
NASB	Luke	1	34	But Mary said to the angel , “ How will this be , since I [ v ] am a virgin ? ”
NASB	Luke	1	35	The angel answered and said to her , “ ( AR ) The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of ( AS ) the Most High will overshadow you ; for that reason also ( AT ) the [ w ] holy Child will be called ( AU ) the Son of God .
NASB	Luke	1	36	And behold , even your relative Elizabeth herself has conceived a son in her old age , and [ x ] she who was called infertile is now in her sixth month .
NASB	Luke	1	37	For ( AV ) nothing will be impossible with God. ”
NASB	Luke	1	38	And Mary said , “ Behold , the Lord ’ s bond-servant ; may it be done to me according to your word. ” And the angel departed from her . Mary Visits Elizabeth
NASB	Luke	1	39	Now [ y ] at this time Mary set out and went in a hurry to ( AW ) the hill country , to a city of Judah ,
NASB	Luke	1	40	and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth .
NASB	Luke	1	41	When Elizabeth heard Mary ’ s greeting , the baby leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was ( AX ) filled with the Holy Spirit .
NASB	Luke	1	42	And she cried out with a loud voice and said , “ Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
NASB	Luke	1	43	And [ z ] how has it happened to me that the mother of ( AY ) my Lord would come to me ?
NASB	Luke	1	44	For behold , when the sound of your greeting reached my ears , the baby leaped in my womb for joy .
NASB	Luke	1	45	And ( AZ ) blessed is she who [ aa ] believed that there would be a fulfillment of what had been spoken to her [ ab ] by the Lord. ” Mary ’ s Song : The Magnificat
NASB	Luke	1	46	And Mary said : “ ( BA ) My soul [ ac ] ( BB ) exalts the Lord ,
NASB	Luke	1	47	And ( BC ) my spirit has rejoiced in ( BD ) God my Savior .
NASB	Luke	1	48	For ( BE ) He has had regard for the humble state of His bond-servant ; For behold , from now on all generations will [ ad ] call me ( BF ) blessed .
NASB	Luke	1	49	For the Mighty One has done great things for me ; And holy is His name .
NASB	Luke	1	50	( BG ) And His mercy is to generation [ ae ] after generation Toward those who fear Him .
NASB	Luke	1	51	( BH ) He has done [ af ] mighty deeds with His arm ; He has scattered those who were proud in the [ ag ] thoughts of their hearts .
NASB	Luke	1	52	He has brought down rulers from their thrones , And has ( BI ) exalted those who were humble .
NASB	Luke	1	53	( BJ ) He has filled the hungry with good things , And sent the rich away empty-handed .
NASB	Luke	1	54	He has given help to His servant Israel , [ ah ] In remembrance of His mercy ,
NASB	Luke	1	55	( BK ) Just as He spoke to our fathers , ( BL ) To Abraham and his [ ai ] descendants forever. ”
NASB	Luke	1	56	Mary stayed with her about three months , and then returned to her home . John the Baptist Is Born
NASB	Luke	1	57	Now the time [ aj ] had come for Elizabeth to give birth , and she gave birth to a son .
NASB	Luke	1	58	Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had [ ak ] ( BM ) displayed His great mercy toward her ; and they were rejoicing with her .
NASB	Luke	1	59	And it happened that on ( BN ) the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they were going to call him Zechariah , [ al ] after his father .
NASB	Luke	1	60	And yet his mother responded and said , “ No indeed ; but ( BO ) he shall be called John. ”
NASB	Luke	1	61	And they said to her , “ There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name. ”
NASB	Luke	1	62	And they [ am ] ( BP ) made signs to his father , as to what he wanted him called .
NASB	Luke	1	63	And he asked for a tablet and wrote [ an ] as follows , “ ( BQ ) His name is John. ” And they were all amazed .
NASB	Luke	1	64	( BR ) And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue freed , and he began speaking in praise of God .
NASB	Luke	1	65	And fear came on all those who lived around them ; and all these matters were being talked about in ( BS ) the entire hill country of Judea .
NASB	Luke	1	66	All who heard them kept them in mind , saying , “ What then will this child turn out to be ? ” For indeed ( BT ) the hand of the Lord was with him . Zechariah ’ s Prophecy
NASB	Luke	1	67	And his father Zechariah ( BU ) was filled with the Holy Spirit and ( BV ) prophesied , saying :
NASB	Luke	1	68	“ ( BW ) Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , For He has visited us and accomplished ( BX ) redemption for His people ,
NASB	Luke	1	69	And has raised up a ( BY ) horn of salvation for us In the house of ( BZ ) His servant David—
NASB	Luke	1	70	( CA ) Just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets ( CB ) from ancient times—
NASB	Luke	1	71	[ ao ] ( CC ) Salvation ( CD ) from our enemies , And from the hand of all who hate us ;
NASB	Luke	1	72	( CE ) To show mercy to our fathers , ( CF ) And to remember His holy covenant ,
NASB	Luke	1	73	( CG ) The oath which He swore to our father Abraham ,
NASB	Luke	1	74	To grant us that we , being rescued from the hand of our enemies , Would serve Him without fear ,
NASB	Luke	1	75	( CH ) In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days .
NASB	Luke	1	76	And you , child , also will be called the ( CI ) prophet of ( CJ ) the Most High ; For you will go on ( CK ) before the Lord to ( CL ) prepare His ways ;
NASB	Luke	1	77	To give His people the knowledge of salvation [ ap ] By ( CM ) the forgiveness of their sins ,
NASB	Luke	1	78	Because of the tender mercy of our God , With which ( CN ) the Sunrise from on high will visit us ,
NASB	Luke	1	79	( CO ) To shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death , To guide our feet into the ( CP ) way of peace. ”
NASB	Luke	1	80	( CQ ) Now the child grew and was becoming strong in spirit , and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel .

NASB	Luke	2	9	And ( F ) an angel of the Lord suddenly ( G ) stood near them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them ; and they were terribly frightened .
NASB	Luke	2	10	And so the angel said to them , “ ( H ) Do not be afraid ; for behold , I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people ;
NASB	Luke	2	11	for today in the city of David there has been born for you a ( I ) Savior , who is [ h ] ( J ) Christ ( K ) the Lord .
NASB	Luke	2	12	And ( L ) this will be a sign for you : you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a [ i ] manger. ”
NASB	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly [ j ] army of angels praising God and saying ,
NASB	Luke	2	15	When the angels had departed from them into heaven , the shepherds began saying to one another , “ Let ’ s go straight to Bethlehem , then , and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has made known to us. ”
NASB	Luke	2	16	And they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph , and the baby as He lay in the [ l ] manger .
NASB	Luke	2	17	When they had seen Him , they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child .
NASB	Luke	2	18	And all who heard it were amazed about the things which were told them by the shepherds .
NASB	Luke	2	19	But Mary ( O ) treasured all these things , pondering them in her heart .
NASB	Luke	2	20	And the shepherds went back , ( P ) glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen , just as had been told them . Jesus Presented at the Temple
NASB	Luke	2	21	And when ( Q ) eight days were completed [ m ] so that it was time for His circumcision , ( R ) He was also named Jesus , the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb .
NASB	Luke	2	22	( S ) And when the days for [ n ] their purification according to the Law of Moses were completed , they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
NASB	Luke	2	23	( as it is written in the Law of the Lord : “ ( T ) Every firstborn male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ” ) ,
NASB	Luke	2	24	and to offer a sacrifice according to what has been stated in the Law of the Lord : “ ( U ) A pair of turtledoves or two young doves. ”
NASB	Luke	2	25	And there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon ; and this man was ( V ) righteous and devout , ( W ) looking forward to the consolation of Israel ; and the Holy Spirit was upon him .
NASB	Luke	2	26	And ( X ) it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not ( Y ) see death before he had seen the Lord ’ s [ o ] Christ .
NASB	Luke	2	27	And he came [ p ] by the Spirit into the temple ; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , [ q ] ( Z ) to carry out for Him the custom of the Law ,
NASB	Luke	2	28	then he took Him in his arms , and blessed God , and said ,
NASB	Luke	2	29	“ Now , Lord , You are letting Your bond-servant depart in peace , ( AA ) According to Your word ;
NASB	Luke	2	30	For my eyes have ( AB ) seen Your salvation ,
NASB	Luke	2	31	Which You have prepared in the presence of all the peoples :
NASB	Luke	2	32	( AC ) A light for revelation [ r ] for the Gentiles , And the glory of Your people Israel. ”
NASB	Luke	2	33	And His father and ( AD ) mother were amazed at the things which were being said about Him .
NASB	Luke	2	34	And Simeon blessed them and said to ( AE ) His mother Mary , “ Behold , this Child is appointed for ( AF ) the fall and [ s ] rise of many in Israel , and as a sign to be [ t ] opposed—
NASB	Luke	2	35	and a sword will pierce your own soul—to the end that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed. ”
NASB	Luke	2	36	And there was a ( AG ) prophetess , [ u ] Anna , the daughter of Phanuel , of ( AH ) the tribe of Asher . She was advanced in [ v ] years ( AI ) and had lived with her husband for seven years after her [ w ] marriage ,
NASB	Luke	2	37	and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four . She did not leave the temple grounds , serving night and day with ( AJ ) fasts and prayers .
NASB	Luke	2	38	And at that very [ x ] moment she came up and began giving thanks to God , and continued to speak about Him to all those who were ( AK ) looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem . Return to Nazareth
NASB	Luke	2	39	And when His parents had completed everything in accordance with the Law of the Lord , they returned to Galilee , to ( AL ) their own city of Nazareth .
NASB	Luke	2	40	( AM ) Now the Child continued to grow and to become strong , [ y ] increasing in wisdom ; and the favor of God was upon Him . Visit to Jerusalem
NASB	Luke	2	41	His parents went to Jerusalem every year at ( AN ) the Feast of the Passover .
NASB	Luke	2	42	And when He was twelve years old , they went up there according to the custom of the feast ;
NASB	Luke	2	43	and as they were returning , after spending the ( AO ) full number of days required , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem , but His parents were unaware of it .
NASB	Luke	2	44	Instead , they thought that He was somewhere in the caravan , and they went a day ’ s journey ; and then they began looking for Him among their relatives and acquaintances .
NASB	Luke	2	45	And when they did not find Him , they returned to Jerusalem , looking for Him .
NASB	Luke	2	46	Then , after three days they found Him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers , both listening to them and asking them questions .
NASB	Luke	2	47	And all who heard Him ( AP ) were amazed at His understanding and His answers .
NASB	Luke	2	48	When Joseph and Mary saw Him , they were bewildered ; and ( AQ ) His mother said to Him , “ Son , why have You treated us this way ? Behold , ( AR ) Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You ! ”
NASB	Luke	2	49	And He said to them , “ Why is it that you were looking for Me ? Did you not know that ( AS ) I had to be in My Father ’ s [ z ] house ? ”
NASB	Luke	2	50	And yet ( AT ) they on their part did not understand the statement which He had [ aa ] made to them .
NASB	Luke	2	51	And He went down with them and came to ( AU ) Nazareth , and He continued to be subject to them ; and ( AV ) His mother ( AW ) treasured all these [ ab ] things in her heart .
NASB	Luke	2	52	And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and [ ac ] stature , and in ( AX ) favor with God and people .

NASB	Luke	3	3	And he came into all ( F ) the region around the Jordan , preaching a baptism of repentance [ a ] for the forgiveness of sins ;
NASB	Luke	3	2	in the high priesthood of ( C ) Annas and ( D ) Caiaphas , ( E ) the word of God came to John , the son of Zechariah , in the wilderness .
NASB	Luke	3	4	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet : “ ( G ) The voice of one calling [ b ] out in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way of the Lord , Make His paths straight !
NASB	Luke	3	5	( H ) Every ravine will be filled , And every mountain and hill will be lowered ; The crooked will become straight , And the rough roads smooth ;
NASB	Luke	3	6	( I ) And all [ c ] flesh will ( J ) see the salvation of God ! ’ ”
NASB	Luke	3	7	So he was saying to the crowds who were going out to be baptized by him , “ ( K ) You [ d ] offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
NASB	Luke	3	8	Therefore produce fruits that are consistent with repentance , and ( L ) do not start saying [ e ] to yourselves , ‘ ( M ) We have Abraham as our father , ’ for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children for Abraham .
NASB	Luke	3	9	But indeed the axe is already being laid at the root of the trees ; so ( N ) every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. ”
NASB	Luke	3	10	And the crowds were questioning him , saying , “ ( O ) Then what are we to do ? ”
NASB	Luke	3	11	And he would answer and say to them , “ The one who has two [ f ] tunics is to ( P ) share with the one who has none ; and the one who has food is to do likewise. ”
NASB	Luke	3	12	Now even ( Q ) tax collectors came to be baptized , and they said to him , “ Teacher , what are we to do ? ”
NASB	Luke	3	13	And he said to them , “ [ g ] Collect no more than what you have been ordered to. ”
NASB	Luke	3	14	And soldiers also were questioning him , saying , “ What are we to do , we as well ? ” And he said to them , “ Do not extort money from anyone , nor [ h ] ( R ) harass anyone , and ( S ) be content with your wages. ”
NASB	Luke	3	15	Now while the people were in a state of expectation and they all were thinking carefully in their hearts about John , ( T ) whether he himself perhaps was the [ i ] Christ ,
NASB	Luke	3	16	( U ) John responded to them all , saying , “ As for me , I baptize you with water ; but He is coming who is mightier than I , and I am not fit to untie the straps of His sandals ; He will baptize you [ j ] with the Holy Spirit and fire .
NASB	Luke	3	17	His ( V ) winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor , and to gather the wheat into His barn ; but He will burn up the chaff with ( W ) unquenchable fire. ”
NASB	Luke	3	18	So with many other exhortations he preached the gospel to the people .
NASB	Luke	3	19	But when ( X ) Herod the tetrarch was reprimanded by him regarding ( Y ) Herodias , his brother ’ s wife , and regarding all the evil things which ( Z ) Herod had done ,
NASB	Luke	3	20	Herod also added this to them all : ( AA ) he locked John up in prison . Jesus Is Baptized
NASB	Luke	3	21	( AB ) Now when all the people were baptized , Jesus also was baptized , and while He was ( AC ) praying , heaven was opened ,
NASB	Luke	3	22	and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove , and a voice came from heaven : “ ( AD ) You are My beloved Son , in You I am well pleased. ” Genealogy of Jesus

NASB	Luke	4	7	Therefore if You [ d ] worship before me , it shall all be Yours. ”
NASB	Luke	4	8	Jesus replied to him , “ It is written : ‘ ( H ) You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him only. ’ ”
NASB	Luke	4	9	( I ) And he brought Him into Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to Him , “ If You are the Son of God , throw Yourself down from here ;

NASB	Luke	4	14	And ( M ) Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit , and ( N ) news about Him spread through all the surrounding region .
NASB	Luke	4	15	And He began ( O ) teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all .
NASB	Luke	4	16	And He came to ( P ) Nazareth , where He had been brought up ; and as was His custom , ( Q ) He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath , and ( R ) stood up to read .
NASB	Luke	4	17	And the scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to Him . And He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written :
NASB	Luke	4	18	“ ( S ) The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me , Because He anointed Me to bring good news to the poor . He has sent Me to proclaim release to captives , And recovery of sight to the blind , To set free those who are oppressed ,
NASB	Luke	4	19	( T ) To proclaim the favorable year of the Lord. ”
NASB	Luke	4	20	And He ( U ) rolled up the scroll , gave it back to the attendant , and ( V ) sat down ; and the eyes of all the people in the synagogue were intently directed at Him .
NASB	Luke	4	21	Now He began to say to them , “ Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your [ e ] hearing. ”
NASB	Luke	4	22	And all the people were [ f ] speaking well of Him , and admiring the [ g ] gracious words which were coming from His [ h ] lips ; and yet they were saying , “ ( W ) Is this not Joseph ’ s son ? ”
NASB	Luke	4	23	And He said to them , “ No doubt you will [ i ] quote this proverb to Me : ‘ Physician , heal yourself ! All the miracles that we heard were done ( X ) in Capernaum , do here in ( Y ) your hometown as well. ’ ”
NASB	Luke	4	24	But He said , “ Truly I say to you , ( Z ) no prophet is welcome in his hometown .
NASB	Luke	4	25	But I say to you in truth , there were many widows in Israel ( AA ) in the days of Elijah , when the sky was shut up for three years and six months , when a [ j ] severe famine came over all the land ;
NASB	Luke	4	26	and yet Elijah was sent to none of them , but only to [ k ] ( AB ) Zarephath , in the land of ( AC ) Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
NASB	Luke	4	27	And there were many with leprosy in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet ; and none of them was [ l ] cleansed , but only ( AD ) Naaman the Syrian. ”
NASB	Luke	4	28	And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things ;
NASB	Luke	4	29	and they got up and ( AE ) drove Him out of the city , and brought Him to the [ m ] crest of the hill on which their city had been built , so that they could throw Him down from the cliff .
NASB	Luke	4	30	But He ( AF ) passed through their midst and went on His way .
NASB	Luke	4	31	And ( AG ) He came down to ( AH ) Capernaum , a city of Galilee ; and He was teaching them on the Sabbath ;
NASB	Luke	4	32	and ( AI ) they were amazed at His teaching , because ( AJ ) His [ n ] message was delivered with authority .
NASB	Luke	4	33	In the synagogue there was a man [ o ] possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon , and he cried out with a loud voice ,
NASB	Luke	4	34	“ Leave us alone ! [ p ] ( AK ) What business do You have with us , Jesus [ q ] of ( AL ) Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are— ( AM ) the Holy One of God ! ”
NASB	Luke	4	35	But Jesus ( AN ) rebuked him , saying , “ Be quiet and come out of him ! ” And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst of the people , it came out of him without doing him any harm .
NASB	Luke	4	36	And amazement came upon them all , and they began talking with one another , saying , “ What is [ r ] this message ? For ( AO ) with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits , and they come out ! ”
NASB	Luke	4	37	And ( AP ) the news about Him was spreading into every locality of the surrounding region . Many Are Healed
NASB	Luke	4	38	( AQ ) Then He got up and left the synagogue , and entered Simon ’ s home . Now Simon ’ s mother-in-law was ( AR ) suffering from a high fever , and they asked Him [ s ] to help her .
NASB	Luke	4	39	And standing over her , He ( AS ) rebuked the fever , and it left her ; and she immediately got up and served them .
NASB	Luke	4	40	( AT ) Now while ( AU ) the sun was setting , all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him ; and He was ( AV ) laying His hands on each one of them and ( AW ) healing them .
NASB	Luke	4	41	Demons also were coming out of many , shouting , “ You are ( AX ) the Son of God ! ” And yet He was ( AY ) rebuking them and would ( AZ ) not allow them to speak , because they knew that He was the [ t ] Christ .
NASB	Luke	4	42	( BA ) Now when day came , Jesus left and went to a secluded place ; and the crowds were searching for Him , and they came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving them .
NASB	Luke	4	43	But He said to them , “ I must also preach the kingdom of God to the other cities , ( BB ) because I was sent for this purpose. ”
NASB	Luke	4	44	So He kept on preaching in the synagogues ( BC ) of [ u ] Judea . Footnotes - Luke 4:1 Or under the influence of ; lit in - Luke 4:5 Lit the inhabited earth - Luke 4:6 Lit their ( referring to the kingdoms in v

NASB	Luke	5	5	Simon responded and said , “ ( E ) Master , ( F ) we worked hard all night and caught nothing , but [ a ] I will do as You say and let down the nets. ”
NASB	Luke	5	2	and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake ; but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets .
NASB	Luke	5	3	And ( C ) He got into one of the boats , which was Simon ’ s , and asked him to put out a little distance from the land . And He sat down and continued teaching the crowds from the boat .
NASB	Luke	5	4	Now when He had finished speaking , He said to Simon , “ Put out into the deep water and ( D ) let down your nets for a catch. ”
NASB	Luke	5	6	And when they had done this , ( G ) they caught a great quantity of fish , and their nets began to tear ;
NASB	Luke	5	7	so they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . And they came and filled both of the boats , to the point that they were sinking .
NASB	Luke	5	8	But when Simon Peter saw this , he fell down at Jesus ’ knees , saying , “ Go away from me , Lord , for I am a sinful man ! ”
NASB	Luke	5	9	For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken ;
NASB	Luke	5	10	and likewise also were [ b ] James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , “ ( H ) Do not fear ; from now on you will be ( I ) catching people. ”
NASB	Luke	5	11	When they had brought their boats to land , ( J ) they left everything and followed Him . A Man with Leprosy Healed
NASB	Luke	5	12	( K ) While He was in one of the cities , behold , there was a man [ c ] covered with leprosy ; and when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face and begged Him , saying , “ Lord , if You are willing , You can make me clean. ”
NASB	Luke	5	13	And He reached out with His hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing ; be cleansed. ” And immediately the leprosy left him .
NASB	Luke	5	14	And He ordered him to tell no one , saying , “ But go and ( L ) show yourself to the priest , and make an offering for your cleansing , just as Moses commanded , as a testimony to them. ”
NASB	Luke	5	15	But ( M ) the news about Him was spreading even farther , and large crowds were gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses .
NASB	Luke	5	16	But Jesus Himself would often slip away [ d ] to the [ e ] wilderness and ( N ) pray . A Man Lowered Through a Roof
NASB	Luke	5	17	[ f ] One day He was teaching , and ( O ) there were some Pharisees and ( P ) teachers of the Law sitting there who had ( Q ) come from every village of Galilee and Judea , and from Jerusalem ; and ( R ) the power of the Lord was present for Him to perform healing .
NASB	Luke	5	18	( S ) And some men were carrying a man on a stretcher who was paralyzed ; and they were trying to bring him in and to set him down in front of Him .
NASB	Luke	5	19	But when they did not find any way to bring him in because of the crowd , they went up on ( T ) the roof and let him down ( U ) through the tiles with his stretcher , into the middle of the crowd , in front of Jesus .
NASB	Luke	5	20	And seeing their faith , He said , “ [ g ] Friend , ( V ) your sins are forgiven you. ”
NASB	Luke	5	21	The scribes and the Pharisees ( W ) began thinking of the implications , saying , “ ( X ) Who is this man who speaks blasphemies ? ( Y ) Who can forgive sins , except God alone ? ”
NASB	Luke	5	22	But Jesus , [ h ] aware of their thoughts , responded and said to them , “ Why are you thinking this way in your hearts ?
NASB	Luke	5	23	Which is easier , to say : ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
NASB	Luke	5	24	But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins , ” He said to the ( Z ) man who was paralyzed , “ I say to you , get up , and pick up your stretcher , and go home. ”
NASB	Luke	5	25	And immediately he got up before them , and picked up what he had been lying on , and went home ( AA ) glorifying God .
NASB	Luke	5	26	And [ i ] they were all struck with astonishment and began ( AB ) glorifying God . They were also filled ( AC ) with fear , saying , “ We have seen remarkable things today ! ” Call of Levi ( Matthew )
NASB	Luke	5	27	( AD ) After that He went out and looked at a tax collector named [ j ] ( AE ) Levi sitting in the tax office , and He said to him , “ Follow Me. ”
NASB	Luke	5	28	And he ( AF ) left everything behind , and got up and began following Him .
NASB	Luke	5	29	And ( AG ) Levi gave a big reception for Him in his house ; and there was a large crowd of ( AH ) tax collectors and other people who were reclining at the table with them .
NASB	Luke	5	30	( AI ) The Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling to His disciples , saying , “ Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and [ k ] sinners ? ”
NASB	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answered and said to them , “ ( AJ ) It is not those who are healthy who need a physician , but those who are sick .
NASB	Luke	5	32	I have not come to call the righteous to repentance , but sinners. ”
NASB	Luke	5	33	And they said to Him , “ ( AK ) The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers , the disciples of the Pharisees also do [ l ] the same , but Yours eat and drink. ”
NASB	Luke	5	34	And Jesus said to them , “ You can not make the [ m ] attendants of the groom fast while the groom is with them , can you ?
NASB	Luke	5	35	( AL ) But the days will come ; and when the groom is taken away from them , then they will fast in those days. ”
NASB	Luke	5	36	And He was also telling them a parable : “ No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment ; otherwise he will both tear the new , and the patch from the new garment will not match the old .

NASB	Luke	6	6	( F ) On another Sabbath He entered ( G ) the synagogue and taught ; and a man was there [ c ] whose right hand was withered .
NASB	Luke	6	2	But some of the Pharisees said , “ Why are you doing what ( C ) is not lawful on the Sabbath ? ”
NASB	Luke	6	3	And Jesus , answering them , said , “ Have you not even read ( D ) what David did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him ,
NASB	Luke	6	4	how he entered the house of God , and took and ate the [ b ] consecrated bread , which ( E ) is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests alone , and gave it to his companions ? ”
NASB	Luke	6	5	And He was saying to them , “ The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. ”
NASB	Luke	6	7	Now the scribes and the Pharisees ( H ) were watching Him [ d ] closely to see if He healed on the Sabbath , so that they might find a reason to accuse Him .
NASB	Luke	6	8	But He ( I ) knew [ e ] what they were thinking , and He said to the man with the withered hand , “ Get up and [ f ] come forward ! ” And he got up and [ g ] came forward .
NASB	Luke	6	9	And Jesus said to them , “ I ask you whether it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm , to save a life or to destroy it ? ”
NASB	Luke	6	10	And after ( J ) looking around at them all , He said to him , “ Stretch out your hand ! ” And he did so ; and his hand was restored .
NASB	Luke	6	11	But they themselves were filled with senseless rage , and began discussing together what they might do to Jesus . Choosing the Twelve
NASB	Luke	6	12	Now it was [ h ] at this time that He went off to ( K ) the mountain to ( L ) pray , and He spent the whole night in prayer with God .
NASB	Luke	6	13	And when day came , ( M ) He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them , whom He also named as ( N ) apostles :
NASB	Luke	6	14	Simon , whom He also named Peter , and his brother Andrew ; and [ i ] James and John ; and Philip and Bartholomew ;

NASB	Luke	6	17	And then Jesus ( P ) came down with them and stood on a level place ; and there was ( Q ) a large crowd of His disciples , and a great multitude of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem , and the coastal region of ( R ) Tyre and Sidon ,
NASB	Luke	6	18	who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases ; and those who were troubled by unclean spirits were being cured .
NASB	Luke	6	19	And all the [ j ] people were trying to ( S ) touch Him , because ( T ) power was coming from Him and healing them all . The Beatitudes
NASB	Luke	6	20	And He raised His eyes toward His disciples and began saying , “ ( U ) Blessed are [ k ] you who are poor , for ( V ) yours is the kingdom of God .
NASB	Luke	6	21	Blessed are [ l ] you who are hungry now , for you will be satisfied . Blessed are [ m ] you who weep now , for you will laugh .
NASB	Luke	6	22	( W ) Blessed are you when the people hate you , and when they [ n ] ( X ) exclude you , and insult you , and scorn your name as evil , on account of the Son of Man .
NASB	Luke	6	23	Rejoice on that day and ( Y ) jump for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven . For their fathers used to [ o ] treat the prophets ( Z ) the same way .
NASB	Luke	6	24	But woe to ( AA ) you who are rich , for ( AB ) you are receiving your comfort in full .
NASB	Luke	6	25	Woe to you who [ p ] are well-fed now , for you will be hungry . Woe to you who laugh now , for you will mourn and weep .
NASB	Luke	6	26	Woe to you when all the people speak well of you ; for their fathers used to [ q ] treat the ( AC ) false prophets the same way .
NASB	Luke	6	27	“ But I say to you who hear , ( AD ) love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
NASB	Luke	6	28	bless those who curse you , ( AE ) pray for those who are abusive to you .
NASB	Luke	6	29	( AF ) Whoever hits you on the cheek , offer him the other also ; and whoever takes away your [ r ] cloak , do not withhold your [ s ] tunic from him either .
NASB	Luke	6	30	Give to everyone who asks of you , and whoever takes away what is yours , do not demand it back .
NASB	Luke	6	31	[ t ] ( AG ) Treat people the same way you want them to [ u ] treat you .
NASB	Luke	6	32	( AH ) If you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners love those who love them .
NASB	Luke	6	33	And if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners do the same .
NASB	Luke	6	34	( AI ) And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount .
NASB	Luke	6	35	But ( AJ ) love your enemies and do good , and lend , expecting nothing in return ; and your reward will be great , and you will be ( AK ) sons of ( AL ) the Most High ; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil people .
NASB	Luke	6	36	[ v ] Be merciful , just as your Father is merciful .
NASB	Luke	6	37	“ ( AM ) Do not [ w ] judge , and you will not be judged ; and do not [ x ] condemn , and you will not be condemned ; [ y ] ( AN ) pardon , and you will be pardoned .
NASB	Luke	6	38	Give , and it will be given to you . They will [ z ] pour ( AO ) into your lap a ( AP ) good measure—pressed down , shaken together , and running over . For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return. ”
NASB	Luke	6	39	Now He also spoke a parable to them : “ ( AQ ) A person who is blind can not guide another who is blind , can he ? Will they not both fall into a pit ?
NASB	Luke	6	40	( AR ) A [ aa ] student is not above the teacher ; but everyone , when he has been fully trained , will be like his teacher .
NASB	Luke	6	41	Why do you look at the [ ab ] speck that is in your brother ’ s eye , but do not notice the log that is in your own eye ?
NASB	Luke	6	42	How can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me take out the [ ac ] speck that is in your eye , ’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye ? You hypocrite , first take the log out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take out the [ ad ] speck that is in your brother ’ s eye .
NASB	Luke	6	43	( AS ) For there is no good tree that bears bad fruit , nor , [ ae ] on the other hand , a bad tree that bears good fruit .
NASB	Luke	6	44	( AT ) For each tree is known by its own fruit . For people do not gather figs from thorns , nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush .
NASB	Luke	6	45	( AU ) The good person out of the good [ af ] treasure of his heart brings forth what is good ; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil ; ( AV ) for his mouth speaks from [ ag ] that which fills his heart . The Parable of the Builders
NASB	Luke	6	46	“ Now ( AW ) why do you call Me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ and do not do what I say ?
NASB	Luke	6	47	( AX ) Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and [ ah ] acts on them , I will show you whom he is like :
NASB	Luke	6	48	he is like a man building a house , who [ ai ] dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock ; and when there was a flood , the river burst against that house and yet it could not shake it , because it had been well built .
NASB	Luke	6	49	But the one who has heard and has not acted accordingly is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation ; and the river burst against it and it immediately collapsed , and the ruin of that house was great. ” Footnotes - Luke 6:1 Lit He - Luke 6:4 Lit loaves of presentation - Luke 6:6 Lit and his - Luke 6:7 Or maliciously - Luke 6:8 Lit their thoughts - Luke 6:8 Lit stand into the middle - Luke 6:8 Lit stood - Luke 6:12 Lit in these days - Luke 6:14 Or Jacob , also vv

NASB	Luke	7	7	for that reason I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You ; but just [ d ] say the word , and my servant [ e ] shall be healed .
NASB	Luke	7	2	Now a centurion ’ s slave , who was highly regarded by him , was sick and about to die .
NASB	Luke	7	3	When he heard about Jesus , ( C ) he sent some [ b ] Jewish elders to Him , asking Him to come and save the life of his slave .
NASB	Luke	7	4	When they came to Jesus , they strongly urged Him , saying , “ He is worthy for You to grant this to him ;
NASB	Luke	7	5	for he loves our nation , and it was he who built us our synagogue. ”
NASB	Luke	7	6	Now Jesus started on His way with them ; but already , when He was not yet far from the house , the centurion sent friends , saying to Him , “ [ c ] Lord , do not trouble Yourself further , for I am not worthy for You to enter under my roof ;
NASB	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man placed under authority , with soldiers under myself ; and I say to this one , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes , and to my slave , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he does it. ”
NASB	Luke	7	9	Now when Jesus heard this , He was amazed at him , and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him , “ I say to you , ( D ) not even in Israel have I found such great faith. ”
NASB	Luke	7	10	And when those who had been sent returned to the house , they found the slave in good health .
NASB	Luke	7	11	Soon afterward Jesus went to a city called Nain ; and His disciples were going along with Him , [ f ] accompanied by a large crowd .
NASB	Luke	7	12	Now as He approached the gate of the city , [ g ] a dead man was being carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow ; and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her .
NASB	Luke	7	13	When ( E ) the Lord saw her , He felt compassion for her and said to her , “ Do not go on weeping. ”
NASB	Luke	7	14	And He came up and touched the coffin ; and the bearers came to a halt . And He said , “ Young man , I say to you , arise ! ”
NASB	Luke	7	15	And the dead man sat up and began to speak . And Jesus gave him back to his mother .
NASB	Luke	7	16	( F ) Fear gripped them all , and they began ( G ) glorifying God , saying , “ A great ( H ) prophet has appeared among us ! ” and , “ God has [ h ] visited His people ! ”
NASB	Luke	7	17	( I ) And this report about Him spread throughout Judea and in all the surrounding region . The Messengers from John
NASB	Luke	7	18	( J ) The disciples of John also reported to him about all these things .
NASB	Luke	7	19	And after summoning [ i ] two of his disciples , John sent them to ( K ) the Lord , saying , “ Are You the Coming One , or are we to [ j ] look for another ? ”
NASB	Luke	7	20	When the men came to Him , they said , “ John the Baptist has sent us to You , [ k ] to ask , ‘ Are You the Coming One , or are we to [ l ] look for another ? ’ ”
NASB	Luke	7	21	At that very [ m ] time He ( L ) cured many people of diseases and ( M ) afflictions and evil spirits ; and He gave sight to many who were blind .
NASB	Luke	7	22	And He answered and said to them , “ Go and report to John what you have seen and heard : people who were ( N ) blind receive sight , people who limped walk , people with leprosy are cleansed and people who were deaf hear , dead people are raised up , and ( O ) people who are poor have the gospel preached to them .
NASB	Luke	7	23	And blessed is [ n ] anyone who does not take offense at Me. ”
NASB	Luke	7	24	When the messengers of John had left , He began to speak to the crowds about John : “ What did you go out into the [ o ] wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
NASB	Luke	7	25	[ p ] But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothing ? Those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are found in royal palaces !
NASB	Luke	7	26	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and one who is more than a prophet .
NASB	Luke	7	27	This is the one about whom it is written :
NASB	Luke	7	28	I say to you , among those born of women there is no one greater than John ; yet the one who is [ r ] least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. ”
NASB	Luke	7	29	When all the people and the tax collectors heard this , they acknowledged ( Q ) God ’ s justice , ( R ) having been baptized with ( S ) the baptism of John .
NASB	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the [ s ] ( T ) lawyers rejected God ’ s purpose for themselves , not having been baptized by [ t ] John .
NASB	Luke	7	31	“ To what then shall I compare the people of this generation , and what are they like ?
NASB	Luke	7	32	They are like children who sit in the marketplace and call to one another , and say , ‘ We played the flute for you , and you did not dance ; we sang a song of mourning , and you did not weep. ’
NASB	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist has come neither ( U ) eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon ! ’
NASB	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Behold , a gluttonous man and a [ u ] heavy drinker , a friend of tax collectors and [ v ] sinners ! ’
NASB	Luke	7	35	And yet wisdom ( V ) is vindicated by all her children. ” The Anointing in Galilee
NASB	Luke	7	36	Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to eat with him , and He entered the Pharisee ’ s house and reclined at the table .
NASB	Luke	7	37	( W ) And there was a woman in the city who was a [ w ] sinner ; and when she learned that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee ’ s house , she brought an alabaster vial of perfume ,
NASB	Luke	7	38	and standing behind Him at His feet , weeping , she began to wet His feet with her tears , and she wiped them with the hair of her head , and began kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume .
NASB	Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this , he said to himself , “ If this man were ( X ) a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him , that she is a [ x ] sinner ! ” Parable of Two Debtors
NASB	Luke	7	40	And Jesus responded and said to him , “ Simon , I have something to say to you. ” And he [ y ] replied , “ Say it , Teacher. ”
NASB	Luke	7	41	“ A moneylender had two debtors : the one owed five hundred [ z ] ( Y ) denarii , and the other , fifty .
NASB	Luke	7	42	When they ( Z ) were unable to repay , he canceled the debts of both . So which of them will love him more ? ”
NASB	Luke	7	43	Simon answered and said , “ I assume the one for whom he canceled the greater debt. ” And He said to him , “ You have judged correctly. ”
NASB	Luke	7	44	And turning toward the woman , He said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I entered your house ; you ( AA ) gave Me no water for My feet , but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
NASB	Luke	7	45	You [ aa ] ( AB ) gave Me no kiss ; but she has not stopped kissing My feet since the time I came in .
NASB	Luke	7	46	( AC ) You did not [ ab ] anoint My head with oil , but she anointed My feet with perfume .
NASB	Luke	7	47	For this reason I say to you , her sins , which are many , have been forgiven , for she loved much ; but the one who is forgiven little , loves little. ”
NASB	Luke	7	48	And He said to her , “ ( AD ) Your sins have been forgiven. ”
NASB	Luke	7	49	And then those who were reclining at the table with Him began saying [ ac ] to themselves , “ ( AE ) Who is this man who even forgives sins ? ”
NASB	Luke	7	50	And He said to the woman , “ ( AF ) Your faith has saved you ; ( AG ) go in peace. ” Footnotes - Luke 7:1 Lit words - Luke 7:3 Lit elders of the Jews - Luke 7:6 Or Sir - Luke 7:7 Lit say with a word - Luke 7:7 A command in Greek - Luke 7:11 Lit and a - Luke 7:12 Lit one who had died - Luke 7:16 Or cared for - Luke 7:19 Lit a certain two - Luke 7:19 Or wait for - Luke 7:20 Lit saying - Luke 7:20 Or wait for - Luke 7:21 Lit hour - Luke 7:23 Lit whoever - Luke 7:24 I.e. , desert - Luke 7:25 Or Well then , what - Luke 7:27 Lit before Your face - Luke 7:28 Or less - Luke 7:30 I.e. , experts in the Mosaic Law - Luke 7:30 Lit him - Luke 7:34 Or wine drinker - Luke 7:34 I.e. , irreligious Jews - Luke 7:37 I.e. , an immoral woman - Luke 7:39 I.e. , an immoral woman - Luke 7:40 Lit says - Luke 7:41 The denarius was a day ’ s wages for a laborer - Luke 7:45 A customary form of greeting between rabbis - Luke 7:46 A customary act of hospitality - Luke 7:49 Or among New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Luke	8	8	And yet other seed fell into the good soil , and grew up , and produced a crop a hundred times as much. ” As He said these things , He would call out , “ ( G ) The one who has ears to hear , [ b ] let him hear. ”
NASB	Luke	8	2	and also ( B ) some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses : ( C ) Mary who was called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out ,
NASB	Luke	8	3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza , ( D ) Herod ’ s ( E ) steward , and Susanna , and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means . Parable of the Sower
NASB	Luke	8	4	( F ) Now when a large crowd was coming together , and those from the various cities were journeying to Him , He spoke by way of a parable :
NASB	Luke	8	5	“ The sower went out to sow his seed ; and as he sowed , some fell beside the road , and it was trampled underfoot , and the birds of the sky ate it up .
NASB	Luke	8	6	Other seed fell on rocky soil , and when it came up , it withered away because it had no moisture .
NASB	Luke	8	7	Other seed fell among the thorns ; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out .
NASB	Luke	8	9	( H ) Now His disciples began asking Him what this parable [ c ] meant .
NASB	Luke	8	10	And He said , “ ( I ) To you it has been granted to know the [ d ] mysteries of the kingdom of God , but to the rest they are told in parables , so that [ e ] ( J ) while seeing they may not see , and [ f ] while hearing they may not understand .
NASB	Luke	8	11	“ Now this is the parable : ( K ) the seed is the word of God .
NASB	Luke	8	12	And those beside the road are the ones who have heard , then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart , so that they will not believe and be saved .
NASB	Luke	8	13	Those on the rocky soil are the ones who , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and yet these do not have a firm root ; [ g ] they believe for a while , and in a time of temptation they [ h ] fall away .
NASB	Luke	8	14	And the seed which fell among the thorns , these are the ones who have heard , and as they go on their way they are choked by worries , riches , and pleasures of this life , and they bring no fruit to maturity .
NASB	Luke	8	15	But the seed in the good soil , these are the ones who have heard the word [ i ] with a good and virtuous heart , and hold it firmly , and produce fruit with [ j ] perseverance . Parable of the Lamp
NASB	Luke	8	16	“ Now ( L ) no one lights a lamp and covers it over with a container , or puts it under a bed ; but he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light .
NASB	Luke	8	17	( M ) For nothing is concealed that will not become evident , nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light .
NASB	Luke	8	18	So take care how you listen ; ( N ) for whoever has , to him more will be given ; and whoever does not have , even what he [ k ] thinks he has will be taken away from him. ”
NASB	Luke	8	19	( O ) Now His mother and brothers came to Him , and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd .
NASB	Luke	8	20	And it was reported to Him , “ Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , wishing to see You. ”
NASB	Luke	8	21	But He answered and said to them , “ My mother and My brothers are these ( P ) who hear the word of God and do it. ” Jesus Stills the Sea
NASB	Luke	8	22	( Q ) Now on one of those days [ l ] Jesus and His disciples got into a boat , and He said to them , “ Let ’ s cross over to the other side of ( R ) the lake. ” So they launched out .
NASB	Luke	8	23	But as they were sailing along He fell asleep ; and a fierce gale of wind descended on ( S ) the lake , and they began to be swamped and to be in danger .
NASB	Luke	8	24	They came up to Jesus and woke Him , saying , “ ( T ) Master , Master , we are perishing ! ” And He got up and ( U ) rebuked the wind and the surging [ m ] waves , and they stopped , and [ n ] it became calm .
NASB	Luke	8	25	And He said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” But they were fearful and amazed , saying to one another , “ Who then is this , that He commands even the winds and the water , and they obey Him ? ” The Demon-possessed Man Cured
NASB	Luke	8	26	( V ) Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
NASB	Luke	8	27	And when He stepped out onto the land , a man from the city met Him who was possessed with demons ; and he had not put on clothing for a long time and was not living in a house , but among the tombs .
NASB	Luke	8	28	And seeing Jesus , he cried out and fell down before Him , and said with a loud voice , “ [ o ] ( W ) What business do You have with me , Jesus , Son of ( X ) the Most High God ? I beg You , do not torment me ! ”
NASB	Luke	8	29	For He had already commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For it had seized him many times ; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard , and yet he would break the restraints and be driven by the demon into the desert .
NASB	Luke	8	30	And Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ ( Y ) Legion ” ; because many demons had entered him .
NASB	Luke	8	31	And they were begging Him not to command them to go away into ( Z ) the abyss .
NASB	Luke	8	32	Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding there on the mountain ; and the demons begged Him to permit them to enter [ p ] the pigs . And He gave them permission .
NASB	Luke	8	33	And the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs ; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into ( AA ) the lake and was drowned .
NASB	Luke	8	34	Now when the herdsmen saw what had happened , they ran away and reported everything in the city , and in the country .
NASB	Luke	8	35	And the people came out to see what had happened ; and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting down ( AB ) at the feet of Jesus , clothed and in his right mind ; and they became frightened .
NASB	Luke	8	36	Those who had seen everything reported to them how the man who had been ( AC ) demon-possessed had been [ q ] made well .
NASB	Luke	8	37	And all the [ r ] people of the territory of the Gerasenes and the surrounding region asked Him to leave them , because they were overwhelmed by great fear ; and He got into a boat and returned .
NASB	Luke	8	38	( AD ) But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might [ s ] accompany Him ; but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
NASB	Luke	8	39	“ Return to your home and describe what great things God has done for you. ” So he went away , proclaiming throughout the city what great things Jesus had done for him . Miracles of Healing
NASB	Luke	8	40	( AE ) And as Jesus was returning , the [ t ] people welcomed Him , for they had all been waiting for Him .
NASB	Luke	8	41	( AF ) And a man named Jairus came , and he was an [ u ] ( AG ) official of the synagogue ; and he fell at Jesus ’ feet , and began urging Him to come to his house ;
NASB	Luke	8	42	for he had an only daughter , about twelve years old , and she was dying . But as He went , the crowds were pressing against Him .
NASB	Luke	8	43	And a woman who had suffered a chronic flow of blood for twelve years , and could not be healed by anyone ,
NASB	Luke	8	44	came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His [ v ] cloak , and immediately her bleeding stopped .
NASB	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , “ Who is the one who touched Me ? ” And while they were all denying it , Peter said , “ ( AH ) Master , the [ w ] people are crowding and pressing in on You. ”
NASB	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone did touch Me , for I was aware that ( AI ) power had left Me. ”
NASB	Luke	8	47	Now when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice , she came trembling and fell down before Him , and admitted in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him , and how she had been immediately healed .
NASB	Luke	8	48	And He said to her , “ Daughter , ( AJ ) your faith has [ x ] made you well ; ( AK ) go in peace. ”
NASB	Luke	8	49	While He was still speaking , someone * came from the house of ( AL ) the synagogue official , saying , “ Your daughter has died ; do not trouble the Teacher anymore. ”
NASB	Luke	8	50	But when Jesus heard this , He responded to him , “ ( AM ) Do not be afraid any longer ; only believe , and she will be [ y ] made well. ”
NASB	Luke	8	51	When He came to the house , He did not allow anyone to enter with Him except Peter , John , and James , and the girl ’ s father and mother .
NASB	Luke	8	52	Now they were all weeping and ( AN ) mourning for her ; but He said , “ Stop weeping , for she has not died , but ( AO ) is asleep. ”
NASB	Luke	8	53	And they began laughing at Him , knowing that she had died .

NASB	Luke	9	9	Herod said , “ I myself had John beheaded ; but who is this man about whom I hear such things ? ” And ( K ) he kept trying to see Him .
NASB	Luke	9	2	And He sent them out to ( B ) proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing .
NASB	Luke	9	3	And He said to them , “ ( C ) Take nothing for your journey , ( D ) neither a staff , nor a [ a ] bag , nor bread , nor money ; and do not even have two [ b ] tunics .
NASB	Luke	9	4	And whatever house you enter , stay there [ c ] until you leave that city .
NASB	Luke	9	5	And as for all who do not receive you , when you leave that city , ( E ) shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them. ”
NASB	Luke	9	6	And as they were leaving , they began going [ d ] throughout the villages , ( F ) preaching the gospel and healing everywhere .
NASB	Luke	9	7	( G ) Now ( H ) Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening ; and he was greatly perplexed , because it was said by some that ( I ) John had risen from the dead ,
NASB	Luke	9	8	and by some that ( J ) Elijah had appeared , and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen .
NASB	Luke	9	10	( L ) When the apostles returned , they gave an account to Him of all that they had done . ( M ) And taking them with Him , He withdrew privately to a city called ( N ) Bethsaida .
NASB	Luke	9	11	But the crowds were aware of this and followed Him ; and He welcomed them and began speaking to them about the kingdom of God , and curing those who had need of healing . Five Thousand Men Fed
NASB	Luke	9	12	Now the day [ e ] was ending , and the twelve came up and said to Him , “ Dismiss the crowd , so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get [ f ] something to eat ; because here , we are in a secluded place. ”
NASB	Luke	9	13	But He said to them , “ You give them something to eat ! ” But they said , “ We have no more than five loaves and two fish , unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people. ”
NASB	Luke	9	14	( For there were about five thousand men . ) But He said to His disciples , “ Have them recline to eat ( O ) in groups of about fifty each. ”
NASB	Luke	9	15	They did so , and had them all recline .
NASB	Luke	9	16	And He took the five loaves and the two fish , and , looking up to heaven , He blessed them and broke them , and gave them to the disciples again and again , to serve the crowd .
NASB	Luke	9	17	And they all ate and were satisfied ; and [ g ] the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up , twelve ( P ) baskets full . Peter Says Jesus is The Christ
NASB	Luke	9	18	( Q ) And it happened that while He was ( R ) praying alone , the disciples were with Him , and He questioned them , saying , “ Who do the [ h ] people say that I am ? ”
NASB	Luke	9	19	They answered and said , “ John the Baptist , and others say Elijah ; but others , that one of the prophets of old has risen. ”
NASB	Luke	9	20	And He said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” And Peter answered and said , “ ( S ) The [ i ] Christ of God. ”
NASB	Luke	9	21	But He [ j ] ( T ) warned them and instructed them not to tell this to anyone ,
NASB	Luke	9	22	( U ) saying , “ ( V ) The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed and be raised on the third day. ”
NASB	Luke	9	23	And He was saying to them all , “ ( W ) If anyone wants to come after Me , he must deny himself , take up his cross daily , and follow Me .
NASB	Luke	9	24	For ( X ) whoever wants to save his [ k ] life will lose it , but whoever loses his [ l ] life for My sake , this is the one who will save it .
NASB	Luke	9	25	For what good does it do a person if he gains the whole world , but ( Y ) loses or forfeits himself ?
NASB	Luke	9	26	( Z ) For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words , the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels .
NASB	Luke	9	27	But I say to you truthfully , ( AA ) there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God. ” The Transfiguration
NASB	Luke	9	28	( AB ) About eight days after these sayings , He took along ( AC ) Peter , John , and James , and ( AD ) went up on the mountain ( AE ) to pray .
NASB	Luke	9	29	And while He was ( AF ) praying , the appearance of His face ( AG ) became different , and His clothing became white and [ m ] gleaming .
NASB	Luke	9	30	And behold , two men were talking with Him ; and they were Moses and Elijah ,
NASB	Luke	9	31	who , appearing in [ n ] glory , were speaking of His ( AH ) departure , which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem .
NASB	Luke	9	32	Now Peter and his companions ( AI ) had been overcome with sleep ; but when they were fully awake , they saw His glory and the two men who were standing with Him .
NASB	Luke	9	33	And as [ o ] these two men were leaving Him , Peter said to Jesus , “ ( AJ ) Master , it is good that we are here ; and ( AK ) let ’ s make three [ p ] tabernacles : one for You , one for Moses , and one for Elijah ” — ( AL ) not realizing what he was saying .
NASB	Luke	9	34	But while he was saying this , a cloud [ q ] formed and began to overshadow them ; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud .
NASB	Luke	9	35	And then ( AM ) a voice came from the cloud , saying , “ ( AN ) This is My Son , My Chosen One ; listen to Him ! ”
NASB	Luke	9	36	And when the voice [ r ] had spoken , Jesus was found alone . And ( AO ) they kept silent , and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen .
NASB	Luke	9	37	( AP ) On the next day , when they came down from the mountain , a large crowd met Him .
NASB	Luke	9	38	And a man from the crowd shouted , saying , “ Teacher , I beg You to look at my son , because he is my only son ,
NASB	Luke	9	39	and a spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams , and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming at the mouth ; and only with difficulty does it leave him , mauling him as it leaves .
NASB	Luke	9	40	And I begged Your disciples to cast it out , and they could not. ”
NASB	Luke	9	41	And Jesus answered and said , “ You unbelieving and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here. ”
NASB	Luke	9	42	Now while he was still approaching , the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into a convulsion . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy and gave him back to his father .
NASB	Luke	9	43	And they were all amazed at the [ s ] ( AQ ) greatness of God . ( AR ) But while everyone was astonished at all that He was doing , He said to His disciples ,
NASB	Luke	9	44	“ As for you , let these words sink into your ears : ( AS ) for the Son of Man is going to be [ t ] handed over to men. ”
NASB	Luke	9	45	But ( AT ) they [ u ] did not understand this statement , and it was concealed from them so that they would not comprehend it ; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement . The Test of Greatness
NASB	Luke	9	46	( AU ) Now an argument [ v ] started among them as to which of them might be the greatest .
NASB	Luke	9	47	But Jesus , ( AV ) knowing [ w ] what they were thinking in their hearts , took a child and had him stand by His side ,
NASB	Luke	9	48	and He said to them , “ ( AW ) Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me , and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me ; ( AX ) for the one who is least among all of you , this is the one who is great. ”
NASB	Luke	9	49	( AY ) John answered and said , “ ( AZ ) Master , we saw someone casting out demons in Your name ; and we tried to prevent him , because he does not follow along with us. ”
NASB	Luke	9	50	But Jesus said to him , “ Do not hinder him ; ( BA ) for the one who is not against you is [ x ] for you. ”
NASB	Luke	9	51	When the days were approaching for ( BB ) His [ y ] ascension , He [ z ] was determined ( BC ) to go to Jerusalem ;
NASB	Luke	9	52	and He sent messengers on ahead of Him , and they went and entered a village of the ( BD ) Samaritans to [ aa ] make arrangements for Him .
NASB	Luke	9	53	And they did not receive Him , ( BE ) because [ ab ] He was traveling toward Jerusalem .
NASB	Luke	9	54	When His disciples ( BF ) James and John saw this , they said , “ Lord , do You want us to ( BG ) command fire to come down from heaven and consume them ? ”
NASB	Luke	9	55	But He turned and rebuked them . [ ac ]
NASB	Luke	9	56	And they went on to another village . Exacting Discipleship
NASB	Luke	9	57	( BH ) As they were going on the road , ( BI ) someone said to Him , “ I will follow You wherever You go. ”
NASB	Luke	9	58	And Jesus said to him , “ The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests , but ( BJ ) the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head. ”
NASB	Luke	9	59	And He said to another , “ ( BK ) Follow Me. ” But he said , “ Lord , permit me first to go and bury my father. ”
NASB	Luke	9	60	But He said to him , “ Allow the dead to bury their own dead ; but as for you , go and ( BL ) proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God. ”
NASB	Luke	9	61	Another also said , “ I will follow You , Lord ; but ( BM ) first permit me to say goodbye to those at my home. ”
NASB	Luke	9	62	But Jesus said to him , “ ( BN ) No one , after putting his hand to the plow and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God. ” Footnotes - Luke 9:3 Or knapsack - Luke 9:3 A long shirt worn next to the skin - Luke 9:4 Lit and leave from there - Luke 9:6 Or from village to village - Luke 9:12 Lit began to decline - Luke 9:12 Lit provisions - Luke 9:17 Lit what was left over to them of the broken pieces was - Luke 9:18 Lit crowds - Luke 9:20 I.e. , Messiah - Luke 9:21 Or strictly admonished - Luke 9:24 Or soul - Luke 9:24 Or soul - Luke 9:29 Or flashing like lightning - Luke 9:31 Or splendor - Luke 9:33 Lit they - Luke 9:33 Or sacred tents - Luke 9:34 Lit occurred - Luke 9:36 Lit occurred - Luke 9:43 Or majesty - Luke 9:44 Or betrayed - Luke 9:45 Lit were not knowing - Luke 9:46 Lit entered - Luke 9:47 Lit the reasoning ; or argument - Luke 9:50 Or on your side - Luke 9:51 Lit taking up - Luke 9:51 Lit set His face - Luke 9:52 Or prepare - Luke 9:53 Lit His face was proceeding toward - Luke 9:55 Some late mss add : and said , “ You do not know of what kind of spirit you are ; for the Son of Man did not come to destroy people ’ s lives , but to save them. ” New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Luke	10	10	But whatever city you enter and they do not receive you , go out into its streets and say ,
NASB	Luke	10	2	And He was saying to them , “ ( D ) The harvest is plentiful , but the laborers are few ; therefore plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest .
NASB	Luke	10	3	Go ; ( E ) behold , I am sending you out like lambs in the midst of wolves .
NASB	Luke	10	4	( F ) Carry no money belt , no [ b ] bag , no sandals , and greet no one along the way .
NASB	Luke	10	5	And whatever house you enter , first say , ‘ Peace be to this house. ’
NASB	Luke	10	6	And if a [ c ] man of peace is there , your peace will rest upon him ; but if not , it will return to you .
NASB	Luke	10	7	Stay in [ d ] that house , eating and drinking [ e ] what they provide ; for ( G ) the laborer is deserving of his wages . Do not move from house to house .
NASB	Luke	10	8	Whatever city you enter and they receive you , ( H ) eat what is served to you ;
NASB	Luke	10	9	and heal those in it who are sick , and say to them , ‘ ( I ) The kingdom of God has come near to you. ’
NASB	Luke	10	11	‘ ( J ) Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you ; yet [ f ] be sure of this , that ( K ) the kingdom of God has come near. ’
NASB	Luke	10	12	I say to you , ( L ) it will be more tolerable on that day for ( M ) Sodom than for that city .
NASB	Luke	10	13	“ ( N ) Woe to you , ( O ) Chorazin ! Woe to you , ( P ) Bethsaida ! For if the [ g ] miracles that occurred in you had occurred in ( Q ) Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago , sitting in [ h ] ( R ) sackcloth and ashes .
NASB	Luke	10	14	But it will be more tolerable for ( S ) Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you .
NASB	Luke	10	15	And you , ( T ) Capernaum , will not be exalted to heaven , will you ? You will be brought down to Hades !
NASB	Luke	10	16	“ ( U ) The one who listens to you listens to Me , and ( V ) the one who rejects you rejects Me ; but the one who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me. ” The Joyful Results
NASB	Luke	10	17	Now the [ i ] seventy-two returned with joy , saying , “ Lord , even ( W ) the demons are subject to us [ j ] in Your name ! ”
NASB	Luke	10	18	And He said to them , “ I watched ( X ) Satan fall from heaven like lightning .
NASB	Luke	10	19	Behold , I have given you authority to ( Y ) walk on snakes and scorpions , and authority over all the power of the enemy , and nothing will injure you .
NASB	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless , do not [ k ] rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that ( Z ) your names are recorded in heaven. ”
NASB	Luke	10	21	( AA ) At that very [ l ] time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit , and said , “ I [ m ] praise You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants . Yes , Father , for doing so was well pleasing in Your sight .
NASB	Luke	10	22	( AB ) All things have been handed over to Me by My Father , and ( AC ) no one knows who the Son is except the Father , and who the Father is except the Son , and anyone to whom the Son determines to reveal Him. ”
NASB	Luke	10	23	( AD ) Turning to the disciples , He said privately , “ Blessed are the eyes that see the things you see ;
NASB	Luke	10	24	for I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see the things that you see , and did not see them , and to hear the things that you hear , and did not hear them. ”
NASB	Luke	10	25	( AE ) And behold , a [ n ] ( AF ) lawyer stood up and put Him to the test , saying , “ Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
NASB	Luke	10	26	And He said to him , “ What is written in the Law ? [ o ] How does it read to you ? ”
NASB	Luke	10	27	And he answered , “ ( AG ) You shall love the Lord your God [ p ] with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your strength , and with all your mind ; and your neighbor as yourself. ”
NASB	Luke	10	28	And He said to him , “ You have answered correctly ; ( AH ) do this and you will live. ”
NASB	Luke	10	29	But wanting ( AI ) to justify himself , he said to Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ” The Good Samaritan
NASB	Luke	10	30	Jesus replied and said , “ A man was ( AJ ) going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he encountered robbers , and they stripped him and [ q ] beat him , and went away leaving him half dead .
NASB	Luke	10	31	And by coincidence a priest was going down on that road , and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
NASB	Luke	10	32	Likewise a Levite also , when he came to the place and saw him , passed by on the other side .
NASB	Luke	10	33	But a ( AK ) Samaritan who was on a journey came upon him ; and when he saw him , he felt compassion ,
NASB	Luke	10	34	and came to him and bandaged up his wounds , pouring oil and wine on them ; and he put him on his own animal , and brought him to an inn and took care of him .
NASB	Luke	10	35	On the next day he took out two [ r ] denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said , ‘ Take care of him ; and whatever more you spend , when I return , I will repay you. ’
NASB	Luke	10	36	Which of these three do you think [ s ] proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers ’ hands ? ”
NASB	Luke	10	37	And he said , “ The one who showed compassion to him. ” Then Jesus said to him , “ Go and do [ t ] the same. ” Martha and Mary
NASB	Luke	10	38	Now as they were traveling along , He entered a village ; and a woman named ( AL ) Martha welcomed Him into her home .
NASB	Luke	10	39	And she had a sister called ( AM ) Mary , who was also ( AN ) seated at the Lord ’ s feet , and was listening to His word .
NASB	Luke	10	40	But ( AO ) Martha was distracted with [ u ] all her preparations ; and she came up to Him and said , “ Lord , do You not care that my sister has left me to do the serving [ v ] by myself ? Then tell her to help me. ”
NASB	Luke	10	41	But the Lord answered and said to her , “ ( AP ) Martha , Martha , you are ( AQ ) worried and distracted by many things ;
NASB	Luke	10	42	( AR ) but only one thing is necessary ; for ( AS ) Mary has chosen the good part , which shall not be taken away from her. ” Footnotes - Luke 10:1 One early ms seventy - Luke 10:4 Or knapsack - Luke 10:6 Lit son of - Luke 10:7 Lit the house itself - Luke 10:7 Lit the things from them - Luke 10:11 Lit know - Luke 10:13 Or works of power - Luke 10:13 I.e. , symbols of mourning - Luke 10:17 One early ms seventy - Luke 10:17 Or by - Luke 10:20 Or go on rejoicing - Luke 10:21 Lit hour - Luke 10:21 Or acknowledge to You - Luke 10:25 I.e. , an expert in the Mosaic Law - Luke 10:26 Lit How do you read ? - Luke 10:27 Lit from all - Luke 10:30 Lit laid blows upon - Luke 10:35 The denarius was a day ’ s wages for a laborer - Luke 10:36 Lit has proved - Luke 10:37 Or likewise - Luke 10:40 Lit much service - Luke 10:40 Lit alone New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Luke	11	11	Now [ l ] which one of you fathers will his son ask for a [ m ] fish , and instead of a fish , he will give him a snake ?
NASB	Luke	11	2	And He said to them , “ ( A ) When you pray , say : ‘ [ b ] Father , [ c ] hallowed be Your name . [ d ] Your kingdom come .
NASB	Luke	11	3	Give us ( B ) each day our [ e ] daily bread .
NASB	Luke	11	4	And forgive us our sins , For we ourselves also forgive everyone who ( C ) is indebted to us . And do not lead us into temptation. ’ ”
NASB	Luke	11	5	And He said to them , “ [ f ] Suppose one of you has a friend , and goes to him at midnight and says to him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves ,
NASB	Luke	11	6	because a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to serve him ’ ;
NASB	Luke	11	7	and from inside he answers and says , ‘ Do not bother me ; the door has already been shut and my children [ g ] and I are in bed ; I can not get up and give you anything. ’
NASB	Luke	11	8	I tell you , even if he will not get up and give him anything just because he is his friend , yet ( D ) because of his [ h ] shamelessness he will get up and give him as much as he needs .
NASB	Luke	11	9	“ So I say to you , [ i ] ( E ) ask , and it will be given to you ; [ j ] seek , and you will find ; [ k ] knock , and it will be opened to you .
NASB	Luke	11	10	For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks , it will be opened .
NASB	Luke	11	12	Or he will even ask for an egg , and his father will give him a scorpion ?
NASB	Luke	11	13	So ( F ) if you , despite being [ n ] evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will [ o ] your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him ? ” Pharisees ’ Blasphemy
NASB	Luke	11	14	( G ) And He was casting out a mute demon ; when the demon had gone out , the man who was previously unable to speak talked , and the crowds were amazed .
NASB	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , “ He casts out the demons ( H ) by ( I ) Beelzebul , the ruler of the demons. ”
NASB	Luke	11	16	Others , [ p ] to test Him , ( J ) were demanding of Him a [ q ] sign from heaven .
NASB	Luke	11	17	( K ) But He knew their thoughts and said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste ; and a house divided against [ r ] itself falls .
NASB	Luke	11	18	And if ( L ) Satan also has been divided against himself , how will his kingdom [ s ] stand ? For you claim that I cast out the demons by ( M ) Beelzebul .
NASB	Luke	11	19	Yet if by ( N ) Beelzebul I cast out the demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore , they will be your judges .
NASB	Luke	11	20	But if I cast out the demons by [ t ] the ( O ) finger of God , then ( P ) the kingdom of God has come upon you .
NASB	Luke	11	21	When [ u ] a strong man , fully armed , guards his own house , his possessions are [ v ] secure .
NASB	Luke	11	22	But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him , that man takes away his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder .
NASB	Luke	11	23	( Q ) The one who is not with Me is against Me ; and the one who does not gather with Me scatters .
NASB	Luke	11	24	“ ( R ) When the unclean spirit comes out of [ w ] a person , it passes through waterless places seeking rest , and not finding any , it then says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came. ’
NASB	Luke	11	25	And when it comes , it finds it swept and put in order .
NASB	Luke	11	26	Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they come in and live there ; and the last condition of that person becomes worse than the first. ”
NASB	Luke	11	27	While [ x ] Jesus was saying these things , one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him , “ ( S ) Blessed is the womb that carried You , and the breasts at which You nursed ! ”
NASB	Luke	11	28	But He said , “ On the contrary , blessed are ( T ) those who hear the word of God and follow it. ” The Sign of Jonah
NASB	Luke	11	29	Now as the crowds were increasing , He began to say , “ ( U ) This generation is a wicked generation ; it ( V ) demands a [ y ] sign , and so no [ z ] sign will be given to it except the [ aa ] sign of Jonah .
NASB	Luke	11	30	For just as ( W ) Jonah became a [ ab ] sign to the Ninevites , so will the Son of Man be to this generation .
NASB	Luke	11	31	The ( X ) Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation at the judgment and condemn them , because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , something greater than Solomon is here .
NASB	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it , because ( Y ) they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , something greater than Jonah is here .
NASB	Luke	11	33	“ ( Z ) No one lights a lamp and puts it away in a cellar nor under a basket , but on the lampstand , so that those who enter may see the light .
NASB	Luke	11	34	( AA ) Your eye is the lamp of your body ; when your eye is [ ac ] clear , your whole body also is full of light ; but when it is [ ad ] bad , your body also is full of darkness .
NASB	Luke	11	35	So watch out that the light in you is not darkness .
NASB	Luke	11	36	Therefore if your whole body is full of light , without any dark part , it will be wholly illuminated , as when the lamp illuminates you with its light. ” Woes upon the Pharisees
NASB	Luke	11	37	Now when He had spoken , a Pharisee * asked Him to have lunch with him ; and He went in and reclined at the table .
NASB	Luke	11	38	When the Pharisee saw this , he was surprised that Jesus had not first [ ae ] ( AB ) ceremonially washed before the [ af ] meal .
NASB	Luke	11	39	But ( AC ) the Lord said to him , “ Now ( AD ) you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish ; but your inside is full of greed and wickedness .
NASB	Luke	11	40	( AE ) You foolish ones , did He who made the outside not make the inside also ?
NASB	Luke	11	41	But ( AF ) give that which is within as a charitable gift , and [ ag ] then all things are ( AG ) clean for you .
NASB	Luke	11	42	“ ( AH ) But woe to you Pharisees ! For you ( AI ) pay tithes of mint , rue , and every kind of garden herb , and yet you [ ah ] ignore justice and the love of God ; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others .
NASB	Luke	11	43	Woe to you Pharisees ! For you ( AJ ) love the seat of honor in the synagogues and personal greetings in the marketplaces .
NASB	Luke	11	44	( AK ) Woe to you ! For you are like [ ai ] unseen tombs , and the people who walk over them are unaware of it. ”
NASB	Luke	11	45	One of the [ aj ] ( AL ) lawyers * said to Him in reply , “ Teacher , when You say these things , You insult us too. ”
NASB	Luke	11	46	But He said , “ Woe to you ( AM ) lawyers as well ! For ( AN ) you load people with burdens that are hard to bear , [ ak ] while you yourselves will not even [ al ] touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
NASB	Luke	11	47	( AO ) Woe to you ! For you build the [ am ] tombs of the prophets , and it was your fathers who killed them .
NASB	Luke	11	48	So you are witnesses and you approve of the deeds of your fathers ; because it was they who killed them , and you build their [ an ] tombs .
NASB	Luke	11	49	For this reason also , ( AP ) the wisdom of God said , ‘ ( AQ ) I will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they will kill , and some they will [ ao ] persecute ,
NASB	Luke	11	50	so that the blood of all the prophets , shed ( AR ) since the foundation of the world , may be charged [ ap ] against this generation ,

NASB	Luke	11	52	Woe to you [ ar ] ( AU ) lawyers ! For you have taken away the key of knowledge ; ( AV ) you yourselves did not enter , and you hindered those who were entering. ”

NASB	Luke	12	15	But He said to them , “ ( Q ) Beware , and be on your guard against every form of greed ; for not even when one is affluent does his life consist of his possessions. ”
NASB	Luke	12	16	And He told them a parable , saying , “ The land of a rich man was very productive .

NASB	Luke	12	21	Such is the one who ( V ) stores up treasure for himself , and is not rich in relation to God. ”
NASB	Luke	12	22	And He said to His disciples , “ ( W ) For this reason I tell you , [ n ] do not worry about your [ o ] life , as to what you are to eat ; nor for your body , as to what you are to wear .
NASB	Luke	12	23	For life is more than food , and the body is more than clothing .
NASB	Luke	12	24	Consider the ( X ) ravens , that they neither sow nor reap ; they have no storeroom nor ( Y ) barn , and yet God feeds them ; how much more valuable you are than the birds !
NASB	Luke	12	25	And which of you by worrying can add a [ p ] ( Z ) day to his [ q ] life ’ s span ?
NASB	Luke	12	26	Therefore if you can not do even a very little thing , why do you worry about the other things ?
NASB	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies , how they grow : they neither labor nor [ r ] spin ; but I tell you , not even ( AA ) Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these .
NASB	Luke	12	28	Now if God so clothes the grass in the field , which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , how much more will He clothe you ? ( AB ) You of little faith !
NASB	Luke	12	29	And do not [ s ] seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink , and do not ( AC ) keep worrying .
NASB	Luke	12	30	For [ t ] all these things are what the nations of the world [ u ] eagerly seek ; and your Father knows that you need these things .

NASB	Luke	12	36	You are also to be like people who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast , so that they may immediately open the door for him when he comes and knocks .
NASB	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find ( AM ) on the alert when he comes ; truly I say to you , that ( AN ) he will [ z ] prepare himself to serve , and have them recline at the table , and he will come up and serve them .

NASB	Luke	12	49	“ I [ ah ] have come to cast fire upon the earth ; and [ ai ] how I wish it were already kindled !
NASB	Luke	12	50	But I have a ( BA ) baptism [ aj ] to undergo , and how distressed I am until it is accomplished !
NASB	Luke	12	51	( BB ) Do you think that I came to provide peace on earth ? No , I tell you , but rather division ;
NASB	Luke	12	52	for from now on five members in one household will be divided , three against two and two against three .
NASB	Luke	12	53	They will be divided , ( BC ) father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ”
NASB	Luke	12	54	And He was also saying to the crowds , “ ( BD ) Whenever you see a cloud rising [ ak ] in the west , you immediately say , ‘ A shower is coming , ’ and so it turns out .
NASB	Luke	12	55	And whenever you feel a [ al ] south wind blowing , you say , ‘ It will be a ( BE ) hot day , ’ and it turns out that way .

NASB	Luke	13	13	And He ( I ) laid His hands on her ; and immediately she stood up straight again , and began ( J ) glorifying God .
NASB	Luke	13	2	And Jesus responded and said to them , “ ( B ) Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans just because they have suffered this fate ?

NASB	Luke	13	6	And He began telling this parable : “ A man had ( E ) a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard ; and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any .
NASB	Luke	13	7	And he said to the vineyard-keeper , ‘ Look ! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree [ d ] without finding any . ( F ) Cut it down ! Why does it even use up the ground ? ’
NASB	Luke	13	8	But he answered and said to him , ‘ Sir , leave it alone for this year too , until I dig around it and put in fertilizer ;
NASB	Luke	13	9	and if it bears fruit next year , fine ; but if not , cut it down. ’ ” Healing on the Sabbath
NASB	Luke	13	10	Now Jesus was ( G ) teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
NASB	Luke	13	11	And [ e ] there was a woman who for eighteen years had had ( H ) a [ f ] sickness caused by a spirit ; and she was bent over double , and could not straighten up at all .
NASB	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her , He called her over and said to her , “ Woman , you are freed from your sickness. ”
NASB	Luke	13	14	But ( K ) the synagogue leader , indignant because Jesus ( L ) had healed on the Sabbath , began saying to the crowd in response , “ ( M ) There are six days during which work should be done ; so come during them and get healed , and not on the Sabbath day. ”
NASB	Luke	13	15	But ( N ) the Lord answered him and said , “ You hypocrites , ( O ) does each of you on the Sabbath not untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it away to water it ?
NASB	Luke	13	16	And this woman , ( P ) a daughter of Abraham as she is , whom ( Q ) Satan has bound for [ g ] eighteen long years , should she not have been released from this restraint on the Sabbath day ? ”
NASB	Luke	13	17	And as He said this , all His opponents were being [ h ] humiliated ; and ( R ) the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him . Parables of Mustard Seed and Leaven
NASB	Luke	13	18	So ( S ) He was saying , “ ( T ) What is the kingdom of God like , and to what shall I compare it ?
NASB	Luke	13	19	It is like a mustard seed , which a man took and threw into his own garden ; and it grew and became a tree , and ( U ) the birds of the sky nested in its branches. ”
NASB	Luke	13	20	And again He said , “ ( V ) To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?

NASB	Luke	13	24	“ ( Z ) Strive to enter through the narrow door ; for many , I tell you , will seek to enter and will not be able .
NASB	Luke	13	25	Once the head of the house gets up and ( AA ) shuts the door , and you begin standing outside and knocking on the door , saying , ‘ ( AB ) Lord , open up to us ! ’ and He then will answer and say to you , ‘ ( AC ) I do not know where you are from. ’
NASB	Luke	13	26	Then you will ( AD ) begin saying , ‘ We ate and drank in Your presence , and You taught in our streets ! ’
NASB	Luke	13	27	And yet He will [ k ] say , ‘ ( AE ) I do not know where you are from ; ( AF ) leave Me , all you [ l ] evildoers. ’
NASB	Luke	13	28	( AG ) In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but yourselves being thrown out .
NASB	Luke	13	29	And they ( AH ) will come from east and west , and from north and south , and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God .
NASB	Luke	13	30	And behold , ( AI ) some are last who will be first , and some are first who will be last. ”
NASB	Luke	13	31	At that very time some Pharisees approached , saying to Him , “ Go away and leave this place , because ( AJ ) Herod wants to kill You. ”
NASB	Luke	13	32	And He said to them , “ Go and tell that [ m ] fox , ‘ Behold , I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow , and on the third day I [ n ] ( AK ) reach My goal. ’

NASB	Luke	14	2	And [ c ] there in front of Him was a man suffering from [ d ] edema .
NASB	Luke	14	3	And Jesus responded and said to the [ e ] ( B ) lawyers and [ f ] Pharisees , “ ( C ) Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath , or not ? ”
NASB	Luke	14	4	But they kept silent . And He took hold of him and healed him , and sent him away .
NASB	Luke	14	5	And He said to them , “ [ g ] ( D ) Which one of you will have a son or an ox fall into a well , and will not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day ? ”
NASB	Luke	14	6	( E ) And they could offer no reply to this . Parable of the Guests
NASB	Luke	14	7	Now He began telling a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how ( F ) they had been picking out the places of honor at the table , saying to them ,
NASB	Luke	14	8	“ Whenever you are invited by someone to a wedding feast , ( G ) do not [ h ] take the place of honor , for someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him ,
NASB	Luke	14	9	and the one who invited you [ i ] both will come and say to you , ‘ Give your place to this person , ’ and then ( H ) in disgrace you will proceed to occupy the last place .
NASB	Luke	14	10	But whenever you are invited , go and [ j ] take the last place , so that when the one who has invited you comes , he will say to you , ‘ Friend , ( I ) move up higher ’ ; then you will have honor in the sight of all who are [ k ] dining at the table with you .
NASB	Luke	14	11	( J ) For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and the one who humbles himself will be exalted. ”
NASB	Luke	14	12	Now He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him , “ Whenever you give a luncheon or a dinner , do not invite your friends , your brothers , your relatives , nor wealthy neighbors , otherwise they may also invite you to a meal in return , and that will be your [ l ] repayment .
NASB	Luke	14	13	But whenever you give a [ m ] banquet , invite people who are poor , who have disabilities , who are limping , and people who are blind ;
NASB	Luke	14	15	Now when one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this , he said to Him , “ ( L ) Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God ! ” Parable of the Dinner
NASB	Luke	14	16	But He said to him , “ ( M ) A man was giving a big dinner , and he invited many ;
NASB	Luke	14	17	and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited , ‘ Come , because everything is ready now. ’
NASB	Luke	14	18	And yet they all alike began to make excuses . The first one said to him , ‘ I purchased a field and I need to go out to look at it ; [ o ] please consider me excused. ’
NASB	Luke	14	19	And another one said , ‘ I bought five yoke of oxen , and I am going to try them out ; [ p ] please consider me excused. ’
NASB	Luke	14	20	And another one said , ‘ ( N ) I took a woman as my wife , and for that reason I can not come. ’
NASB	Luke	14	21	And the slave came back and reported this to his master . Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave , ‘ Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here those who are poor , those with disabilities , those who are blind , and those who are limping. ’
NASB	Luke	14	22	And later the slave said , ‘ Master , what you commanded has been done , and still there is room. ’
NASB	Luke	14	23	And the master said to the slave , ‘ Go out into the roads and the hedges and press upon them to come in , so that my house will be filled .
NASB	Luke	14	24	For I tell you , none of those men who were invited shall taste my dinner. ’ ” Discipleship Tested
NASB	Luke	14	25	Now [ q ] large crowds were going along with Him , and He turned and said to them ,
NASB	Luke	14	26	“ ( O ) If anyone comes to Me and does not [ r ] hate his own father , mother , wife , children , brothers , sisters , yes , and even his own life , he can not be My disciple .
NASB	Luke	14	27	Whoever does not ( P ) carry his own cross and come after Me can not be My disciple .
NASB	Luke	14	28	For which one of you , when he wants to build a tower , does not first sit down and calculate the cost , to see if he has enough to complete it ?
NASB	Luke	14	29	Otherwise , when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish , all who are watching it will begin to ridicule him ,
NASB	Luke	14	30	saying , ‘ This person began to build , and was not able to finish ! ’
NASB	Luke	14	31	Or what king , when he sets out to meet another king in battle , will not first sit down and ( Q ) consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to face the one coming against him with twenty thousand ?
NASB	Luke	14	32	Otherwise , while the other is still far away , he sends a delegation and requests terms of peace .
NASB	Luke	14	33	So then , none of you can be My disciple who ( R ) does not [ s ] give up all his own possessions .
NASB	Luke	14	34	“ Therefore , salt is good ; but ( S ) if even salt has become tasteless , with what will it be [ t ] seasoned ?

NASB	Luke	15	2	And both the Pharisees and the scribes began to complain , saying , “ This man receives sinners and ( B ) eats with them. ”
NASB	Luke	15	3	And so He told them this parable , saying ,
NASB	Luke	15	4	“ ( C ) What man among you , if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them , does not leave the other ninety-nine in the [ c ] open pasture and go after the one that is lost , until he finds it ?
NASB	Luke	15	5	And when he has found it , he puts it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
NASB	Luke	15	6	And when he comes home , he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying to them , ‘ Rejoice with me , because I have found my sheep that was lost ! ’
NASB	Luke	15	7	I tell you that in the same way , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance . The Lost Coin
NASB	Luke	15	8	“ Or what woman , if she has ten [ d ] silver coins and loses one coin , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it ?
NASB	Luke	15	9	And when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , because I have found the coin which I had lost ! ’
NASB	Luke	15	10	In the same way , I tell you , there is joy ( D ) in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents. ” The Prodigal Son
NASB	Luke	15	11	And He said , “ A man had two sons .
NASB	Luke	15	12	The younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me ( E ) the share of the estate that [ e ] is coming to me. ’ And so he divided his [ f ] ( F ) wealth between them .
NASB	Luke	15	13	And not many days later , the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey to a distant country , and there he squandered his estate in [ g ] wild living .
NASB	Luke	15	14	Now when he had [ h ] spent everything , a severe famine occurred in that country , and he began doing without .
NASB	Luke	15	16	And he longed to have his fill of the carob pods that the pigs were eating , and no one was giving him anything .
NASB	Luke	15	17	But when he came to [ j ] his senses , he said , ‘ How many of my father ’ s hired laborers have more than enough bread , but I am dying here [ k ] from hunger !
NASB	Luke	15	18	I will set out and go to my father , and will say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven , and [ l ] in your sight ;
NASB	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ; treat me as one of your hired laborers. ” ’
NASB	Luke	15	20	So he set out and came to [ m ] his father . But when he was still a long way off , his father saw him and felt compassion for him , and ran and [ n ] ( G ) embraced him and kissed him .
NASB	Luke	15	21	And the son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and [ o ] in your sight ; I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ’
NASB	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his slaves , ‘ Quickly bring out ( H ) the best robe and put it on him , and [ p ] ( I ) put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet ;
NASB	Luke	15	23	and bring the fattened calf , slaughter it , and let ’ s eat and celebrate ;
NASB	Luke	15	24	for this son of mine was ( J ) dead and has come to life again ; he was lost and has been found. ’ And they began to celebrate .
NASB	Luke	15	25	“ Now his older son was in the field , and when he came and approached the house , he heard music and dancing .
NASB	Luke	15	26	And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things could be .
NASB	Luke	15	27	And he said to him , ‘ Your brother has come , and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound. ’
NASB	Luke	15	28	But he became angry and was not willing to go in ; and his father came out and began pleading with him .
NASB	Luke	15	29	But he answered and said to his father , ‘ Look ! For so many years I have been serving you and I have never [ q ] neglected a command of yours ; and yet you never gave me a young goat , so that I might celebrate with my friends ;
NASB	Luke	15	30	but when this son of yours came , who has devoured your [ r ] ( K ) wealth with prostitutes , you slaughtered the fattened calf for him. ’
NASB	Luke	15	31	And he said to him , ‘ Son , you [ s ] have always been with me , and all that is mine is yours .
NASB	Luke	15	32	But we had to celebrate and rejoice , because this brother of yours was ( L ) dead and has begun to live , and was lost and has been found. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 15:1 I.e. , irreligious Jews - Luke 15:1 Lit Him - Luke 15:4 Lit wilderness - Luke 15:8 Gr drachmas ; one drachma was a day ’ s wages for a laborer - Luke 15:12 Lit falls - Luke 15:12 Lit means of subsistence - Luke 15:13 Or wasteful - Luke 15:14 Or wasted - Luke 15:15 Lit joined himself to - Luke 15:17 Lit himself - Luke 15:17 Lit by - Luke 15:18 Lit before you - Luke 15:20 Lit his own - Luke 15:20 Lit fell on his neck - Luke 15:21 Lit before you - Luke 15:22 Lit give ... into his hand - Luke 15:29 Or disobeyed - Luke 15:30 Lit means of subsistence - Luke 15:31 Lit are always with me New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Luke	16	16	“ ( O ) The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John came ; since that time ( P ) the gospel of the kingdom of God [ q ] has been preached , and everyone is forcing his way into it .
NASB	Luke	16	2	And he summoned him and said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Give an accounting of your management , for you can no longer be manager. ’
NASB	Luke	16	3	And the manager said to himself , ‘ What am I to do , since my [ b ] master is taking the management away from me ? I am not strong enough to [ c ] dig ; I am ashamed to beg .
NASB	Luke	16	4	I know what I will do , so that when I am removed from the management people will welcome me into their homes. ’
NASB	Luke	16	5	And he summoned each one of his [ d ] master ’ s debtors , and he began saying to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
NASB	Luke	16	6	And he said , ‘ A hundred [ e ] jugs of oil. ’ And he said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty. ’
NASB	Luke	16	7	Then he said to another , ‘ And how much do you owe ? ’ And he said , ‘ A hundred [ f ] kors of wheat. ’ He * said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and write eighty. ’
NASB	Luke	16	8	And his [ g ] master complimented the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly ; for the sons of ( B ) this age are more shrewd in relation to their own [ h ] kind than the ( C ) sons of light .

NASB	Luke	16	10	“ ( G ) The one who is faithful in a very little thing is also faithful in much ; and the one who is unrighteous in a very little thing is also unrighteous in much .
NASB	Luke	16	11	Therefore if you have not [ k ] been faithful in the use of unrighteous [ l ] ( H ) wealth , who will entrust the true wealth to you ?
NASB	Luke	16	12	And if you have not [ m ] been faithful in the use of that which is another ’ s , who will give you that which is your own ?
NASB	Luke	16	13	( I ) No [ n ] servant can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to one and despise the other . You can not serve God and [ o ] ( J ) wealth. ”
NASB	Luke	16	14	Now the Pharisees , who were ( K ) lovers of money , were listening to all these things and ( L ) were [ p ] ridiculing Him .
NASB	Luke	16	15	And He said to them , “ You are the ones who ( M ) justify yourselves in the sight of people , but ( N ) God knows your hearts ; because that which is highly esteemed among people is detestable in the sight of God .
NASB	Luke	16	17	( Q ) But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one [ r ] stroke of a letter of the Law to fail .
NASB	Luke	16	18	“ ( R ) Everyone who [ s ] divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery , and he who marries one who is [ t ] divorced from a husband commits adultery . The Rich Man and Lazarus
NASB	Luke	16	19	“ Now there was a rich man , and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen , enjoying himself in splendor every day .
NASB	Luke	16	20	And a poor man named Lazarus ( S ) was laid at his gate , covered with sores ,
NASB	Luke	16	21	and longing to be fed from the scraps which fell from the rich man ’ s table ; not only that , the dogs also were coming and licking his sores .

NASB	Luke	16	23	And in ( U ) Hades he raised his eyes , being in torment , and * saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his [ v ] arms .
NASB	Luke	16	24	And he cried out and said , ‘ ( V ) Father Abraham , have mercy on me and send Lazarus , so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue , for I am in agony in ( W ) this flame. ’
NASB	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , ‘ Child , remember that ( X ) during your life you received your good things , and likewise Lazarus bad things ; but now he is being comforted here , and you are in agony .
NASB	Luke	16	26	And [ w ] besides all this , between us and you a great chasm has been set , so that those who want to go over from here to you will not be able , nor will any people cross over from there to us. ’
NASB	Luke	16	27	And he said , ‘ Then I request of you , father , that you send him to my father ’ s house—
NASB	Luke	16	28	for I have five brothers—in order that he may ( Y ) warn them , so that they will not come to this place of torment as well. ’
NASB	Luke	16	29	But Abraham * said , ‘ They have [ x ] ( Z ) Moses and the Prophets ; let them hear them. ’
NASB	Luke	16	30	But he said , ‘ No , ( AA ) father Abraham , but if someone goes to them from the dead , they will repent ! ’

NASB	Luke	17	17	But Jesus responded and said , “ Were there not ten cleansed ? But the nine—where are they ?
NASB	Luke	17	2	( B ) It is better for him if a millstone is hung around his neck and he [ b ] is thrown into the sea , than that he may cause one of these little ones to [ c ] sin .
NASB	Luke	17	3	[ d ] Be on your guard ! ( C ) If your brother sins , rebuke him ; and if he repents , forgive him .
NASB	Luke	17	4	And if he sins against you ( D ) seven times a day , and returns to you seven times , saying , ‘ I repent , ’ you shall forgive him. ”
NASB	Luke	17	5	( E ) The apostles said to ( F ) the Lord , “ Increase our faith ! ”
NASB	Luke	17	6	But ( G ) the Lord said , “ If you [ e ] had faith [ f ] the size of ( H ) a mustard seed , you could say to this ( I ) mulberry tree , ‘ Be uprooted and be planted in the sea ’ ; and it would [ g ] obey you .
NASB	Luke	17	7	“ Now which of you , having a slave plowing or tending sheep , will say to him after he comes in from the field , ‘ Come immediately and recline at the table to eat ’ ?
NASB	Luke	17	8	On the contrary , will he not say to him , ‘ ( J ) Prepare something for me to eat , and properly [ h ] clothe yourself and serve me while I eat and drink ; and [ i ] afterward you [ j ] may eat and drink ’ ?
NASB	Luke	17	9	He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were commanded , does he ?
NASB	Luke	17	10	So you too , when you do all the things which were commanded you , say , ‘ We are [ k ] unworthy slaves ; we have done only that which we ought to have done. ’ ” Ten Men with Leprosy Healed
NASB	Luke	17	11	While He was ( K ) on the way to Jerusalem , ( L ) He was passing [ l ] between Samaria and Galilee .
NASB	Luke	17	12	And as He entered a village , ten men with leprosy who ( M ) stood at a distance met Him ;
NASB	Luke	17	13	and they raised their voices , saying , “ Jesus , ( N ) Master , have mercy on us ! ”
NASB	Luke	17	14	When He saw them , He said to them , “ ( O ) Go and show yourselves to the priests. ” And as they were going , they were cleansed .
NASB	Luke	17	15	Now one of them , when he saw that he had been healed , turned back , ( P ) glorifying God with a loud voice ,
NASB	Luke	17	16	and he fell on his face at His feet , giving thanks to Him . And he was a ( Q ) Samaritan .
NASB	Luke	17	18	[ m ] Was no one found who returned to ( R ) give glory to God , except this foreigner ? ”
NASB	Luke	17	19	And He said to him , “ Stand up and go ; ( S ) your faith has [ n ] made you well. ” Second Coming Foretold
NASB	Luke	17	20	Now He was questioned by the Pharisees ( T ) as to when the kingdom of God was coming , and He answered them and said , “ The kingdom of God is not coming with [ o ] ( U ) signs that can be observed ;
NASB	Luke	17	21	nor will ( V ) they say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or , ‘ There it is ! ’ For behold , the kingdom of God is [ p ] in your midst. ”
NASB	Luke	17	22	And He said to the disciples , “ ( W ) The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
NASB	Luke	17	23	( X ) And they will say to you , ‘ Look there , ’ or , ‘ Look here ! ’ Do not leave , and do not run after them .
NASB	Luke	17	24	( Y ) For just like the lightning , when it flashes out of one part [ q ] of the sky , shines to the other part [ r ] of the sky , so will the Son of Man be in His day .
NASB	Luke	17	25	( Z ) But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
NASB	Luke	17	26	( AA ) And just as it happened ( AB ) in the days of Noah , so will it also be in the days of the Son of Man :
NASB	Luke	17	27	people were eating , they were drinking , they were marrying , and they were being given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
NASB	Luke	17	28	[ s ] It was the same as happened in ( AC ) the days of Lot : they were eating , they were drinking , they were buying , they were selling , they were planting , and they were building ;
NASB	Luke	17	29	but on the day that Lot left Sodom , it rained fire and [ t ] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all .
NASB	Luke	17	30	It will be [ u ] just the same on the day that the Son of Man ( AD ) is revealed .
NASB	Luke	17	31	On that day , the one who will be ( AE ) on the [ v ] housetop , [ w ] with his goods in the house , must not go down to take them out ; and likewise the one in the field must not turn back .
NASB	Luke	17	32	( AF ) Remember Lot ’ s wife .
NASB	Luke	17	33	( AG ) Whoever strives to [ x ] save his [ y ] life will lose it , and whoever loses his life will keep it .
NASB	Luke	17	34	I tell you , on that night there will be two in one bed ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
NASB	Luke	17	35	( AH ) There will be two women grinding at the same place ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
NASB	Luke	17	36	[ [ z ] ( AI ) Two men will be in the field ; one will be taken and the other will be left. ” ]
NASB	Luke	17	37	And responding , they * said to Him , “ Where , Lord ? ” And He said to them , “ ( AJ ) Where the body is , there also the [ aa ] vultures will be gathered. ” Footnotes - Luke 17:1 Or temptations to sin - Luke 17:2 Lit has been thrown ( intensive ) - Luke 17:2 Or stumble - Luke 17:3 Lit Take heed for yourselves - Luke 17:6 Lit have - Luke 17:6 Lit like - Luke 17:6 Lit have obeyed - Luke 17:8 Lit belt up - Luke 17:8 Lit after these things - Luke 17:8 Lit will - Luke 17:10 I.e. , possibly unworthy of praise - Luke 17:11 Lit through the middle of - Luke 17:18 Lit Were they not found who - Luke 17:19 Or saved you - Luke 17:20 Lit observation - Luke 17:21 Or among you - Luke 17:24 Lit under heaven ; i.e. , the lowest heaven , the sky - Luke 17:24 Lit under heaven ; i.e. , the lowest heaven , the sky - Luke 17:28 Lit In the same way as - Luke 17:29 I.e. , burning sulfur - Luke 17:30 Lit according to the same things - Luke 17:31 Housetops were flat living areas - Luke 17:31 Lit and his - Luke 17:33 Or secure - Luke 17:33 Or soul - Luke 17:36 Early mss do not contain this v - Luke 17:37 Or eagles New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Luke	18	18	( X ) A ruler questioned Him , saying , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
NASB	Luke	18	2	saying , “ In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and did not ( C ) respect any person .
NASB	Luke	18	3	Now there was a widow in that city , and she kept coming to him , saying , ‘ Give me justice against my [ a ] opponent. ’
NASB	Luke	18	4	For a while he was unwilling ; but later he said to himself , ‘ Even though I do not fear God nor ( D ) respect any person ,
NASB	Luke	18	5	yet ( E ) because this widow is bothering me , I will give her justice ; otherwise [ b ] by continually coming she will ( F ) wear me out. ’ ”
NASB	Luke	18	6	And ( G ) the Lord said , “ Listen to what the unrighteous judge * said ;
NASB	Luke	18	7	now , will God not ( H ) bring about justice for His ( I ) elect who cry out to Him day [ c ] and night , and will He ( J ) delay long for them ?
NASB	Luke	18	8	I tell you that He will bring about justice for them quickly . However , when the Son of Man comes , ( K ) will He find [ d ] faith on the earth ? ” The Pharisee and the Tax Collector
NASB	Luke	18	9	Now He also told this parable to some people who ( L ) trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and ( M ) viewed others with contempt :
NASB	Luke	18	10	“ Two men ( N ) went up into the [ e ] temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
NASB	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee ( O ) stood and began praying this in regard to himself : ‘ God , I thank You that I am not like other people : swindlers , crooked , adulterers , or even like this tax collector .
NASB	Luke	18	12	I ( P ) fast twice a week ; I ( Q ) pay tithes of all that I get. ’
NASB	Luke	18	13	But the tax collector , ( R ) standing some distance away , ( S ) was even unwilling to raise his eyes toward heaven , but ( T ) was beating his chest , saying , ‘ God , be [ f ] merciful to me , the sinner ! ’
NASB	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went to his house justified rather than the other one ; ( U ) for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but the one who humbles himself will be exalted. ”
NASB	Luke	18	15	( V ) Now they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them ; but when the disciples saw it , they began rebuking them .
NASB	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called for [ g ] the little ones , saying , “ Allow the children to come to Me , and do not [ h ] forbid them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
NASB	Luke	18	17	Truly I say to you , ( W ) whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all. ” The Rich Young Ruler
NASB	Luke	18	19	But Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call Me [ i ] good ? No one is [ j ] good except God alone .
NASB	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments , ‘ ( Y ) Do not commit adultery , Do not murder , Do not steal , Do not give false testimony , Honor your father and mother. ’ ”
NASB	Luke	18	21	And he said , “ All these things I have kept since my youth. ”
NASB	Luke	18	22	Now when Jesus heard this , He said to him , “ One thing you still lack ; ( Z ) sell all that you possess and distribute the money to the poor , and you will have ( AA ) treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me. ”
NASB	Luke	18	23	But when he had heard these things , he became very sad , for he was extremely wealthy .
NASB	Luke	18	24	And Jesus looked at him and said , “ ( AB ) How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God !
NASB	Luke	18	25	For ( AC ) it is easier for a camel to [ k ] go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
NASB	Luke	18	26	Those who heard Him said , “ And so who can be saved ? ”
NASB	Luke	18	27	But He said , “ ( AD ) The things that are impossible with people are possible with God. ”
NASB	Luke	18	28	Peter said , “ Behold , ( AE ) we have left [ l ] our own homes and followed You. ”
NASB	Luke	18	29	And He said to them , “ Truly I say to you , ( AF ) there is no one who has left house , or wife , or brothers , or parents , or children for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
NASB	Luke	18	30	who will not receive many times as much at this time , and in ( AG ) the age to come , eternal life. ”
NASB	Luke	18	31	( AH ) Now He took the twelve aside and said to them , “ Behold , ( AI ) we are going up to Jerusalem , and ( AJ ) all the things that have been written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished .
NASB	Luke	18	32	( AK ) For He will be [ m ] handed over to the Gentiles , and will be ridiculed , and abused , and spit upon ,
NASB	Luke	18	33	and after they have flogged Him , they will kill Him ; and on the third day He will rise. ”
NASB	Luke	18	34	[ n ] ( AL ) The disciples understood none of these things , and the meaning of this statement was hidden from them , and they did not comprehend the things that were said . Bartimaeus Receives Sight
NASB	Luke	18	35	( AM ) Now as [ o ] ( AN ) Jesus was approaching Jericho , a man who was blind was sitting by the road , begging .
NASB	Luke	18	36	But when he heard a crowd going by , he began inquiring what this was .
NASB	Luke	18	37	They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by .
NASB	Luke	18	38	And he called out , saying , “ Jesus , ( AO ) Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NASB	Luke	18	39	Those who led the way were sternly telling him to be quiet ; but he kept crying out all the more , “ ( AP ) Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NASB	Luke	18	40	And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him ; and when he came near , He asked him ,
NASB	Luke	18	41	“ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” And he said , “ Lord , I want to regain my sight ! ”
NASB	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said to him , “ Regain your sight ; ( AQ ) your faith has [ p ] made you well. ”
NASB	Luke	18	43	And immediately he regained his sight and began following Him , ( AR ) glorifying God ; and when ( AS ) all the people saw it , they gave praise to God .

NASB	Luke	19	19	And he said to him also , ‘ And you are to be over five cities. ’
NASB	Luke	19	2	And [ a ] there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus ; he was a chief tax collector and he was rich .
NASB	Luke	19	3	Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was , and he was unable due to the crowd , because he was short in stature .
NASB	Luke	19	4	So he ran on ahead and climbed up a [ b ] ( B ) sycamore tree in order to see Him , because He was about to pass through that way .
NASB	Luke	19	5	And when Jesus came to the place , He looked up and said to him , “ Zaccheus , hurry and come down , for today I must stay at your house. ”
NASB	Luke	19	6	And he hurried and came down , and received Him [ c ] joyfully .
NASB	Luke	19	7	When the people saw this , they all began to complain , saying , “ He has gone in [ d ] to be the guest of a man who is a sinner ! ”
NASB	Luke	19	8	But Zaccheus stopped and said to ( C ) the Lord , “ Behold , Lord , half of my possessions I am giving to the poor , and if I have ( D ) extorted anything from anyone , I am giving back ( E ) four times as much. ”

NASB	Luke	19	11	Now while they were listening to these things , Jesus went on to tell a parable , because ( G ) He was near Jerusalem and they thought that ( H ) the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately .
NASB	Luke	19	12	So He said , “ ( I ) A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself , and then to return .

NASB	Luke	19	14	But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him , saying , ‘ We do not want this man to reign over us. ’
NASB	Luke	19	15	When he returned after receiving the kingdom , he ordered that these slaves , to whom he had given the money , be summoned to him so that he would learn how much they had made by the business they had done .
NASB	Luke	19	16	The first slave appeared , saying , ‘ [ g ] Master , your [ h ] mina has made ten minas more. ’
NASB	Luke	19	17	And he said to him , ‘ Well done , good slave ; since you have been ( J ) faithful in a very little thing , you are to have authority over ten cities. ’
NASB	Luke	19	18	The second one came , saying , ‘ Your [ i ] mina , [ j ] master , has made five minas. ’
NASB	Luke	19	20	And then another came , saying , ‘ Master , here is your mina , which I kept tucked away in a handkerchief ;
NASB	Luke	19	21	for I was afraid of you , because you are a demanding man ; you take up what you did not lay down , and reap what you did not sow. ’
NASB	Luke	19	22	He * said to him , ‘ [ k ] From your own lips I will judge you , you worthless slave . Did you know that I am a demanding man , taking up what I did not lay down , and reaping what I did not sow ?
NASB	Luke	19	23	And so why did you not put my money in the bank , and when I came back , I would have collected it with interest ? ’
NASB	Luke	19	24	And then he said to the other slaves who were present , ‘ Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas. ’
NASB	Luke	19	25	And they said to him , ‘ Master , he already has ten minas. ’
NASB	Luke	19	26	‘ ( K ) I tell you that to everyone who has , more shall be given , but from the one who does not have , even what he does have shall be taken away .
NASB	Luke	19	27	But as for ( L ) these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them , bring them here and ( M ) slaughter them in my presence. ’ ” Triumphal Entry
NASB	Luke	19	28	After Jesus said these things , He ( N ) was going on ahead , ( O ) going up to Jerusalem .
NASB	Luke	19	29	( P ) When He approached Bethphage and ( Q ) Bethany , near the [ l ] mountain that is called ( R ) Olivet , He sent two of the disciples ,
NASB	Luke	19	30	saying , “ Go into the village [ m ] ahead of you ; there , as you enter , you will find a colt tied , on which no one yet has ever sat ; untie it and bring it here .
NASB	Luke	19	31	And if anyone asks you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ you shall say this : ‘ [ n ] The Lord has need of it. ’ ”
NASB	Luke	19	32	So those who were sent left and found it just as He had told them .
NASB	Luke	19	33	And as they were untying the colt , its [ o ] owners said to them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
NASB	Luke	19	34	They said , “ [ p ] The Lord has need of it. ”
NASB	Luke	19	35	And they brought it to Jesus , ( S ) and they threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it .
NASB	Luke	19	36	Now as He was going , they were spreading their cloaks on the road .
NASB	Luke	19	37	And as soon as He was approaching , near the descent of ( T ) the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of the disciples began to ( U ) praise God [ q ] joyfully with a loud voice for all the [ r ] miracles which they had seen ,
NASB	Luke	19	38	[ s ] shouting : “ ( V ) Blessed is the ( W ) King , the One who comes in the name of the Lord ; Peace in heaven and ( X ) glory in the highest ! ”
NASB	Luke	19	39	( Y ) And yet some of the Pharisees [ t ] in the crowd said to Him , “ Teacher , rebuke Your disciples ! ”
NASB	Luke	19	40	Jesus replied , “ I tell you , if these stop speaking , ( Z ) the stones will cry out ! ”
NASB	Luke	19	41	When He approached Jerusalem , He saw the city and ( AA ) wept over it ,
NASB	Luke	19	42	saying , “ If you had known on this day , even you , the conditions for peace ! But now they have been hidden from your eyes .
NASB	Luke	19	43	For the days will come upon you [ u ] when your enemies will ( AB ) put up a [ v ] barricade against you , and ( AC ) surround you and hem you in on every side ,
NASB	Luke	19	44	and they will level you to the ground , and throw down your children within you , and ( AD ) they will not leave in you one stone upon [ w ] another , because you did not recognize ( AE ) the time of your visitation. ” Traders Driven from the Temple
NASB	Luke	19	45	( AF ) And Jesus entered the temple grounds and began to drive out those who were selling ,
NASB	Luke	19	46	saying to them , “ It is written : ‘ ( AG ) And My house will be a house of prayer , ’ ( AH ) but you have made it a den of robbers. ”
NASB	Luke	19	47	And ( AI ) He was teaching daily in the temple ; but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people ( AJ ) were trying to put Him to death ,
NASB	Luke	19	48	and yet they could not find [ x ] anything that they might do , for all the people were hanging on to [ y ] every word He said .

NASB	Luke	20	20	( N ) And so they watched Him [ g ] closely , and sent spies who pretended to be righteous , in order ( O ) that they might catch Him in some statement , so that they could hand Him over to the jurisdiction and authority of ( P ) the governor .
NASB	Luke	20	2	and they declared , saying to Him , “ Tell us by what authority You are doing these things , or who is the one who gave You this authority ? ”
NASB	Luke	20	3	But He replied to them , “ I will also ask you a [ a ] question , and you tell Me :
NASB	Luke	20	4	Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men ? ”
NASB	Luke	20	5	They discussed among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘ Why did you not believe him ? ’
NASB	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ all the people will stone us to death , since they are convinced that John was a ( E ) prophet. ”
NASB	Luke	20	7	And so they answered that they did not know where it came from .
NASB	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said to them , “ Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things. ” Parable of the Vine-growers
NASB	Luke	20	9	( F ) But He began to tell the people this parable : “ A man planted a vineyard and leased it to [ b ] vine-growers , and went on a journey for a long time .
NASB	Luke	20	10	,
NASB	Luke	20	11	And he proceeded to send another slave ; but they beat him also and treated him shamefully , and sent him away empty-handed .
NASB	Luke	20	12	And he proceeded to send a third ; but this one too they wounded and threw out .
NASB	Luke	20	13	Now the [ c ] owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What am I to do ? I will send my beloved son ; perhaps they will ( G ) respect him. ’
NASB	Luke	20	14	,
NASB	Luke	20	15	And so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . What , then , will the [ d ] owner of the vineyard do to them ?

NASB	Luke	20	17	But [ e ] Jesus looked at them and said , “ Then what is this statement that has been written :
NASB	Luke	20	18	( L ) Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces ; but on whomever it falls , it will crush him. ” Paying Taxes to Caesar
NASB	Luke	20	19	The scribes and the chief priests ( M ) tried to lay hands on Him that very hour , and yet they feared the people ; for they were aware that He had spoken this parable against them .
NASB	Luke	20	21	And the spies questioned Him , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You speak and teach correctly , and You [ h ] are not partial to anyone , but You teach the way of God on the basis of truth .
NASB	Luke	20	22	Is it [ i ] permissible for us ( Q ) to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? ”
NASB	Luke	20	23	But He saw through their trickery and said to them ,
NASB	Luke	20	24	“ Show Me a [ j ] denarius . Whose image and inscription does it have ? ” They said , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NASB	Luke	20	25	And He said to them , “ Then ( R ) pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and to God the things that are God ’ s. ”
NASB	Luke	20	26	And they were unable to ( S ) catch Him in a statement in the presence of the people ; and they were amazed at His answer , and said nothing . Is There a Resurrection ?
NASB	Luke	20	27	( T ) Now some of the ( U ) Sadducees ( who maintain that there is no resurrection ) came to Him ,
NASB	Luke	20	28	and they questioned Him , saying , “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that ( V ) if [ k ] a man ’ s brother dies , [ l ] leaving a wife , and he is childless , that his brother is to [ m ] marry the wife and raise up children [ n ] for his brother .
NASB	Luke	20	29	So then , there were seven brothers ; and the first took a wife and died childless ;
NASB	Luke	20	30	and the second
NASB	Luke	20	31	and the third [ o ] married her ; and in the same way [ p ] all seven [ q ] died , leaving no children .
NASB	Luke	20	32	Finally the woman also died .
NASB	Luke	20	33	Therefore , in the resurrection , [ r ] which one ’ s wife does the woman become ? For [ s ] all seven [ t ] married her. ”
NASB	Luke	20	34	Jesus said to them , “ The sons of ( W ) this age marry and the women are given in marriage ,
NASB	Luke	20	35	but those who are considered worthy to attain to ( X ) that age and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry nor are given in marriage ;
NASB	Luke	20	36	for they can not even die anymore , for they are like angels , and are ( Y ) sons of God , being [ u ] sons of the resurrection .
NASB	Luke	20	37	But as for the fact that the dead are raised , even Moses revealed this in ( Z ) the passage about the burning bush , where he calls the Lord ( AA ) the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
NASB	Luke	20	38	( AB ) Now He is not the God of the dead , but of the living ; for ( AC ) all live to Him. ”
NASB	Luke	20	39	Some of the scribes answered and said , “ Teacher , You have spoken well. ”
NASB	Luke	20	40	For ( AD ) they did not have the courage to question Him any longer about anything .
NASB	Luke	20	41	( AE ) But He said to them , “ How is it that they say the [ v ] Christ is ( AF ) David ’ s son ?
NASB	Luke	20	42	For David himself says in the book of Psalms , ‘ ( AG ) The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand ,
NASB	Luke	20	43	( AH ) Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet. ” ’
NASB	Luke	20	44	Therefore David calls Him ‘ Lord , ’ and so how is He his son ? ”
NASB	Luke	20	45	( AI ) And while all the people were listening , He said to the disciples ,
NASB	Luke	20	46	“ Beware of the scribes , ( AJ ) who like to walk around in long robes , and love personal greetings in the marketplaces , and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets ,
NASB	Luke	20	47	who [ w ] devour widows ’ houses , and for appearance ’ s sake offer long prayers . These will receive all the more condemnation. ” Footnotes - Luke 20:3 Lit word - Luke 20:9 Or tenant farmers , also vv

NASB	Luke	21	21	Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains , and those who are inside [ r ] the city must leave , and ( O ) those who are in the country must not enter [ s ] the city ;
NASB	Luke	21	2	And He saw a poor widow putting [ a ] in ( B ) two [ b ] lepta coins .
NASB	Luke	21	3	And He said , “ Truly I say to you , this poor widow put in more than all of them ;
NASB	Luke	21	4	for they all [ c ] contributed to the [ d ] offering from their [ e ] surplus ; but she , from her poverty , put in all [ f ] that she had ( C ) to live on. ”
NASB	Luke	21	5	( D ) And while some were talking about the temple , that it was decorated with beautiful stones and [ g ] vowed gifts , He said ,
NASB	Luke	21	6	“ As for these things which you are observing , the days will come when ( E ) there will not be left one stone upon [ h ] another , which will not be torn down. ”
NASB	Luke	21	7	They asked Him questions , saying , “ Teacher , when therefore will these things happen ? And what will be the [ i ] sign when these things are about to take place ? ”
NASB	Luke	21	8	And He said , “ See to it that you are not misled ; for many will come in My name , saying , ‘ ( F ) I am He , ’ and , ‘ The time is near. ’ ( G ) Do not go after them .
NASB	Luke	21	9	And when you hear of wars and revolts , do not be alarmed ; for these things must take place first , but the end will not follow immediately. ” Things to Come
NASB	Luke	21	10	Then He continued by saying to them , “ Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ,
NASB	Luke	21	11	and there will be [ j ] massive earthquakes , and in various places plagues and famines ; and there will be terrible sights and great [ k ] signs from heaven .
NASB	Luke	21	12	“ But before all these things , ( H ) they will lay their hands on you and persecute you , turning you over to the synagogues and prisons , [ l ] bringing you before kings and governors on account of My name .
NASB	Luke	21	13	( I ) It will lead to [ m ] an opportunity for your testimony .
NASB	Luke	21	14	( J ) So [ n ] make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves ;

NASB	Luke	21	16	But you will be betrayed even by parents , brothers and sisters , other relatives , and friends , and they will put some of you to death ,
NASB	Luke	21	17	and you will be hated by all people because of My name .
NASB	Luke	21	18	And yet ( L ) not a hair of your head will perish .
NASB	Luke	21	19	( M ) By your endurance you will gain your [ p ] lives .
NASB	Luke	21	20	“ But when you see Jerusalem ( N ) surrounded by armies , then [ q ] recognize that her desolation is near .
NASB	Luke	21	22	because these are ( P ) days of punishment , so that all things which have been written will be fulfilled .
NASB	Luke	21	23	Woe to those women who are pregnant , and to those who are nursing babies in those days ; for ( Q ) there will be great distress upon the [ t ] land , and wrath to this people ;
NASB	Luke	21	24	and they will fall by ( R ) the edge of the sword , and will be led captive into all the nations ; and ( S ) Jerusalem will be ( T ) trampled underfoot by the Gentiles until ( U ) the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled . The Return of Christ
NASB	Luke	21	25	“ There will be [ u ] signs in the sun and moon and stars , and on the earth distress among nations , in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves ,
NASB	Luke	21	26	people fainting from fear and the expectation of the things that are coming upon the [ v ] world ; for the powers of [ w ] the heavens will be shaken .
NASB	Luke	21	27	And ( V ) then they will see ( W ) the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
NASB	Luke	21	28	But when these things begin to take place , straighten up and lift up your heads , because ( X ) your redemption is drawing near. ”
NASB	Luke	21	29	And He told them a parable : “ Look at the fig tree and all the trees :
NASB	Luke	21	30	as soon as they put forth leaves , you see for yourselves and ( Y ) know that summer is now near .
NASB	Luke	21	31	So you too , when you see these things happening , [ x ] recognize that ( Z ) the kingdom of God is near .
NASB	Luke	21	32	Truly I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all things take place .
NASB	Luke	21	33	( AA ) Heaven and earth will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
NASB	Luke	21	34	“ But ( AB ) be on your guard , so that your hearts will not be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life , and that [ y ] this day will not come on you suddenly , like a trap ;

NASB	Luke	21	36	But ( AC ) stay alert at all times , praying that you will have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place , and to ( AD ) stand before the Son of Man. ”
NASB	Luke	21	37	Now [ z ] during the day He was ( AE ) teaching in the temple , but [ aa ] ( AF ) at evening He would go out and spend the night on ( AG ) the [ ab ] mountain that is called [ ac ] Olivet .

NASB	Luke	22	2	And the chief priests and the scribes ( C ) were trying to find [ a ] a way to put Him to death , since they were afraid of the people .
NASB	Luke	22	3	( D ) And ( E ) Satan entered Judas , the one called Iscariot , [ b ] who belonged to the number of the twelve .
NASB	Luke	22	4	And he left and discussed with the chief priests and ( F ) officers how he was to betray Him to them .
NASB	Luke	22	5	And they were delighted , and agreed to give him money .
NASB	Luke	22	6	And so he consented , and began looking for a good opportunity to betray Him to them [ c ] away from the crowd .
NASB	Luke	22	7	( G ) Now the first day of Unleavened Bread came , on which ( H ) the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed .
NASB	Luke	22	8	And so Jesus sent ( I ) Peter and John , saying , “ Go and prepare the Passover for us , so that we may eat it. ”
NASB	Luke	22	9	They said to Him , “ Where do You want us to prepare it ? ”
NASB	Luke	22	10	And He said to them , “ When you have entered the city , a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you ; follow him into the house that he enters .
NASB	Luke	22	11	And you shall say to the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says to you , “ Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples ? ” ’
NASB	Luke	22	12	And he will show you a large , furnished upstairs room ; prepare it there. ”
NASB	Luke	22	13	And they left and found everything just as He had told them ; and they prepared the Passover . The Lord ’ s Supper
NASB	Luke	22	14	( J ) When the hour came , He reclined at the table , and ( K ) the apostles with Him .
NASB	Luke	22	15	And He said to them , “ I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer ;
NASB	Luke	22	16	for I say to you , I shall not eat it again ( L ) until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. ”
NASB	Luke	22	17	( M ) And when He had taken a cup and ( N ) given thanks , He said , “ Take this and share it among yourselves ;
NASB	Luke	22	18	for ( O ) I say to you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes. ”
NASB	Luke	22	19	And when He had taken some bread and ( P ) given thanks , He broke it and gave it to them , saying , “ This is My body , which is being given for you ; do this in remembrance of Me. ”
NASB	Luke	22	20	And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten , saying , “ This cup , which is ( Q ) poured out for you , is the ( R ) new covenant in My blood .
NASB	Luke	22	21	( S ) But behold , the hand of the one betraying Me is with [ d ] Mine on the table .
NASB	Luke	22	23	And they began to debate among themselves which one of them it was who was going to do this . Who Is Greatest
NASB	Luke	22	24	And ( U ) a dispute also developed among them as to which one of them was regarded as being the greatest .
NASB	Luke	22	25	( V ) And He said to them , “ The kings of the Gentiles domineer over them ; and those who have authority over them are called ‘ Benefactors. ’
NASB	Luke	22	26	But it is not this way for you ; ( W ) rather , the one who is the greatest among you must become like ( X ) the youngest , and the leader like the servant .
NASB	Luke	22	27	For ( Y ) who is greater , the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves ? Is it not the one who reclines at the table ? But ( Z ) I am among you as the one who serves .
NASB	Luke	22	28	“ You are the ones who have stood by Me in My ( AA ) trials ;
NASB	Luke	22	29	and just as My Father has granted Me a ( AB ) kingdom , I grant you
NASB	Luke	22	30	that you may ( AC ) eat and drink at My table in My ( AD ) kingdom , and ( AE ) you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
NASB	Luke	22	31	“ Simon , Simon , behold , ( AF ) Satan has [ e ] demanded to ( AG ) sift you men like wheat ;
NASB	Luke	22	32	but I ( AH ) have prayed for [ f ] you , that [ g ] your faith will not fail ; and [ h ] you , when you have [ i ] turned back , ( AI ) strengthen your brothers. ”
NASB	Luke	22	33	( AJ ) But he said to Him , “ Lord , I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death ! ”
NASB	Luke	22	34	But He said , “ I tell you , Peter , the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me. ”
NASB	Luke	22	35	And He said to them , “ ( AK ) When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals , you did not lack anything , did you ? ” They said , “ No , nothing. ”
NASB	Luke	22	36	And He said to them , “ But now , [ j ] whoever has a money belt is to take it along , likewise also a bag , and [ k ] whoever has no sword is to sell his [ l ] cloak and buy one .
NASB	Luke	22	37	For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me : ‘ ( AL ) And He was counted with wrongdoers ’ ; for ( AM ) that which refers to Me has its [ m ] fulfillment. ”
NASB	Luke	22	38	They said , “ Lord , look , here are two ( AN ) swords. ” And He said to them , “ It is enough. ” The Garden of Gethsemane
NASB	Luke	22	39	( AO ) And He came out and went , ( AP ) as was His habit , to ( AQ ) the Mount of Olives ; and the disciples also followed Him .

NASB	Luke	22	41	And He withdrew from them about a stone ’ s throw , and He ( AT ) knelt down and began to pray ,

NASB	Luke	22	45	When He rose from prayer , He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow ,

NASB	Luke	22	47	( AZ ) While He was still speaking , behold , a crowd came , and the one called Judas , one of the twelve , was leading the way for them ; and he approached Jesus to kiss Him .
NASB	Luke	22	48	But Jesus said to him , “ Judas , are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
NASB	Luke	22	49	When those who were around Him saw what was going to happen , they said , “ Lord , shall we strike with the ( BA ) sword ? ”
NASB	Luke	22	50	And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
NASB	Luke	22	51	But Jesus responded and said , “ [ o ] Stop ! No more of this. ” And He touched his ear and healed him .

NASB	Luke	22	53	While I was with you daily in the temple , you did not lay hands on Me ; but [ p ] this hour and the power of darkness are yours. ” Jesus ’ Arrest
NASB	Luke	22	54	( BD ) Now they arrested Him and led Him away , and brought Him to the house of the high priest ; but ( BE ) Peter was following at a distance .
NASB	Luke	22	55	( BF ) After they kindled a fire in the middle of ( BG ) the courtyard and sat down together , Peter was sitting among them .
NASB	Luke	22	56	And a slave woman , seeing him as he sat in the firelight , and staring at him , said , “ This man was with Him as well. ”
NASB	Luke	22	57	But he denied it , saying , “ I do not know Him , woman ! ”
NASB	Luke	22	58	And a little later , ( BH ) another person saw him and said , “ You are one of them too ! ” But Peter said , “ Man , I am not ! ”
NASB	Luke	22	59	And after about an hour had passed , some other man began to insist , saying , “ Certainly this man also was with Him , ( BI ) for he , too , is a Galilean. ”
NASB	Luke	22	60	But Peter said , “ Man , I do not know what you are talking about ! ” And immediately , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
NASB	Luke	22	61	And then ( BJ ) the Lord turned and looked at Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how He had told him , “ ( BK ) Before a rooster crows today , you will deny Me three times. ”
NASB	Luke	22	62	And he went out and wept bitterly .
NASB	Luke	22	63	( BL ) The men who were holding [ q ] Jesus in custody began mocking Him and beating Him ,

NASB	Luke	23	23	But they were insistent , with loud voices , demanding that He be crucified . And their voices began to prevail .
NASB	Luke	23	2	( B ) And they began to bring charges against Him , saying , “ We found this man ( C ) misleading our nation and ( D ) forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar , and saying that He Himself is [ a ] Christ , a King. ”

NASB	Luke	23	4	But Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds , “ ( F ) I find no grounds for charges in the case of this man. ”
NASB	Luke	23	5	But they kept on insisting , saying , “ He is stirring up the people , teaching all over Judea , ( G ) starting from Galilee , as far as this place ! ”
NASB	Luke	23	6	Now when Pilate heard this , he asked whether the man was a Galilean .
NASB	Luke	23	7	And when he learned that He belonged to Herod ’ s jurisdiction , he sent Him to ( H ) Herod , [ b ] since he also was in Jerusalem [ c ] at this time . Jesus before Herod
NASB	Luke	23	8	Now Herod was overjoyed when he saw Jesus ; for ( I ) he had wanted to see Him for a long time , because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some [ d ] sign performed by Him .
NASB	Luke	23	9	And he questioned Him [ e ] at some length ; but ( J ) He offered him no answer at all .
NASB	Luke	23	10	Now the chief priests and the scribes stood there , vehemently charging Him .
NASB	Luke	23	11	And Herod , together with his soldiers , treated Him with contempt and mocked Him , ( K ) dressing Him in a brightly shining robe , and sent Him back to Pilate .
NASB	Luke	23	12	And so ( L ) Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that very day ; for previously , they had been enemies toward each other . Pilate Seeks Jesus ’ Release
NASB	Luke	23	13	Now Pilate summoned to himself the chief priests , the [ f ] ( M ) rulers , and the people ,
NASB	Luke	23	14	and he said to them , “ You brought this man to me on the ground that ( N ) he is inciting the people to revolt ; and behold , after examining Him before you , I ( O ) have found no basis at all in the case of this man for the charges which you are bringing against Him .
NASB	Luke	23	15	No , nor has ( P ) Herod , for he sent Him back to us ; and behold , nothing deserving death has been done by Him .
NASB	Luke	23	16	Therefore I will [ g ] ( Q ) punish Him and release Him. ”
NASB	Luke	23	17	[ [ h ] Now he was obligated to release to them at the feast one prisoner . ]
NASB	Luke	23	18	But they cried out all together , saying , “ ( R ) Away with this man , and release to us Barabbas ! ”
NASB	Luke	23	19	( He was one who had been thrown into prison for a revolt that took place in the city , and for murder . )
NASB	Luke	23	20	But Pilate , wanting to release Jesus , addressed them again ,
NASB	Luke	23	21	but they kept on crying out , saying , “ Crucify , crucify Him ! ”
NASB	Luke	23	22	And he said to them a third time , “ Why , what has this man done wrong ? I have found [ i ] in His case no grounds for a sentence of death ; therefore I will [ j ] ( S ) punish Him and release Him. ”
NASB	Luke	23	24	And so Pilate decided to have their demand carried out .
NASB	Luke	23	25	And he released the man for whom they were asking , who had been thrown into prison for a revolt and murder ; but he handed Jesus over to their will . Simon Carries the Cross
NASB	Luke	23	26	( T ) And when they led Him away , they seized a man , Simon of ( U ) Cyrene , as he was coming in from the country , and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus .
NASB	Luke	23	27	Now following Him was a large crowd of the people , and of women who were [ k ] ( V ) mourning and grieving for Him .
NASB	Luke	23	28	But Jesus turned to them and said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , stop weeping for Me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
NASB	Luke	23	29	For behold , days are coming when they will say , ‘ ( W ) Blessed are those who can not bear , and the wombs that have not given birth , and the breasts that have not nursed. ’
NASB	Luke	23	30	Then they will begin to ( X ) say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us , ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us. ’
NASB	Luke	23	31	For if they do these things [ l ] when the tree is green , what will happen [ m ] when it is dry ? ”
NASB	Luke	23	32	( Y ) Now two others , who were criminals , were also being led away to be put to death with Him . The Crucifixion
NASB	Luke	23	33	( Z ) And when they came to the place called [ n ] The Skull , there they crucified Him and the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
NASB	Luke	23	34	[ [ o ] But Jesus was saying , “ ( AA ) Father , forgive them ; for they do not know what they are doing. ” ] ( AB ) And they cast lots , dividing His garments among themselves .
NASB	Luke	23	35	And the people stood by , watching . And even the ( AC ) rulers were sneering at Him , saying , “ He saved others ; ( AD ) let Him save Himself if this is the [ p ] Christ of God , His Chosen One. ”
NASB	Luke	23	36	The soldiers also ridiculed Him , coming up to Him , ( AE ) offering Him sour wine ,
NASB	Luke	23	37	and saying , “ ( AF ) If You are the King of the Jews , save Yourself ! ”
NASB	Luke	23	38	Now there was also an inscription above Him , “ ( AG ) THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. ”
NASB	Luke	23	39	( AH ) One of the criminals who were hanged there was [ q ] hurling abuse at Him , saying , “ Are You not the [ r ] Christ ? ( AI ) Save Yourself and us ! ”
NASB	Luke	23	40	But the other responded , and rebuking him , said , “ Do you not even fear God , since you are under the same sentence of condemnation ?
NASB	Luke	23	41	And we indeed are suffering justly , for we are receiving [ s ] what we deserve for our crimes ; but this man has done nothing wrong. ”
NASB	Luke	23	42	And he was saying , “ Jesus , remember me when You come into Your kingdom ! ”
NASB	Luke	23	43	And He said to him , “ Truly I say to you , today you will be with Me in ( AJ ) Paradise. ”
NASB	Luke	23	44	( AK ) It was now about [ t ] ( AL ) the sixth hour , and darkness came over the entire land until [ u ] the ninth hour ,
NASB	Luke	23	45	[ v ] because the sun stopped shining ; and ( AM ) the veil of the temple was torn [ w ] in two .
NASB	Luke	23	46	And Jesus , ( AN ) crying out with a loud voice , said , “ Father , ( AO ) into Your hands I entrust My spirit. ” And having said this , He [ x ] died .
NASB	Luke	23	47	( AP ) Now when the centurion saw what had happened , he began ( AQ ) praising God , saying , “ This man was in fact [ y ] innocent. ”
NASB	Luke	23	48	And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle , after watching what had happened , began to return home , [ z ] ( AR ) beating their chests .
NASB	Luke	23	49	( AS ) And all His acquaintances and ( AT ) the women who accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance , seeing these things . Jesus Is Buried
NASB	Luke	23	50	( AU ) And a man named Joseph , who was a ( AV ) member of the Council , a good and righteous man
NASB	Luke	23	51	( he had not consented to their plan and action ) , a man from Arimathea , a city of the Jews , who was ( AW ) waiting for the kingdom of God—
NASB	Luke	23	52	this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
NASB	Luke	23	53	And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock , where no one had ever lain .
NASB	Luke	23	54	It was a [ aa ] ( AX ) preparation day , and a Sabbath was about to [ ab ] begin .
NASB	Luke	23	55	Now ( AY ) the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed , and they saw the tomb and how His body was laid .
NASB	Luke	23	56	And then they returned and ( AZ ) prepared spices and perfumes . And ( BA ) on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment .

NASB	Luke	24	24	And so some of those who were with us went to the tomb , and found it just exactly as the women also had said ; but Him they did not see. ”
NASB	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
NASB	Luke	24	3	but when they entered , they did not find the body of ( B ) the Lord Jesus .
NASB	Luke	24	4	While they were perplexed about this , behold , ( C ) two men suddenly ( D ) stood near them in gleaming clothing ;
NASB	Luke	24	5	and as [ a ] the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground , the men said to them , “ Why are you seeking the living One among the dead ?
NASB	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but He ( E ) has [ b ] risen . Remember how He spoke to you ( F ) while He was still in Galilee ,
NASB	Luke	24	7	miles or 11.3 km ; a Roman stadion perhaps averaged
NASB	Luke	24	8	And ( H ) they remembered His words ,
NASB	Luke	24	9	and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
NASB	Luke	24	10	Now these women were ( I ) Mary Magdalene , Joanna , and Mary the mother of James ; also the other women with them were telling these things to ( J ) the apostles .
NASB	Luke	24	11	But these words appeared [ c ] to them as nonsense , and they ( K ) would not believe [ d ] the women .
NASB	Luke	24	12	Nevertheless , Peter got up and ( L ) ran to the tomb ; and when he stooped and looked in , he * saw the linen wrappings [ e ] only ; and he went away ( M ) to his [ f ] home , marveling at what had happened . The Road to Emmaus
NASB	Luke	24	13	And behold , on that very day ( N ) two of them were going to a village named Emmaus , which was [ g ] sixty stadia from Jerusalem .
NASB	Luke	24	14	And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place .
NASB	Luke	24	15	While they were talking and discussing , Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them .
NASB	Luke	24	16	But ( O ) their eyes were kept from recognizing Him .
NASB	Luke	24	17	And He said to them , “ What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking ? ” And they came to a stop , looking sad .
NASB	Luke	24	18	One of them , named Cleopas , answered and said to Him , “ Are You possibly the only one living near Jerusalem [ h ] who does not know about the things that happened here in these days ? ”
NASB	Luke	24	19	And He said to them , “ What sort of things ? ” And they said to Him , “ Those about ( P ) Jesus the Nazarene , who proved to be a ( Q ) prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people ,
NASB	Luke	24	20	and how the chief priests and our ( R ) rulers handed Him over to be sentenced to death , and crucified Him .
NASB	Luke	24	21	But we [ i ] were hoping that it was He who was going to ( S ) redeem Israel . Indeed , besides all this , it is now the third day since these things happened .
NASB	Luke	24	22	But also some women among us left us bewildered . ( T ) When they were at the tomb early in the morning ,
NASB	Luke	24	23	and did not find His body , they came , saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive .
NASB	Luke	24	25	And then He said to them , “ [ j ] You foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that ( U ) the prophets have spoken !
NASB	Luke	24	26	( V ) Was it not necessary for the [ k ] Christ to suffer these things and to come into His glory ? ”
NASB	Luke	24	27	Then beginning [ l ] with ( W ) Moses and [ m ] with all the ( X ) Prophets , He explained to them the things written about Himself in all the Scriptures .
NASB	Luke	24	28	And they approached the village where they were going , and ( Y ) He gave the impression that He was going farther .
NASB	Luke	24	29	And so they strongly urged Him , saying , “ Stay with us , for it is getting toward evening , and the day [ n ] is now nearly over. ” So He went in to stay with them .
NASB	Luke	24	30	And it came about , when He had reclined at the table with them , that He took the bread and ( Z ) blessed it , and He broke it and began giving it to them .
NASB	Luke	24	31	And then their ( AA ) eyes were opened and they recognized Him ; and He vanished from [ o ] their sight .
NASB	Luke	24	32	They said to one another , “ [ p ] Were our hearts not burning within us when He was speaking to us on the road , while He ( AB ) was [ q ] explaining the Scriptures to us ? ”
NASB	Luke	24	33	And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem , and ( AC ) found the eleven gathered together and ( AD ) those who were with them ,
NASB	Luke	24	34	saying , “ ( AE ) The Lord has really risen and ( AF ) has appeared to Simon ! ”
NASB	Luke	24	35	They began to relate [ r ] their experiences on the road , and how ( AG ) He was recognized by them at the breaking of the bread . Other Appearances
NASB	Luke	24	36	Now while they were telling these things , ( AH ) Jesus Himself suddenly stood in their midst and * said to them , “ Peace be to you. ”
NASB	Luke	24	37	But they were startled and frightened , and thought that they were looking at ( AI ) a spirit .
NASB	Luke	24	38	And He said to them , “ Why are you frightened , and why are doubts arising in your [ s ] hearts ?
NASB	Luke	24	39	( AJ ) See My hands and My feet , that [ t ] it is I Myself ; ( AK ) touch Me and see , because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you plainly see that I have. ”
NASB	Luke	24	40	And when He had said this , He showed them His hands and His feet .
NASB	Luke	24	41	While they still [ u ] ( AL ) could not believe it because of their joy and astonishment , He said to them , “ ( AM ) Have you anything here to eat ? ”
NASB	Luke	24	42	They served Him a piece of broiled fish ;
NASB	Luke	24	43	and He took it and ( AN ) ate it in front of them .
NASB	Luke	24	44	Now He said to them , “ ( AO ) These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you , that all the things that are written about Me in the ( AP ) Law of Moses and the Prophets and ( AQ ) the Psalms must be fulfilled. ”
NASB	Luke	24	45	Then He ( AR ) opened their [ v ] minds to understand the Scriptures ,
NASB	Luke	24	46	and He said to them , “ ( AS ) So it is written , that the [ w ] Christ would suffer and ( AT ) rise from the dead on the third day ,
NASB	Luke	24	47	and that ( AU ) repentance [ x ] for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed [ y ] in His name to ( AV ) all the nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
NASB	Luke	24	48	You are ( AW ) witnesses of these things .
NASB	Luke	24	49	And behold , ( AX ) I am sending the promise of My Father upon you ; but ( AY ) you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high. ” The Ascension
NASB	Luke	24	50	And He led them out as far as ( AZ ) Bethany , and He lifted up His hands and blessed them .
NASB	Luke	24	51	While He was blessing them , He parted from them and was carried up into heaven .

NASB	John	1	6	A man [ d ] came , one sent from God , and his name was ( I ) John .
NASB	John	1	7	[ e ] He came [ f ] ( J ) as a witness , to testify about the Light , ( K ) so that all might believe through him .
NASB	John	1	8	[ g ] ( L ) He was not the Light , but he came to testify about the Light .
NASB	John	1	9	[ h ] This was ( M ) the true Light [ i ] that , coming into the world , enlightens every person .
NASB	John	1	10	He was in the world , and ( N ) the world came into being through Him , and yet the world did not [ j ] know Him .
NASB	John	1	11	He came to His [ k ] own , and His own people did not [ l ] accept Him .

NASB	John	1	14	And ( R ) the Word ( S ) became flesh , and ( T ) dwelt among us ; and ( U ) we saw His glory , glory as of the only Son from the Father , full of ( V ) grace and ( W ) truth .
NASB	John	1	15	John * ( X ) testified about Him and called out , saying , “ This was He of whom I said , ‘ ( Y ) He who is coming after me has proved to be [ q ] my superior , ( Z ) because He existed before me. ’ ”
NASB	John	1	16	For of His ( AA ) fullness [ r ] we have all received , and [ s ] grace upon grace .
NASB	John	1	17	For ( AB ) the Law was given through Moses ; ( AC ) grace and ( AD ) truth [ t ] were realized through Jesus Christ .
NASB	John	1	18	( AE ) No one has seen God at any time ; ( AF ) God the only Son , who is ( AG ) in the [ u ] arms of the Father , ( AH ) He has [ v ] explained Him . The Testimony of John the Baptist
NASB	John	1	19	This is ( AI ) the testimony of John , when ( AJ ) the Jews sent priests and Levites to him ( AK ) from Jerusalem to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
NASB	John	1	20	And he confessed and did not deny ; and this is what he confessed : “ ( AL ) I am not the [ w ] Christ. ”
NASB	John	1	21	And so they asked him , “ What then ? Are you ( AM ) Elijah ? ” And he * said , “ I am not. ” “ Are you ( AN ) the Prophet ? ” And he answered , “ No. ”
NASB	John	1	22	Then they said to him , “ Who are you ? Tell us , so that we may give an answer to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
NASB	John	1	23	He said , “ I am ( AO ) the voice of one calling [ x ] out in the wilderness , ‘ Make the way of the Lord straight , ’ as Isaiah the prophet said. ”
NASB	John	1	24	And the messengers had been sent from the Pharisees .
NASB	John	1	25	They asked him , and said to him , “ Why then are you baptizing , if you are not the [ y ] Christ , nor Elijah , nor ( AP ) the Prophet ? ”
NASB	John	1	26	John answered them , saying , “ ( AQ ) I baptize [ z ] in water , but among you stands One whom you do not know .
NASB	John	1	27	It is ( AR ) He who comes after me , of whom I am not worthy even to untie the ( AS ) strap of His sandal. ”
NASB	John	1	28	These things took place in Bethany ( AT ) beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing people .
NASB	John	1	29	The next day he * saw Jesus coming to him , and * said , “ Behold , ( AU ) the Lamb of God who ( AV ) takes away the sin of the world !
NASB	John	1	30	This is He in behalf of whom I said , ‘ ( AW ) After me is coming a Man who has proved to be [ aa ] my superior , ( AX ) because He existed before me. ’
NASB	John	1	31	And I did not recognize [ ab ] Him , but so that He would be revealed to Israel , I came baptizing [ ac ] in water. ”
NASB	John	1	32	And John ( AY ) testified , saying , “ ( AZ ) I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven , and He remained upon Him .
NASB	John	1	33	And I did not recognize [ ad ] Him , but He who sent me to baptize [ ae ] in water said to me , ‘ He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him , ( BA ) this is the One who baptizes [ af ] in the Holy Spirit. ’
NASB	John	1	34	And I myself have seen , and have testified that this is ( BB ) the [ ag ] Son of God. ” Jesus ’ Public Ministry ; First Converts
NASB	John	1	35	Again ( BC ) the next day John was standing [ ah ] with two of his disciples ,
NASB	John	1	36	and he looked at Jesus as He walked , and * said , “ Behold , ( BD ) the Lamb of God ! ”
NASB	John	1	37	And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
NASB	John	1	38	And Jesus turned and saw them following , and * said to them , “ What are you seeking ? ” They said to Him , “ ( BE ) Rabbi ( which translated means Teacher ) , where are You staying ? ”
NASB	John	1	39	He * said to them , “ Come , and you will see. ” So they came and saw where He was staying , and they stayed with Him that day ; it was about the [ ai ] tenth hour .
NASB	John	1	40	( BF ) One of the two who heard John speak , and followed Him , was Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother .
NASB	John	1	41	He first * found his own brother Simon and * said to him , “ We have found the ( BG ) Messiah ” ( which translated means [ aj ] Christ ) .
NASB	John	1	42	He brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon the son of [ ak ] ( BH ) John ; you shall be called ( BI ) Cephas ” ( which is translated [ al ] ( BJ ) Peter ) .
NASB	John	1	43	( BK ) The next day He [ am ] decided to go to ( BL ) Galilee , and He * found ( BM ) Philip . And Jesus * said to him , “ ( BN ) Follow Me. ”
NASB	John	1	44	Now ( BO ) Philip was from ( BP ) Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
NASB	John	1	45	( BQ ) Philip * found ( BR ) Nathanael and * said to him , “ We have found Him of whom ( BS ) Moses wrote in the Law , and ( BT ) the prophets also wrote : Jesus ( BU ) the son of Joseph , from ( BV ) Nazareth ! ”
NASB	John	1	46	Nathanael said to him , “ ( BW ) Can anything good be from Nazareth ? ” ( BX ) Philip * said to him , “ Come and see. ”
NASB	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him , and * said of him , “ Here is truly an ( BY ) Israelite , in whom there is no deceit ! ”
NASB	John	1	48	Nathanael * said to Him , “ How do You know me ? ” Jesus answered and said to him , “ Before ( BZ ) Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you. ”
NASB	John	1	49	Nathanael answered Him , “ ( CA ) Rabbi , You are ( CB ) the Son of God ; You are the ( CC ) King of Israel ! ”
NASB	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree , do you believe ? You will see greater things than these. ”
NASB	John	1	51	And He * said to him , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , you will see ( CD ) heaven opened and ( CE ) the angels of God ascending and descending on ( CF ) the Son of Man. ” Footnotes - John 1:2 Lit This one - John 1:3 One early ms nothing came into - John 1:5 Or overpower - John 1:6 Or came into being - John 1:7 Lit This one - John 1:7 Lit for testimony - John 1:8 Lit That one ; i.e. , John - John 1:9 I.e. , the Word , Christ - John 1:9 Or that enlightens every person coming into the world - John 1:10 Or acknowledge - John 1:11 Or own things , possessions , domain - John 1:11 Or receive - John 1:12 Or all who received - John 1:12 Or trust in - John 1:13 Or fathered - John 1:13 Lit bloods - John 1:15 Lit before me - John 1:16 Lit we all received - John 1:16 Lit grace for grace - John 1:17 Lit came to be - John 1:18 Lit chest ; or possibly lap - John 1:18 I.e. , given a detailed account of - John 1:20 I.e. , Messiah - John 1:23 Or out , In the wilderness make the way - John 1:25 I.e. , Messiah - John 1:26 The Gr here can be translated in , with , or by - John 1:30 Lit before me - John 1:31 I.e. , as the Messiah - John 1:31 The Gr here can be translated in , with , or by - John 1:33 I.e. , as the Messiah - John 1:33 The Gr here can be translated in , with , or by - John 1:33 The Gr here can be translated in , with , or by - John 1:34 One early ms Chosen One of - John 1:35 Lit and - John 1:39 I.e. , about

NASB	John	2	2	and both Jesus and His ( D ) disciples were invited to the wedding .
NASB	John	2	3	When the wine ran out , the mother of Jesus * said to Him , “ They have no wine. ”
NASB	John	2	4	And Jesus * said to her , “ [ a ] ( E ) What business do you have with Me , ( F ) woman ? ( G ) My hour has not yet come. ”
NASB	John	2	5	His ( H ) mother * said to the servants , “ Whatever He tells you , do it. ”
NASB	John	2	6	Now there were six stone waterpots standing there ( I ) for the Jewish custom of purification , containing [ b ] two or three measures each .
NASB	John	2	7	Jesus * said to them , “ Fill the waterpots with water. ” So they filled them up to the brim .
NASB	John	2	8	And He * said to them , “ Draw some out now and take it to the [ c ] headwaiter. ” And they took it to him .
NASB	John	2	9	Now when the headwaiter tasted the water ( J ) which had become wine , and did not know where it came from ( but the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , the headwaiter * called the groom ,
NASB	John	2	10	and * said to him , “ Every man serves the good wine first , and when the guests ( K ) are drunk , then he serves the poorer wine ; but you have kept the good wine until now. ”
NASB	John	2	11	This beginning of His [ d ] ( L ) signs Jesus did in Cana of ( M ) Galilee , and revealed His ( N ) glory ; and His disciples believed in Him .
NASB	John	2	12	After this He went down to ( O ) Capernaum , He and His ( P ) mother , and His ( Q ) brothers and His ( R ) disciples ; and they stayed there a few days . First Passover—Cleansing the Temple
NASB	John	2	13	( S ) The Passover of the Jews was near , and Jesus ( T ) went up to Jerusalem .
NASB	John	2	14	( U ) And within the temple grounds He found those who were selling oxen , sheep , and doves , and the money changers seated at their tables .
NASB	John	2	15	And He made a whip of [ e ] cords , and drove them all out of the temple area , with the sheep and the oxen ; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables ;
NASB	John	2	16	and to those who were selling ( V ) the doves He said , “ Take these things away from here ; stop making ( W ) My Father ’ s house a [ f ] place of business ! ”
NASB	John	2	17	His ( X ) disciples remembered that it was written : “ ( Y ) Zeal for Your house will consume me. ”
NASB	John	2	18	or
NASB	John	2	19	Jesus answered them , “ ( AB ) Destroy this [ h ] temple , and in three days I will raise it up. ”
NASB	John	2	20	( AC ) The Jews then said , “ It took ( AD ) forty-six years to build this [ i ] temple , and yet You will raise it up in three days ? ”
NASB	John	2	21	But He was speaking about ( AE ) the [ j ] temple of His body .
NASB	John	2	22	So when He was raised from the dead , His ( AF ) disciples ( AG ) remembered that He said this ; and they believed ( AH ) the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken .
NASB	John	2	23	Now when He was in Jerusalem at ( AI ) the Passover , during the feast , many believed in His name as they ( AJ ) observed His signs which He was doing .
NASB	John	2	24	But Jesus , on His part , was not entrusting Himself to them , because ( AK ) He knew all people ,
NASB	John	2	25	and because He did not need anyone to testify about mankind , ( AL ) for He Himself knew what was in mankind . Footnotes - John 2:4 Lit What to Me and to you ( an ancient idiom ) - John 2:6 About

NASB	John	3	3	Jesus responded and said to him , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless someone ( F ) is born [ c ] again he can not see ( G ) the kingdom of God. ”
NASB	John	3	2	this man came to [ a ] Jesus at night and said to Him , “ ( C ) Rabbi , we know that You have come from God as a teacher ; for no one can do these [ b ] ( D ) signs that You do unless ( E ) God is with him. ”
NASB	John	3	4	Nicodemus * said to Him , “ How can a person be born when he is old ? He can not enter his mother ’ s womb a second time and be born , can he ? ”
NASB	John	3	5	Jesus answered , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless someone is born of ( H ) water and the Spirit , he can not enter ( I ) the kingdom of God .
NASB	John	3	6	( J ) That which has been born of the flesh is flesh , and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit .
NASB	John	3	7	Do not be amazed that I said to you , ‘ You must be born [ d ] again. ’
NASB	John	3	8	( K ) The wind blows where it wishes , and you hear the sound of it , but you do not know where it is coming from and where it is going ; so is everyone who has been born of the Spirit. ”
NASB	John	3	9	Nicodemus responded and said to Him , “ How can these things be ? ”
NASB	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said to him , “ You are ( L ) the teacher of Israel , and yet you do not understand these things ?
NASB	John	3	11	Truly , truly , I say to you , ( M ) we speak of what we know and ( N ) testify of what we have seen , and ( O ) you people do not accept our testimony .
NASB	John	3	12	If I told you earthly things and you do not believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
NASB	John	3	13	( P ) No one has ascended into heaven , except ( Q ) He who descended from heaven : ( R ) the Son of Man .
NASB	John	3	14	And just as ( S ) Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , so must ( T ) the Son of Man ( U ) be lifted up ,
NASB	John	3	15	so that everyone who [ e ] believes will ( V ) have eternal life in Him .
NASB	John	3	16	“ For God so ( W ) loved the world , that He ( X ) gave His ( Y ) only Son , so that everyone who ( Z ) believes in Him will not perish , but have eternal life .
NASB	John	3	17	For God ( AA ) did not send the Son into the world ( AB ) to judge the world , but so that the world might be saved through Him .
NASB	John	3	18	( AC ) The one who believes in Him is not judged ; the one who does not believe has been judged already , because he has not believed in the name of ( AD ) the only Son of God .
NASB	John	3	19	And this is the judgment , that ( AE ) the Light has come into the world , and people loved the darkness rather than the Light ; for ( AF ) their deeds were evil .
NASB	John	3	20	( AG ) For everyone who does evil hates the Light , and does not come to the Light , so that his deeds will not be exposed .
NASB	John	3	21	But the one who ( AH ) practices the truth comes to the Light , so that his deeds will be revealed [ f ] as having been performed in God. ” John the Baptist ’ s Last Testimony
NASB	John	3	22	After these things Jesus and His ( AI ) disciples came into the land of Judea ; and there He was spending time with them and ( AJ ) baptizing .
NASB	John	3	23	Now John also was baptizing in Aenon , near Salim , because there was an abundance of water there ; and people were coming and being baptized—
NASB	John	3	24	for ( AK ) John had not yet been thrown into prison .
NASB	John	3	25	Then a matter of dispute developed on the part of John ’ s disciples with a Jew about [ g ] ( AL ) purification .
NASB	John	3	26	And they came to John and said to him , “ ( AM ) Rabbi , He who was with you ( AN ) beyond the Jordan , to whom you ( AO ) have testified—behold , He is baptizing and all the people are coming to Him. ”
NASB	John	3	27	John replied , “ ( AP ) A person can receive not even one thing unless it ( AQ ) has been given to him from heaven .
NASB	John	3	28	You yourselves [ h ] are my witnesses that I said , ‘ ( AR ) I am not the [ i ] Christ , ’ but , ‘ I have been sent ahead of Him. ’
NASB	John	3	29	He who has the bride is ( AS ) the groom ; but the friend of the groom , who stands and listens to him , rejoices greatly because of the groom ’ s voice . So this ( AT ) joy of mine has been made full .
NASB	John	3	30	He must [ j ] increase , but I must [ k ] decrease .
NASB	John	3	31	“ ( AU ) He who comes from above is above all ; ( AV ) the one who is only from the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth . ( AW ) He who comes from heaven is above all .
NASB	John	3	32	What He has seen and heard , of this He ( AX ) testifies ; and ( AY ) no one accepts His testimony .
NASB	John	3	33	The one who has accepted His testimony ( AZ ) has certified that God is true .
NASB	John	3	34	For He whom God ( BA ) sent speaks the words of God ; ( BB ) for He does not give the Spirit [ l ] sparingly .
NASB	John	3	35	( BC ) The Father loves the Son and ( BD ) has entrusted all things to His hand .
NASB	John	3	36	The one who ( BE ) believes in the Son has eternal life ; but the one who ( BF ) does not [ m ] obey the Son will not see life , but the wrath of God remains on him. ” Footnotes - John 3:2 Lit Him - John 3:2 I.e. , confirming miracles - John 3:3 Or from above - John 3:7 Or from above - John 3:15 Or believes in Him will have eternal life - John 3:21 Lit that they have been - John 3:25 I.e. , ceremonial washing - John 3:28 Lit testify for me - John 3:28 I.e. , Messiah - John 3:30 Or become greater - John 3:30 Or become less important - John 3:34 Lit from measure - John 3:36 I.e. , in belief New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	John	4	4	And He had to pass through ( G ) Samaria .
NASB	John	4	2	( although ( C ) Jesus Himself was not baptizing ; rather , His ( D ) disciples were ) ,
NASB	John	4	3	He left ( E ) Judea and went away ( F ) again to Galilee .
NASB	John	4	5	So He * came to a city of ( H ) Samaria called Sychar , near ( I ) the parcel of land that ( J ) Jacob gave to his son Joseph ;
NASB	John	4	6	and Jacob ’ s well was there . So Jesus , tired from His journey , was just sitting by the well . It was about [ b ] the sixth hour . The Woman of Samaria
NASB	John	4	7	A woman of Samaria * came to draw water . Jesus * said to her , “ Give Me a drink. ”
NASB	John	4	8	For His ( K ) disciples had gone away to ( L ) the city to buy food .
NASB	John	4	9	So the ( M ) Samaritan woman * said to Him , “ How is it that You , though You are a Jew , are asking me for a drink , though I am a Samaritan woman ? ” ( For ( N ) Jews do not associate with Samaritans . )
NASB	John	4	10	Jesus replied to her , “ If you knew the gift of God , and who it is who is saying to you , ‘ Give Me a drink , ’ you would have asked Him , and He would have given you ( O ) living water. ”
NASB	John	4	11	She * said to Him , “ [ c ] Sir , You have no bucket and the well is deep ; where then do You get this ( P ) living water ?
NASB	John	4	12	You are not greater than our father Jacob , are You , who ( Q ) gave us the well and drank of it himself , and his sons and his cattle ? ”
NASB	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said to her , “ Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again ;
NASB	John	4	14	but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him ( R ) shall never be thirsty ; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to ( S ) eternal life. ”
NASB	John	4	15	The woman * said to Him , “ [ d ] Sir , ( T ) give me this water so that I will not be thirsty , nor come all the way here to draw water. ”
NASB	John	4	16	He * said to her , “ Go , call your husband and come here. ”
NASB	John	4	17	The woman answered and said to Him , “ I have no husband. ” Jesus * said to her , “ You have correctly said , ‘ I have no husband ’ ;
NASB	John	4	18	for you have had five husbands , and the one whom you now have is not your husband ; this which you have said is true. ”
NASB	John	4	19	The woman * said to Him , “ [ e ] Sir , I perceive that You are ( U ) a prophet .
NASB	John	4	20	( V ) Our fathers worshiped on ( W ) this mountain , and yet you Jews say that ( X ) in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship. ”
NASB	John	4	21	Jesus * said to her , “ Believe Me , woman , that [ f ] ( Y ) a time is coming when you will worship the Father ( Z ) neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
NASB	John	4	22	( AA ) You Samaritans worship what you do not know ; we worship what we do know , because ( AB ) salvation is from the Jews .
NASB	John	4	23	But [ g ] ( AC ) a time is coming , and [ h ] even now has arrived , when the true worshipers will worship the Father ( AD ) in spirit and truth ; for such people the Father seeks to be [ i ] His worshipers .
NASB	John	4	24	God is [ j ] spirit , and those who worship Him must worship ( AE ) in spirit and truth. ”
NASB	John	4	25	The woman * said to Him , “ I know that ( AF ) Messiah is coming ( ( AG ) He who is called Christ ) ; when that One comes , He will declare all things to us. ”
NASB	John	4	26	Jesus * said to her , “ ( AH ) I am He , the One speaking to you. ”
NASB	John	4	27	And at this point His ( AI ) disciples came , and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman , yet no one said , “ What are You seeking ? ” or , “ Why are You speaking with her ? ”
NASB	John	4	28	So the woman left her waterpot and went into the city , and * said to the people ,
NASB	John	4	29	“ Come , see a man ( AJ ) who told me all the things that I have done ; ( AK ) this is not the [ k ] Christ , is He ? ”
NASB	John	4	30	They left the city and were coming to Him .
NASB	John	4	31	Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him , saying , “ ( AL ) Rabbi , eat something. ”
NASB	John	4	32	But He said to them , “ I have food to eat that you do not know about. ”
NASB	John	4	33	So the ( AM ) disciples were saying to one another , “ No one brought Him anything to eat , did he ? ”
NASB	John	4	34	Jesus * said to them , “ My food is to ( AN ) do the will of Him who sent Me , and to ( AO ) accomplish His work .
NASB	John	4	35	Do you not say , ‘ There are still four months , and then comes the harvest ’ ? Behold , I tell you , raise your eyes and observe the fields , that they are white ( AP ) for harvest .
NASB	John	4	36	Already the one who reaps is receiving ( AQ ) wages and is gathering ( AR ) fruit for ( AS ) eternal life , so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together .
NASB	John	4	37	For in this case the saying is true : ‘ ( AT ) One sows and another reaps. ’
NASB	John	4	38	I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored ; others have labored , and you have [ l ] come into their labor. ” The Samaritans
NASB	John	4	39	Now from ( AU ) that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified , “ ( AV ) He told me all the things that I have done. ”
NASB	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to [ m ] Jesus , they were asking Him to stay with them ; and He stayed there two days .
NASB	John	4	41	Many more believed because of His word ;
NASB	John	4	42	and they were saying to the woman , “ It is no longer because of what you said that we believe , for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One truly is ( AW ) the Savior of the world. ”
NASB	John	4	43	And after ( AX ) the two days , He departed from there for Galilee .
NASB	John	4	44	For Jesus Himself testified that ( AY ) a prophet has no honor in his own country .
NASB	John	4	45	So when He came to Galilee , the Galileans received Him , only because ( AZ ) they had seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast ; for they themselves also went to the feast . Healing an Official ’ s Son
NASB	John	4	46	Therefore He came again to ( BA ) Cana of Galilee , ( BB ) where He had made the water into wine . And there was a royal official whose son was sick at ( BC ) Capernaum .
NASB	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus had come ( BD ) from Judea into Galilee , he went to Him and began asking Him to come down and heal his son ; for he was at the point of death .
NASB	John	4	48	Then Jesus said to him , “ Unless you people see [ n ] ( BE ) signs and ( BF ) wonders , you simply will not believe. ”
NASB	John	4	49	The royal official * said to Him , “ [ o ] Sir , come down before my child dies. ”
NASB	John	4	50	Jesus * said to him , “ ( BG ) Go ; your son [ p ] is alive. ” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went home .
NASB	John	4	51	And as he was now going down , his slaves met him , saying that his [ q ] son was [ r ] alive .
NASB	John	4	52	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better . Then they said to him , “ Yesterday at the [ s ] seventh hour the fever left him. ”
NASB	John	4	53	So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him , “ Your son is alive ” ; and he himself believed , and ( BH ) his entire household .
NASB	John	4	54	This is again a ( BI ) second [ t ] sign that Jesus performed when He had ( BJ ) come from Judea into Galilee .

NASB	John	5	5	Now a man was there who had been [ f ] ill for thirty-eight years .
NASB	John	5	2	Now in Jerusalem , by ( B ) the Sheep Gate , there is a pool which ( C ) in [ a ] Hebrew is called [ b ] Bethesda , having five [ c ] porticoes .
NASB	John	5	3	, and v
NASB	John	5	6	Jesus , upon seeing this man lying there and knowing that he had already been in that condition for a long time , * said to him , “ Do you want to get well ? ”
NASB	John	5	7	The sick man answered Him , “ Sir , I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up , but while I am coming , another steps down before me. ”
NASB	John	5	8	Jesus * said to him , “ ( D ) Get up , pick up your pallet and walk. ”
NASB	John	5	9	Immediately the man became well , and picked up his pallet and began to walk . ( E ) Now it was a Sabbath on that day .
NASB	John	5	10	So ( F ) the Jews were saying to the man who was cured , “ It is a Sabbath , and ( G ) it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet. ”
NASB	John	5	11	But he answered them , “ He who made me well was the one who said to me , ‘ Pick up your pallet and walk. ’ ”
NASB	John	5	12	They asked him , “ Who is the man who said to you , ‘ Pick it up and walk ’ ? ”
NASB	John	5	13	But the man who was healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place .
NASB	John	5	14	Afterward , Jesus * found him in the temple and said to him , “ Behold , you have become well ; do not ( H ) sin anymore , ( I ) so that nothing worse happens to you. ”
NASB	John	5	15	The man went away , and informed ( J ) the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
NASB	John	5	16	For this reason ( K ) the Jews were persecuting Jesus , because He was doing these things on a Sabbath .
NASB	John	5	17	But He answered them , “ My Father [ g ] is working until now , and I Myself am working. ” Jesus ’ Equality with God
NASB	John	5	18	For this reason therefore ( L ) the Jews ( M ) were seeking all the more to kill Him , because He not only was breaking the Sabbath , but also was calling God His own Father , ( N ) making Himself equal with God .
NASB	John	5	19	Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , ( O ) the Son can do nothing of Himself , unless it is something He sees the Father doing ; for whatever [ h ] the Father does , these things the Son also does in the same way .
NASB	John	5	20	( P ) For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing ; and the Father will show Him ( Q ) greater works than these , so that you will be amazed .
NASB	John	5	21	For just as the Father raises the dead and ( R ) gives them life , so ( S ) the Son also gives life to whom He wishes .
NASB	John	5	22	For not even the Father judges anyone , but ( T ) He has given all judgment to the Son ,
NASB	John	5	23	so that all will honor the Son just as they honor the Father . ( U ) The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him .
NASB	John	5	24	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , the one who hears My word , and ( V ) believes Him who sent Me , has eternal life , and ( W ) does not come into judgment , but has ( X ) passed out of death into life . Two Resurrections
NASB	John	5	25	Truly , truly , I say to you , [ i ] ( Y ) a time is coming and [ j ] even now has arrived , when ( Z ) the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who ( AA ) hear will live .
NASB	John	5	26	For just as the Father has life in Himself , so He ( AB ) gave to the Son also to have life in Himself ;
NASB	John	5	27	and He gave Him authority to ( AC ) execute judgment , because He is [ k ] the Son of Man .
NASB	John	5	28	Do not be amazed at this ; for [ l ] ( AD ) a time is coming when ( AE ) all who are in the tombs will hear His voice ,
NASB	John	5	29	and will come out : ( AF ) those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life , those who committed the bad deeds to a resurrection of judgment .
NASB	John	5	30	“ ( AG ) I can do nothing [ m ] on My own . As I hear , I judge ; and ( AH ) My judgment is [ n ] righteous , because I do not seek My own will but ( AI ) the will of Him who sent Me .
NASB	John	5	31	“ ( AJ ) If I alone testify about Myself , My testimony is not [ o ] true .
NASB	John	5	32	There is ( AK ) another who testifies about Me , and I know that the testimony which He gives about Me is true . Testimony of John the Baptist
NASB	John	5	33	You have sent messengers to John , and he ( AL ) has testified to the truth .
NASB	John	5	34	But ( AM ) the testimony I receive is not from man , but I say these things so that you may be saved .
NASB	John	5	35	He was ( AN ) the lamp that was burning and shining , and you ( AO ) were willing to rejoice for [ p ] a while in his light . Testimony of Works
NASB	John	5	36	But the testimony I have is greater than the testimony of John ; for ( AP ) the works which the Father has given Me ( AQ ) to accomplish—the very works that I do—testify about Me , that the Father ( AR ) has sent Me . Testimony of the Father
NASB	John	5	37	And the Father who sent Me , ( AS ) He has testified about Me . You have neither heard His voice at any time , nor seen His form .
NASB	John	5	38	Also you do not have ( AT ) His word remaining in you , because you do not believe Him whom He ( AU ) sent . Testimony of the Scripture
NASB	John	5	39	[ q ] ( AV ) You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and it is ( AW ) those very Scriptures that testify about Me ;
NASB	John	5	40	and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life .
NASB	John	5	41	( AX ) I do not receive glory from people ;
NASB	John	5	42	but I know you , that you do not have the love of God in yourselves .
NASB	John	5	43	I have come in My Father ’ s name , and you do not [ r ] receive Me ; ( AY ) if another comes in his own name , you will [ s ] receive him .
NASB	John	5	44	How can you believe , when you [ t ] ( AZ ) accept [ u ] glory from one another and you do not seek ( BA ) the [ v ] glory that is from ( BB ) the one and only God ?
NASB	John	5	45	Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father ; the one who accuses you is ( BC ) Moses , in whom you have put your hope .
NASB	John	5	46	For if you believed Moses , you would believe Me ; for ( BD ) he wrote about Me .
NASB	John	5	47	But ( BE ) if you do not believe his writings , how will you believe My words ? ” Footnotes - John 5:2 I.e. , Jewish Aramaic - John 5:2 Some early mss Bethsaida or Bethzatha - John 5:2 Or colonnades ( with roofs ) - John 5:3 Or had shrunken limbs - John 5:3 Late mss add the following as the remainder of v

NASB	John	6	6	But He was saying this only to ( H ) test him , for He Himself knew what He intended to do .
NASB	John	6	2	A large crowd was following Him , because they were watching the [ a ] ( D ) signs which He was performing on those who were sick .
NASB	John	6	3	But ( E ) Jesus went up on the mountain , and there He sat with His disciples .
NASB	John	6	4	Now ( F ) the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was near .
NASB	John	6	5	So Jesus , after raising His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him , * said to ( G ) Philip , “ Where are we to buy bread so that these people may eat ? ”
NASB	John	6	7	( I ) Philip answered Him , “ ( J ) Two hundred [ b ] denarii worth of bread is not enough for them , for each to receive just a little ! ”
NASB	John	6	8	One of His ( K ) disciples , ( L ) Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , * said to Him ,
NASB	John	6	9	“ There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two ( M ) fish ; but what are these for so many people ? ”
NASB	John	6	10	Jesus said , “ Have the people recline to eat. ” Now there was ( N ) plenty of grass in the place . So the men reclined , about [ c ] ( O ) five thousand in number .
NASB	John	6	11	Jesus then took the loaves , and ( P ) after giving thanks He distributed them to those who were reclining ; likewise also of the ( Q ) fish , as much as they wanted .
NASB	John	6	12	And when they had eaten their fill , He * said to His ( R ) disciples , “ Gather up the leftover pieces so that nothing will be lost. ”
NASB	John	6	13	So they gathered them up , and filled twelve ( S ) baskets with pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten .
NASB	John	6	14	Therefore when the people saw the [ d ] sign which He had performed , they said , “ This is truly the ( T ) Prophet who is to come into the world. ” Jesus Walks on the Water
NASB	John	6	15	So Jesus , aware that they [ e ] intended to come and take Him by force ( U ) to make Him king , ( V ) withdrew again to ( W ) the mountain by Himself , alone .
NASB	John	6	16	Now when evening came , His ( X ) disciples went down to the sea ,
NASB	John	6	17	and after getting into a boat , they started to cross the sea ( Y ) to Capernaum . It had already become dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them .
NASB	John	6	18	In addition , the sea began getting rough , because a strong wind was blowing .
NASB	John	6	19	Then , when they had rowed about [ f ] twenty-five or thirty stadia , they * saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat ; and they were frightened .
NASB	John	6	20	But He * said to them , “ It is I ; [ g ] ( Z ) do not be afraid. ”
NASB	John	6	21	So they were willing to take Him into the boat , and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going .
NASB	John	6	22	The next day ( AA ) the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there except one , and that Jesus ( AB ) had not gotten into the boat with His disciples , but that His disciples had departed alone .
NASB	John	6	23	Other small boats came from ( AC ) Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the ( AD ) Lord ( AE ) had given thanks .
NASB	John	6	24	So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there , nor His disciples , they themselves got into the small boats and ( AF ) came to Capernaum , looking for Jesus .
NASB	John	6	25	And when they found Him on the other side of the sea , they said to Him , “ ( AG ) Rabbi , when did You get here ? ” Words to the People
NASB	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , you ( AH ) seek Me , not because you saw [ h ] ( AI ) signs , but because you ate some of the loaves and were filled .
NASB	John	6	27	Do not ( AJ ) work for the food that perishes , but for the food that lasts for ( AK ) eternal life , which ( AL ) the Son of Man will give you , for on Him the Father , God , ( AM ) has set His [ i ] seal. ”
NASB	John	6	28	Therefore they said to Him , “ What are we to do , so that we may accomplish the works of God ? ”
NASB	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said to them , “ This is ( AN ) the work of God , that you believe in Him whom He ( AO ) has sent. ”
NASB	John	6	30	So they said to Him , “ ( AP ) What then are You doing as a ( AQ ) sign , so that we may see , and believe You ? What work are You performing ?
NASB	John	6	31	( AR ) Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written : ‘ ( AS ) He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. ’ ”
NASB	John	6	32	Jesus then said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven , but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven .
NASB	John	6	33	For the bread of God is [ j ] that which ( AT ) comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world. ”
NASB	John	6	34	Then they said to Him , “ Lord , always ( AU ) give us this bread. ”
NASB	John	6	35	Jesus said to them , “ ( AV ) I am the bread of life ; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry , and the one who believes in Me ( AW ) will never be thirsty .
NASB	John	6	36	But ( AX ) I said to you that you have indeed seen Me , and yet you do not believe .
NASB	John	6	37	( AY ) Everything that the Father gives Me will come to Me , and the one who comes to Me I certainly will not cast out .
NASB	John	6	38	For ( AZ ) I have come down from heaven , ( BA ) not to do My own will , but ( BB ) the will of Him who ( BC ) sent Me .
NASB	John	6	39	And this is the will of Him who sent Me , that of ( BD ) everything that He has given Me I will ( BE ) lose nothing , but will ( BF ) raise it up on the last day .
NASB	John	6	40	For this is the will of My Father , that everyone who ( BG ) sees the Son and ( BH ) believes in Him will have eternal life , and I Myself will ( BI ) raise him up on the last day. ” Words to the Jews
NASB	John	6	41	( BJ ) So then the Jews were complaining about Him because He said , “ I am the bread that ( BK ) came down out of heaven. ”
NASB	John	6	42	And they were saying , “ ( BL ) Is this not Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother ( BM ) we know ? How does He now say , ‘ ( BN ) I have come down out of heaven ’ ? ”
NASB	John	6	43	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Stop complaining among yourselves .
NASB	John	6	44	No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me ( BO ) draws him ; and I will ( BP ) raise him up on the last day .
NASB	John	6	45	It is written ( BQ ) in the Prophets : ‘ ( BR ) And they shall all be ( BS ) taught of God. ’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father , comes to Me .
NASB	John	6	46	( BT ) Not that anyone has seen the Father , except the One who is from God ; He has seen the Father .
NASB	John	6	47	Truly , truly , I say to you , the one who believes ( BU ) has eternal life .
NASB	John	6	48	( BV ) I am the bread of life .
NASB	John	6	49	( BW ) Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
NASB	John	6	50	This is the bread that ( BX ) comes down out of heaven , so that anyone may eat from it and ( BY ) not die .
NASB	John	6	51	( BZ ) I am the living bread that ( CA ) came down out of heaven ; if anyone eats from this bread , ( CB ) he will live forever ; and the bread which I will give ( CC ) for the life of the world also is ( CD ) My flesh. ”
NASB	John	6	52	( CE ) Then the Jews ( CF ) began to argue with one another , saying , “ How can this man give us His flesh to eat ? ”
NASB	John	6	53	So Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of ( CG ) the Son of Man and drink His blood , you have no life in yourselves .
NASB	John	6	54	The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life , and I will ( CH ) raise him up on the last day .
NASB	John	6	55	For My flesh is true food , and My blood is true drink .
NASB	John	6	56	The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood ( CI ) remains in Me , and I in him .
NASB	John	6	57	Just as the ( CJ ) living Father ( CK ) sent Me , and I live because of the Father , the one who eats Me , he also will live because of Me .
NASB	John	6	58	This is the bread that ( CL ) came down out of heaven , not as ( CM ) the fathers ate and died ; the one who eats this bread ( CN ) will live forever. ” Words to the Disciples
NASB	John	6	59	These things He said ( CO ) in the synagogue as He taught ( CP ) in Capernaum .
NASB	John	6	60	So then many of His ( CQ ) disciples , when they heard this , said , “ ( CR ) This statement is very [ k ] unpleasant ; who can listen to it ? ”
NASB	John	6	61	But Jesus , ( CS ) aware that His disciples were complaining about this , said to them , “ Is this [ l ] ( CT ) offensive to you ?
NASB	John	6	62	What then if you see ( CU ) the Son of Man ( CV ) ascending to where He was before ?
NASB	John	6	63	( CW ) It is the Spirit who gives life ; the flesh provides no benefit ; ( CX ) the words that I have spoken to you are spirit , and are life .
NASB	John	6	64	But there are ( CY ) some of you who do not believe. ” For Jesus ( CZ ) knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe , and ( DA ) who it was who would [ m ] betray Him .
NASB	John	6	65	And He was saying , “ For this reason I have ( DB ) told you that no one can come to Me unless ( DC ) it has been granted him from the Father. ” Peter ’ s Confession of Faith
NASB	John	6	66	As a result of this many of His ( DD ) disciples ( DE ) left , and would no longer walk with Him .
NASB	John	6	67	So Jesus said to ( DF ) the twelve , “ You do not want to leave also , do you ? ”
NASB	John	6	68	( DG ) Simon Peter answered Him , “ Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have ( DH ) words of eternal life .
NASB	John	6	69	And we have already believed and have come to know that You are ( DI ) the Holy One of God. ”
NASB	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , “ ( DJ ) Did I Myself not choose you , ( DK ) the twelve ? And yet one of you is ( DL ) a devil. ”
NASB	John	6	71	Now He meant Judas ( DM ) the son of Simon Iscariot ; for he , ( DN ) one of ( DO ) the twelve , [ n ] was going to betray Him .

NASB	John	7	7	( I ) The world can not hate you , but it hates Me because I testify about it , that ( J ) its deeds are evil .
NASB	John	7	2	Now the feast of the Jews , ( D ) the Feast of Booths , was near .
NASB	John	7	3	So His ( E ) brothers said to Him , “ Move on from here and go into Judea , so that Your ( F ) disciples also may see Your works which You are doing .
NASB	John	7	4	For no one does anything in secret [ a ] when he himself is striving to be known publicly . If You are doing these things , show Yourself to the world. ”
NASB	John	7	5	For not even His ( G ) brothers believed in Him .
NASB	John	7	6	So Jesus * said to them , “ ( H ) My time is not yet here , but your time is always ready .
NASB	John	7	8	Go up to the feast yourselves ; I am not going up to this feast , because ( K ) My time has not yet fully arrived. ”
NASB	John	7	9	Now having said these things to them , He stayed in Galilee .
NASB	John	7	10	But when His ( L ) brothers had gone up to the feast , then He Himself also went up , not publicly , but as though in secret .
NASB	John	7	11	( M ) So the Jews ( N ) were looking for Him at the feast and saying , “ Where is He ? ”
NASB	John	7	12	And there was a great deal of talk about Him in secret among the crowds : ( O ) some were saying , “ He is a good man ” ; others were saying , “ No , on the contrary , He is misleading the people. ”
NASB	John	7	13	However , no one was speaking openly about Him , for ( P ) fear of [ b ] the Jews .
NASB	John	7	14	But when it was now the middle of the feast , Jesus went up into the temple area , and began to ( Q ) teach .
NASB	John	7	15	( R ) The Jews then were astonished , saying , “ How has this man ( S ) become learned , not having been educated ? ”
NASB	John	7	16	So Jesus answered them and said , “ ( T ) My teaching is not My own , but His who sent Me .
NASB	John	7	17	( U ) If anyone is willing to do His will , he will know about the teaching , whether it is of God , or I am speaking from Myself .
NASB	John	7	18	The one who speaks from himself ( V ) seeks his own glory ; but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him , He is true , and there is no unrighteousness in Him .
NASB	John	7	19	“ ( W ) Did Moses not give you the Law , and yet none of you carries out the Law ? Why are you ( X ) seeking to kill Me ? ”
NASB	John	7	20	The crowd answered , “ ( Y ) You have a demon ! Who is seeking to kill You ? ”
NASB	John	7	21	Jesus answered them , “ I did ( Z ) one [ c ] deed , and you all are astonished .
NASB	John	7	22	For this reason ( AA ) Moses has given you circumcision ( not that it is from Moses , but from ( AB ) the fathers ) , and even on a Sabbath you circumcise a man .
NASB	John	7	23	( AC ) If a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken , are you angry at Me because I made an entire man well on a Sabbath ?
NASB	John	7	24	Do not ( AD ) judge by the outward appearance , but judge [ d ] with righteous judgment. ”
NASB	John	7	25	So some of the people of Jerusalem were saying , “ Is this man not the one whom they are seeking to kill ?
NASB	John	7	26	And yet look , He is speaking publicly , and they are saying nothing to Him . ( AE ) The rulers do not really know that this is the [ e ] Christ , do they ?
NASB	John	7	27	However , ( AF ) we know where this man is from ; but when the Christ comes , no one knows where He is from. ”
NASB	John	7	28	Then Jesus cried out in the temple , ( AG ) teaching and saying , “ ( AH ) You both know Me and you know where I am from ; and ( AI ) I have not come of Myself , but He who sent Me is true , whom you do not know .
NASB	John	7	29	( AJ ) I do know Him , because ( AK ) I am from Him , and ( AL ) He sent Me. ”
NASB	John	7	30	So they ( AM ) were seeking to arrest Him ; and yet no one laid a hand on Him , because His ( AN ) hour had not yet come .
NASB	John	7	31	But ( AO ) many of the crowd believed in Him ; and they were saying , “ ( AP ) When the [ f ] Christ comes , He will not perform more [ g ] ( AQ ) signs than those which this man has done , will He ? ”
NASB	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Him , and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent ( AR ) officers to ( AS ) arrest Him .
NASB	John	7	33	Therefore Jesus said , “ ( AT ) For a little while longer I am going to be with you , and then ( AU ) I am going to Him who sent Me .
NASB	John	7	34	( AV ) You will seek Me , and will not find Me ; and where I am , you can not come. ”
NASB	John	7	35	( AW ) The Jews then said to one another , “ ( AX ) Where does this man intend to go that we will not find Him ? He does not intend to go to ( AY ) the Dispersion among ( AZ ) the Greeks , and teach the Greeks , does He ?
NASB	John	7	36	What is this statement that He said , ‘ ( BA ) You will seek Me , and will not find Me ; and where I am , you can not come ’ ? ”
NASB	John	7	37	Now on ( BB ) the last day , the great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , saying , “ ( BC ) If anyone is thirsty , [ h ] let him come to Me and drink .
NASB	John	7	38	The one who believes in Me , ( BD ) as the Scripture said , ‘ [ i ] From his innermost being will flow rivers of ( BE ) living water. ’ ”
NASB	John	7	39	But this He said ( BF ) in reference to the Spirit , whom those who believed in Him were to receive ; for ( BG ) the Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus was not yet ( BH ) glorified . People ’ s Division over Jesus
NASB	John	7	40	Some of the people therefore , after they heard these words , were saying , “ This truly is ( BI ) the Prophet. ”
NASB	John	7	41	Others were saying , “ This is the [ j ] Christ. ” But others were saying , “ ( BJ ) Surely the [ k ] Christ is not coming from Galilee , is He ?
NASB	John	7	42	Has the Scripture not said that the Christ comes from ( BK ) the descendants of David , and from Bethlehem , the village where David was ? ”
NASB	John	7	43	So ( BL ) a dissension occurred in the crowd because of Him .
NASB	John	7	44	And ( BM ) some of them wanted to arrest Him , but no one laid hands on Him .
NASB	John	7	45	The ( BN ) officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , “ Why did you not bring Him ? ”
NASB	John	7	46	The ( BO ) officers answered , “ ( BP ) Never has a man spoken in this way ! ”
NASB	John	7	47	The Pharisees then replied to them , “ ( BQ ) You have not been led astray too , have you ?
NASB	John	7	48	( BR ) Not one of ( BS ) the rulers or Pharisees has believed in Him , has he ?
NASB	John	7	49	But this crowd that does not know the Law is accursed ! ”
NASB	John	7	50	( BT ) Nicodemus ( the one who came to Him before , being one of them ) * said to them ,
NASB	John	7	51	“ ( BU ) Our Law does not judge the person unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing , does it ? ”
NASB	John	7	52	They answered and said to him , “ ( BV ) You are not from Galilee as well , are you ? Examine the Scriptures , and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee. ”

NASB	John	8	8	And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground .
NASB	John	8	2	And early in the morning He came again into the temple area , and all the people were coming to Him ; and ( B ) He sat down and began teaching them .
NASB	John	8	3	Now the scribes and the Pharisees * brought a woman caught in the act of adultery , and after placing her in the center of the courtyard ,
NASB	John	8	4	they * said to Him , “ Teacher , this woman has been caught in the very act of committing adultery .
NASB	John	8	5	Now in the Law , ( C ) Moses commanded us to stone such women ; what then do You say ? ”
NASB	John	8	6	Now they were saying this to ( D ) test Him , ( E ) so that they might have grounds for accusing Him . But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground .
NASB	John	8	7	When they persisted in asking Him , ( F ) He straightened up and said to them , “ ( G ) He who is without sin among you , let him be the ( H ) first to throw a stone at her. ”
NASB	John	8	9	Now when they heard this , they began leaving , one by one , beginning with the older ones , and He was left alone , and the woman where she was , in the center of the courtyard .
NASB	John	8	10	And ( I ) straightening up , Jesus said to her , “ Woman , where are they ? Did no one condemn you ? ”
NASB	John	8	11	She said , “ No one , [ a ] Lord. ” And Jesus said , “ ( J ) I do not condemn you , either . Go . From now on do not ( K ) sin any longer. ” ] ] Jesus Is the Light of the World
NASB	John	8	12	Then Jesus again spoke to them , saying , “ ( L ) I am the Light of the world ; ( M ) the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness , but will have the Light of life. ”
NASB	John	8	13	So the Pharisees said to Him , “ ( N ) You are testifying about Yourself ; Your testimony is not [ b ] true. ”
NASB	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said to them , “ ( O ) Even if I am testifying about Myself , My testimony is [ c ] true , because I know ( P ) where I came from and where I am going ; but ( Q ) you do not know where I come from or where I am going .
NASB	John	8	15	( R ) You judge [ d ] according to the flesh ; ( S ) I am not judging anyone .
NASB	John	8	16	But even ( T ) if I do judge , My judgment is true ; for I am not alone in it , but I and the Father who sent Me .
NASB	John	8	17	Even in ( U ) your Law it has been written that the testimony of ( V ) two people is [ e ] true .
NASB	John	8	18	I am He who testifies about Myself , and ( W ) the Father who sent Me testifies about Me. ”
NASB	John	8	19	So they were saying to Him , “ Where is Your Father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You know neither Me nor My Father ; ( X ) if you knew Me , you would know My Father also. ”
NASB	John	8	20	These words He spoke [ f ] in ( Y ) the treasury , as ( Z ) He taught in the temple area ; and no one arrested Him , because ( AA ) His hour had not yet come .
NASB	John	8	21	Then He said again to them , “ I am going away , and ( AB ) you will look for Me , and ( AC ) will die in your sin ; where I am going , you can not come. ”
NASB	John	8	22	So ( AD ) the Jews were saying , “ Surely He will not kill Himself , will He , since He says , ‘ ( AE ) Where I am going , you can not come ’ ? ”
NASB	John	8	23	And He was saying to them , “ ( AF ) You are from below , I am from above ; ( AG ) you are of this world , ( AH ) I am not of this world .

NASB	John	8	25	Then they were saying to Him , “ Who are You ? ” Jesus said to them , “ [ h ] What have I even been saying to you from the beginning ?
NASB	John	8	26	I have many things to say and to judge regarding you , but ( AL ) He who sent Me is true ; and ( AM ) the things which I heard from Him , these I say to the world. ”
NASB	John	8	27	They did not realize that He was speaking to them about the Father .
NASB	John	8	28	So Jesus said , “ When you ( AN ) lift up the Son of Man , then you will know that [ i ] ( AO ) I am , and ( AP ) I do nothing [ j ] on My own , but I say these things as the Father instructed Me .
NASB	John	8	29	And He who sent Me is with Me ; ( AQ ) He [ k ] has not left Me alone , for ( AR ) I always do the things that are pleasing to Him. ”
NASB	John	8	30	As He said these things , ( AS ) many came to believe in Him . The Truth Will Set You Free
NASB	John	8	31	So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him , “ ( AT ) If you continue in My word , then you are truly My ( AU ) disciples ;
NASB	John	8	32	and ( AV ) you will know the truth , and ( AW ) the truth will set you free. ”
NASB	John	8	33	They answered Him , “ ( AX ) We are Abraham ’ s descendants and have never been enslaved to anyone ; how is it that You say , ‘ You will become free ’ ? ”
NASB	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , “ Truly , truly I say to you , ( AY ) everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin .
NASB	John	8	35	Now ( AZ ) the slave does not remain in the house forever ; ( BA ) the son does remain forever .
NASB	John	8	36	So if the Son ( BB ) sets you free , you really will be free .
NASB	John	8	37	I know that you are ( BC ) Abraham ’ s descendants ; yet ( BD ) you are seeking to kill Me , because My word [ l ] has no place in you .
NASB	John	8	38	I speak of the things which I have seen [ m ] with My Father ; therefore you also do the things which you heard from ( BE ) your father. ”
NASB	John	8	39	They answered and said to Him , “ Abraham is ( BF ) our father. ” Jesus * said to them , “ ( BG ) If you are Abraham ’ s children , do the deeds of Abraham .
NASB	John	8	40	But as it is , ( BH ) you are seeking to kill Me , a man who has ( BI ) told you the truth , which I heard from God ; this Abraham did not do .
NASB	John	8	41	You are doing the deeds of ( BJ ) your father. ” They said to Him , “ We were not born as a result of sexual immorality ; ( BK ) we have one Father : God. ”
NASB	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , “ If God were your Father , ( BL ) you would love Me , ( BM ) for I came forth from God and am here ; for I have ( BN ) not even come [ n ] on My own , but [ o ] ( BO ) He sent Me .
NASB	John	8	43	Why do you not understand [ p ] ( BP ) what I am saying ? It is because you can not ( BQ ) listen to My word .
NASB	John	8	44	( BR ) You are of ( BS ) your father the devil , and ( BT ) you want to do the desires of your father . ( BU ) He was a murderer from the beginning , and does not stand in the truth because ( BV ) there is no truth in him . Whenever he tells [ q ] a lie , he ( BW ) speaks from his own nature , because he is a liar and the father of [ r ] lies .
NASB	John	8	45	But because ( BX ) I say the truth , you do not believe Me .
NASB	John	8	46	Which one of you convicts Me of sin ? If ( BY ) I speak truth , why do you not believe Me ?
NASB	John	8	47	( BZ ) The one who is of God hears the words of God ; for this reason you do not hear them , because you are not of God. ”
NASB	John	8	48	( CA ) The Jews answered and said to Him , “ Do we not rightly say that You are a ( CB ) Samaritan , and You ( CC ) have a demon ? ”
NASB	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I do not ( CD ) have a demon ; on the contrary , I honor My Father , and you dishonor Me .
NASB	John	8	50	But ( CE ) I am not seeking My glory ; there is One who seeks it , and judges .
NASB	John	8	51	Truly , truly I say to you , if anyone ( CF ) follows My word , he will never ( CG ) see death. ”
NASB	John	8	52	( CH ) The Jews said to Him , “ Now we know that You ( CI ) have a demon . Abraham died , and the prophets as well ; and yet You say , ‘ If anyone ( CJ ) follows My word , he will never ( CK ) taste of death. ’
NASB	John	8	53	You ( CL ) are not greater than our father Abraham , who died , are You ? The prophets died too . Whom do You make Yourself out to be ? ”
NASB	John	8	54	Jesus answered , “ ( CM ) If I glorify Myself , My glory is nothing ; ( CN ) it is My Father who glorifies Me , of whom you say , ‘ He is our God ’ ;
NASB	John	8	55	and ( CO ) you have not come to know Him , ( CP ) but I know Him . And if I say that I do not know Him , I will be ( CQ ) a liar like you ; ( CR ) but I do know Him , and I ( CS ) follow His word .
NASB	John	8	56	( CT ) Your father Abraham was ( CU ) overjoyed that he would see My day , and he saw it and rejoiced. ”
NASB	John	8	57	( CV ) So the Jews said to Him , “ You are not yet fifty years old , and You have seen Abraham ? ”
NASB	John	8	58	Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly I say to you , before Abraham [ s ] was born , [ t ] ( CW ) I am. ”
NASB	John	8	59	Therefore they ( CX ) picked up stones to throw at Him , but Jesus ( CY ) hid Himself and left the temple grounds .

NASB	John	9	9	Others were saying , “ This is he , ” still others were saying , “ No , but he is like him. ” [ b ] The man himself kept saying , “ I am the one. ”
NASB	John	9	2	And His disciples asked Him , “ ( A ) Rabbi , who sinned , ( B ) this man or his ( C ) parents , that he would be born blind ? ”
NASB	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ It was neither that this man sinned , nor his parents ; but it was ( D ) so that the works of God might be displayed in him .
NASB	John	9	4	We must carry out the works of Him who sent Me ( E ) as long as it is day ; night is coming , when no one can work .
NASB	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am ( F ) the Light of the world. ”
NASB	John	9	6	When He had said this , He ( G ) spit on the ground , and made mud from the saliva , and applied the mud to his eyes ,
NASB	John	9	7	and said to him , “ Go , wash in ( H ) the pool of Siloam ” ( which is translated , Sent ) . So he left and ( I ) washed , and ( J ) came back seeing .
NASB	John	9	8	So the neighbors , and those who previously saw [ a ] him as a beggar , were saying , “ Is this not the one who used to ( K ) sit and beg ? ”
NASB	John	9	10	So they were saying to him , “ How then were your eyes opened ? ”
NASB	John	9	11	He answered , “ The man who is called Jesus made mud , and spread it on my eyes , and said to me , ‘ Go to ( L ) Siloam and wash ’ ; so I went away and washed , and I received sight. ”
NASB	John	9	12	And they said to him , “ Where is He ? ” He * said , “ I do not know. ” Controversy over the Man
NASB	John	9	13	They * brought [ c ] the man who was previously blind to the Pharisees .
NASB	John	9	14	( M ) Now it was a Sabbath on the day that Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes .
NASB	John	9	15	( N ) Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight . And he said to them , “ He applied mud to my eyes , and I washed , and I see. ”
NASB	John	9	16	Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying , “ This man is not from God , because He ( O ) does not keep the Sabbath. ” But others were saying , “ How can a man who is a sinner perform such [ d ] ( P ) signs ? ” And ( Q ) there was dissension among them .
NASB	John	9	17	So they * said ( R ) again to the man who was blind , “ What do you say about Him , since He opened your eyes ? ” And he said , “ He is a ( S ) prophet. ”
NASB	John	9	18	( T ) The Jews then did not believe it about him , that he had been blind and had received sight , until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight ,
NASB	John	9	19	and they questioned them , saying , “ Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? Then how does he now see ? ”
NASB	John	9	20	His parents then answered and said , “ We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
NASB	John	9	21	but how he now sees , we do not know ; or who opened his eyes , we do not know . Ask him ; he is of age , he will speak for himself. ”
NASB	John	9	22	His parents said this because they ( U ) were afraid of the [ e ] Jews ; for the Jews ( V ) had already reached the decision that if anyone confessed Him to be [ f ] Christ , ( W ) he was to be excommunicated from the synagogue .
NASB	John	9	23	It was for this reason that his parents said , “ ( X ) He is of age ; ask him. ”
NASB	John	9	24	So for a second time they summoned the man who had been blind , and said to him , “ ( Y ) Give glory to God ; we know that ( Z ) this man is a sinner. ”
NASB	John	9	25	He then answered , “ Whether He is a sinner , I do not know ; one thing I do know , that though I was blind , now I see. ”
NASB	John	9	26	So they said to him , “ What did He do to you ? How did He open your eyes ? ”
NASB	John	9	27	He answered them , “ ( AA ) I told you already and you did not ( AB ) listen ; why do you want to hear it again ? You do not want to become His disciples too , do you ? ”
NASB	John	9	28	They spoke abusively to him and said , “ You are His disciple , but ( AC ) we are disciples of Moses .
NASB	John	9	29	We know that God has spoken to Moses , but as for this man , ( AD ) we do not know where He is from. ”
NASB	John	9	30	The man answered and said to them , “ Well , here is the amazing thing , that you do not know where He is from , and yet He opened my eyes !
NASB	John	9	31	We know that ( AE ) God does not listen to sinners ; but if someone is [ g ] God-fearing and does His will , He listens to him .
NASB	John	9	32	[ h ] Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind .
NASB	John	9	33	( AF ) If this man were not from God , He could do nothing. ”

NASB	John	10	10	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy ; I came so that they ( K ) would have life , and [ b ] have it abundantly .
NASB	John	10	2	But the one who enters by the door is ( B ) a shepherd of the sheep .
NASB	John	10	3	To him the doorkeeper opens , and the sheep listen to ( C ) his voice , and he calls his own sheep by name and ( D ) leads them out .
NASB	John	10	4	When he puts all his own sheep outside , he goes ahead of them , and the sheep follow him because they know ( E ) his voice .
NASB	John	10	5	However , a stranger they simply will not follow , but will flee from him , because they do not know ( F ) the voice of strangers. ”
NASB	John	10	6	Jesus told them this ( G ) figure of speech , but they did not understand what the things which He was saying to them [ a ] meant .
NASB	John	10	7	So Jesus said to them again , “ Truly , truly I say to you , I am ( H ) the door of the sheep .
NASB	John	10	8	All those who came before Me are ( I ) thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not listen to them .
NASB	John	10	9	( J ) I am the door ; if anyone enters through Me , he will be saved , and will go in and out and find pasture .
NASB	John	10	11	“ ( L ) I am the good shepherd ; the good shepherd ( M ) lays down His life for the sheep .
NASB	John	10	12	He who is a hired hand , and not a ( N ) shepherd , who is not the owner of the sheep , sees the wolf coming , and leaves the sheep and flees ; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock .
NASB	John	10	13	He flees because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep .
NASB	John	10	14	( O ) I am the good shepherd , and ( P ) I know My own , and My own know Me ,
NASB	John	10	15	just as ( Q ) the Father knows Me and I know the Father ; and ( R ) I lay down My life for the sheep .
NASB	John	10	16	And I have ( S ) other sheep that are not of this fold ; I must bring them also , and they will listen to My voice ; and they will become ( T ) one flock , with ( U ) one shepherd .
NASB	John	10	17	For this reason the Father loves Me , because I ( V ) lay down My life so that I may take it back .
NASB	John	10	18	( W ) No one has taken it away from Me , but I ( X ) lay it down on My own . I have authority to lay it down , and I have authority to take it back . ( Y ) This commandment I received from My Father. ”
NASB	John	10	19	( Z ) Dissension occurred again among the Jews because of these words .
NASB	John	10	20	Many of them were saying , “ He ( AA ) has a demon and ( AB ) is insane . Why do you listen to Him ? ”
NASB	John	10	21	Others were saying , “ These are not the words of one who is ( AC ) demon-possessed . ( AD ) A demon can not open the eyes of those who are blind , can it ? ” Jesus Asserts His Deity
NASB	John	10	22	At that time the [ c ] Feast of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem ;
NASB	John	10	23	it was winter , and Jesus was walking in the temple area , in the portico of ( AE ) Solomon .
NASB	John	10	24	( AF ) The Jews then surrounded Him and began saying to Him , “ How long [ d ] will You keep us in suspense ? If You are the [ e ] Christ , tell us ( AG ) plainly. ”
NASB	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , “ ( AH ) I told you , and you do not believe ; ( AI ) the works that I do in My Father ’ s name , these testify of Me .
NASB	John	10	26	But you do not believe , because ( AJ ) you are not of My sheep .
NASB	John	10	27	My sheep ( AK ) listen to My voice , and ( AL ) I know them , and they follow Me ;
NASB	John	10	28	and I give them ( AM ) eternal life , and they will never perish ; and ( AN ) no one will snatch them out of My hand .
NASB	John	10	29	[ f ] My Father , who has given them to Me , is greater than all ; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father ’ s hand .
NASB	John	10	30	( AO ) I and the Father are [ g ] one. ”
NASB	John	10	31	The Jews ( AP ) picked up stones again to stone Him .
NASB	John	10	32	Jesus replied to them , “ I showed you many good works from the Father ; for which of them are you stoning Me ? ”
NASB	John	10	33	The Jews answered Him , “ We are not stoning You for a good work , but for ( AQ ) blasphemy ; and because You , being a man , ( AR ) make Yourself out to be God. ”
NASB	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , “ Has it not been written in ( AS ) your ( AT ) Law : ‘ ( AU ) I said , you are gods ’ ?
NASB	John	10	35	If he called them gods , to whom the word of God came ( and the Scripture can not be nullified ) ,
NASB	John	10	36	are you saying of Him whom the Father ( AV ) sanctified and ( AW ) sent into the world , ‘ You are blaspheming , ’ because I said , ‘ ( AX ) I am the Son of God ’ ?
NASB	John	10	37	( AY ) If I do not do the works of My Father , do not believe Me ;
NASB	John	10	38	but if I do them , even though you do not believe Me , believe ( AZ ) the works , so that you may [ h ] know and understand that ( BA ) the Father is in Me , and I in the Father. ”
NASB	John	10	39	Therefore ( BB ) they were seeking again to arrest Him , and ( BC ) He eluded their grasp .
NASB	John	10	40	And He went away ( BD ) again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing , and He stayed there .
NASB	John	10	41	Many came to Him and were saying , “ While John performed no ( BE ) sign , yet ( BF ) everything John said about this man was true. ”

NASB	John	11	11	This He said , and after this He * said to them , “ Our ( M ) friend Lazarus ( N ) has fallen asleep ; but I am going so that I may awaken him from sleep. ”
NASB	John	11	2	miles or
NASB	John	11	3	km ; a Roman stadion perhaps averaged
NASB	John	11	4	But when Jesus heard this , He said , “ This sickness is not [ b ] meant for death , but is for ( G ) the glory of God , so that the Son of God may be glorified by it. ”
NASB	John	11	5	( Now Jesus loved ( H ) Martha and her sister , and Lazarus . )
NASB	John	11	6	So when He heard that he was sick , He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was .
NASB	John	11	7	Then after this He * said to the disciples , “ ( I ) Let ’ s go to Judea again. ”
NASB	John	11	8	The disciples * said to Him , “ ( J ) Rabbi , the Jews were just now seeking ( K ) to stone You , and yet You are going there again ? ”
NASB	John	11	9	Jesus replied , “ ( L ) Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If anyone walks during the day , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
NASB	John	11	10	But if anyone walks during the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in [ c ] him. ”
NASB	John	11	12	The disciples then said to Him , “ Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he will [ d ] come out of it. ”
NASB	John	11	13	Now ( O ) Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that He was speaking about [ e ] actual sleep .
NASB	John	11	14	So Jesus then said to them plainly , “ Lazarus died ,
NASB	John	11	15	and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , so that you may believe ; but let ’ s go to him. ”
NASB	John	11	16	( P ) Therefore Thomas , who was called [ f ] ( Q ) Didymus , said to his fellow disciples , “ Let ’ s also go , so that we may die with Him ! ”
NASB	John	11	17	So when Jesus came , He found that he had already been in the tomb ( R ) four days .
NASB	John	11	18	Now ( S ) Bethany was near Jerusalem , about [ g ] fifteen stadia away ;
NASB	John	11	19	and many of ( T ) the Jews had come to ( U ) Martha and Mary , ( V ) to console them about their brother .
NASB	John	11	20	So then ( W ) Martha , when she heard that Jesus was coming , went to meet Him , but ( X ) Mary [ h ] stayed in the house .
NASB	John	11	21	Martha then said to Jesus , “ ( Y ) Lord , ( Z ) if You had been here , my brother would not have died .
NASB	John	11	22	Even now I know that ( AA ) whatever You ask of God , God will give You. ”
NASB	John	11	23	Jesus * said to her , “ Your brother will rise from the dead. ”
NASB	John	11	24	Martha * said to Him , “ ( AB ) I know that he will rise in the resurrection on the last day. ”
NASB	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , “ ( AC ) I am the resurrection and the life ; the one who believes in Me will live , even if he dies ,
NASB	John	11	26	and everyone who lives and believes in Me ( AD ) will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
NASB	John	11	27	She * said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; I have come to believe that You are ( AE ) the [ i ] Christ , the Son of God , and [ j ] ( AF ) He who comes into the world. ”
NASB	John	11	28	When she had said this , she ( AG ) left and called Mary her sister , saying secretly , “ ( AH ) The Teacher is here and is calling for you. ”
NASB	John	11	29	And when she heard this , she * got up quickly and came to Him .
NASB	John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village , but ( AI ) was still at the place where Martha met Him .
NASB	John	11	31	( AJ ) Then the Jews who were with her in the house and were ( AK ) consoling her , when they saw that Mary had gotten up quickly and left , they followed her , thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there .
NASB	John	11	32	So when Mary came to the place where Jesus was , she saw Him and fell at His feet , saying to Him , “ ( AL ) Lord , ( AM ) if You had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
NASB	John	11	33	Therefore when Jesus saw her weeping , and ( AN ) the Jews who came with her also weeping , He ( AO ) was deeply moved in spirit and [ k ] ( AP ) was troubled ,
NASB	John	11	34	and He said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They * said to Him , “ Lord , come and see. ”
NASB	John	11	35	Jesus ( AQ ) wept .
NASB	John	11	36	So ( AR ) the Jews were saying , “ See how He ( AS ) loved him ! ”
NASB	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ Could this man , who ( AT ) opened the eyes of the man who was blind , not have also [ l ] kept this man from dying ? ”
NASB	John	11	38	So Jesus , again being deeply moved within , * came to the tomb . Now it was a ( AU ) cave , and a stone was lying against it .
NASB	John	11	39	Jesus * said , “ Remove the stone. ” Martha , the sister of the deceased , * said to Him , “ Lord , by this time [ m ] there will be a stench , for he has been dead ( AV ) four days. ”
NASB	John	11	40	Jesus * said to her , “ ( AW ) Did I not say to you that if you believe , you will see the glory of God ? ”
NASB	John	11	41	So they removed the ( AX ) stone . And Jesus ( AY ) raised His eyes , and said , “ ( AZ ) Father , I thank You that You have heard Me .
NASB	John	11	42	But I knew that You always hear Me ; nevertheless , ( BA ) because of the [ n ] people standing around I said it , so that they may believe that ( BB ) You sent Me. ”
NASB	John	11	43	And when He had said these things , He cried out with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
NASB	John	11	44	Out came the man who had died , ( BC ) bound hand and foot with wrappings , and ( BD ) his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus * said to them , “ Unbind him , and let him go. ”
NASB	John	11	45	( BE ) Therefore many of the Jews ( BF ) who came to Mary , and ( BG ) saw what He had done , believed in Him .
NASB	John	11	46	But some of them went to the ( BH ) Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done . Conspiracy to Kill Jesus
NASB	John	11	47	Therefore ( BI ) the chief priests and the Pharisees ( BJ ) convened a ( BK ) council meeting , and they were saying , “ What are we [ o ] doing in regard to the fact that this man is performing many [ p ] ( BL ) signs ?
NASB	John	11	48	If we let Him go on like this , all the people will believe in Him , and the Romans will come and take over both our [ q ] ( BM ) place and our nation. ”
NASB	John	11	49	But one of them , ( BN ) Caiaphas , ( BO ) who was high priest that year , said to them , “ You know nothing at all ,
NASB	John	11	50	nor are you taking into account that ( BP ) it is in your best interest that one man die for the people , and that the whole nation not perish instead. ”
NASB	John	11	51	Now he did not say this [ r ] on his own , but ( BQ ) as he was high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation ;
NASB	John	11	52	and not for the nation only , but in order that He might also ( BR ) gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad .
NASB	John	11	53	So from that day on they ( BS ) planned together to kill Him .
NASB	John	11	54	Therefore Jesus ( BT ) no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews , but went away from there to the region near the wilderness , into a city called ( BU ) Ephraim ; and there He stayed with the disciples .
NASB	John	11	55	Now ( BV ) the Passover of the Jews was near , and many went up to Jerusalem from the country prior to the Passover , ( BW ) in order to [ s ] purify themselves .
NASB	John	11	56	So they ( BX ) were looking for Jesus , and saying to one another as they stood in the temple area , “ What do you think ; that He will not come to the feast at all ? ”
NASB	John	11	57	Now ( BY ) the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was , he was to report it , so that they might arrest Him .

NASB	John	12	2	So they made Him a dinner there , and ( D ) Martha was serving ; and Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him .
NASB	John	12	3	( E ) Mary then took a [ a ] pound of very expensive ( F ) perfume of pure nard , and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair ; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
NASB	John	12	4	But ( G ) Judas Iscariot , one of His disciples , the one who intended to [ b ] betray Him , * said ,
NASB	John	12	5	“ Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred [ c ] denarii and the proceeds given to poor people ? ”
NASB	John	12	6	Now he said this , not because he cared about the poor , but because he was a thief , and as he ( H ) kept the money box , he used to [ d ] steal from ( I ) what was put into it .
NASB	John	12	7	Therefore Jesus said , “ Leave her alone , so that she may keep it [ e ] for ( J ) the day of My burial .
NASB	John	12	8	( K ) For you always have the poor with you , but you do not always have Me. ”
NASB	John	12	9	The ( L ) large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there ; and they came , not on account of Jesus only , but so that they might also see Lazarus , ( M ) whom He raised from the dead .
NASB	John	12	10	But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also ,
NASB	John	12	11	because ( N ) on account of him ( O ) many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus . The Triumphal Entry
NASB	John	12	13	they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him , and began shouting , “ ( R ) Hosanna ! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord , indeed , the ( S ) King of Israel ! ”
NASB	John	12	14	Jesus , finding a young donkey , sat on it ; as it is written :
NASB	John	12	15	“ ( T ) Do not fear , daughter of Zion ; behold , your King is coming , seated on a donkey ’ s colt. ”
NASB	John	12	16	( U ) These things His disciples did not understand at the first ; but when Jesus ( V ) was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written of Him , and that they had done these things for Him .
NASB	John	12	17	So ( W ) the [ f ] people , who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead , continued to testify about Him .
NASB	John	12	18	( X ) For this reason also the [ g ] people went to meet Him , ( Y ) because they heard that He had performed this [ h ] sign .
NASB	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said [ i ] to one another , “ You see that you are not accomplishing anything ; look , the world has gone after Him ! ” Greeks Seek Jesus
NASB	John	12	20	Now there were some ( Z ) Greeks among those who were going up to worship at ( AA ) the feast ;
NASB	John	12	21	these people then came to ( AB ) Philip , who was from ( AC ) Bethsaida of Galilee , and were making a request of him , saying , “ Sir , we wish to see Jesus. ”
NASB	John	12	22	Philip * came and * told ( AD ) Andrew ; then Andrew and Philip * came and * told Jesus .
NASB	John	12	23	But Jesus * answered them by saying , “ ( AE ) The hour has come for the Son of Man to ( AF ) be glorified .
NASB	John	12	24	Truly , truly I say to you , ( AG ) unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it bears much fruit .
NASB	John	12	25	( AH ) The one who loves his [ j ] life loses it , and the one who ( AI ) hates his [ k ] life in this world will keep it [ l ] to eternal life .
NASB	John	12	26	If anyone [ m ] serves Me , he must follow Me ; and ( AJ ) where I am , there My servant will be also ; if anyone [ n ] serves Me , the Father will ( AK ) honor him . Jesus Foretells His Death
NASB	John	12	27	“ ( AL ) Now My soul has become troubled ; and what am I to say ? ‘ ( AM ) Father , save Me from ( AN ) this hour ’ ? But for this purpose I came to this hour .
NASB	John	12	28	( AO ) Father , glorify Your name. ” Then a ( AP ) voice came out of heaven : “ I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again. ”
NASB	John	12	29	So the crowd who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered ; others were saying , “ ( AQ ) An angel has spoken to Him ! ”
NASB	John	12	30	Jesus responded and said , “ ( AR ) This voice has not come for My sake , but for yours .
NASB	John	12	31	( AS ) Now judgment is upon this world ; now ( AT ) the ruler of this world will be cast out .
NASB	John	12	32	And I , if I ( AU ) am lifted up from the earth , will ( AV ) draw all people to Myself. ”
NASB	John	12	33	Now He was saying this ( AW ) to indicate what kind of death He was going to die .
NASB	John	12	34	The crowd then answered Him , “ We have heard from ( AX ) the Law that ( AY ) the [ o ] Christ is to remain forever ; and how is it that You say , ‘ The ( AZ ) Son of Man must be ( BA ) lifted up ’ ? Who is this ( BB ) Son of Man ? ”
NASB	John	12	35	So Jesus said to them , “ ( BC ) For a little while longer ( BD ) the Light is among you . ( BE ) Walk while you have the Light , so that darkness will not overtake you ; also , the one who ( BF ) walks in the darkness does not know where he is going .
NASB	John	12	36	While you have the Light , ( BG ) believe in the Light , so that you may become ( BH ) sons of Light. ” These things Jesus proclaimed , and He went away and ( BI ) hid Himself from them .
NASB	John	12	37	But though He had performed so many [ p ] signs in their sight , they still were not believing in Him .
NASB	John	12	38	This happened so that the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke would be fulfilled : “ ( BJ ) Lord , who has believed our report ? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ”
NASB	John	12	39	For this reason they could not believe , for Isaiah said again ,
NASB	John	12	40	“ ( BK ) He has blinded their eyes and He ( BL ) hardened their heart , so that they will not see with their eyes and understand with their heart , and [ q ] be converted , and so I will not heal them. ”
NASB	John	12	41	These things Isaiah said because ( BM ) he saw His glory , and ( BN ) he spoke about Him .
NASB	John	12	42	Nevertheless ( BO ) many , even of ( BP ) the rulers , believed in Him , but ( BQ ) because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him , so that they would not be ( BR ) excommunicated from the synagogue ;
NASB	John	12	43	( BS ) for they loved the [ r ] approval of people rather than the [ s ] approval of God .
NASB	John	12	44	Now Jesus cried out and said , “ ( BT ) The one who believes in Me , does not believe only in Me , but also in Him who sent Me .
NASB	John	12	45	And ( BU ) the one who sees Me sees Him who sent Me .
NASB	John	12	46	( BV ) I have come as Light into the world , so that no one who believes in Me will remain in darkness .
NASB	John	12	47	If anyone hears My [ t ] teachings and does not keep them , I do not judge him ; for ( BW ) I did not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
NASB	John	12	48	( BX ) The one who rejects Me and does not [ u ] accept My [ v ] teachings has one who judges him : ( BY ) the word which I spoke . That will judge him on ( BZ ) the last day .
NASB	John	12	49	( CA ) For I did not speak [ w ] on My own , but the Father Himself who sent Me ( CB ) has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak .
NASB	John	12	50	And I know that ( CC ) His commandment is eternal life ; therefore the things I speak , I speak ( CD ) just as the Father has told Me. ” Footnotes - John 12:3 I.e. , a Roman pound , about

NASB	John	13	13	You call Me ( P ) ‘ Teacher ’ and ( Q ) ‘ Lord ’ ; and [ d ] you are correct , for so I am .
NASB	John	13	2	And during supper , ( D ) the devil having already put into the heart of ( E ) Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , to betray Him ,
NASB	John	13	3	Jesus , ( F ) knowing that the Father had handed all things over to Him , and that ( G ) He had come forth from God and was going back to God ,
NASB	John	13	4	* got up from supper and * laid His outer garments aside ; and He took a towel and ( H ) tied it around Himself . Jesus Washes the Disciples ’ Feet
NASB	John	13	5	Then He * poured water into the basin , and began ( I ) washing the disciples ’ feet and wiping them with the towel which He had tied around Himself .
NASB	John	13	6	So He * came to Simon Peter . He * said to Him , “ Lord , You are washing my feet ? ”
NASB	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said to him , “ What I am doing , you do not realize right now , but you will understand ( J ) later. ”
NASB	John	13	8	Peter * said to Him , “ Never shall You wash my feet ! ” Jesus answered him , “ ( K ) If I do not wash you , ( L ) you have no [ b ] place with Me. ”
NASB	John	13	9	Simon Peter * said to Him , “ Lord , then wash not only my feet , but also my hands and my head ! ”
NASB	John	13	10	Jesus * said to him , “ He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet ; otherwise he is completely clean . And ( M ) you are clean—but [ c ] not all of you. ”
NASB	John	13	11	For ( N ) He knew the one who was betraying Him ; it was for this reason that He said , “ Not all of you are clean. ”
NASB	John	13	12	Then , when He had washed their feet , and ( O ) taken His garments and reclined at the table again , He said to them , “ Do you know what I have done for you ?
NASB	John	13	14	So if I , ( R ) the Lord and the Teacher , washed your feet , you also ought to wash one another ’ s feet .
NASB	John	13	15	For I gave you ( S ) an example , so that you also would do just as I did for you .
NASB	John	13	16	Truly , truly I say to you , ( T ) a slave is not greater than his master , nor is ( U ) [ e ] one who is sent greater than the one who sent him .
NASB	John	13	17	If you know these things , you are ( V ) blessed if you do them .
NASB	John	13	18	( W ) I am not speaking about all of you . I know the ones whom I have ( X ) chosen ; but this is happening ( Y ) so that the Scripture may be fulfilled , ‘ ( Z ) He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me. ’
NASB	John	13	19	From now on ( AA ) I am telling you before it happens , so that when it does happen , you may believe that ( AB ) I am He .
NASB	John	13	20	Truly , truly I say to you , ( AC ) the one who [ f ] receives anyone I send , [ g ] receives Me ; and the one who [ h ] receives Me [ i ] receives Him who sent Me. ” Jesus Predicts His Betrayal
NASB	John	13	21	When Jesus had said these things , He ( AD ) became troubled in spirit , and [ j ] testified and said , “ Truly , truly I say to you that ( AE ) one of you will [ k ] betray Me. ”
NASB	John	13	22	The disciples began looking at one another , ( AF ) at a loss to know of which one He was speaking .
NASB	John	13	23	Lying back on ( AG ) Jesus ’ chest was one of His disciples , ( AH ) whom Jesus loved .
NASB	John	13	24	So Simon Peter * nodded to this disciple and * said to him , “ Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking. ”
NASB	John	13	25	He then simply ( AI ) leaned back on Jesus ’ chest and * said to Him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
NASB	John	13	26	Jesus then * answered , “ That man is the one for whom I shall dip the piece of bread and give it to him. ” So when He had dipped the piece of bread , He * took and * gave it to Judas , ( AJ ) the son of Simon Iscariot .
NASB	John	13	27	After [ l ] this , ( AK ) Satan then ( AL ) entered him . Therefore Jesus * said to him , “ What you are doing , do it quickly. ”
NASB	John	13	28	Now none of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him .
NASB	John	13	29	For some were assuming , since Judas ( AM ) kept the money box , that Jesus was saying to him , “ Buy the things we need ( AN ) for the feast ” ; or else , that he was to [ m ] ( AO ) give something to the poor .
NASB	John	13	30	So after receiving the piece of bread , he left immediately ; and ( AP ) it was night .
NASB	John	13	31	Therefore when he had left , Jesus * said , “ Now [ n ] is ( AQ ) the Son of Man ( AR ) glorified , and ( AS ) God [ o ] is glorified in Him ;
NASB	John	13	32	[ p ] if God is glorified in Him , ( AT ) God will also glorify Him in Himself , and will glorify Him immediately .
NASB	John	13	33	( AU ) Little children , I am still with you ( AV ) a little longer . ( AW ) You will look for Me ; and just as I said to the [ q ] Jews , now I also say to you : ‘ Where I am going , you can not come. ’
NASB	John	13	34	I am giving you a ( AX ) new commandment , ( AY ) that you love one another ; ( AZ ) just as I have loved you , that you also love one another .
NASB	John	13	35	( BA ) By this all people will know that you are My disciples : if you have love for one another. ”
NASB	John	13	36	Simon Peter * said to Him , “ Lord , where are You going ? ” Jesus answered , “ ( BB ) Where I am going , you can not follow Me now ; but ( BC ) you will follow later. ”
NASB	John	13	37	Peter * said to Him , “ Lord , why can I not follow You right now ? ( BD ) I will lay down my life for You. ”

NASB	John	15	13	( P ) Greater love has no one than this , that a person will ( Q ) lay down his life for his friends .
NASB	John	15	14	You are My ( R ) friends if ( S ) you do what I command you .
NASB	John	15	16	( U ) You did not choose Me but I chose you , and appointed you that you would go and ( V ) bear fruit , and that your fruit would remain , so that ( W ) whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you .
NASB	John	15	17	This ( X ) I command you , that you love one another . Disciples ’ Relation to the World
NASB	John	15	18	“ ( Y ) If the world hates you , [ h ] you know that it has hated Me before it hated you .
NASB	John	15	19	If you were of the world , the world would love you as its own ; but because you are not of the world , but ( Z ) I chose you out of the world , ( AA ) because of this the world hates you .
NASB	John	15	20	Remember the word that I said to you , ‘ ( AB ) A slave is not greater than his master. ’ If they persecuted Me , ( AC ) they will persecute you as well ; if they ( AD ) followed My word , they will follow yours also .
NASB	John	15	21	But all these things they will do to you ( AE ) on account of My name , ( AF ) because they do not know the One who sent Me .
NASB	John	15	22	( AG ) If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not have [ i ] sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
NASB	John	15	23	The one who hates Me hates My Father also .
NASB	John	15	24	( AH ) If I had not done among them ( AI ) the works which no one else did , they would not have [ j ] sin ; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well .
NASB	John	15	25	But this has happened so that the word that is written in their ( AJ ) Law will be fulfilled : ‘ ( AK ) They hated Me for no reason. ’
NASB	John	15	26	“ When the [ k ] ( AL ) Helper comes , ( AM ) whom I will send to you from the Father , namely , ( AN ) the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father , ( AO ) He will testify about Me ,
NASB	John	15	27	and [ l ] ( AP ) you are testifying as well , because you have been with Me ( AQ ) from the beginning .

NASB	John	16	16	“ ( V ) A little while , and ( W ) you no longer are going to see Me ; and again a little while , and ( X ) you will see Me. ”
NASB	John	16	2	They will [ b ] ( C ) ban you from the synagogue , yet ( D ) an hour is coming for everyone ( E ) who kills you to think that he is offering a [ c ] service to God .
NASB	John	16	3	These things they will do ( F ) because they have not known the Father nor Me .
NASB	John	16	4	But these things I have spoken to you , ( G ) so that when their hour comes , you [ d ] may remember that I told you of them . However , I did not say these things to you ( H ) at the beginning , because I was with you . The Holy Spirit Promised
NASB	John	16	5	“ But now ( I ) I am going to Him who sent Me ; and none of you asks Me , ‘ ( J ) Where are You going ? ’
NASB	John	16	6	But because I have said these things to you , ( K ) grief has filled your heart .
NASB	John	16	7	But I tell you the truth : it is to your advantage that I am leaving ; for if I do not leave , the [ e ] ( L ) Helper will not come to you ; but if I go , ( M ) I will send Him to you .
NASB	John	16	8	And He , when He comes , will convict the world regarding sin , and righteousness , and judgment :
NASB	John	16	9	regarding sin , ( N ) because they do not believe in Me ;
NASB	John	16	10	and regarding ( O ) righteousness , because ( P ) I am going to the Father and you no longer are going to see Me ;
NASB	John	16	11	( Q ) and regarding judgment , because the ruler of this world has been judged .
NASB	John	16	12	“ I have many more things to say to you , but you can not bear them at the present time .
NASB	John	16	13	But when He , ( R ) the Spirit of truth , comes , He will ( S ) guide you into all the truth ; for He will not speak on His own , but whatever He hears , He will speak ; and He will disclose to you what is to come .
NASB	John	16	14	He will ( T ) glorify Me , for He will take from Mine and will disclose it to you .
NASB	John	16	15	( U ) All things that the Father has are Mine ; this is why I said that He takes from Mine and will disclose it to you . Jesus ’ Death and Resurrection Foretold
NASB	John	16	17	So some of His disciples said to one another , “ What is this that He is telling us , ‘ ( Y ) A little while , and you are not going to see Me ; and again a little while , and you will see Me ’ ; and , ‘ because ( Z ) I am going to the Father ’ ? ”
NASB	John	16	18	So they were saying , “ What is this that He says , ‘ A little while ’ ? We do not know what He is talking about. ”
NASB	John	16	19	( AA ) Jesus knew that they wanted to question Him , and He said to them , “ Are you deliberating together about this , that I said , ‘ A little while , and you are not going to see Me , and again a little while , and you will see Me ’ ?
NASB	John	16	20	Truly , truly I say to you that ( AB ) you will weep and mourn , but the world will rejoice ; you will grieve , but ( AC ) your grief will be turned into joy !
NASB	John	16	21	( AD ) Whenever a woman is in labor she has [ f ] pain , because her hour has come ; but when she gives birth to the child , she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a [ g ] child has been born into the world .
NASB	John	16	22	Therefore ( AE ) you too have grief now ; but ( AF ) I will see you again , and your heart will rejoice , and no one is going to take your joy away from you . Prayer Promises
NASB	John	16	23	And ( AG ) on that day ( AH ) you will not question Me about anything . Truly , truly I say to you , ( AI ) if you ask the Father for anything in My name , He will give it to you .
NASB	John	16	24	( AJ ) Until now you have asked for nothing in My name ; ask and you will receive , so that your ( AK ) joy may be made full .
NASB	John	16	25	“ These things I have spoken to you in ( AL ) figures of speech ; ( AM ) an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech , but will tell you plainly about the Father .
NASB	John	16	26	( AN ) On that day ( AO ) you will ask in My name , and I am not saying to you that I will request of the Father on your behalf ;
NASB	John	16	27	for ( AP ) the Father Himself loves you , because you have loved Me and ( AQ ) have believed that ( AR ) I came forth from the Father .
NASB	John	16	28	( AS ) I came forth from the Father and have come into the world ; again , I am leaving the world and ( AT ) going to the Father. ”
NASB	John	16	29	His disciples * said , “ See , now You are speaking plainly and are not [ h ] using any ( AU ) figure of speech .
NASB	John	16	30	Now we know that You know all things , and that You have no need for anyone to question You ; this is why we ( AV ) believe that You ( AW ) came forth from God. ”
NASB	John	16	31	Jesus replied to them , “ Do you now believe ?
NASB	John	16	32	Behold , ( AX ) an hour is coming , and has already come , for ( AY ) you to be scattered , each to ( AZ ) his own home , and to leave Me alone ; and yet ( BA ) I am not alone , because the Father is with Me .
NASB	John	16	33	These things I have spoken to you so that ( BB ) in Me you may have peace .

NASB	John	18	18	Now the slaves and the ( Z ) officers were standing there , having made ( AA ) a charcoal fire , for it was cold and they were ( AB ) warming themselves ; and Peter was also with them , standing and warming himself .
NASB	John	18	2	Now Judas , who was [ c ] betraying Him , also knew the place , because Jesus had ( D ) often met there with His disciples .
NASB	John	18	3	( E ) So Judas , having obtained ( F ) the Roman [ d ] cohort and ( G ) officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , * came there with lanterns , ( H ) torches , and weapons .
NASB	John	18	4	Jesus therefore , ( I ) knowing all the things that were coming upon Him , came out into the open and * said to them , “ ( J ) Whom are you seeking ? ”
NASB	John	18	5	They answered Him , “ Jesus the Nazarene. ” He * said to them , “ I am He. ” And Judas also , who was betraying Him , was standing with them .
NASB	John	18	6	Now then , when He said to them , “ I am He , ” they drew back and fell to the ground .
NASB	John	18	7	He then asked them again , “ ( K ) Whom are you seeking ? ” And they said , “ Jesus the Nazarene. ”
NASB	John	18	8	Jesus answered , “ I told you that I am He ; so if you are seeking Me , let these men go on their way. ”
NASB	John	18	9	This took place so that the word which He spoke would be fulfilled : “ ( L ) Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one. ”
NASB	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , ( M ) since he had a sword , drew it and struck the high priest ’ s slave , and cut off his right ear ; and the slave ’ s name was Malchus .
NASB	John	18	11	So Jesus said to Peter , “ Put the sword into the sheath ; ( N ) the cup which the Father has given Me , am I not to drink it ? ” Jesus before the Priests
NASB	John	18	12	( O ) So ( P ) the Roman [ e ] cohort , the [ f ] commander , and the ( Q ) officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him ,
NASB	John	18	13	and brought Him to ( R ) Annas first ; for he was the father-in-law of ( S ) Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
NASB	John	18	14	Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that ( T ) it was in their best interest for one man to die in behalf of the people .
NASB	John	18	15	( U ) Simon Peter was following Jesus , and so was another disciple . Now that disciple was known to the high priest , and he entered with Jesus into ( V ) the courtyard of the high priest ,
NASB	John	18	16	( W ) but Peter was standing at the door outside . So the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the doorkeeper , and brought Peter in .
NASB	John	18	17	( X ) Then the slave woman who was the doorkeeper * said to Peter , “ ( Y ) You are not also one of this Man ’ s disciples , are you ? ” He * said , “ I am not. ”
NASB	John	18	19	( AC ) The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples , and about His teaching .
NASB	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , “ I ( AD ) have spoken openly to the world ; I always ( AE ) taught in [ g ] synagogues and ( AF ) in the temple area , where all the Jews congregate ; and I said nothing in secret .
NASB	John	18	21	Why are you asking Me ? Ask those who have heard what I spoke to them . Look : these people know what I said. ”
NASB	John	18	22	But when He said this , one of the ( AG ) officers , who was standing nearby , ( AH ) struck Jesus , saying , “ Is that the way You answer the high priest ? ”
NASB	John	18	23	( AI ) Jesus answered him , “ If I have spoken wrongly , testify of the wrong ; but if rightly , why do you strike Me ? ”
NASB	John	18	24	( AJ ) So Annas sent Him bound to ( AK ) Caiaphas the high priest . Peter ’ s Denial of Jesus
NASB	John	18	25	( AL ) Now ( AM ) Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself . So they said to him , “ ( AN ) You are not one of His disciples as well , are you ? ” He denied it , and said , “ I am not. ”
NASB	John	18	26	One of the slaves of the high priest , who was related to the one ( AO ) whose ear Peter cut off , * said , “ Did I not see you in ( AP ) the garden with Him ? ”
NASB	John	18	27	Peter then denied it again , and immediately ( AQ ) a rooster crowed . Jesus before Pilate
NASB	John	18	28	( AR ) Then they * brought Jesus from ( AS ) Caiaphas into ( AT ) the [ h ] Praetorium , and it was early ; and they themselves did not enter ( AU ) the [ i ] Praetorium , so that ( AV ) they would not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
NASB	John	18	29	( AW ) Therefore Pilate came out to them and * said , “ What accusation are you bringing against this Man ? ”
NASB	John	18	30	They answered and said to him , “ If this Man were not [ j ] a criminal , we would not have handed Him over to you. ”
NASB	John	18	31	So Pilate said to them , “ Take Him yourselves , and judge Him according to your law. ” The Jews said to him , “ We are not [ k ] permitted to put anyone to death. ”
NASB	John	18	32	This happened so that ( AX ) the word of Jesus which He said , indicating what kind of death He was going to die , would be fulfilled .
NASB	John	18	33	Therefore Pilate ( AY ) entered the Praetorium again , and summoned Jesus and said to Him , “ ( AZ ) You are the King of the Jews ? ”
NASB	John	18	34	Jesus answered , “ Are you saying this [ l ] on your own , or did others tell you about Me ? ”
NASB	John	18	35	Pilate answered , “ I am not a Jew , am I ? Your own nation and the chief priests handed You over to me ; what have You done ? ”
NASB	John	18	36	Jesus answered , “ ( BA ) My kingdom is not of this world . If My kingdom were of this world , My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews ; but as it is , My kingdom is not [ m ] of this realm. ”
NASB	John	18	37	Therefore Pilate said to Him , “ So You are a king ? ” Jesus answered , “ ( BB ) You say correctly that I am a king . For this purpose I have been born , and for this I have come into the world : ( BC ) to testify to the truth . ( BD ) Everyone who is of the truth listens to My voice. ”
NASB	John	18	38	Pilate * said to Him , “ What is truth ? ” And after saying this , he ( BE ) came out again to the Jews and * said to them , “ ( BF ) I find no grounds at all for charges in [ n ] His case .
NASB	John	18	39	( BG ) However , you have a custom that I release one prisoner [ o ] for you at the Passover ; therefore do you wish that I release [ p ] for you the King of the Jews ? ”

NASB	John	19	19	Now Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross . It was written : “ ( AC ) JESUS THE NAZARENE , ( AD ) THE KING OF THE JEWS. ”
NASB	John	19	2	( B ) And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it on His head , and put a purple [ b ] cloak on Him ;
NASB	John	19	3	and they repeatedly came up to Him and said , “ ( C ) Hail , King of the Jews ! ” and ( D ) slapped Him in the face again and again .
NASB	John	19	4	And then Pilate ( E ) came out again and * said to them , “ See , I am bringing Him out to you so that you will know that ( F ) I find no grounds at all for charges in [ c ] His case. ”
NASB	John	19	5	Jesus then came out , ( G ) wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . And Pilate * said to them , “ Behold , the Man ! ”
NASB	John	19	6	So when the chief priests and the ( H ) officers saw Him , they shouted , saying , “ Crucify , crucify ! ” Pilate * said to them , “ Take Him yourselves and crucify Him ; for ( I ) I find no grounds for charges in [ d ] His case ! ”
NASB	John	19	7	The Jews answered him , “ ( J ) We have a law , and by that law He ought to die , because He ( K ) made Himself out to be the Son of God ! ”
NASB	John	19	8	Therefore when Pilate heard this statement , he was even more afraid ;
NASB	John	19	9	and he ( L ) entered the [ e ] Praetorium again and * said to Jesus , “ Where are You from ? ” But ( M ) Jesus gave him no answer .
NASB	John	19	10	So Pilate * said to Him , “ Are you not speaking to me ? Do You not know that I have authority to release You , and I have authority to crucify You ? ”
NASB	John	19	11	Jesus answered him , “ ( N ) You would have no authority [ f ] over Me at all , if it had not been given to you from above ; for this reason ( O ) the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin. ”
NASB	John	19	12	As a result of this , Pilate [ g ] made efforts to release Him ; but the Jews shouted , saying , “ ( P ) If you release this Man , you are not a friend of Caesar ; everyone who makes himself out to be a king [ h ] opposes Caesar ! ”
NASB	John	19	13	Therefore when Pilate heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and ( Q ) sat down on the judgment seat at a place called [ i ] The Pavement—but ( R ) in [ j ] Hebrew , Gabbatha .
NASB	John	19	14	Now it was ( S ) the day of preparation for the Passover ; it was about the [ k ] ( T ) sixth hour . And he * said to the Jews , “ Look , ( U ) your King ! ”
NASB	John	19	15	So they shouted , “ ( V ) Away with Him , away with Him , crucify Him ! ” Pilate * said to them , “ Shall I crucify your King ? ” The chief priests answered , “ We have no king except Caesar. ” The Crucifixion
NASB	John	19	16	So he then ( W ) handed Him over to them to be crucified .
NASB	John	19	17	( X ) They took Jesus , therefore , and He went out , [ l ] ( Y ) carrying His own cross , to the place called ( Z ) the Place of a Skull , which ( AA ) in [ m ] Hebrew is called , Golgotha .
NASB	John	19	18	There they crucified Him , and with Him ( AB ) two other men , one on either side , and Jesus in between .
NASB	John	19	20	Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription , because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written ( AE ) in [ n ] Hebrew , Latin , and in Greek .
NASB	John	19	21	So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate , “ Do not write , ‘ ( AF ) The King of the Jews ’ ; rather , write that He said , ‘ I am ( AG ) King of the Jews. ’ ”
NASB	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ ( AH ) What I have written , I have written. ”
NASB	John	19	23	Then ( AI ) the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took His outer garments and made ( AJ ) four parts : a part to each soldier , and the [ o ] tunic also ; but the tunic was seamless , woven [ p ] in one piece .
NASB	John	19	24	So they said to one another , “ ( AK ) Let ’ s not tear it , but cast lots for it , to decide whose it shall be. ” ( AL ) This happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled : “ They ( AM ) divided My garments among themselves , and they cast [ q ] lots for My clothing. ” Therefore the soldiers did these things .
NASB	John	19	25	( AN ) Now beside the cross of Jesus stood ( AO ) His mother , His mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and ( AP ) Mary Magdalene .
NASB	John	19	26	So when Jesus saw His mother , and ( AQ ) the disciple whom He loved standing nearby , He * said to His mother , “ ( AR ) Woman , behold , your son ! ”
NASB	John	19	27	Then He * said to the disciple , “ Behold , your mother ! ” And from that hour the disciple took her into ( AS ) his own household .
NASB	John	19	28	After this , Jesus , ( AT ) knowing that all things had already been accomplished , ( AU ) in order that the Scripture would be fulfilled , * said , “ ( AV ) I am thirsty. ”
NASB	John	19	29	A jar full of sour wine was standing there ; so ( AW ) they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth .
NASB	John	19	30	Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine , He said , “ ( AX ) It is finished ! ” And He bowed His head and ( AY ) gave up His spirit . Care of the Body of Jesus
NASB	John	19	31	Now then , since it was ( AZ ) the day of preparation , to prevent ( BA ) the bodies from remaining on the cross on the Sabbath ( [ r ] for that Sabbath was a ( BB ) high day ) , the Jews requested of Pilate that their legs be broken , and the bodies be taken away .
NASB	John	19	32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man , and of the other who was ( BC ) crucified with Him ;
NASB	John	19	33	but after they came to Jesus , when they saw that He was already dead , they did not break His legs .

NASB	John	19	35	And he who has seen has ( BE ) testified , and his testimony is true ; and he knows that he is telling the truth , so that you also may believe .
NASB	John	19	36	For these things took place ( BF ) so that the Scripture would be fulfilled : “ ( BG ) Not a bone of Him shall be [ s ] broken. ”
NASB	John	19	37	And again another Scripture says , “ ( BH ) They will look at Him whom they pierced. ”
NASB	John	19	38	Now ( BI ) after these things Joseph of Arimathea , being a disciple of Jesus , but a ( BJ ) secret one for ( BK ) fear of the [ t ] Jews , requested of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus ; and Pilate granted permission . So he came and took away His body .
NASB	John	19	39	( BL ) Nicodemus , who had first come to Him by night , also came , ( BM ) bringing a [ u ] mixture of ( BN ) myrrh and aloes , about a [ v ] ( BO ) hundred litras weight .
NASB	John	19	40	So they took the body of Jesus and ( BP ) bound it in ( BQ ) linen wrappings with the spices , as is the burial custom of the Jews .
NASB	John	19	41	Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden , and in the garden was a ( BR ) new tomb ( BS ) in which no one had yet been laid .
NASB	John	19	42	Therefore because of the Jewish day of ( BT ) preparation , since the tomb was ( BU ) nearby , they laid Jesus there .

NASB	John	20	20	And when He had said this , ( AE ) He showed them both His hands and His side . The disciples then ( AF ) rejoiced when they saw the Lord .
NASB	John	20	2	So she * ran and * came to Simon Peter and to the other ( D ) disciple whom Jesus loved , and * said to them , “ ( E ) They have taken the Lord from the tomb , and we do not know where they have put Him. ”
NASB	John	20	3	( F ) So Peter and the other disciple left , and they were going to the tomb .
NASB	John	20	4	The two were running together ; and the other disciple ran ahead , faster than Peter , and came to the tomb first ;
NASB	John	20	5	and he ( G ) stooped to look in , and * saw the ( H ) linen wrappings lying there ; however he did not go in .
NASB	John	20	6	So Simon Peter also * came , following him , and he entered the tomb ; and he * looked at the linen wrappings lying there ,
NASB	John	20	7	and ( I ) the face-cloth which had been on His head , not lying with the ( J ) linen wrappings but folded up in a place by itself .
NASB	John	20	8	So the other disciple who ( K ) had first come to the tomb also entered then , and he saw and believed .
NASB	John	20	9	For ( L ) they did not yet understand the Scripture , ( M ) that He must rise from the dead .
NASB	John	20	10	So the disciples went away again ( N ) to their own homes .
NASB	John	20	11	( O ) But Mary was standing outside the tomb , weeping ; so as she wept , she ( P ) stooped to look into the tomb ;
NASB	John	20	12	and she * saw ( Q ) two angels in white sitting , one at the head and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had been lying .
NASB	John	20	13	And they * said to her , “ ( R ) Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She * said to them , “ Because ( S ) they have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they put Him. ”
NASB	John	20	14	When she had said this , she turned around and * ( T ) saw Jesus standing there , and yet she ( U ) did not know that it was Jesus .
NASB	John	20	15	Jesus * said to her , “ ( V ) Woman , why are you weeping ? Whom are you seeking ? ” Thinking that He was the gardener , she * said to Him , “ Sir , if you have carried Him away , tell me where you put Him , and I will take Him away. ”
NASB	John	20	16	Jesus * said to her , “ Mary ! ” She turned and * said to Him ( W ) in [ a ] Hebrew , “ ( X ) Rabboni ! ” ( which means , Teacher ) .
NASB	John	20	17	Jesus * said to her , “ Stop clinging to Me , for I have not yet ascended to the Father ; but go to ( Y ) My brothers and say to them , ‘ I am ( Z ) ascending to My Father and your Father , and My God and your God. ’ ”
NASB	John	20	18	( AA ) Mary Magdalene * came and ( AB ) announced to the disciples , “ I have seen the Lord , ” and that He had said these things to her . Jesus among His Disciples
NASB	John	20	19	Now when it was evening on that day , the first day of the week , and when the doors were [ b ] shut where the disciples were together due to ( AC ) fear of the [ c ] Jews , Jesus came and stood in their midst , and * said to them , “ ( AD ) Peace be to you. ”
NASB	John	20	21	So Jesus said to them again , “ ( AG ) Peace be to you ; ( AH ) just as the Father has sent Me , I also send you. ”
NASB	John	20	22	And when He had said this , He breathed on them and * said to them , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
NASB	John	20	23	( AI ) If you forgive the sins of any , their sins [ d ] have been forgiven them ; if you retain the sins of any , they have been retained. ”
NASB	John	20	24	But ( AJ ) Thomas , one of ( AK ) the twelve , who was called [ e ] ( AL ) Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
NASB	John	20	25	So the other disciples were saying to him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But he said to them , “ Unless I see in ( AM ) His hands the imprint of the nails , and put my finger into the place of the nails , and put my hand into His side , ( AN ) I will not believe. ”
NASB	John	20	26	[ f ] Eight days later His disciples were again inside , and Thomas was with them . Jesus * came , the doors having been [ g ] shut , and stood in their midst and said , “ ( AO ) Peace be to you. ”
NASB	John	20	27	Then He * said to Thomas , “ ( AP ) Place your finger here , and see My hands ; and take your hand and put it into My side ; and do not continue in disbelief , but be a believer. ”
NASB	John	20	28	Thomas answered and said to Him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
NASB	John	20	29	Jesus * said to him , “ Because you have seen Me , have you now believed ? ( AQ ) Blessed are they who did not see , and yet believed. ” Why This Gospel Was Written
NASB	John	20	30	( AR ) So then , many other [ h ] ( AS ) signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book ;
NASB	John	20	31	but these have been written ( AT ) so that you may believe that Jesus is the [ i ] Christ , ( AU ) the Son of God ; and that by ( AV ) believing you may have life in His name .

NASB	John	21	21	So Peter , upon seeing him , * said to Jesus , “ Lord , and what about this man ? ”
NASB	John	21	2	Simon Peter , ( D ) Thomas who was called [ b ] Didymus , ( E ) Nathanael of ( F ) Cana in Galilee , ( G ) the sons of Zebedee , and two others of His disciples were together .
NASB	John	21	3	Simon Peter * said to them , “ I am going fishing. ” They * said to him , “ We are also coming with you. ” They went out and got into the boat ; and ( H ) that night they caught nothing .
NASB	John	21	4	But when the day was now breaking , Jesus stood on the beach ; yet the disciples did not ( I ) know that it was Jesus .
NASB	John	21	5	So Jesus * said to them , “ Children , ( J ) you do not have any fish to eat , do you ? ” They answered Him , “ No. ”
NASB	John	21	6	And He said to them , “ ( K ) Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat , and you will find the fish. ” So they cast it , and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great quantity of fish .
NASB	John	21	7	( L ) Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved * said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he put on his outer garment ( for he was stripped for work ) , and threw himself into the sea .
NASB	John	21	8	But the other disciples came in the little boat , for they were not far from the land , but about [ c ] two hundred cubits away , dragging the net full of fish .
NASB	John	21	9	So when they got out on the land , they * saw a charcoal ( M ) fire already [ d ] made and ( N ) fish placed on it , and bread .
NASB	John	21	10	Jesus * said to them , “ Bring some of the ( O ) fish which you have now caught. ”
NASB	John	21	11	So Simon Peter went up and hauled the net to land , full of large fish ,
NASB	John	21	153	; and although there were so many , the net was not torn . Jesus Provides
NASB	John	21	12	Jesus * said to them , “ Come and have ( P ) breakfast. ” None of the disciples ventured to inquire of Him , “ Who are You ? ” knowing that it was the Lord .
NASB	John	21	13	Jesus * came and * took ( Q ) the bread and * gave it to them , and the ( R ) fish likewise .
NASB	John	21	14	This was now the ( S ) third time that Jesus revealed Himself to the disciples , after He was raised from the dead . The Love Question
NASB	John	21	15	Now when they had ( T ) finished breakfast , Jesus * said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of John , do you [ e ] ( U ) love Me more than these ? ” He * said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; You know that I [ f ] love You. ” He * said to him , “ Tend ( V ) My lambs. ”
NASB	John	21	16	He * said to him again , a second time , “ Simon , son of John , do you [ g ] love Me ? ” He * said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; You know that I [ h ] love You. ” He * said to him , “ ( W ) Shepherd My sheep. ”
NASB	John	21	17	He * said to him the third time , “ Simon , son of John , do you [ i ] love Me ? ” Peter was [ j ] hurt because He said to him ( X ) the third time , “ Do you [ k ] love Me ? ” And he said to Him , “ Lord , ( Y ) You know all things ; You know that I [ l ] love You. ” Jesus * said to him , “ ( Z ) Tend My sheep . Our Times Are in His Hand
NASB	John	21	18	in . or
NASB	John	21	19	Now He said this , ( AA ) indicating by ( AB ) what kind of death he would glorify God . And when He had said this , He * said to him , “ ( AC ) Follow Me ! ”
NASB	John	21	20	Peter turned around and * saw the ( AD ) disciple whom Jesus loved following them—the one who also had ( AE ) leaned back on His chest at the supper and said , “ Lord , who is the one who is betraying You ? ”
NASB	John	21	22	Jesus * said to him , “ If I want him to remain ( AF ) until I come , what is that to you ? You ( AG ) follow Me ! ”
NASB	John	21	23	Therefore this [ m ] account went out among ( AH ) the brothers , that that disciple would not die ; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die , but only , “ If I want him to remain ( AI ) until I come , what is that to you ? ”
NASB	John	21	24	This is the disciple who ( AJ ) is testifying about these things and wrote these things , and we know that his testimony is true .

NASB	Romans	1	1	Paul , a bond-servant of Christ Jesus , [ a ] ( A ) called as an apostle , ( B ) set apart for ( C ) the gospel of God ,
NASB	Romans	1	2	which He ( D ) promised beforehand through His ( E ) prophets in the holy Scriptures ,
NASB	Romans	1	3	concerning His Son , who was born ( F ) of a [ b ] descendant of David ( G ) according to the flesh ,
NASB	Romans	1	4	who was declared ( H ) the Son of God with power according to the [ c ] Spirit of holiness [ d ] by the resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord ,
NASB	Romans	1	5	through whom we have received grace and ( I ) apostleship [ e ] to bring about the ( J ) obedience of faith among ( K ) all the Gentiles in behalf of His name ,
NASB	Romans	1	6	among whom you also are the ( L ) called of Jesus Christ ;
NASB	Romans	1	7	to all who are ( M ) beloved of God in Rome , called as [ f ] ( N ) saints : ( O ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB	Romans	1	8	First , ( P ) I thank my God through Jesus Christ [ g ] for you all , because ( Q ) your faith is being proclaimed throughout the world .
NASB	Romans	1	9	For ( R ) God , whom I ( S ) serve in my spirit in the preaching of the gospel of His Son , is my witness as to how unceasingly ( T ) I make mention of you ,
NASB	Romans	1	10	always in my prayers requesting if perhaps now , at last by ( U ) the will of God , I will succeed in coming to you .
NASB	Romans	1	11	For ( V ) I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you , that you may be [ h ] established ;
NASB	Romans	1	12	that is , that I may be encouraged together with you while among you , each of us by the other ’ s faith , both yours and mine .
NASB	Romans	1	13	( W ) I do not want you to be unaware , ( X ) brothers and sisters , that often I ( Y ) have planned to come to you ( and have been prevented so far ) so that I may obtain some ( Z ) fruit among you also just as among the rest of the Gentiles .
NASB	Romans	1	14	( AA ) I am [ i ] under obligation both to Greeks and to the [ j ] ( AB ) uncultured , both to the wise and to the foolish .
NASB	Romans	1	15	So , for my part , I am eager to ( AC ) preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome .
NASB	Romans	1	16	For I am not ( AD ) ashamed of the gospel , for ( AE ) it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes , to the ( AF ) Jew first and also to ( AG ) the Greek .
NASB	Romans	1	17	For in it ( AH ) the righteousness of God is revealed [ k ] from faith to faith ; as it is written : “ [ l ] ( AI ) But the righteous one will live by faith. ” Unbelief and Its Consequences
NASB	Romans	1	18	For ( AJ ) the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who ( AK ) suppress the truth [ m ] in unrighteousness ,
NASB	Romans	1	19	because ( AL ) that which is known about God is evident [ n ] within them ; for God made it evident to them .
NASB	Romans	1	20	For ( AM ) since the creation of the world His invisible attributes , that is , His eternal power and divine nature , have been clearly perceived , ( AN ) being understood by what has been made , so that they are without excuse .
NASB	Romans	1	21	For even though they knew God , they did not [ o ] honor Him as God or give thanks , but they became ( AO ) futile in their reasonings , and their senseless hearts were darkened .
NASB	Romans	1	22	( AP ) Claiming to be wise , they became fools ,
NASB	Romans	1	23	and they ( AQ ) exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible mankind , of birds , four-footed animals , and [ p ] crawling creatures .
NASB	Romans	1	24	Therefore ( AR ) God gave them up to vile impurity in the lusts of their hearts , so that their bodies would be ( AS ) dishonored among them .
NASB	Romans	1	25	For they exchanged the truth of God for [ q ] ( AT ) falsehood , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , ( AU ) who is blessed [ r ] forever . Amen .
NASB	Romans	1	26	For this reason ( AV ) God gave them over to ( AW ) degrading passions ; for their women exchanged natural relations for that which is contrary to nature ,
NASB	Romans	1	27	and likewise the men , too , abandoned natural relations [ s ] with women and burned in their desire toward one another , ( AX ) males with males committing [ t ] shameful acts and receiving in [ u ] their own persons the due penalty of their error .
NASB	Romans	1	28	And just as they did not see fit [ v ] to acknowledge God , ( AY ) God gave them up to a depraved mind , to do those things that are not proper ,
NASB	Romans	1	29	people having been filled with all unrighteousness , wickedness , greed , and evil ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , and malice ; they are ( AZ ) gossips ,
NASB	Romans	1	30	slanderers , [ w ] ( BA ) haters of God , insolent , arrogant , boastful , inventors of evil , ( BB ) disobedient to parents ,
NASB	Romans	1	31	without understanding , untrustworthy , ( BC ) unfeeling , and unmerciful ;
NASB	Romans	1	32	and although they know the ordinance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of ( BD ) death , they not only do the same , but also ( BE ) approve of those who practice them .

NASB	Romans	2	2	And we know that the judgment of God [ c ] rightly falls upon those who practice such things .
NASB	Romans	2	3	But do you suppose this , [ d ] ( D ) you foolish person who passes judgment on those who practice such things , and yet does them as well , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
NASB	Romans	2	4	Or do you think lightly of ( E ) the riches of His ( F ) kindness and [ e ] ( G ) restraint and ( H ) patience , not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance ?
NASB	Romans	2	5	But [ f ] because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart ( I ) you are storing up wrath for yourself ( J ) on the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ,
NASB	Romans	2	6	( K ) who will repay each person according to his deeds :
NASB	Romans	2	7	to those who by ( L ) perseverance in doing good seek ( M ) glory , honor , and ( N ) immortality , He will give ( O ) eternal life ;
NASB	Romans	2	8	but to those who are ( P ) self-serving and ( Q ) do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , He will give wrath and indignation .
NASB	Romans	2	9	There will be ( R ) tribulation and distress [ g ] for every soul of mankind who does evil , [ h ] for the Jew ( S ) first and also [ i ] for the Greek ,
NASB	Romans	2	10	but ( T ) glory , honor , and peace to everyone who does what is good , to the Jew ( U ) first and also to the Greek .
NASB	Romans	2	11	For ( V ) there is no partiality with God .
NASB	Romans	2	12	For all who have sinned [ j ] ( W ) without the Law will also perish [ k ] without the Law , and all who have sinned [ l ] under the Law will be judged [ m ] by the Law ;
NASB	Romans	2	13	for it is ( X ) not the hearers [ n ] of the Law who are [ o ] righteous before God , but the doers [ p ] of the Law who will be justified .
NASB	Romans	2	14	For when Gentiles who do not have [ q ] the Law [ r ] ( Y ) instinctively perform the requirements of the Law , these , though not having [ s ] the Law , are a law to themselves ,
NASB	Romans	2	15	in that they show ( Z ) the work of the Law written in their hearts , their conscience testifying and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them ,
NASB	Romans	2	16	on the day when , ( AA ) according to my gospel , ( AB ) God will judge the secrets of mankind through Christ Jesus . The Jews under the Law
NASB	Romans	2	17	But if you call yourself a [ t ] Jew and ( AC ) rely [ u ] upon the Law and boast in God ,
NASB	Romans	2	18	and know His will and [ v ] ( AD ) distinguish the things that matter , being instructed from the Law ,
NASB	Romans	2	19	and are confident that you yourself are a guide to people who are blind , a light to those in darkness ,
NASB	Romans	2	20	a [ w ] corrector of the foolish , a teacher of [ x ] the immature , possessing in the Law ( AE ) the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth—
NASB	Romans	2	21	you , therefore , ( AF ) who teach someone else , do you not teach yourself ? You who [ y ] preach that one is not to steal , do you steal ?
NASB	Romans	2	22	You who say that one is not to commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who loathe idols , do you ( AG ) rob temples ?
NASB	Romans	2	23	You who ( AH ) boast [ z ] in the Law , through your breaking the Law , do you dishonor God ?
NASB	Romans	2	24	For “ ( AI ) the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles ( AJ ) because of you , ” just as it is written .
NASB	Romans	2	25	For indeed circumcision is of value if you ( AK ) practice [ aa ] the Law ; but if you are a violator [ ab ] of the Law , ( AL ) your circumcision has turned into uncircumcision .
NASB	Romans	2	26	( AM ) So if ( AN ) the [ ac ] uncircumcised man ( AO ) keeps the requirements of the Law , will his uncircumcision not be regarded as circumcision ?
NASB	Romans	2	27	And ( AP ) he who is physically uncircumcised , if he keeps the Law , will he not ( AQ ) judge you who [ ad ] though having the letter of the Law and circumcision are a violator [ ae ] of the Law ?
NASB	Romans	2	28	For ( AR ) he is not a Jew who is one outwardly , nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh .
NASB	Romans	2	29	But ( AS ) he is a Jew who is one inwardly ; and ( AT ) circumcision is of the heart , by the ( AU ) Spirit , not by the letter ; ( AV ) and his praise is not from people , but from God .

NASB	Romans	3	4	[ d ] ( D ) Far from it ! Rather , God must prove to be true , though every person be found ( E ) a liar , as it is written :

NASB	Romans	3	9	What then ? [ h ] ( O ) Are we better than they ? Not at all ; for we have already charged that both ( P ) Jews and ( Q ) Greeks are ( R ) all under sin ;
NASB	Romans	3	10	as it is written : “ ( S ) There is no righteous person , not even one ;
NASB	Romans	3	11	There is no one who understands , There is no one who seeks out God ;
NASB	Romans	3	12	They have all turned aside , together they have become [ i ] corrupt ; There is no one who does good , There is not even one. ”
NASB	Romans	3	13	“ ( T ) Their throat is an open grave , With their tongues they keep deceiving , ” “ ( U ) The venom of [ j ] asps is under their lips ” ;
NASB	Romans	3	14	“ ( V ) Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness ” ;
NASB	Romans	3	15	“ ( W ) Their feet are swift to shed blood ,
NASB	Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their paths ,
NASB	Romans	3	17	And they have not known the way of peace. ”
NASB	Romans	3	18	“ ( X ) There is no fear of God before their eyes. ”
NASB	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever the ( Y ) Law says , it speaks to ( Z ) those who are [ k ] under the Law , so that every mouth may be closed and ( AA ) all the world may become accountable to God ;
NASB	Romans	3	20	because ( AB ) by the works [ l ] of the Law [ m ] none of mankind will be justified in His sight ; for [ n ] ( AC ) through the Law comes [ o ] knowledge of sin . Justification by Faith
NASB	Romans	3	21	But now apart [ p ] from the Law ( AD ) the righteousness of God has been revealed , being ( AE ) witnessed by the [ q ] Law and the Prophets ,
NASB	Romans	3	22	but it is the ( AF ) righteousness of God through ( AG ) faith ( AH ) in Jesus Christ for ( AI ) all those [ r ] who believe ; for ( AJ ) there is no distinction ,
NASB	Romans	3	23	for all [ s ] ( AK ) have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
NASB	Romans	3	24	being justified as a gift ( AL ) by His grace through ( AM ) the redemption which is in Christ Jesus ,
NASB	Romans	3	25	whom God displayed publicly as ( AN ) a [ t ] propitiation [ u ] ( AO ) in His blood through faith . This was to demonstrate His righteousness , [ v ] because in God ’ s merciful ( AP ) restraint He ( AQ ) let the sins previously committed go unpunished ;
NASB	Romans	3	26	for the demonstration , that is , of His righteousness at the present time , so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who [ w ] has faith in Jesus .
NASB	Romans	3	27	Where then is ( AR ) boasting ? It has been excluded . By ( AS ) what kind of law ? Of works ? No , but by a law of faith .
NASB	Romans	3	28	[ x ] For ( AT ) we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from works [ y ] of the Law .
NASB	Romans	3	29	Or ( AU ) is God the God of Jews only ? Is He not the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , of Gentiles also ,
NASB	Romans	3	30	since indeed ( AV ) God ( AW ) who will justify the [ z ] circumcised [ aa ] by faith and the [ ab ] uncircumcised through faith ( AX ) is one .
NASB	Romans	3	31	Do we then nullify [ ac ] the Law through faith ? ( AY ) Far from it ! On the contrary , we ( AZ ) establish the Law .

NASB	Romans	4	4	Now to the one who ( D ) works , the wages are not credited as a favor , but as what is due .
NASB	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified [ b ] by works , he has something to boast about ; but ( B ) not [ c ] before God .
NASB	Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say ? “ ( C ) Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness. ”
NASB	Romans	4	5	But to the one who does not work , but ( E ) believes in Him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is credited as righteousness ,
NASB	Romans	4	6	just as David also speaks of the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
NASB	Romans	4	7	“ ( F ) Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven , And whose sins have been covered .
NASB	Romans	4	8	( G ) Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not ( H ) take into account. ”
NASB	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing then on [ d ] ( I ) the circumcised , or on [ e ] the uncircumcised also ? For ( J ) we say , “ ( K ) Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness. ”
NASB	Romans	4	10	How then was it credited ? While he was [ f ] circumcised , or [ g ] uncircumcised ? Not while [ h ] circumcised , but while [ i ] uncircumcised ;
NASB	Romans	4	11	and he ( L ) received the sign of circumcision , ( M ) a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [ j ] he had while uncircumcised , so that he might be ( N ) the father of ( O ) all who believe without being circumcised , that righteousness might be credited to them ,
NASB	Romans	4	12	and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which [ k ] he had while uncircumcised .
NASB	Romans	4	13	For ( P ) the promise to Abraham or to his [ l ] descendants ( Q ) that he would be heir of the world was not [ m ] through the Law , but through the righteousness of faith .
NASB	Romans	4	14	For ( R ) if those who are [ n ] of the Law are heirs , then faith is made void and the promise is nullified ;
NASB	Romans	4	15	for ( S ) the Law brings about wrath , but ( T ) where there is no law , there also is no violation .
NASB	Romans	4	16	For this reason it is [ o ] by faith , in order that it may be in accordance with ( U ) grace , so that the promise will be guaranteed to ( V ) all the [ p ] descendants , not only to [ q ] those who are of the Law , but also to [ r ] ( W ) those who are of the faith of Abraham , who is ( X ) the father of us all ,
NASB	Romans	4	17	( as it is written : “ I have made you ( Y ) a father of many nations ” ) in the presence of Him whom he believed , that is , God , ( Z ) who gives life to the dead and ( AA ) calls into being ( AB ) things that do not exist .
NASB	Romans	4	18	In hope against hope he believed , so that he might become ( AC ) a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken , “ ( AD ) So shall your [ s ] descendants be. ”
NASB	Romans	4	19	Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body , now ( AE ) as good as dead since ( AF ) he was about a hundred years old , and ( AG ) the deadness of Sarah ’ s womb ;
NASB	Romans	4	20	yet , with respect to the promise of God , he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith , ( AH ) giving glory to God ,
NASB	Romans	4	21	and ( AI ) being fully assured that ( AJ ) what God had promised , He was able also to perform .
NASB	Romans	4	22	Therefore ( AK ) it was also credited to him as righteousness .
NASB	Romans	4	23	Now ( AL ) not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him ,
NASB	Romans	4	24	but for our sake also , to whom it will be credited , to us ( AM ) who believe in Him who ( AN ) raised Jesus our Lord from the dead ,
NASB	Romans	4	25	He who was ( AO ) delivered over because of our wrongdoings , and was ( AP ) raised because of our justification .

NASB	Romans	5	5	and hope ( J ) does not disappoint , because the love of God has been ( K ) poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
NASB	Romans	5	2	through whom we also have ( C ) obtained our introduction by faith into this grace ( D ) in which we stand ; and [ b ] we celebrate in hope of the glory of God .
NASB	Romans	5	3	( E ) And not only this , but [ c ] we also ( F ) celebrate in our tribulations , knowing that tribulation brings about ( G ) perseverance ;
NASB	Romans	5	4	and ( H ) perseverance , ( I ) proven character ; and proven character , hope ;
NASB	Romans	5	6	For while we were still ( L ) helpless , ( M ) at the right time ( N ) Christ died for the ungodly .
NASB	Romans	5	7	For one will hardly die for a righteous person ; [ d ] though perhaps for the good person someone would even dare to die .
NASB	Romans	5	8	But God ( O ) demonstrates ( P ) His own love toward us , in that while we were still sinners , ( Q ) Christ died for us .
NASB	Romans	5	9	Much more then , having now been justified [ e ] ( R ) by His blood , we shall be saved ( S ) from the wrath of God through Him .
NASB	Romans	5	10	For if while we were ( T ) enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son , much more , having been reconciled , we shall be saved [ f ] ( U ) by His life .
NASB	Romans	5	11	( V ) And not only this , but [ g ] we also celebrate in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received ( W ) the reconciliation .
NASB	Romans	5	12	Therefore , just as through ( X ) one man sin entered into the world , and ( Y ) death through sin , and ( Z ) so death spread to all mankind , because all sinned—
NASB	Romans	5	13	for [ h ] until the Law sin was in the world , but ( AA ) sin is not [ i ] counted against anyone when there is no law .
NASB	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses , even over those who had not sinned ( AB ) in the likeness of the [ j ] violation committed by Adam , who is a [ k ] ( AC ) type of Him who was to come .
NASB	Romans	5	15	But [ l ] the gracious gift is not like the offense . For if by the offense of ( AD ) the one ( AE ) the many died , much more did the grace of God and the gift by ( AF ) the grace of the one Man , Jesus Christ , overflow to the many .
NASB	Romans	5	16	The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned ; for on the one hand ( AG ) the judgment arose from one offense , [ m ] resulting in condemnation , but on the other hand the gracious gift arose from many offenses , [ n ] resulting in justification .
NASB	Romans	5	17	For if by the offense of the one , death reigned ( AH ) through the one , much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness ( AI ) reign in life through the One , Jesus Christ .
NASB	Romans	5	18	So then , as through ( AJ ) one offense [ o ] the result was condemnation to all mankind , so also through one ( AK ) act of righteousness [ p ] the result was ( AL ) justification of life to all mankind .
NASB	Romans	5	19	For as through the one man ’ s disobedience ( AM ) the many ( AN ) were made sinners , so also through ( AO ) the obedience of the One ( AP ) the many will be made righteous .
NASB	Romans	5	20	[ q ] ( AQ ) The Law came in so that the offense would increase ; but where sin increased , ( AR ) grace abounded all the more ,
NASB	Romans	5	21	so that , as ( AS ) sin reigned in death , so also ( AT ) grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .

NASB	Romans	6	6	knowing this , that our ( L ) old [ d ] self was ( M ) crucified with Him , in order that our ( N ) body of sin might be [ e ] done away with , so that we would no longer be slaves to sin ;
NASB	Romans	6	2	[ a ] ( C ) Far from it ! How shall we who ( D ) died to sin still live in it ?
NASB	Romans	6	3	Or do you not know that all of us who have been ( E ) baptized into ( F ) Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death ?
NASB	Romans	6	4	Therefore we have been ( G ) buried with Him through baptism into death , so that , just as Christ was ( H ) raised from the dead through the ( I ) glory of the Father , so we too may walk in ( J ) newness of life .
NASB	Romans	6	5	For ( K ) if we have become [ b ] united with Him in the likeness of His death , certainly we shall also be [ c ] in the likeness of His resurrection ,
NASB	Romans	6	7	for ( O ) the one who has died is [ f ] freed from sin .
NASB	Romans	6	8	Now ( P ) if we have died with Christ , we believe that ( Q ) we shall also live with Him ,
NASB	Romans	6	9	knowing that Christ , having been ( R ) raised from the dead , [ g ] is never to die again ; ( S ) death no longer is master over Him .
NASB	Romans	6	10	For [ h ] the death that He died , He died to sin once for all time ; but [ i ] the life that He lives , He lives to [ j ] God .
NASB	Romans	6	11	So you too , consider yourselves to be ( T ) dead to sin , but alive to God in Christ Jesus .
NASB	Romans	6	12	Therefore sin is not to ( U ) reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts ,
NASB	Romans	6	13	and do not go on ( V ) presenting [ k ] the parts of your body to sin as [ l ] instruments of unrighteousness ; but ( W ) present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead , and [ m ] your body ’ s parts as [ n ] instruments of righteousness for God .
NASB	Romans	6	14	For ( X ) sin shall not ( Y ) be master over you , for ( Z ) you are not under [ o ] the Law but ( AA ) under grace .
NASB	Romans	6	15	What then ? ( AB ) Are we to sin because we are not under [ p ] the Law but under grace ? [ q ] ( AC ) Far from it !
NASB	Romans	6	16	Do you not ( AD ) know that the one to whom you present yourselves as ( AE ) slaves for obedience , you are slaves of that same one whom you obey , either of ( AF ) sin [ r ] resulting in death , or of obedience [ s ] resulting in righteousness ?
NASB	Romans	6	17	But ( AG ) thanks be to God that [ t ] though you were slaves of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that [ u ] ( AH ) form of teaching to which you were entrusted ,
NASB	Romans	6	18	and after being ( AI ) freed from sin , you became slaves to righteousness .
NASB	Romans	6	19	( AJ ) I am speaking [ v ] in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh . For just ( AK ) as you presented [ w ] the parts of your body as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness , [ x ] resulting in further lawlessness , so now present [ y ] your body ’ s parts as slaves to righteousness , [ z ] resulting in sanctification .
NASB	Romans	6	20	For ( AL ) when you were slaves of sin , you were free in relation to righteousness .
NASB	Romans	6	21	Therefore what [ aa ] ( AM ) benefit were you then [ ab ] deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed ? For the outcome of those things is ( AN ) death .
NASB	Romans	6	22	But now having been ( AO ) freed from sin and ( AP ) enslaved to God , you [ ac ] derive your [ ad ] ( AQ ) benefit , [ ae ] resulting in sanctification , and ( AR ) the outcome , eternal life .
NASB	Romans	6	23	For the wages of ( AS ) sin is death , but the gracious gift of God is ( AT ) eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .

NASB	Romans	7	7	( M ) What shall we say then ? Is the Law sin ? ( N ) [ i ] Far from it ! On the contrary , ( O ) I would not have come to know sin except [ j ] through the Law ; for I would not have known about [ k ] coveting if the Law had not said , “ ( P ) You shall not [ l ] covet. ”
NASB	Romans	7	2	For ( B ) the married woman is bound by law to her [ c ] husband as long as he is alive ; but if her husband dies , she is released from the law [ d ] concerning the husband .
NASB	Romans	7	3	So then , if while her husband is alive she [ e ] gives herself to another man , she will be called an adulteress ; but if her husband dies , she is free from the law , so that she is not an adulteress if she [ f ] gives herself to another man .
NASB	Romans	7	4	Therefore , my brothers and sisters , you also were ( C ) put to death ( D ) in regard to the Law ( E ) through the body of Christ , so that you might belong to another , to Him who was raised from the dead , in order that we might bear fruit for God .
NASB	Romans	7	5	For while we were ( F ) in the flesh , the sinful passions , which were ( G ) brought to light by the Law , were at work ( H ) in [ g ] the parts of our body to bear fruit for death .
NASB	Romans	7	6	But now we have been ( I ) released from the Law , having ( J ) died to that by which we were bound , so that we serve in ( K ) newness of ( L ) the [ h ] Spirit and not in oldness of the letter .
NASB	Romans	7	8	But sin , ( Q ) taking an opportunity ( R ) through the commandment , produced in me [ m ] coveting of every kind ; for ( S ) apart [ n ] from the Law sin is dead .
NASB	Romans	7	9	I was once alive apart [ o ] from the Law ; but when the commandment came , sin came to life , and I died ;
NASB	Romans	7	10	and this commandment , which was [ p ] ( T ) to result in life , proved [ q ] to result in death for me ;
NASB	Romans	7	11	for sin , ( U ) taking an opportunity ( V ) through the commandment , ( W ) deceived me , and through it , killed me .
NASB	Romans	7	12	( X ) So then , the Law is holy , and the commandment is holy and righteous and good .
NASB	Romans	7	13	Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me ? [ r ] ( Y ) Far from it ! Rather it was sin , in order that it might be shown to be sin by bringing about my death through that which is good , so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful . The Conflict of Serving Two Masters
NASB	Romans	7	14	For we know that the Law is ( Z ) spiritual , but I am ( AA ) fleshly , ( AB ) sold [ s ] ( AC ) into bondage to sin .
NASB	Romans	7	15	For ( AD ) I do not understand what I am doing ; for I am not practicing ( AE ) what I want to do , but I do the very thing I hate .
NASB	Romans	7	16	However , if I do the very thing I do not want to do , I agree with ( AF ) the Law , that the Law is good .
NASB	Romans	7	17	But now , ( AG ) no longer am I the one doing it , but sin that dwells in me .
NASB	Romans	7	18	For I know that good does not dwell in me , that is , in my ( AH ) flesh ; for the willing is present in me , but the doing of the good is not .
NASB	Romans	7	19	For ( AI ) the good that I want , I do not do , but I practice the very evil that I do not want .
NASB	Romans	7	20	But if I do the very thing I do not want , ( AJ ) I am no longer the one doing it , but sin that dwells in me .
NASB	Romans	7	21	I find then ( AK ) the [ t ] principle that evil is present in me , the one who wants to do good .
NASB	Romans	7	22	For I joyfully agree with the law of God [ u ] in ( AL ) the inner person ,
NASB	Romans	7	23	but I see ( AM ) a different law in [ v ] the parts of my body waging war against the ( AN ) law of my mind , and making me a prisoner [ w ] of ( AO ) the law of sin , the law which is in [ x ] my body ’ s parts .
NASB	Romans	7	24	Wretched man that I am ! Who will set me free from [ y ] ( AP ) the body of this ( AQ ) death ?
NASB	Romans	7	25	( AR ) Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God , but on the other , with my flesh ( AS ) the law of sin .

NASB	Romans	8	8	and those who are ( Q ) in the flesh can not please God .
NASB	Romans	8	2	For ( D ) the law of the Spirit of life [ a ] in ( E ) Christ Jesus ( F ) has set you free from the law of sin and of death .
NASB	Romans	8	3	For ( G ) what the Law could not do , [ b ] ( H ) weak as it was through the flesh , God did : sending His own Son in ( I ) the likeness of [ c ] sinful flesh and as an offering for sin , He condemned sin in the flesh ,
NASB	Romans	8	4	so that the ( J ) requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us who ( K ) do not walk [ d ] according to the flesh but [ e ] according to the Spirit .
NASB	Romans	8	5	For those who are in accord with the flesh set their minds on ( L ) the things of the flesh , but those who are in accord with the Spirit , ( M ) the things of the Spirit .
NASB	Romans	8	6	( N ) For the mind [ f ] set on the flesh is ( O ) death , but the mind [ g ] set on the Spirit is life and peace ,
NASB	Romans	8	7	because the mind [ h ] set on the flesh is ( P ) hostile toward God ; for it does not subject itself to the law of God , for it is not even able to do so ,
NASB	Romans	8	9	However , you are not ( R ) in the flesh but in the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of God ( S ) dwells in you . But ( T ) if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , he does not belong to Him .
NASB	Romans	8	10	( U ) If Christ is in you , though the body is dead because of sin , yet the spirit is [ i ] alive because of righteousness .
NASB	Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of Him who ( V ) raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you , ( W ) He who raised ( X ) Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies [ j ] through His Spirit who dwells in you .
NASB	Romans	8	12	So then , brothers and sisters , we are under obligation , not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh—
NASB	Romans	8	13	for ( Y ) if you are living in accord with the flesh , you are going to die ; but if by the Spirit you are ( Z ) putting to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
NASB	Romans	8	14	For all who are ( AA ) being led by the Spirit of God , these are ( AB ) sons and daughters of God .
NASB	Romans	8	15	For you ( AC ) have not received a spirit of slavery [ k ] leading to fear again , but you ( AD ) have received [ l ] a spirit of adoption as sons and daughters by which we cry out , “ ( AE ) Abba ! [ m ] Father ! ”
NASB	Romans	8	16	The Spirit Himself ( AF ) testifies with our spirit that we are ( AG ) children of God ,
NASB	Romans	8	17	and if children , ( AH ) heirs also , heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ , ( AI ) if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him .
NASB	Romans	8	18	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time ( AJ ) are not worthy to be compared with the ( AK ) glory that is to be revealed to us .
NASB	Romans	8	19	For the ( AL ) eagerly awaiting creation waits for ( AM ) the revealing of the ( AN ) sons and daughters of God .
NASB	Romans	8	20	For the creation ( AO ) was subjected to ( AP ) futility , not willingly , but ( AQ ) because of Him who subjected it , [ n ] in hope
NASB	Romans	8	21	that ( AR ) the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God .
NASB	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation ( AS ) groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now .
NASB	Romans	8	23	( AT ) And not only that , but also we ourselves , having ( AU ) the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves ( AV ) groan within ourselves , ( AW ) waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons and daughters , ( AX ) the redemption of our body .
NASB	Romans	8	24	For ( AY ) in hope we have been saved , but ( AZ ) hope that is seen is not hope ; for who hopes for what he already sees ?
NASB	Romans	8	25	But ( BA ) if we hope for what we do not see , through perseverance we wait eagerly for it . Our Victory in Christ
NASB	Romans	8	26	Now in the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness ; for ( BB ) we do not know what to pray for as we should , but ( BC ) the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with [ o ] groanings too deep for words ;
NASB	Romans	8	27	and ( BD ) He who searches the hearts knows what ( BE ) the mind of the Spirit is , because He ( BF ) intercedes for the [ p ] saints according to the will of God .
NASB	Romans	8	28	And we know that [ q ] God [ r ] causes ( BG ) all things to work together for good to those who love God , to those who are ( BH ) called according to His purpose .
NASB	Romans	8	29	For those whom He ( BI ) foreknew , He also ( BJ ) predestined to become ( BK ) conformed to the image of His Son , so that He would be the ( BL ) firstborn among many brothers and sisters ;
NASB	Romans	8	30	and these whom He ( BM ) predestined , He also ( BN ) called ; and these whom He called , He also ( BO ) justified ; and these whom He justified , He also ( BP ) glorified .
NASB	Romans	8	31	( BQ ) What then shall we say to these things ? ( BR ) If God is for us , who is against us ?
NASB	Romans	8	32	He who ( BS ) did not spare His own Son , but ( BT ) delivered Him over for us all , how will He not also with Him freely give us all things ?
NASB	Romans	8	33	Who will bring charges against ( BU ) God ’ s elect ? ( BV ) God is the one who justifies ;
NASB	Romans	8	34	who is the one who ( BW ) condemns ? Christ Jesus is He who ( BX ) died , but rather , was [ s ] ( BY ) raised , who is ( BZ ) at the right hand of God , who also ( CA ) intercedes for us .
NASB	Romans	8	35	Who will separate us from ( CB ) the love of [ t ] Christ ? Will ( CC ) tribulation , or trouble , or ( CD ) persecution , or ( CE ) famine , or ( CF ) nakedness , or ( CG ) danger , or sword ?
NASB	Romans	8	36	Just as it is written : “ ( CH ) For Your sake we are killed all day long ; We were regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. ”
NASB	Romans	8	37	But in all these things we overwhelmingly ( CI ) conquer through ( CJ ) Him who loved us .
NASB	Romans	8	38	For I am convinced that neither ( CK ) death , nor life , nor ( CL ) angels , nor principalities , nor ( CM ) things present , nor things to come , nor powers ,
NASB	Romans	8	39	nor height , nor depth , nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from ( CN ) the love of God that is ( CO ) in Christ Jesus our Lord .

NASB	Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise : “ ( Y ) At this time I will come , and Sarah will have a son. ”
NASB	Romans	9	2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart .
NASB	Romans	9	3	For ( B ) I could [ a ] wish that I myself were ( C ) accursed , separated from Christ for the sake of my countrymen , my kinsmen ( D ) according to the flesh ,
NASB	Romans	9	4	who are ( E ) Israelites , to whom belongs ( F ) the adoption as sons and daughters , ( G ) the glory , ( H ) the covenants , ( I ) the giving of the Law , ( J ) the temple service , and ( K ) the promises ;
NASB	Romans	9	5	whose are ( L ) the fathers , and ( M ) from whom is the [ b ] Christ according to the flesh , ( N ) who is over all , ( O ) God ( P ) blessed [ c ] forever . Amen .
NASB	Romans	9	6	But it is not as though ( Q ) the word of God has failed . ( R ) For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel ;
NASB	Romans	9	7	nor are they all children ( S ) because they are Abraham ’ s [ d ] ( T ) descendants , but : “ [ e ] ( U ) through Isaac your [ f ] descendants shall be named. ”
NASB	Romans	9	8	That is , it is not the children of the flesh [ g ] who are ( V ) children of God , but the ( W ) children of the promise are regarded as [ h ] ( X ) descendants .
NASB	Romans	9	10	( Z ) And not only that , but there was also ( AA ) Rebekah , when she had conceived twins by one man , our father Isaac ;
NASB	Romans	9	11	for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad , so that ( AB ) God ’ s purpose according to His choice would [ i ] stand , not [ j ] because of works but [ k ] because of Him who calls ,
NASB	Romans	9	12	it was said to her , “ ( AC ) The older will serve the younger. ”
NASB	Romans	9	13	Just as it is written : “ ( AD ) Jacob I have loved , but Esau I have hated. ”
NASB	Romans	9	14	( AE ) What shall we say then ? ( AF ) There is no injustice with God , is there ? [ l ] ( AG ) Far from it !
NASB	Romans	9	15	For He says to Moses , “ ( AH ) I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy , and I will show compassion to whomever I show compassion. ”
NASB	Romans	9	16	So then , it does not depend on the person who [ m ] wants it nor the one who [ n ] ( AI ) runs , but on ( AJ ) God who has mercy .
NASB	Romans	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , “ ( AK ) For this very reason I raised you up , in order to demonstrate My power in you , and that My name might be proclaimed [ o ] throughout the earth. ”
NASB	Romans	9	18	So then He has mercy on whom He desires , and He ( AL ) hardens whom He desires .
NASB	Romans	9	19	( AM ) You will say to me then , “ ( AN ) Why does He still find fault ? For ( AO ) who has resisted His will ? ”
NASB	Romans	9	20	On the contrary , who are you , [ p ] ( AP ) you foolish person , who ( AQ ) answers back to God ? ( AR ) The thing molded will not say to the molder , “ Why did you make me like this , ” will it ?
NASB	Romans	9	21	Or does the potter not have a right over the clay , to make from the same lump one object [ q ] for honorable use , and another [ r ] for common use ?
NASB	Romans	9	22	[ s ] What if God , although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known , endured with great ( AS ) patience objects of wrath ( AT ) prepared for destruction ?
NASB	Romans	9	23	And He did so to make known ( AU ) the riches of His glory upon ( AV ) objects of mercy , which He ( AW ) prepared beforehand for glory ,
NASB	Romans	9	24	namely us , whom He also ( AX ) called , ( AY ) not only from among Jews , but also from among Gentiles ,
NASB	Romans	9	25	as He also says in Hosea : “ ( AZ ) I will call those who were not My people , ‘ My people , ’ And her who was not beloved , ‘ beloved. ’ ”
NASB	Romans	9	26	“ ( BA ) And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them , ‘ you are not My people , ’ There they shall be called sons of ( BB ) the living God. ”
NASB	Romans	9	27	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel , “ ( BC ) Though the number of the sons of Israel may be ( BD ) like the sand of the sea , only ( BE ) the remnant will be saved ;
NASB	Romans	9	28	( BF ) for the Lord will execute His word on the earth , [ t ] thoroughly and [ u ] quickly. ”
NASB	Romans	9	29	And just as Isaiah foretold : “ ( BG ) If ( BH ) the Lord [ v ] of armies had not left us [ w ] ( BI ) descendants , ( BJ ) We would have become like Sodom , and would have [ x ] been like Gomorrah. ”
NASB	Romans	9	30	( BK ) What shall we say then ? That Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness , attained righteousness , but ( BL ) the righteousness that is [ y ] by faith ;
NASB	Romans	9	31	however , Israel , ( BM ) pursuing a law of righteousness , did not ( BN ) arrive at that law .
NASB	Romans	9	32	Why ? Because they did not pursue it [ z ] by faith , but as though they could [ aa ] by works . They stumbled over ( BO ) the stumbling stone ,
NASB	Romans	9	33	just as it is written : “ ( BP ) Behold , I am laying in Zion ( BQ ) a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense , ( BR ) And the one who believes in Him ( BS ) will not be [ ab ] put to shame. ” Footnotes - Romans 9:3 Lit pray - Romans 9:5 I.e. , Messiah - Romans 9:5 Lit unto the ages - Romans 9:7 Lit seed - Romans 9:7 Lit in - Romans 9:7 Lit seed - Romans 9:8 Lit these - Romans 9:8 Lit seed - Romans 9:11 Lit remain - Romans 9:11 Lit from - Romans 9:11 Lit from - Romans 9:14 Lit May it never happen ! - Romans 9:16 Or wills nor - Romans 9:16 I.e. , to win mercy or favor - Romans 9:17 Lit in all - Romans 9:20 Lit O - Romans 9:21 Lit for honor - Romans 9:21 Lit for dishonor - Romans 9:22 Lit But - Romans 9:28 Lit finishing it - Romans 9:28 Lit cutting it short - Romans 9:29 Gr sabaoth , for Heb tsebaoth ( armies ) - Romans 9:29 Lit seed - Romans 9:29 Lit been made like - Romans 9:30 Lit out of - Romans 9:32 Lit out of - Romans 9:32 Lit out of - Romans 9:33 Or disappointed New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Romans	10	10	for with the heart a person believes , [ g ] resulting in righteousness , and with the mouth he confesses , [ h ] resulting in salvation .
NASB	Romans	10	2	For I testify about them that they have ( A ) a zeal for God , but not in accordance with knowledge .
NASB	Romans	10	3	For not knowing about ( B ) God ’ s righteousness and ( C ) seeking to establish their own , they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
NASB	Romans	10	4	For ( D ) Christ is the [ a ] end of the Law for righteousness to ( E ) everyone who believes .
NASB	Romans	10	5	For Moses writes of the righteousness that is [ b ] based on the Law , that the person who performs [ c ] them ( F ) will live by [ d ] them .
NASB	Romans	10	6	But ( G ) the righteousness [ e ] based on faith speaks as follows : “ ( H ) Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will go up into heaven ? ’ ( that is , to bring Christ down ) ,
NASB	Romans	10	7	or ‘ Who will descend into the ( I ) abyss ? ’ ( that is , to ( J ) bring Christ up from the dead ) . ”
NASB	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? “ ( K ) The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” —that is , the word of faith which we are preaching ,
NASB	Romans	10	9	[ f ] that ( L ) if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord , and ( M ) believe in your heart that ( N ) God raised Him from the dead , you will be saved ;
NASB	Romans	10	11	For the Scripture says , “ ( O ) Whoever believes in Him will not be [ i ] put to shame. ”
NASB	Romans	10	12	For ( P ) there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is ( Q ) Lord of ( R ) all , abounding in riches for all who call on Him ;
NASB	Romans	10	13	for “ ( S ) Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. ”
NASB	Romans	10	14	How then are they to call on Him in whom they have not believed ? How are they to believe in Him ( T ) whom they have not heard ? And how are they to hear without ( U ) a preacher ?
NASB	Romans	10	15	But how are they to preach unless they are sent ? Just as it is written : “ ( V ) How beautiful are the feet of those who [ j ] ( W ) bring good news of good things ! ”
NASB	Romans	10	16	However , they ( X ) did not all heed the [ k ] good news ; for Isaiah says , “ ( Y ) Lord , who has believed our report ? ”
NASB	Romans	10	17	So faith comes from ( Z ) hearing , and hearing by ( AA ) the word [ l ] of Christ .
NASB	Romans	10	18	But I say , surely they have never heard , have they ? On the contrary :
NASB	Romans	10	19	But I say , surely Israel did not know , did they ? First Moses says , “ ( AC ) I will ( AD ) make you jealous with those who are not a nation , With a foolish nation I will anger you. ”
NASB	Romans	10	20	And Isaiah is very bold and says , “ ( AE ) I was found by those who did not seek Me , I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me. ”
NASB	Romans	10	21	But as for Israel , He says , “ ( AF ) I have spread out My hands all day long to a disobedient and obstinate people. ” Footnotes - Romans 10:4 Or goal - Romans 10:5 Lit out of , from - Romans 10:5 I.e. , the statutes of the Law - Romans 10:5 I.e. , the statutes of the Law - Romans 10:6 Lit out of , from - Romans 10:9 Or because - Romans 10:10 Lit to righteousness - Romans 10:10 Lit to salvation - Romans 10:11 Or disappointed - Romans 10:15 Or preach the gospel - Romans 10:16 Or gospel - Romans 10:17 Or concerning Christ - Romans 10:18 Or inhabited earth New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Romans	11	11	( P ) I say then , they did not stumble so as to fall , did they ? [ g ] ( Q ) Far from it ! But by their wrongdoing ( R ) salvation has come to the Gentiles , to ( S ) make them jealous .
NASB	Romans	11	2	God ( D ) has not rejected His people whom He ( E ) foreknew . ( F ) Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah , how he pleads with God against Israel ?
NASB	Romans	11	3	“ Lord , ( G ) they have killed Your prophets , they have torn down Your altars , and I alone am left , and they are seeking my life. ”
NASB	Romans	11	4	But what [ c ] is the divine response to him ? “ ( H ) I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. ”
NASB	Romans	11	5	In the same way then , there has also come to be at the present time ( I ) a remnant according to God ’ s [ d ] gracious choice .
NASB	Romans	11	6	But ( J ) if it is by grace , it is no longer [ e ] on the basis of works , since otherwise grace is no longer grace .
NASB	Romans	11	7	What then ? What ( K ) Israel is seeking , it has not obtained , but [ f ] those who were chosen obtained it , and the rest were ( L ) hardened ;
NASB	Romans	11	8	just as it is written : “ ( M ) God gave them a spirit of stupor , Eyes to see not and ears to hear not , Down to this very day. ”
NASB	Romans	11	9	And David says , “ ( N ) May their table become a snare and a trap , And a stumbling block and a retribution to them .
NASB	Romans	11	10	( O ) May their eyes be darkened to see not , And bend their backs continually. ”
NASB	Romans	11	12	Now if their wrongdoing proves to be riches for the world , and their failure , riches for the Gentiles , how much more will their [ h ] ( T ) fulfillment be !
NASB	Romans	11	13	But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles . Therefore insofar as ( U ) I am an apostle of Gentiles , I magnify my ministry
NASB	Romans	11	14	if somehow I may ( V ) move ( W ) my [ i ] own people to jealousy and ( X ) save some of them .
NASB	Romans	11	15	For if their rejection proves to be the ( Y ) reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance be but ( Z ) life from the dead ?
NASB	Romans	11	16	If the ( AA ) first piece of dough is holy , the lump is also ; and if the root is holy , the branches are as well .
NASB	Romans	11	17	But if some of the ( AB ) branches were broken off , and ( AC ) you , being a wild olive , were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the [ j ] rich root of the olive tree ,
NASB	Romans	11	18	do not be arrogant toward the branches ; but if you are arrogant , remember that ( AD ) it is not you who supports the root , but the root supports you .
NASB	Romans	11	19	( AE ) You will say then , “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. ”
NASB	Romans	11	20	Quite right , they were broken off for their unbelief , but you ( AF ) stand by your faith . ( AG ) Do not be conceited , but fear ;
NASB	Romans	11	21	for if God did not spare the natural branches , He will not spare you , either .
NASB	Romans	11	22	See then the kindness and severity of God : to those who fell , severity , but to you , God ’ s ( AH ) kindness , ( AI ) if you continue in His kindness ; for otherwise you too ( AJ ) will be cut off .
NASB	Romans	11	23	And they also , ( AK ) if they do not continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in ; for God is able to graft them in again .
NASB	Romans	11	24	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree ?
NASB	Romans	11	25	For ( AL ) I do not want you , brothers and sisters , to be uninformed of this ( AM ) mystery—so that you will not be ( AN ) wise in your own estimation—that a partial ( AO ) hardening has happened to Israel until the ( AP ) fullness of the Gentiles has come in ;
NASB	Romans	11	26	and so all Israel will be saved ; just as it is written : “ ( AQ ) The Deliverer will come from Zion , He will remove ungodliness from Jacob. ”
NASB	Romans	11	27	“ ( AR ) This is [ k ] My covenant with them , ( AS ) When I take away their sins. ”
NASB	Romans	11	28	In relation to the gospel they are ( AT ) enemies on your account , but in relation to God ’ s choice they are beloved ( AU ) on account of the fathers ;
NASB	Romans	11	29	for the gifts and the ( AV ) calling of God ( AW ) are irrevocable .
NASB	Romans	11	30	For just as you once were disobedient to God , but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience ,
NASB	Romans	11	31	so these also now have been disobedient , that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy .
NASB	Romans	11	32	For ( AX ) God has shut up all in disobedience , so that He may show mercy to all .
NASB	Romans	11	33	Oh , the depth of ( AY ) the riches , [ l ] both of the ( AZ ) wisdom and knowledge of God ! ( BA ) How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways !
NASB	Romans	11	34	For ( BB ) who has known the mind of the Lord , or who became His counselor ?
NASB	Romans	11	35	Or ( BC ) who has first given to Him , [ m ] that it would be paid back to him ?
NASB	Romans	11	36	For ( BD ) from Him , and through Him , and to Him are all things . ( BE ) To Him be the glory [ n ] forever . Amen .

NASB	Romans	12	2	And do not ( C ) be conformed to ( D ) this [ c ] world , but be transformed by the ( E ) renewing of your mind , so that you may [ d ] ( F ) prove what the will of God is , that which is good and [ e ] acceptable and perfect .
NASB	Romans	12	3	For through ( G ) the grace given to me I say to everyone among you ( H ) not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think ; but to think so as to have sound judgment , as God has allotted to ( I ) each a measure of faith .
NASB	Romans	12	4	For ( J ) just as we have many parts in one body and all [ f ] the body ’ s parts do not have the same function ,
NASB	Romans	12	5	so we , ( K ) who are many , are ( L ) one body in Christ , and individually parts of one another .
NASB	Romans	12	6	However , since we have gifts that ( M ) differ according to the grace given to us , each of us is to use them properly : if ( N ) prophecy , [ g ] in proportion to one ’ s faith ;
NASB	Romans	12	7	if [ h ] ( O ) service , in the act of serving ; or the one who ( P ) teaches , in the act of teaching ;
NASB	Romans	12	8	or the one who [ i ] ( Q ) exhorts , in the work of [ j ] exhortation ; the one who gives , with [ k ] ( R ) generosity ; ( S ) the one who [ l ] is in leadership , with diligence ; the one who shows mercy , with ( T ) cheerfulness .
NASB	Romans	12	9	[ m ] ( U ) Love must be free of hypocrisy . ( V ) Detest what is evil ; cling to what is good .
NASB	Romans	12	10	Be ( W ) devoted to one another in brotherly love ; [ n ] give preference to one another ( X ) in honor ,
NASB	Romans	12	11	not lagging behind in diligence , ( Y ) fervent in spirit , ( Z ) serving the Lord ;

NASB	Romans	12	18	If possible , ( AM ) so far as it depends on you , ( AN ) be at peace with all people .
NASB	Romans	12	19	( AO ) Never take your own revenge , beloved , but [ u ] leave room for the wrath of God , for it is written : “ ( AP ) Vengeance is Mine , I will repay , ” says the Lord .

NASB	Romans	13	13	Let ’ s [ j ] ( T ) behave properly as in the day , ( U ) not in carousing and drunkenness , not in sexual promiscuity and debauchery , not in strife and jealousy .
NASB	Romans	13	2	Therefore [ c ] whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God ; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves .
NASB	Romans	13	3	For ( D ) rulers are not a cause of fear for [ d ] good behavior , but for evil . Do you want to have no fear of authority ? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same ;
NASB	Romans	13	4	for it is a servant of God to you for good . But if you do what is evil , be afraid ; for it does not bear the sword for nothing ; for it is a servant of God , an ( E ) avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil .
NASB	Romans	13	5	Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection , not only because of wrath , but also ( F ) for the sake of conscience .
NASB	Romans	13	6	For because of this you also pay taxes , for rulers are servants of God , devoting themselves to this very thing .
NASB	Romans	13	7	( G ) Pay to all what is due them : ( H ) tax to whom tax is due ; ( I ) custom to whom custom ; [ e ] respect to whom [ f ] respect ; honor to whom honor .
NASB	Romans	13	8	Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another ; for ( J ) the one who loves [ g ] his neighbor has fulfilled the Law .
NASB	Romans	13	9	For this , “ ( K ) You shall not commit adultery , You shall not murder , You shall not steal , You shall not covet , ” and if there is any other commandment , it is summed up in this saying , “ ( L ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”

NASB	Romans	14	14	I know and am convinced [ j ] in the Lord Jesus that ( W ) nothing is [ k ] unclean in itself ; but to the one who ( X ) thinks something is [ l ] unclean , to that person it is [ m ] unclean .
NASB	Romans	14	2	( C ) One person has faith that he may eat all things , but the one who is ( D ) weak eats only vegetables .
NASB	Romans	14	3	The one who eats is not to ( E ) regard with contempt the one who does not eat , and the one who does not eat is not to ( F ) judge the one who eats , for God has ( G ) accepted him .
NASB	Romans	14	4	( H ) Who are you to judge the [ c ] servant of another ? To his own [ d ] master he stands or falls ; and he will stand , for the Lord is able to make him stand .
NASB	Romans	14	5	( I ) One person [ e ] values one day over another , another [ f ] values every day the same . Each person must be ( J ) fully convinced in his own mind .
NASB	Romans	14	6	The one who observes the day , observes it for the Lord , and the one who eats , [ g ] does so with regard to the Lord , for he ( K ) gives thanks to God ; and the one who does not eat , it is for the Lord that he does not eat , and he gives thanks to God .
NASB	Romans	14	7	For not one of us ( L ) lives for himself , and not one dies for himself ;
NASB	Romans	14	8	for if we live , we live for the Lord , or if we die , we die for the Lord ; therefore ( M ) whether we live or die , we are the Lord ’ s .
NASB	Romans	14	9	For to this end ( N ) Christ died and lived again , that He might be ( O ) Lord both of the dead and of the living .
NASB	Romans	14	10	But as for you , why do you judge your brother or sister ? Or you as well , why do you ( P ) regard your brother or sister with contempt ? For ( Q ) we will all appear before the judgment seat of God .
NASB	Romans	14	11	For it is written : “ ( R ) As I live , says the Lord , ( S ) to Me every knee will bow , And every tongue will [ h ] give praise to God. ”
NASB	Romans	14	12	So then ( T ) each one of us will give an account of himself to God .
NASB	Romans	14	13	Therefore let ’ s not ( U ) judge one another anymore , but rather [ i ] determine this : ( V ) not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother ’ s or sister ’ s way .
NASB	Romans	14	15	For if because of food your brother or sister is hurt , you are no longer ( Y ) walking in accordance with love . ( Z ) Do not destroy with your choice of food that person for whom Christ died .
NASB	Romans	14	16	Therefore ( AA ) do not let what is for you a good thing be [ n ] spoken of as evil ;
NASB	Romans	14	17	for the kingdom of God ( AB ) is not eating and drinking , but righteousness and ( AC ) peace and ( AD ) joy in the Holy Spirit .
NASB	Romans	14	18	For the one who ( AE ) serves Christ in this way is ( AF ) acceptable to God and approved by other people .
NASB	Romans	14	19	So then we ( AG ) pursue the things [ o ] which make for peace and the ( AH ) building up of one another .
NASB	Romans	14	20	( AI ) Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food . ( AJ ) All things indeed are clean , but ( AK ) they are evil for the person who eats [ p ] and causes offense .
NASB	Romans	14	21	( AL ) It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine , or to do anything by which your brother or sister stumbles .
NASB	Romans	14	22	The faith which you have , have [ q ] as your own conviction before God . Happy is the one who ( AM ) does not condemn himself in what he approves .
NASB	Romans	14	23	But ( AN ) the one who doubts is condemned if he eats , because his eating is not from faith ; and whatever is not from faith is sin .

NASB	Romans	15	15	But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again , because of ( Y ) the grace that was given to me [ g ] from God ,
NASB	Romans	15	2	Each of us is to ( B ) please his neighbor [ a ] for his good , to his ( C ) edification .
NASB	Romans	15	3	For even ( D ) Christ did not please Himself , but as it is written : “ ( E ) The taunts of those who taunt You have fallen on Me. ”
NASB	Romans	15	4	For ( F ) whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction , so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope .
NASB	Romans	15	5	Now may the ( G ) God [ b ] who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you ( H ) to be of the same mind with one another , according to Christ Jesus ,
NASB	Romans	15	6	so that with one purpose and one [ c ] voice you may glorify ( I ) the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB	Romans	15	7	Therefore , [ d ] ( J ) accept one another , just as Christ also accepted [ e ] us , for the glory of God .
NASB	Romans	15	8	For I say that Christ has become a servant to ( K ) the circumcision in behalf of the truth of God , to confirm ( L ) the promises given to the fathers ,
NASB	Romans	15	9	and for ( M ) the Gentiles to ( N ) glorify God for His mercy ; as it is written : “ ( O ) Therefore I will [ f ] give praise to You among the Gentiles , And I will sing praises to Your name. ”
NASB	Romans	15	10	Again he says , “ ( P ) Rejoice , you Gentiles , with His people. ”
NASB	Romans	15	11	And again , “ ( Q ) Praise the Lord all you Gentiles , And let all the peoples praise Him. ”
NASB	Romans	15	12	Again Isaiah says , “ ( R ) There shall come ( S ) the root of Jesse , And He who arises to rule over the Gentiles , ( T ) In Him will the Gentiles hope. ”
NASB	Romans	15	13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all ( U ) joy and peace in believing , so that you will abound in hope ( V ) by the power of the Holy Spirit .
NASB	Romans	15	14	And concerning you , my brothers and sisters , I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of ( W ) goodness , filled with ( X ) all knowledge and able also to admonish one another .
NASB	Romans	15	16	to be ( Z ) a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles , ministering as a priest the ( AA ) gospel of God , so that my ( AB ) offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
NASB	Romans	15	17	Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found ( AC ) reason for boasting in ( AD ) things pertaining to God .
NASB	Romans	15	18	( AE ) For I will not presume to speak of anything [ h ] except what ( AF ) Christ has accomplished through me , [ i ] resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed ,
NASB	Romans	15	19	in the power of [ j ] ( AG ) signs and wonders , ( AH ) in the power of the Spirit ; so that ( AI ) from Jerusalem and all around as ( AJ ) far as Illyricum I have [ k ] fully preached the gospel of Christ .
NASB	Romans	15	20	And in this way I aspired to ( AK ) preach the gospel , not where Christ was already known by name , ( AL ) so that I would not build on another person ’ s foundation ;
NASB	Romans	15	21	but just as it is written : “ ( AM ) They who have not been told about Him will see , And they who have not heard will understand. ”
NASB	Romans	15	22	For this reason ( AN ) I have often been prevented from coming to you ;
NASB	Romans	15	23	but now , with no further place for me in these regions , and since I ( AO ) have had for many years a longing to come to you
NASB	Romans	15	24	whenever I ( AP ) go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing , and to be ( AQ ) helped on my way there by you , when I have first ( AR ) enjoyed your company [ l ] for a while—

NASB	Romans	15	26	For ( AU ) Macedonia and ( AV ) Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the [ n ] saints in Jerusalem .
NASB	Romans	15	27	For they were pleased to do so , and they are indebted to them . For ( AW ) if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things , they are indebted to do them a service also in material things .
NASB	Romans	15	28	Therefore , when I have finished this , and ( AX ) have [ o ] put my seal on this fruit of theirs , I will ( AY ) go on by way of you to Spain .
NASB	Romans	15	29	I know that when ( AZ ) I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ .
NASB	Romans	15	30	Now I urge you , brothers and sisters , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by ( BA ) the love of the Spirit , to ( BB ) strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
NASB	Romans	15	31	that I may be ( BC ) rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea , and that my ( BD ) service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the [ p ] ( BE ) saints ;
NASB	Romans	15	32	so that ( BF ) I may come to you in joy by ( BG ) the will of God and relax in your company .

NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To ( E ) the church of God which is in ( F ) Corinth , to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus , [ b ] saints ( G ) by calling , with all who in every place ( H ) call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , their Lord and ours :
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	3	( I ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	4	( J ) I thank [ c ] my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	5	that in everything you were ( K ) enriched in Him , in all ( L ) speech and ( M ) all knowledge ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	6	just as ( N ) the testimony concerning Christ was confirmed [ d ] in you ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that you are not lacking in any gift , as you eagerly ( O ) await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	8	( P ) who will also [ e ] confirm you to the end , blameless on ( Q ) the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	9	( R ) God is faithful , through whom you were ( S ) called into ( T ) fellowship with His Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now ( U ) I urge you , ( V ) brothers and sisters , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you all [ f ] agree and that there be no [ g ] ( W ) divisions among you , but that you be [ h ] made complete in ( X ) the same mind and in the same judgment .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For I have been informed concerning you , my brothers and sisters , by Chloe ’ s people , that there are quarrels among you .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now I mean this , that ( Y ) each one of you is saying , “ I am [ i ] with Paul , ” [ j ] or “ I am [ k ] with ( Z ) Apollos , ” [ l ] or “ I am [ m ] with [ n ] ( AA ) Cephas , ” [ o ] or “ I am [ p ] with Christ. ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	13	[ q ] Has Christ been divided ? Paul was not crucified for you , was he ? Or were you ( AB ) baptized [ r ] in the name of Paul ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I am thankful that I ( AC ) baptized none of you except ( AD ) Crispus and ( AE ) Gaius ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	15	so that no one would say you were baptized [ s ] in my name !
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	16	But I did baptize the ( AF ) household of Stephanas also ; beyond that , I do not know if I baptized anyone else .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	17	( AG ) For Christ did not send me to baptize , but to preach the gospel , ( AH ) not with [ t ] cleverness of speech , so that the cross of Christ would not be made of no effect . The Wisdom of God
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross is ( AI ) foolishness to ( AJ ) those who [ u ] are perishing , but to us who [ v ] are being saved it is ( AK ) the power of God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written : “ ( AL ) I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , And the understanding of those who have understanding , I will confound. ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	20	( AM ) Where is the wise person ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the debater of ( AN ) this age ? Has God not ( AO ) made foolish the wisdom of ( AP ) the world ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For since in the wisdom of God ( AQ ) the world through its wisdom did not come to know God , ( AR ) God [ w ] was pleased through the ( AS ) foolishness of the [ x ] message preached to ( AT ) save those who believe .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For indeed ( AU ) Jews ask for [ y ] signs and Greeks search for wisdom ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we preach [ z ] ( AV ) Christ crucified , ( AW ) to Jews a stumbling block , and to Gentiles ( AX ) foolishness ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but to those who are ( AY ) the called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ ( AZ ) the power of God and ( BA ) the wisdom of God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	25	For the ( BB ) foolishness of God is wiser than mankind , and ( BC ) the weakness of God is stronger than mankind .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For [ aa ] consider your ( BD ) calling , brothers and sisters , that there were ( BE ) not many wise according to [ ab ] the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	27	but ( BF ) God has chosen the foolish things of ( BG ) the world to shame the wise , and God has chosen the weak things of ( BH ) the world to shame the things which are strong ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	28	and the [ ac ] insignificant things of ( BI ) the world and the despised God has chosen , ( BJ ) the things that are not , so that He may ( BK ) nullify the things that are ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	29	so that ( BL ) no [ ad ] human may boast before God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But it is [ ae ] due to Him that you are in ( BM ) Christ Jesus , who became to us ( BN ) wisdom from God , [ af ] and ( BO ) righteousness and ( BP ) sanctification , and ( BQ ) redemption ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	1	31	so that , just as it is written : “ ( BR ) Let the one who boasts , boast in the Lord. ” Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I determined to know nothing among you except ( C ) Jesus Christ , and Him crucified .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	3	I also was with you in ( D ) weakness and ( E ) fear , and in great trembling ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	4	and my [ d ] message and my preaching were ( F ) not in persuasive words of [ e ] wisdom , but in demonstration of ( G ) the Spirit and of power ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	5	so that your faith would not [ f ] rest on the [ g ] wisdom of mankind , but on ( H ) the power of God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are ( I ) mature ; a wisdom , however , not of ( J ) this age nor of the rulers of ( K ) this age , who are ( L ) passing away ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	7	but we speak God ’ s wisdom in a ( M ) mystery , the hidden wisdom which God ( N ) predestined before the ( O ) ages to our glory ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	8	the wisdom ( P ) which none of the rulers of ( Q ) this age has understood ; for if they had understood it , they would not have crucified ( R ) the Lord of glory ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	9	but just as it is written : “ ( S ) Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard , And which have not entered the human heart , All that God has prepared for those who love Him. ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	10	[ h ] ( T ) For to us God revealed them ( U ) through the Spirit ; for the Spirit searches all things , even the ( V ) depths of God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For who among people knows the thoughts of a person except the ( W ) spirit of the person that is in him ? So also the thoughts of God no one knows , except the Spirit of God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we ( X ) have not received the spirit of ( Y ) the world , but the Spirit who is from God , so that we may know the things freely given to us by God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	13	We also speak these things , ( Z ) not in words taught by human wisdom , but in those taught by the Spirit , [ i ] combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But [ j ] a ( AA ) natural person ( AB ) does not accept the things of the Spirit of God , for they are ( AC ) foolishness to him ; and he can not understand them , because they are spiritually discerned .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But the one who is ( AD ) spiritual discerns all things , yet he himself is [ k ] discerned by no one .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	2	16	For ( AE ) who has known the mind of the Lord , that he will instruct Him ? But ( AF ) we have the mind of Christ . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians 3:22 Peter ’ s Aramaic name New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	3	for you are still fleshly . For since there is ( F ) jealousy and strife among you , are you not fleshly , and are you not walking ( G ) like ordinary people ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I gave you ( D ) milk to drink , not solid food ; for you ( E ) were not yet able to consume it . But even now you are not yet able ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For when ( H ) one person says , “ I am [ a ] with Paul , ” and another , “ I am [ b ] with Apollos , ” are you not ordinary ( I ) people ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	5	What then is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? ( J ) Servants through whom you believed , even ( K ) as the Lord gave opportunity to each one .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	6	( L ) I planted , ( M ) Apollos watered , but ( N ) God was causing the growth .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything , but God who causes the growth .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	8	Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one ; but each will ( O ) receive his own [ c ] reward according to his own labor .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are God ’ s ( P ) fellow workers ; you are God ’ s [ d ] ( Q ) field , God ’ s ( R ) building .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to ( S ) the grace of God which was given to me , like a wise master builder ( T ) I laid a foundation , and ( U ) another is building on it . But each person must be careful how he builds on it .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no one can lay a ( V ) foundation other than the one which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , or straw ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	13	( W ) each one ’ s work will become evident ; for ( X ) the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire , and the fire itself will test [ e ] the quality of each one ’ s work .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If anyone ’ s work which he has built on it remains , he will ( Y ) receive a reward .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If anyone ’ s work is burned up , he will suffer loss ; but he himself will be saved , yet only ( Z ) so as through fire .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	16	( AA ) Do you not know that ( AB ) you are a [ f ] temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys the [ g ] temple of God , God will destroy [ h ] that person ; for the [ i ] temple of God is holy , [ j ] and that is what you are .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	18	( AC ) Take care that no one deceives himself . ( AD ) If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in ( AE ) this age , he must become foolish , so that he may become wise .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For ( AF ) the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the sight of God . For it is written : “ He is ( AG ) the one who catches the wise by their craftiness ” ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , “ ( AH ) The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are useless. ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So then , ( AI ) no one is to be boasting in people . For ( AJ ) all things belong to you ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	3	22	( AK ) whether Paul or Apollos or [ k ] Cephas , or the world or ( AL ) life or death , or things present or things to come ; all things belong to you ,

NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	4	For I ( D ) am not aware of anything against myself ; however I am not ( E ) vindicated by this , but the one who examines me is the Lord .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	2	In this case , moreover , it is required [ a ] of stewards that one be found trustworthy .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But to me it is an insignificant matter that I would be examined by you , or by any human [ b ] court ; in fact , I do not even examine myself .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	5	Therefore ( F ) do not go on [ c ] passing judgment before [ d ] the time , but wait ( G ) until the Lord comes , who will both ( H ) bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of human hearts ; and then ( I ) praise will come to each person from God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now these things , brothers and sisters , I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos on your account , so that in us you may learn not to exceed ( J ) what is written , so that no one of you will ( K ) become [ e ] arrogant ( L ) in behalf of one against the other .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who considers you as superior ? ( M ) What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	8	You are ( N ) already filled , you have already become rich , you have become kings without us ; and indeed , I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you !
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For I think , God has exhibited us , the apostles , last of all as men ( O ) condemned to death , because we ( P ) have become a spectacle to the world , both to angels and to mankind .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are ( Q ) fools on account of Christ , but ( R ) you are prudent in Christ ! ( S ) We are weak , but you are strong ! You are distinguished , but we are without honor !
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Up to this present hour we are both ( T ) hungry and thirsty , and are poorly clothed and roughly treated and homeless ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	12	and we labor , ( U ) working with our own hands ; when we are ( V ) verbally abused , we bless ; when we are ( W ) persecuted , we endure it ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	13	when we are slandered , we [ f ] reply as friends ; we have ( X ) become as the scum of the world , the dregs of all things , even until now .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I do not write these things to ( Y ) shame you , but to admonish you as my beloved ( Z ) children .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For if you were to have countless ( AA ) tutors in Christ , yet you would not have many fathers , for in ( AB ) Christ Jesus I ( AC ) became your father through the ( AD ) gospel .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I urge you , be ( AE ) imitators of me .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this reason I ( AF ) have sent to you ( AG ) Timothy , who is my ( AH ) beloved and faithful child in the Lord , and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ , ( AI ) just as I teach everywhere in every church .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Now some have become [ g ] ( AJ ) arrogant , as though I were not ( AK ) coming to you .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I ( AL ) will come to you soon , ( AM ) if the Lord wills , and I shall find out , not the [ h ] words of those who are ( AN ) arrogant , but their power .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is ( AO ) not in [ i ] words , but in power .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	4	21	What do you desire ? ( AP ) That I come to you with a rod , or with love and a spirit of gentleness ? Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	5	5	I have decided [ e ] to ( H ) turn such a person over to ( I ) Satan for the destruction of his [ f ] body , so that his spirit may be saved on ( J ) the day of the [ g ] Lord .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	5	2	[ a ] You ( B ) have become [ b ] arrogant and [ c ] have not ( C ) mourned instead , so that the one who had done this deed would be ( D ) removed from your midst .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	5	3	For I , on my part , though ( E ) absent in body but present in spirit , have already judged him who has so committed this , as though I were present .

NASB	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump , just as you are in fact unleavened . For Christ our ( N ) Passover also has been sacrificed .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let ’ s celebrate the feast , ( O ) not with old leaven , nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in my letter ( P ) not to associate with sexually immoral people ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	5	10	I did not at all mean with the sexually immoral people of this world , or with the greedy and swindlers , or with ( Q ) idolaters , for then you would have to leave the world .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But [ i ] actually , I [ j ] wrote to you not to associate [ k ] with any so-called ( R ) brother if he is a sexually immoral person , or a greedy person , or ( S ) an idolater , or is verbally abusive , or habitually drunk , or a swindler—not even to eat with such a person .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	5	12	For what business of mine is it to judge ( T ) outsiders ? ( U ) Do you not judge those who are within the church ?

NASB	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Actually , then , it is already a defeat for you , that you have lawsuits with one another . ( I ) Why not rather suffer the wrong ? Why not rather be defrauded ?

NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	7	[ d ] Yet I wish that all [ e ] men were ( E ) even as I myself am . However , ( F ) each has his own gift from God , one in this way , and another in that .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But because of sexual immoralities , each man is to have his own wife , and each woman is to have her own husband .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife , and likewise the wife also to her husband .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife does not have authority over her own body , but the husband does ; and likewise the husband also does not have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	5	[ b ] ( B ) Stop depriving one another , except by agreement for a time so that you may devote yourselves to prayer , and [ c ] come together again so that ( C ) Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But this I say by way of concession , ( D ) not of command .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is ( G ) good for them if they remain ( H ) even as I .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they do not have self-control , ( I ) let them marry ; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	10	But to the married I give instructions , ( J ) not I , but the Lord , that the wife is not to leave her husband
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	11	( but if she does leave , she must remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband is not to [ f ] divorce his wife .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest ( K ) I say , not the Lord , that if any brother has an unbelieving wife , and she consents to live with him , he must not [ g ] divorce her .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And [ h ] if any woman has an unbelieving husband , and he consents to live with her , she must not [ i ] divorce her husband .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through [ j ] her believing husband ; for otherwise your children are unclean , but now they are ( L ) holy .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	15	Yet if the unbelieving one is leaving , [ k ] let him leave ; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called [ l ] us ( M ) in peace .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know , wife , whether you will ( N ) save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Only , ( O ) as the Lord has assigned to each one , as God has called each , in this way let him walk . And ( P ) so I direct in ( Q ) all the churches .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was any man called when he was already circumcised ? He is not to become uncircumcised . Has anyone been called in uncircumcision ? ( R ) He is not to be circumcised .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	19	( S ) Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but what matters is ( T ) the keeping of the commandments of God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	20	( U ) Each person is to remain in that [ m ] state in which he was called .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you called as a slave ? Do not let it concern you . But if you are also able to become free , take advantage of that .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave , is ( V ) the Lord ’ s freed person ; likewise the one who was called as free , is ( W ) Christ ’ s slave .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	23	( X ) You were bought for a price ; do not become slaves of people .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brothers and sisters , ( Y ) each one is to remain with God in that condition in which he was called .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins , I have ( Z ) no command of the Lord , but I am offering direction as one who [ n ] ( AA ) by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I think , then , that this is good in view of the [ o ] present ( AB ) distress , that ( AC ) it is good for a man [ p ] to remain as he is .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be released . Are you released from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you marry , you have not sinned ; and if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . Yet such people as yourselves will have [ q ] trouble in this life , and I am trying to spare you .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	29	But this I say , brothers , ( AD ) the time has been shortened , so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and those who weep , as though they did not weep ; and those who rejoice , as though they did not rejoice ; and those who buy , as though they did not possess ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and those who use the world , as though they did not ( AE ) make full use of it ; for ( AF ) the present form of this world is passing away .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I want you to be free from concern . One who is ( AG ) unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	33	but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world , how he may please his wife ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	34	and his interests are divided . The woman who is unmarried , and the virgin , is concerned about the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and spirit ; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I say this for your own benefit , not to put a restraint on you , but [ r ] to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if anyone thinks that he is acting dishonorably toward his virgin , if she is [ s ] past her youth and it ought to be so , let him do what he wishes , he is not sinning ; let [ t ] them marry .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But the one who stands firm in his heart , [ u ] if he is not under constraint , but has authority [ v ] over his own will , and has decided this in his own heart , to keep his own virgin , he will do well .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then , both the one who gives his own virgin in marriage does well , and the one who does not give her in marriage will do better .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	39	( AH ) A wife is bound as long as her husband lives ; but if her husband [ w ] dies , she is free to be married to whom she wishes , only ( AI ) in the Lord .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But ( AJ ) in my opinion she is [ x ] happier if she remains as she is ; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	8	Now ( S ) food will not bring us [ c ] close to God ; we are neither [ d ] the worse if we do not eat , nor [ e ] the better if we do eat .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	2	( E ) If anyone thinks that he knows anything , he has not yet ( F ) known as he ought to know ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	3	but if anyone loves God , he ( G ) is known by Him .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	4	Therefore , concerning the eating of ( H ) food sacrificed to idols , we know that an ( I ) idol is [ b ] nothing at all in the world , and that ( J ) there is no God but one .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For even if ( K ) there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth , as indeed there are many gods and many lords ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	6	yet for us ( L ) there is only one God , ( M ) the Father , ( N ) from whom are all things , and we exist for Him ; and ( O ) one Lord , Jesus Christ , ( P ) by whom are all things , and we exist through Him .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	7	However , not all people ( Q ) have this knowledge ; but ( R ) some , being accustomed to the idol until now , eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol ; and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But ( T ) take care that this [ f ] freedom of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the ( U ) weak .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if someone sees you , the one who has ( V ) knowledge , dining in an idol ’ s temple , will his conscience , if he is weak , not be strengthened to eat ( W ) things sacrificed to idols ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	11	For through ( X ) your knowledge the one who is weak ( Y ) is ruined , the brother or sister for whose sake Christ died .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	12	( Z ) And so , by sinning against the brothers and sisters and wounding their conscience when it is weak , you sin ( AA ) against Christ .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Therefore , ( AB ) if food causes my brother to sin , I will never eat meat again , so that I will not cause my brother to sin . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the Law of Moses : “ ( O ) You shall not muzzle the ox while it is threshing. ” God is not concerned about ( P ) oxen , is He ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If I am not an apostle to others , at least I am to you ; for you are the ( E ) seal of my ( F ) apostleship in the Lord .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	3	My defense to those who examine me is this :
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	4	[ a ] ( G ) Do we not have a right to eat and drink ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	5	[ b ] ( H ) Do we not have a right to take along a [ c ] believing wife , even as the rest of the apostles and the ( I ) brothers of the Lord , and [ d ] ( J ) Cephas ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or do only [ e ] ( K ) Barnabas and I have no right to refrain from [ f ] working ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who at any time serves ( L ) as a soldier at his own expense ? Who ( M ) plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit ? Or who tends a flock and does not [ g ] consume some of the milk of the flock ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	8	I am not just asserting these things ( N ) according to human judgment , am I ? Or does the Law not say these things as well ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Or is He speaking entirely for our sake ? Yes , it was written ( Q ) for our sake , because ( R ) the plowman ought to plow in hope , and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing in the crops .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	11	( S ) If we sowed spiritual things in you , is it too much if we reap material things from you ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others share the right over you , do we not more ? Nevertheless , we ( T ) did not use this right , but we endure all things ( U ) so that we will cause no hindrance to the ( V ) gospel of Christ .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	13	( W ) Do you not know that those who ( X ) perform sacred services eat the food of the temple , and those who attend regularly to the altar have their share [ h ] from the altar ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	14	So also ( Y ) the Lord directed those who proclaim the ( Z ) gospel to ( AA ) get their living from the gospel .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have ( AB ) used none of these things . And I have not written these things so that it will be done so in my case ; for it would be better for me to die than that . No one shall make ( AC ) my boast an empty one !
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the gospel , I have nothing to boast about , for ( AD ) I am under compulsion ; for woe to me if I do not preach ( AE ) the gospel .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this voluntarily , I have a ( AF ) reward ; but if against my will , I have been entrusted with a ( AG ) commission nonetheless .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What , then , is my ( AH ) reward ? That , when I preach the gospel , I may offer the gospel ( AI ) without charge , so as ( AJ ) not to make full use of my right in the gospel .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For though I am ( AK ) free from all people , I have made myself ( AL ) a slave to all , so that I may ( AM ) gain more .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	20	( AN ) To the Jews I became as a Jew , so that I might gain Jews ; to those who are under the Law , I became as one under the Law , though ( AO ) not being under the Law myself , so that I might gain those who are under the Law ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	21	to those who are ( AP ) without the Law , I became ( AQ ) as one without the Law , though not being without the law of God but ( AR ) under the law of Christ , so that I might gain those who are without the Law .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the ( AS ) weak I became weak , that I might gain the weak ; I have become ( AT ) all things to all people , ( AU ) so that I may by all means save some .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do all things for the sake of the gospel , so that I may become a fellow partaker of it .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	24	( AV ) Do you not know that those who run in a race all run , but only one receives ( AW ) the prize ? ( AX ) Run in such a way that you may win .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	25	Everyone who ( AY ) competes in the games exercises self-control in all things . So they do it to obtain a perishable ( AZ ) wreath , but we an imperishable .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	26	Therefore I ( BA ) run in such a way as not to run aimlessly ; I box in such a way , as [ i ] to avoid ( BB ) hitting air ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	9	27	but I strictly discipline ( BC ) my body and make it my slave , so that , after I have preached to others , I myself will not be disqualified . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	10	Nor ( P ) grumble , as some of them [ d ] did , and ( Q ) were killed by the ( R ) destroyer .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	2	and they all were ( D ) baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	3	and they all ( E ) ate the same spiritual food ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and all ( F ) drank the same spiritual drink , for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them ; and the rock was [ a ] Christ .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	5	Nevertheless , with most of them God was not pleased ; for their dead bodies were ( G ) spread out in the wilderness .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things happened as ( H ) examples for us , so that we would not crave evil things as ( I ) they indeed craved them .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Do not be ( J ) idolaters , as some of them were ; as it is written : “ ( K ) The people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to ( L ) play. ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	8	Nor are we to commit sexual immorality , as ( M ) some of them [ b ] did , and ( N ) twenty-three thousand fell in one day .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	9	Nor are we to put the Lord to the test , as ( O ) some of them [ c ] did , and were killed by the snakes .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now these things happened to them as an ( S ) example , and ( T ) they were written for our instruction , upon whom ( U ) the ends of the ages have come .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Therefore let the one who ( V ) thinks he stands watch out that he does not fall .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has overtaken you except something common to mankind ; and ( W ) God is faithful , [ e ] so He will not allow you to be ( X ) tempted beyond what you are able , but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also , so that you will be able to endure it .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Therefore , my ( Y ) beloved , flee from ( Z ) idolatry .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise people ; you then , judge what I say .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	16	Is the ( AA ) cup of blessing which we bless not a sharing in the blood of Christ ? Is the ( AB ) bread which we break not a sharing in the body of Christ ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	17	Since there is one loaf , we ( AC ) who are many are one body ; for we all partake of the one loaf .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Look at [ f ] the people of ( AD ) Israel ; are those who ( AE ) eat the sacrifices not partners in the altar ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What do I mean then ? That food sacrificed to idols is anything , or ( AF ) that an idol is [ g ] anything ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	20	No , but I say that things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they ( AG ) sacrifice to demons and not to God ; and I do not want you to become partners with demons .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	21	( AH ) You can not drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons ; you can not partake of the table of the Lord and ( AI ) the table of demons .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Or do we ( AJ ) provoke the Lord to jealousy ? We are not ( AK ) stronger than He , are we ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	23	( AL ) All things are permitted , but not all things are of benefit . All things are permitted , but not all things [ h ] ( AM ) build people up .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	24	No one is to ( AN ) seek his own advantage , but rather that of his [ i ] neighbor .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	25	( AO ) Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions , for the sake of conscience ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	26	( AP ) for the earth is the Lord ’ s , and [ j ] all it contains .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If ( AQ ) one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go , ( AR ) eat anything that is set before you without asking questions , for the sake of conscience .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But ( AS ) if anyone says to you , “ This is meat sacrificed to idols , ” do not eat it , for the sake of that one who informed you and for the sake of conscience ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	29	Now by “ conscience ” I do not mean your own , but the other person ’ s ; for ( AT ) why is my freedom judged by another ’ s conscience ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	30	If I partake with thankfulness , ( AU ) why am I slandered about that for which I ( AV ) give thanks ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	31	Therefore , whether you eat or drink , or ( AW ) whatever you do , do all things for the glory of God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	32	( AX ) Do not offend Jews or Greeks , or ( AY ) the church of God ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	10	33	just as I also ( AZ ) please everyone in all things , ( BA ) not seeking my own benefit but the benefit of the many , ( BB ) so that they may be saved . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	11	However , in the Lord , neither is woman [ i ] independent of man , nor is man [ j ] independent of woman .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now ( B ) I praise you because you ( C ) remember me in everything and ( D ) hold firmly to the traditions , just as I handed them down to you .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to understand that Christ is the ( E ) head of every man , and [ a ] ( F ) the man is the head of a woman , and God is the ( G ) head of Christ .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man who has something on his head while praying or ( H ) prophesying disgraces his head .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every ( I ) woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head , for it is one and the same as the woman [ b ] whose head is ( J ) shaved .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman does not cover [ c ] her head , have her also [ d ] cut her hair off ; however , if it is disgraceful for a woman to [ e ] have her hair cut off or [ f ] her head shaved , have her cover [ g ] her head .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For a man should not have his head covered , since he is the ( K ) image and glory of God ; but the woman is the glory of man .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For ( L ) man [ h ] does not originate from woman , but woman from man ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	9	for indeed man was not created for the woman ’ s sake , but ( M ) woman for the man ’ s sake .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	10	Therefore the woman should have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman originated from the man , so also the man has his birth through the woman ; and ( N ) all things originate ( O ) from God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	13	( P ) Judge [ k ] for yourselves : is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Does even nature itself not teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a dishonor to him ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	15	but if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her ? For her hair is given to her as a covering .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But if anyone is inclined to be contentious , ( Q ) we have no [ l ] such practice , nor have ( R ) the churches of God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	17	Now in giving this next instruction ( S ) I do not praise you , because you come together not for the better , but for the worse .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For , in the first place , when you come together [ m ] as a church , I hear that [ n ] ( T ) divisions exist among you ; and in part I believe it .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For there also ( U ) have to be factions among you , ( V ) so that those who are approved may become [ o ] evident among you .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	20	Therefore when you come together it is not to eat the Lord ’ s Supper ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	21	for when you eat , each one takes his own supper first ; and one goes hungry while ( W ) another gets drunk .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	22	What ! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink ? Or do you despise the ( X ) church of God and ( Y ) shame those who have nothing ? What am I to say to you ? Shall ( Z ) I praise you ? In this I do not praise you . The Lord ’ s Supper
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For ( AA ) I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you , that ( AB ) the Lord Jesus , on the night when He was betrayed , took bread ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and when He had given thanks , He broke it and said , “ This is My body , which is for you ; do this in remembrance of Me. ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same way He also took ( AC ) the cup after supper , saying , “ This cup is the ( AD ) new covenant in My blood ; do this , as often as you drink it , in remembrance of Me. ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim the Lord ’ s death ( AE ) until He comes .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy way , shall be ( AF ) guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But a person must ( AG ) examine himself , and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For the one who eats and drinks , eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not properly recognize the [ p ] body .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	30	For this reason many among you are weak and sick , and a number [ q ] ( AH ) are asleep .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we judged ourselves rightly , we would not be judged .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged , we are ( AI ) disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with ( AJ ) the world .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So then , my brothers and sisters , when you come together to eat , wait for one another .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If anyone is ( AK ) hungry , have him eat ( AL ) at home , so that you do not come together for judgment . As to the remaining matters , I will ( AM ) give instructions ( AN ) when I come . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians 12:29 Or works of power New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For just ( W ) as the body is one and yet has many parts , and all the parts of the body , though they are many , are one body , ( X ) so also is Christ .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	2	( C ) You know that when you were [ a ] pagans , you were ( D ) led [ b ] astray to the ( E ) mute idols , however you were led .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking [ c ] ( F ) by the Spirit of God says , “ Jesus is [ d ] ( G ) accursed ” ; and no one can say , “ Jesus is ( H ) Lord , ” except [ e ] ( I ) by the Holy Spirit .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now there are ( J ) varieties of gifts , but the same Spirit .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	5	And there are varieties of ministries , and the same Lord .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	6	There are varieties of effects , but the same ( K ) God who works all things in all persons .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit ( L ) for the common good .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given the word of ( M ) wisdom through the Spirit , and to another the word of ( N ) knowledge according to the same Spirit ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	9	to another ( O ) faith [ f ] by the same Spirit , and to another ( P ) gifts of [ g ] healing [ h ] by the one Spirit ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	10	and to another the [ i ] effecting of [ j ] ( Q ) miracles , and to another ( R ) prophecy , and to another the [ k ] ( S ) distinguishing of spirits , to another various ( T ) kinds of tongues , and to another the ( U ) interpretation of tongues .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But one and the same Spirit works all these things , ( V ) distributing to each one individually just as He [ l ] wills .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For [ m ] ( Y ) by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether ( Z ) Jews or Greeks , whether slaves or free , and we were all made to ( AA ) drink of one Spirit .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For ( AB ) the body is not one part , but many .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot says , “ Because I am not a hand , I am not a part of the body , ” it is not for this reason [ n ] any less a part of the body .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear says , “ Because I am not an eye , I am not a part of the body , ” it is not for this reason [ o ] any less a part of the body .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? If the whole body were hearing , where would the sense of smell be ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now God has ( AC ) arranged the parts , each one of them in the body , ( AD ) just as He desired .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	19	If they were all one part , where would the body be ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now ( AE ) there are many parts , but one body .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	21	And the eye can not say to the hand , “ I have no need of you ” ; or again , the head to the feet , “ I have no need of you. ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	22	On the contrary , [ p ] it is much truer that the parts of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	23	and those parts of the body which we [ q ] consider less honorable , [ r ] on these we bestow greater honor , and our less presentable parts become much more presentable ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	24	whereas our more presentable parts have no need of it . But God has so composed the body , giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	25	so that there may be no [ s ] division in the body , but that the parts may have the same care for one another .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And if one part of the body suffers , all the parts suffer with it ; if a part is [ t ] honored , all the parts rejoice with it .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now you are ( AF ) Christ ’ s body , and ( AG ) individually parts of it .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And God has [ u ] ( AH ) appointed in ( AI ) the church , first ( AJ ) apostles , second ( AK ) prophets , third ( AL ) teachers , then [ v ] ( AM ) miracles , then ( AN ) gifts of healings , helps , ( AO ) administrations , and various ( AP ) kinds of tongues .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	29	All are not apostles , are they ? All are not prophets , are they ? All are not teachers , are they ? All are not workers of [ w ] miracles , are they ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	30	All do not have gifts of healings , do they ? All do not speak with tongues , do they ? All do not ( AQ ) interpret , do they ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	12	31	But ( AR ) earnestly desire the greater gifts . And yet , I am going to show you a far better way . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	13	But now faith , hope , and love remain , these three ; but the [ f ] greatest of these is ( Y ) love . Footnotes -
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	2	If I have the gift of ( D ) prophecy and know all ( E ) mysteries and all ( F ) knowledge , and if I have ( G ) all faith so as to ( H ) remove mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	3	And if I ( I ) give away all my possessions to charity , and if I ( J ) surrender my body so that I may [ a ] glory , but do not have love , it does me no good .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love ( K ) is patient , love is kind , it ( L ) is not jealous ; love does not brag , it is not ( M ) arrogant .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	5	It does not act disgracefully , it ( N ) does not seek its own benefit ; it is not provoked , ( O ) does not keep an account of a wrong suffered ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	6	( P ) it does not rejoice in unrighteousness , but ( Q ) rejoices with the truth ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	7	it [ b ] ( R ) keeps every confidence , it believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails ; but if there are gifts of [ c ] ( S ) prophecy , they will be done away with ; if there are ( T ) tongues , they will cease ; if there is knowledge , it will be done away with .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For we ( U ) know in part and prophesy in part ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	10	but when the perfect comes , the partial will be done away with .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I used to speak like a child , think like a child , reason like a child ; when I [ d ] became a man , I did away with childish things .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For now we ( V ) see in a mirror [ e ] dimly , but then ( W ) face to face ; now I know in part , but then I will know fully , just as I also ( X ) have been fully known .

NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians 14:38 Two early mss let him continue not to recognize it New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays , but my mind is unproductive .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	2	v
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But the one who prophesies speaks to people for ( G ) edification , [ c ] ( H ) exhortation , and consolation .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	4	The one who ( I ) speaks in a tongue ( J ) edifies himself ; but the one who ( K ) prophesies ( L ) edifies the church .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	5	Now I wish that you all ( M ) spoke in tongues , but ( N ) rather that you would prophesy ; and greater is the one who prophesies than the one who ( O ) speaks in tongues , unless he interprets , so that the church may receive ( P ) edification .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	6	But now , brothers and sisters , if I come to you speaking in tongues , how will I benefit you unless I speak to you either by way of ( Q ) revelation , or of ( R ) knowledge , or of ( S ) prophecy , or of ( T ) teaching ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Yet even lifeless instruments , whether flute or harp , in producing a sound , if they do not produce a distinction in the tones , how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	8	For if ( U ) the trumpet produces an indistinct sound , who will prepare himself for battle ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So you too , unless you produce intelligible speech by the tongue , how will it be known what is spoken ? For you will just be ( V ) talking to the air .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , perhaps , a great many kinds of [ d ] languages in the world , and none is incapable of meaning .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	11	So if I do not know the meaning of the language , I will be ( W ) unintelligible to the one who speaks , and the one who speaks will be unintelligible [ e ] to me .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	12	So you too , since you are eager to possess [ f ] spiritual gifts , strive to excel for the ( X ) edification of the church .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore , one who speaks in a tongue is to pray that he may interpret .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	15	( Y ) What is the outcome then ? I will pray with the spirit , but I will pray with the mind also ; I will ( Z ) sing with the spirit , but I will sing with the mind also .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	16	-
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For you are giving thanks well enough , but the other person is not ( AC ) edified .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God , I speak in tongues more than you all ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	19	nevertheless , in church I prefer to speak five words with my mind so that I may instruct others also , rather than ten thousand words in a tongue . Instruction for the Church
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	20	( AD ) Brothers and sisters , ( AE ) do not be children in your thinking ; yet in evil ( AF ) be infants , but in your thinking be mature .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In ( AG ) the [ i ] Law it is written : “ ( AH ) By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people , and even so they will not listen to Me , ” says the Lord .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	22	So then , tongues are for a sign , not to those who believe but to unbelievers ; but ( AI ) prophecy is not for unbelievers , but for those who believe .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Therefore if the whole church gathers together and all the people speak in tongues , and [ j ] outsiders or unbelievers enter , will they not say that ( AJ ) you are insane ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all ( AK ) prophesy , and an unbeliever or an [ k ] outsider enters , he is ( AL ) convicted by all , he is called to account by all ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	25	( AM ) the secrets of his heart are disclosed ; and so he will ( AN ) fall on his face and worship God , ( AO ) declaring that God is certainly among you .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	26	( AP ) What is the outcome then , ( AQ ) brothers and sisters ? When you assemble , ( AR ) each one has a ( AS ) psalm , has a ( AT ) teaching , has a ( AU ) revelation , has a ( AV ) tongue , has an ( AW ) interpretation . ( AX ) All things are to be done for edification .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If anyone speaks in a ( AY ) tongue , it must be by two or at the most three , and each one in turn , and one is to ( AZ ) interpret ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	28	but if there is no interpreter , he is to keep silent in church ; and have him speak to himself and to God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Have two or three ( BA ) prophets speak , and have the others ( BB ) pass judgment .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	30	But if a revelation is made to another who is seated , then the first one is to keep silent .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For you can all prophesy one by one , so that all may learn and all may be [ l ] exhorted ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	32	and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	33	for God is not a God of ( BC ) confusion , but of peace . As in ( BD ) all the churches of the [ m ] ( BE ) saints ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	34	the women are to ( BF ) keep silent in the churches ; for they are not permitted to speak , but ( BG ) are to subject themselves , just as ( BH ) the Law also says .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	35	If they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home ; for it is [ n ] improper for a woman to speak in church .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Or was it from you that the word of God first went out ? Or has it come to you only ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	37	( BI ) If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or ( BJ ) spiritual , let him recognize that the things which I write to you ( BK ) are the Lord ’ s commandment .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But if anyone does not recognize this , [ o ] he is not recognized .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	39	Therefore , my brothers and sisters , ( BL ) earnestly desire to ( BM ) prophesy , and do not forbid speaking in tongues .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	14	40	But ( BN ) all things must be done properly and in an orderly way . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	15	Moreover , we are even found to be false witnesses of God , because we testified [ g ] against God that He ( Y ) raised [ h ] Christ , whom He did not raise , if in fact the dead are not raised .

NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that ( K ) He appeared to [ c ] ( L ) Cephas , then ( M ) to the twelve .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that He appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time , most of whom remain until now , but some ( N ) have fallen asleep ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	7	then He appeared to [ d ] ( O ) James , then to ( P ) all the apostles ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	8	and last of all , as [ e ] to one untimely born , ( Q ) He appeared to me also .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am ( R ) the least of the apostles , [ f ] and not fit to be called an apostle , because I ( S ) persecuted the church of God .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by ( T ) the grace of God I am what I am , and His grace toward me did not prove vain ; but I ( U ) labored even more than all of them , yet ( V ) not I , but the grace of God with me .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Whether then it was I or they , so we preach and so you believed .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached , that He has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there ( W ) is no resurrection of the dead ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , then not even Christ has been raised ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	14	and ( X ) if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain , your faith also is in vain .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead are not raised , then not even Christ has been raised ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	17	and if Christ has not been raised , your faith is worthless ; ( Z ) you are still in your sins .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then also those who ( AA ) have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If we have hoped in Christ only in this life , we are ( AB ) of all people most to be pitied . The Order of Resurrection
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But the fact is , Christ ( AC ) has been raised from the dead , the ( AD ) first fruits of those who ( AE ) are asleep .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since ( AF ) by a man death came , by a man also came the resurrection of the dead .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For ( AG ) as in Adam all die , so also in [ i ] Christ all will be made alive .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own order : Christ ( AH ) the first fruits , after that ( AI ) those who are Christ ’ s at ( AJ ) His coming ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	24	then comes the end , when He hands over ( AK ) the kingdom to our ( AL ) God and Father , when He has abolished ( AM ) all rule and all authority and power .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For He must reign ( AN ) until He has put all His enemies under His feet .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that will be ( AO ) abolished is death .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For ( AP ) He has put all things in subjection under His feet . But when He says , “ ( AQ ) All things are put in subjection , ” it is clear that [ j ] this excludes the Father who put all things in subjection to Him .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	28	When ( AR ) all things are subjected to Him , then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him , so that ( AS ) God may be all in all .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	29	For otherwise , what will those do who are baptized [ k ] for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why then are they baptized [ l ] for them ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	30	Why are we also ( AT ) in danger every hour ?
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I affirm , brothers and sisters , by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , that ( AU ) I die daily .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If [ m ] from human motives I ( AV ) fought with wild beasts at ( AW ) Ephesus , what good is it to me ? If the dead are not raised , ( AX ) let ’ s eat and drink , for tomorrow we die .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	33	( AY ) Do not be deceived : “ Bad company corrupts good morals. ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	34	( AZ ) Sober up [ n ] morally and stop sinning , for some have ( BA ) no knowledge of God . ( BB ) I say this to your shame .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But ( BC ) someone will say , “ How are ( BD ) the dead raised ? And with what kind of body do they come ? ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	36	( BE ) You fool ! That which you ( BF ) sow does not come to life unless it dies ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	37	and that which you sow , you do not sow the body which is to be , but a bare grain , perhaps of wheat or of [ o ] something else .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body just as He wished , and ( BG ) to each of the seeds a body of its own .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of mankind , another flesh of animals , another flesh of birds , and another of fish .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies , but the glory of the heavenly is one , and the glory of the earthly is another .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun , another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for star differs from star in glory .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	42	( BH ) So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown [ p ] ( BI ) a perishable body , it is raised [ q ] ( BJ ) an imperishable body ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	43	it is sown in dishonor , it is raised in ( BK ) glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	44	it is sown a ( BL ) natural body , it is raised a ( BM ) spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	45	So also it is written : “ The first ( BN ) man , Adam , became a living [ r ] person. ” The ( BO ) last Adam was a ( BP ) life-giving spirit .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	46	However , the spiritual is not first , but the natural ; then the spiritual .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man is ( BQ ) from the earth , [ s ] ( BR ) earthy ; the second man is from heaven .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As is the earthy one , so also are those who are earthy ; and as is the heavenly one , ( BS ) so also are those who are heavenly .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	49	Just as we have ( BT ) borne the image of the earthy , [ t ] we ( BU ) will also bear the image of the heavenly . The Mystery of Resurrection
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now I say this , brothers and sisters , that ( BV ) flesh and blood can not ( BW ) inherit the kingdom of God ; nor does [ u ] the perishable inherit [ v ] ( BX ) the imperishable .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I am telling you a [ w ] ( BY ) mystery ; we will not all sleep , but we will all be ( BZ ) changed ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet ; for ( CA ) the trumpet will sound , and ( CB ) the dead will be raised [ x ] imperishable , and ( CC ) we will be changed .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this [ y ] perishable must put on [ z ] ( CD ) the imperishable , and this ( CE ) mortal must put on immortality .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	54	But when this [ aa ] perishable puts on [ ab ] the imperishable , and this mortal puts on immortality , then will come about the saying that is written : “ ( CF ) Death has been swallowed up in victory .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	55	( CG ) Where , O Death , is your victory ? Where , O Death , is your sting ? ”
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of ( CH ) death is sin , and ( CI ) the power of sin is the Law ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	57	but ( CJ ) thanks be to God , who gives us the ( CK ) victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	15	58	( CL ) Therefore , my beloved brothers and sisters , be firm , immovable , always excelling in ( CM ) the work of the Lord , knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	16	I urge that ( AH ) you also be subject to such as these and to everyone who helps in the work and labors .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	2	On ( E ) the first day of every week , each of you is to [ b ] put aside and save as he may prosper , so that ( F ) no collections need to be made when I come .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	3	When I arrive , ( G ) whomever you approve , I will send them with letters to take your gift to Jerusalem ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	4	and if it is appropriate for me to go also , they will go with me .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	5	But I ( H ) will come to you after I go through ( I ) Macedonia ; for I ( J ) am going through Macedonia ,
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	6	and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter , so that you may ( K ) send me on my way wherever I go .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I do not want to see you now ( L ) just in passing ; for I hope to remain with you for some time , ( M ) if the Lord permits .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will remain in ( N ) Ephesus until ( O ) Pentecost ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	9	for a ( P ) wide door [ c ] for effective service has opened to me , and ( Q ) there are many adversaries .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	10	Now if ( R ) Timothy comes , see that he [ d ] has no reason to be afraid while among you , for he is doing ( S ) the Lord ’ s work , as I also am .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	11	( T ) So do not look down on him , anyone . But ( U ) send him on his way ( V ) in peace , so that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	12	Now concerning our brother ( W ) Apollos , I strongly encouraged him to come to you with the brothers ; and it was not at all his desire to come now , but he will come when he has the opportunity .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	13	( X ) Be on the alert , ( Y ) stand firm in the faith , ( Z ) act like men , ( AA ) be strong .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	14	All that you do must be done ( AB ) in love .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	15	Now I urge you , brothers and sisters : you know the ( AC ) household of Stephanas , that [ e ] they are the ( AD ) first fruits of ( AE ) Achaia , and that they have devoted themselves to ( AF ) ministry to ( AG ) the [ f ] saints ;
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	17	I rejoice over the [ g ] ( AI ) coming of Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus , because they have [ h ] supplied ( AJ ) what was lacking on your part .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	18	For they ( AK ) have refreshed my spirit and yours . Therefore ( AL ) acknowledge such men .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The churches of [ i ] ( AM ) Asia greet you . ( AN ) Aquila and Prisca greet you heartily in the Lord , with ( AO ) the church that is in their house .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	20	All the brothers and sisters greet you . ( AP ) Greet one another with a holy kiss .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	21	The greeting is in ( AQ ) my own hand—that of Paul .
NASB	1%20Corinthians	16	22	If anyone does not love the Lord , he is to be [ j ] ( AR ) accursed . [ k ] ( AS ) Maranatha !

NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Corinthians 1:22 Or first installment New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , ( A ) an apostle of ( B ) Christ Jesus ( C ) by the will of God , and our brother ( D ) Timothy , To ( E ) the church of God which is at ( F ) Corinth with all the [ a ] saints who are throughout ( G ) Achaia :
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	3	( I ) Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and ( J ) God of all comfort ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	4	who ( K ) comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in [ b ] any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For just ( L ) as the sufferings of Christ are [ c ] ours in abundance , so also our comfort is abundant through Christ .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	6	But if we are afflicted , it is ( M ) for your comfort and salvation ; or if we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	7	and our hope for you is firmly grounded , knowing that ( N ) as you are partners in our sufferings , so also you are in our comfort .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For ( O ) we do not want you to be unaware , brothers and sisters , of our ( P ) affliction which occurred in [ d ] ( Q ) Asia , that we were burdened excessively , beyond our strength , so that we despaired even of life .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	9	[ e ] Indeed , we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	10	who ( R ) rescued us from so great a danger of death , and will rescue us , He [ f ] ( S ) on whom we have set our hope . And He will yet deliver us ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	11	if you also join in ( T ) helping us through your prayers , so that thanks may be given by ( U ) many persons in our behalf for the favor granted to us through the prayers of many . Paul ’ s Integrity
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our [ g ] proud confidence is this : the testimony of ( V ) our conscience , that in holiness and ( W ) godly sincerity , ( X ) not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God , we have conducted ourselves in the world , and especially toward you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write nothing else to you than what you read and understand , and I hope you will understand ( Y ) until the end ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	14	just as you also partially did understand us , that we are your reason to be proud as you also are ours , on ( Z ) the day of our Lord Jesus .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	15	In this confidence I intended at first to ( AA ) come to you , so that you might [ h ] twice receive a [ i ] ( AB ) blessing ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	16	[ j ] that is , to ( AC ) pass [ k ] your way into ( AD ) Macedonia , and again from Macedonia to come to you , and by you to be ( AE ) helped on my journey to Judea .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Therefore , I was not vacillating when I intended to do this , was I ? Or what I decide , do I decide ( AF ) according to the flesh , so that with me there will be [ l ] yes , yes and no , no at the same time ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But as ( AG ) God is faithful , ( AH ) our word to you is not yes and no .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For ( AI ) the Son of God , Christ Jesus , who was preached among you by us—by me and ( AJ ) Silvanus and ( AK ) Timothy—was not yes and no , but has been yes ( AL ) in Him .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For ( AM ) as many as the promises of God are , ( AN ) in Him they are yes ; therefore through Him also is ( AO ) our Amen to the glory of God through us .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now He who ( AP ) establishes us with you in Christ and ( AQ ) anointed us is God ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	22	who also ( AR ) sealed us and ( AS ) gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a [ m ] pledge .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	23	But ( AT ) I call God as witness to my soul , that it was ( AU ) to spare you that I did not come again to ( AV ) Corinth .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Not that we ( AW ) domineer over your faith , but we are workers with you for your joy ; for in your faith you are ( AX ) standing firm . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	3	This is the very thing I ( C ) wrote you , so that ( D ) when I came , I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice ; having ( E ) confidence in you all that my joy was the joy of you all .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I ( F ) wrote to you with many tears ; not so that you would be made sorrowful , but that you might know the love which I have especially for you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But ( G ) if anyone has caused sorrow , he has caused sorrow not for me , but in some degree— [ b ] not to say too much—for all of you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient for such a person is ( H ) this punishment which was imposed by the majority ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	7	so that on the other hand , you should rather ( I ) forgive and comfort him , otherwise such a person might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For to this end ( J ) I also wrote , so that I might [ c ] ( K ) put you to the test , whether you are ( L ) obedient in all things .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	10	But one whom you forgive anything , I also forgive ; for indeed what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , I did so for your sakes ( M ) in the presence of Christ ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	11	so that no advantage would be taken of us by ( N ) Satan , for ( O ) we are not ignorant of his schemes .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Now when I came to ( P ) Troas for the ( Q ) gospel of Christ and when a ( R ) door was opened for me in the Lord ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I ( S ) had no rest for my spirit , not finding ( T ) Titus my brother ; but ( U ) saying goodbye to them , I went on to ( V ) Macedonia .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	14	( W ) But thanks be to God , who always ( X ) leads us in triumph in Christ , and through us reveals the ( Y ) fragrance of the ( Z ) knowledge of Him in every place .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are a ( AA ) fragrance of Christ to God among ( AB ) those who are being saved and among those who are perishing :
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	16	( AC ) to the one an [ d ] aroma from death to death , to the other an aroma from life to life . And who is ( AD ) adequate for these things ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not like the many , [ e ] ( AE ) peddling the word of God , but ( AF ) as from sincerity , but as from God , we speak in Christ ( AG ) in the sight of God . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	3	revealing yourselves , that you are a letter of Christ , [ a ] ( D ) delivered by us , written not with ink but with the Spirit of ( E ) the living God , not on ( F ) tablets of stone but on ( G ) tablets of [ b ] ( H ) human hearts .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	4	Such is the ( I ) confidence we have toward God through Christ .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are adequate in ourselves so as to consider anything as having come from ourselves , but ( J ) our adequacy is from God ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	6	who also made us adequate as ( K ) servants of a ( L ) new covenant , not of ( M ) the letter but of the Spirit ; for the letter kills , but ( N ) the Spirit gives life .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	7	But if the ( O ) ministry of death , engraved ( P ) in letters on stones , came [ c ] with glory ( Q ) so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face , fading as it was ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	8	how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if ( R ) the ministry of condemnation has glory , much more does the ( S ) ministry of righteousness excel in glory .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For indeed what had glory in this case has no glory , because of the glory that surpasses it .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that which fades away was [ d ] with glory , much more that which remains is in glory .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	12	( T ) Therefore , having such a hope , ( U ) we use great boldness in our speech ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	13	and we are not like Moses , ( V ) who used to put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not stare at the end of what was fading away .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were ( W ) hardened ; for until this very day at the ( X ) reading of ( Y ) the old covenant the same veil [ e ] remains unlifted , because it is removed in Christ .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But to this day whenever Moses is read , a veil lies over their hearts ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	16	( Z ) but whenever someone turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where ( AA ) the Spirit of the Lord is , ( AB ) there is freedom .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	3	18	But we all , with unveiled faces , ( AC ) looking as in a mirror at the ( AD ) glory of the Lord , are being ( AE ) transformed into the same image from glory to glory , just as from ( AF ) the Lord , the Spirit . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	4	in whose case ( J ) the god of ( K ) this [ b ] world has ( L ) blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that [ c ] they will not see the ( M ) light of the gospel of the ( N ) glory of Christ , who is the ( O ) image of God .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	3	And even if our ( G ) gospel is ( H ) veiled , it is veiled [ a ] to ( I ) those who are perishing ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For we ( P ) do not preach ourselves , but Christ Jesus as Lord , and ourselves as your bond-servants [ d ] on account of Jesus .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God , who said , “ ( Q ) Light shall shine out of darkness , ” is the One who has ( R ) shone in our hearts to give the ( S ) Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in [ e ] ( T ) earthen containers , so that the extraordinary greatness of ( U ) the power will be of God and not from ourselves ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	8	we are ( V ) afflicted in every way , but not ( W ) crushed ; ( X ) perplexed , but not despairing ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	9	( Y ) persecuted , but not ( Z ) abandoned ; ( AA ) struck down , but not destroyed ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	10	( AB ) always carrying around in the body the dying of Jesus , so that ( AC ) the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are constantly being handed over to death because of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So death works in us , but life in you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	13	But having the same ( AD ) spirit of faith , according to what is written : “ ( AE ) I believed , therefore I spoke , ” we also believe , therefore we also speak ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	14	knowing that He who ( AF ) raised the Lord Jesus ( AG ) will also raise us with Jesus , and will ( AH ) present us with you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	15	For all things are ( AI ) for your sakes , so that grace , having [ f ] ( AJ ) spread to more and more people , will cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore we ( AK ) do not lose heart , but though our outer person is decaying , yet our ( AL ) inner person is ( AM ) being renewed day by day .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our momentary , ( AN ) light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	4	18	while we ( AO ) look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen ; for the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God , who ( I ) gave us the Spirit as a [ c ] pledge .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	3	since in fact after putting it on , we will not be found naked .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For indeed , we who are in this tent ( F ) groan , being burdened , because we do not want to be unclothed but to be ( G ) clothed , so that what is ( H ) mortal will be swallowed up by life .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Therefore , being always of good courage , and knowing that ( J ) while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	7	for ( K ) we walk by faith , not by [ d ] sight—
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	8	but we are of good courage and ( L ) prefer rather to be absent from the body and ( M ) to be at home with the Lord .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Therefore we also have as our ambition , whether at home or absent , to be ( N ) pleasing to Him .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear before ( O ) the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may receive compensation for [ e ] his deeds done through the body , in accordance with what he has done , whether good or bad .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Therefore , knowing the ( P ) fear of the Lord , we persuade people , but we are well known to God ; and I hope that we are also ( Q ) well known in your consciences .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not commending ourselves to you ( R ) again , but are giving you an ( S ) opportunity to be proud of us , so that you will have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For if we have ( T ) lost our minds , it is for God ; if we are of sound mind , it is for you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ ( U ) controls us , having concluded this , that ( V ) one died for all , therefore all died ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	15	and He died for all , so that those who live would no longer ( W ) live for themselves , but for Him who died and rose on their behalf .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	16	Therefore from now on we recognize no one [ f ] ( X ) by the flesh ; even though we have known Christ by the flesh , yet now we know Him in this way no longer .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if anyone is ( Y ) in Christ , this person is ( Z ) a new [ g ] creation ; ( AA ) the old things passed away ; behold , new things have come .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	18	Now ( AB ) all these things are from God , ( AC ) who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ( AD ) ministry of reconciliation ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	19	namely , that ( AE ) God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself , ( AF ) not counting their wrongdoings against them , and [ h ] He has [ i ] committed to us the word of reconciliation .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	20	Therefore , we are ( AG ) ambassadors for Christ , ( AH ) as though God were making an appeal through us ; we beg you on behalf of Christ , be ( AI ) reconciled to God .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	5	21	He made Him who ( AJ ) knew no sin to be [ j ] ( AK ) sin in our behalf , so that we might become the ( AL ) righteousness of God in Him . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Corinthians	6	3	( E ) giving no reason for taking offense in anything , so that the ministry will not be discredited ,

NASB	2%20Corinthians	6	11	( AD ) Our mouth [ d ] has spoken freely to you , you Corinthians , our ( AE ) heart is opened wide .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	6	12	You are not restrained [ e ] by us , but ( AF ) you are restrained in your own [ f ] affections .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	6	13	Now in the same way in ( AG ) exchange—I am speaking as to ( AH ) children—open wide your hearts to us , you as well .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	6	14	( AI ) Do not be [ g ] mismatched with ( AJ ) unbelievers ; for what do righteousness and lawlessness ( AK ) share together , or what does light have in common with darkness ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	6	15	Or what ( AL ) harmony does Christ have with [ h ] Belial , or [ i ] what does a ( AM ) believer share with an ( AN ) unbeliever ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	6	16	Or ( AO ) what agreement does [ j ] the temple of God have with idols ?

NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	7	and not only by his arrival , but also by the comfort with which he was comforted among you , as he reported to us your longing , your mourning , your zeal for me ; so that I rejoiced even more .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not speak to condemn you , for I have said ( D ) before that you are ( E ) in our hearts , to die together and to live together .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	4	My ( F ) confidence [ a ] in you is great ; my ( G ) boasting in your behalf is great . I am filled with ( H ) comfort ; I am overflowing with ( I ) joy in all our affliction .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For even when we came into ( J ) Macedonia our flesh had no rest , but we were ( K ) afflicted on every side : ( L ) conflicts on the outside , fears inside .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But ( M ) God , who comforts the [ b ] discouraged , ( N ) comforted us by the arrival of ( O ) Titus ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For though I ( P ) caused you sorrow by my letter , I do not regret it ; though I did regret it—for I see that that letter caused you sorrow , though only for a while—
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	9	I now rejoice , not that you were made sorrowful , but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance ; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God , so that you might not suffer loss in anything [ c ] through us .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a ( Q ) repentance [ d ] without regret , leading to salvation , but the sorrow of the world produces death .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For behold what earnestness this very thing , this [ e ] godly sorrow , has produced in you : what vindication of yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what ( R ) longing , what zeal , what ( S ) punishment of wrong ! In everything you ( T ) demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So although ( U ) I wrote to you , it was not for the sake of ( V ) the offender nor for the sake of the one offended , but that your earnestness in our behalf might be made known to you in the sight of God .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Because of this , we have been ( W ) comforted . And besides our comfort , we rejoiced even much more for the joy of ( X ) Titus , because his ( Y ) spirit has been refreshed by you all .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if I have ( Z ) boasted to him about you regarding anything , I was not put to shame . But as we spoke all things to you in truth , so also our boasting before ( AA ) Titus proved to be the truth .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	15	His [ f ] affection abounds all the more toward you , as he remembers the ( AB ) obedience of you all , how you received him with ( AC ) fear and trembling .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in everything ( AD ) I have confidence in you . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I ( P ) am not saying this as a command , but as proving , through the earnestness of others , the sincerity of your love as well .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For I testify that ( D ) according to their ability , and beyond their ability , they gave voluntarily ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	4	begging us with much urging for the ( E ) favor [ b ] of participation in the [ c ] ( F ) support of the [ d ] saints ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	5	and this , not as we had [ e ] expected , but they first ( G ) gave themselves to the Lord and to us by ( H ) the will of God .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So we ( I ) urged ( J ) Titus that as he had previously ( K ) made a beginning , so he would also complete in you ( L ) this gracious work as well .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	7	But just as you ( M ) excel ( N ) in everything , in faith , speaking , knowledge , and in all earnestness and in the [ f ] love we inspired in you , see that you also ( O ) excel in this gracious work .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For you know ( Q ) the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ( R ) though He was rich , yet for your sake He became poor , so that you through His poverty might become rich .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	10	I ( S ) give my opinion in this matter , for this is to your advantage , who were the first to begin ( T ) a year ago not only to do this , but also to desire to do it .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	11	But now finish [ g ] doing it also , so that just as there was the ( U ) willingness to desire it , so there may be also the completion of it by your ability .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the willingness is present , it is acceptable ( V ) according to what a person has , not according to what he does not have .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For this is not for the relief of others and for your hardship , but by way of equality—
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	14	at this present time your abundance will serve as assistance for ( W ) their need , so that their abundance also may [ h ] serve as assistance for ( X ) your need , so that there may be equality ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	15	as it is written : “ ( Y ) The one who had gathered much did not have too much , and the one who had gathered little did not have too little. ”
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But ( Z ) thanks be to God who ( AA ) puts the same earnestness in your behalf in the heart of ( AB ) Titus .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For he not only accepted our ( AC ) appeal , but being himself very earnest , he has gone to you of his own accord .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	18	We have sent along with him ( AD ) the brother whose fame in the things of the ( AE ) gospel has spread through ( AF ) all the churches ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	19	( AG ) and not only that , but he has also been ( AH ) appointed by the churches to travel with us in ( AI ) this gracious work , which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself , and to show our ( AJ ) readiness ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	20	[ i ] taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	21	for we ( AK ) have regard for what is honorable , not only in ( AL ) the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of other people .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	22	We have sent with them our brother , whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things , but now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	23	As for ( AM ) Titus , he is my ( AN ) partner and fellow worker [ j ] among you ; as for our ( AO ) brothers , they are [ k ] ( AP ) messengers of the churches , ( AQ ) a glory to Christ .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Therefore , [ l ] openly before the churches , [ m ] show them the proof of your love and of our ( AR ) reason for boasting about you . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	9	as it is written :
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But I have sent the brothers , in order that our ( G ) boasting about you may not prove empty in this case , so that , ( H ) as I was saying , you will be prepared ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	4	otherwise , if any ( I ) Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , we—not to mention you—would be put to shame by this confidence .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	5	So I considered it necessary to urge the ( J ) brothers that they go on ahead to you and arrange in advance your previously promised [ b ] ( K ) generous gift , that the same would be ready as a [ c ] ( L ) generous gift , and not as one grudgingly given due to greediness .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Now I say this : ( M ) the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and the one who sows [ d ] generously will also reap [ e ] generously .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each one must do just as he has decided in his heart , not ( N ) reluctantly or under compulsion , for ( O ) God loves a cheerful giver .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And ( P ) God is able to make all grace overflow to you , so that , always having all sufficiency in everything , you may have an abundance for every good deed ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Now He who supplies ( R ) seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and ( S ) increase the harvest of your righteousness ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	11	you will be ( T ) enriched in everything for all liberality , which through us is producing ( U ) thanksgiving to God .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	12	For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying ( V ) the needs of the [ g ] saints , but is also overflowing ( W ) through many thanksgivings to God .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	13	Because of the proof given by this ( X ) ministry , they will ( Y ) glorify God for your obedience to your ( Z ) confession of the ( AA ) gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your [ h ] contribution to them and to all ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	14	while they also , by prayer on your behalf , yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	9	15	( AB ) Thanks be to God for His indescribable ( AC ) gift ! Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	10	For they say , “ His letters are weighty and strong , but his [ g ] personal presence is ( S ) unimpressive and ( T ) his speech contemptible. ”
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh , we do not wage battle ( H ) according to the flesh ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	4	for the ( I ) weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh , but [ b ] divinely powerful ( J ) for the destruction of fortresses .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	5	We are destroying arguments and all ( K ) arrogance raised against the knowledge of God , and we are taking every thought captive to the ( L ) obedience of Christ ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	6	and we are ready to punish all disobedience , whenever ( M ) your obedience is complete .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	7	[ c ] ( N ) You are looking at [ d ] things as they are outwardly . ( O ) If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ ’ s , have him consider this again within himself , that just as he is Christ ’ s , ( P ) so too are we .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For if ( Q ) I boast somewhat [ e ] more about our ( R ) authority , which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you , I will not be put to shame ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	9	[ f ] for I do not want to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Have such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when absent , such persons we are also in deed when present .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	12	For we do not presume to rank or compare ourselves with [ h ] some of those who ( U ) commend themselves ; but when they [ i ] measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves , they have no understanding .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	13	-
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we are not overextending ourselves , as if we did not reach to you , for ( X ) we were the first to come even as far as you in the ( Y ) gospel of Christ ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	15	not boasting ( Z ) beyond our measure , that is , in ( AA ) other people ’ s labors , but with the hope that as ( AB ) your faith grows , we will be , [ l ] within our [ m ] domain , ( AC ) enlarged even more by you ,
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	16	so as to ( AD ) preach the gospel even to ( AE ) the regions beyond you , and not to boast [ n ] ( AF ) in what has been accomplished in the domain of another .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But ( AG ) the one who boasts is to boast in the Lord .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	10	18	For it is not the one who ( AH ) commends himself that is approved , but the one ( AI ) whom the Lord commends . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Why ? ( Z ) Because I do not love you ? ( AA ) God knows that I do !
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that , as the ( E ) serpent deceived Eve by his trickery , your minds will be led astray from sincere and pure devotion to Christ .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if [ b ] one comes and preaches ( F ) another Jesus whom we have not preached , or you receive a ( G ) different spirit which you have not received , or a ( H ) different gospel which you have not accepted , this you ( I ) tolerate ( J ) very well !
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I consider myself ( K ) not in the least inferior to the [ c ] most eminent apostles .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	6	But even if I am ( L ) unskilled in speech , yet I am not so in ( M ) knowledge ; in fact , in every way we have ( N ) made this evident to you in all things .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Or ( O ) did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted , because I preached the ( P ) gospel of God to you ( Q ) without charge ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches by ( R ) taking wages from them to serve you ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	9	and when I was present with you and was in need , I was ( S ) not a burden to anyone ; for when ( T ) the brothers came from ( U ) Macedonia they fully supplied my need , and in everything I kept myself from ( V ) being a burden to you , [ d ] and will continue to do so .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	10	( W ) As the truth of Christ is in me , ( X ) this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of ( Y ) Achaia .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I am doing I will also continue to do , ( AB ) so that I may eliminate the opportunity from those who want an opportunity to be [ e ] regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such men are ( AC ) false apostles , ( AD ) deceitful workers , disguising themselves as apostles of Christ .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	14	No wonder , for even ( AE ) Satan disguises himself as an ( AF ) angel of light .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness , ( AG ) whose end will be according to their deeds .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	16	( AH ) Again I say , let no one think me foolish ; but if you do , receive me even as foolish , so that I also may boast a little .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	17	What I am saying , I am not saying [ f ] ( AI ) as the Lord would , but as ( AJ ) in foolishness , in this confidence of boasting .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Since ( AK ) many boast ( AL ) according to the flesh , I will boast also .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For you , ( AM ) being so wise , tolerate the foolish gladly .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For you tolerate it if anyone ( AN ) enslaves you , if anyone ( AO ) devours you , if anyone ( AP ) takes advantage of you , if anyone ( AQ ) exalts himself , if anyone ( AR ) hits you in the face .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	21	To my ( AS ) shame I must say that we have been ( AT ) weak by comparison . But in whatever respect anyone else ( AU ) is bold—I am ( AV ) speaking in foolishness—I too am bold .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they ( AW ) Hebrews ? ( AX ) So am I . Are they ( AY ) Israelites ? ( AZ ) So am I . Are they [ g ] ( BA ) descendants of Abraham ? ( BB ) So am I .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they ( BC ) servants of Christ ? —I am speaking as if insane—I more so ; in ( BD ) far more labors , in ( BE ) far more imprisonments , [ h ] ( BF ) beaten times without number , often in danger of ( BG ) death .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received from the Jews ( BH ) thirty-nine lashes .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was ( BI ) beaten with rods , once I was ( BJ ) stoned , three times I was shipwrecked , a night and a day I have spent adrift at sea .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	26	I have been on frequent journeys , in dangers from rivers , dangers from robbers , dangers from my ( BK ) countrymen , dangers from the ( BL ) Gentiles , dangers in the ( BM ) city , dangers in the wilderness , dangers at sea , dangers among ( BN ) false brothers ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	27	I have been in ( BO ) labor and hardship , through many sleepless nights , in ( BP ) hunger and thirst , often ( BQ ) without food , in cold and [ i ] ( BR ) exposure .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Apart from such [ j ] external things , there is the daily pressure on me of concern for ( BS ) all the churches .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is ( BT ) weak without my being weak ? Who is [ k ] led into sin [ l ] without my intense concern ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I have to boast , I will boast of what pertains to my ( BU ) weakness .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , ( BV ) He who is blessed forever , ( BW ) knows that I am not lying .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	11	32	In ( BX ) Damascus the ethnarch under Aretas the king was ( BY ) guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me ,

NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For if I do wish to boast I will not be ( L ) foolish , ( M ) for I will be speaking the truth ; but I refrain from this , so that no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me . A Thorn in the Flesh
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	7	Because of the extraordinary greatness of the ( N ) revelations , for this reason , to keep me from exalting myself , there was given to me a ( O ) thorn in the flesh , a ( P ) messenger of Satan to [ b ] torment me—to keep me from exalting myself !
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Concerning this I pleaded with the Lord ( Q ) three times that it might leave me .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And He has said to me , “ My grace is sufficient for you , for ( R ) power is perfected in weakness. ” Most gladly , therefore , I will rather ( S ) boast [ c ] about my weaknesses , so that the power of Christ may dwell in me .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Therefore ( T ) I delight in weaknesses , in [ d ] insults , in ( U ) distresses , in ( V ) persecutions , in ( W ) difficulties , ( X ) in behalf of Christ ; for ( Y ) when I am weak , then I am strong .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have become ( Z ) foolish ; you yourselves compelled me . Actually I should have been commended by you , since I was ( AA ) in no respect inferior to the [ e ] most eminent apostles , even though ( AB ) I am a nobody .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches , except that ( AD ) I myself did not become a burden to you ? Forgive me ( AE ) this wrong !
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Here ( AF ) for this third time I am ready to come to you , and I ( AG ) will not be a burden to you ; for I ( AH ) do not seek what is yours , but ( AI ) you ; for ( AJ ) children are not responsible to save up for their parents , but ( AK ) parents for their children .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	15	I will ( AL ) most gladly spend and be expended for your souls . If ( AM ) I love you more , am I to be loved less ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But be that as it may , I ( AN ) did not burden you myself ; nevertheless , devious person that I am , I ( AO ) took you in by deceit .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	17	( AP ) Certainly I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you , have I ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I ( AQ ) urged ( AR ) Titus to go , and I sent ( AS ) the brother with him . Titus did not take any advantage of you , did he ? Did we not [ i ] conduct ourselves [ j ] in the same ( AT ) spirit and walk ( AU ) in the same steps ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	19	All this time [ k ] you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you . Actually , ( AV ) it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ ; and ( AW ) all for building you up , ( AX ) beloved .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I am afraid that perhaps ( AY ) when I come I may find you to be not what I wish , and may be found by you to be not what you wish ; that perhaps there will be ( AZ ) strife , jealousy , ( BA ) angry tempers , ( BB ) selfishness , ( BC ) slanders , ( BD ) gossip , ( BE ) arrogance , ( BF ) disturbances ;
NASB	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you , and I may mourn over many of those who have ( BG ) sinned in the past and not repented of the ( BH ) impurity , sexual immorality , and indecent behavior which they have practiced . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	13	( AA ) All the [ h ] saints greet you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	3	since you are ( F ) seeking proof of the ( G ) Christ who speaks in me , who is not weak toward you , but ( H ) mighty in you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	4	For indeed He was ( I ) crucified because of weakness , yet He lives ( J ) because of the power of God . For we too are ( K ) weak [ b ] in Him , yet ( L ) we will live with Him because of the power of God directed toward you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	5	( M ) Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith ; ( N ) examine yourselves ! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves , that Jesus Christ is in you—unless indeed you [ c ] ( O ) fail the test ?
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	6	But I expect that you will realize that we ourselves [ d ] do not fail the test .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	7	Now we pray to God that you do nothing wrong ; not so that we ourselves may appear approved , but that you may do what is right , though we may [ e ] appear unapproved .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	8	For we can not do anything against the truth , but only for the truth .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	9	For we rejoice when we ourselves are ( P ) weak , but you are strong ; this we also pray for , [ f ] that you ( Q ) become mature .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	10	For this reason I am writing these things while absent , so that when present ( R ) I need not use ( S ) severity , in accordance with the ( T ) authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	11	( U ) Finally , brothers and sisters , [ g ] rejoice , ( V ) mend your ways , be comforted , ( W ) be like-minded , ( X ) live in peace ; and ( Y ) the God of love and peace will be with you .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	12	( Z ) Greet one another with a holy kiss .
NASB	2%20Corinthians	13	14	( AB ) The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the ( AC ) love of God , and the ( AD ) fellowship of the Holy Spirit , be with you all . Footnotes -

NASB	Galatians	1	1	Paul , ( A ) an apostle ( ( B ) not sent from men nor through human agency , but ( C ) through Jesus Christ and God the Father , who ( D ) raised Him from the dead ) ,
NASB	Galatians	1	2	and all ( E ) the brothers who are with me , To ( F ) the churches of Galatia :
NASB	Galatians	1	3	( G ) Grace to you and peace from [ a ] God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NASB	Galatians	1	4	who ( H ) gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from ( I ) this present evil [ b ] age , according to the will of ( J ) our God and Father ,
NASB	Galatians	1	5	( K ) to whom be the glory forevermore . Amen . Distortion of the Gospel
NASB	Galatians	1	6	I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting ( L ) Him who called you [ c ] by the grace of Christ , for a ( M ) different gospel ,
NASB	Galatians	1	7	which is not just another account ; but there are some who are ( N ) disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ .
NASB	Galatians	1	8	But even if we , or ( O ) an angel from heaven , should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you , he is to be [ d ] ( P ) accursed !
NASB	Galatians	1	9	As we ( Q ) have said before , even now I say again : ( R ) if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received , he is to be [ e ] ( S ) accursed !
NASB	Galatians	1	10	For am I now ( T ) seeking the favor of people , or of God ? Or am I striving to please people ? If I were still trying to please people , I would not be a ( U ) bond-servant of Christ . Paul Defends His Ministry
NASB	Galatians	1	11	For ( V ) I would have you know , brothers and sisters , that the gospel which was preached by me is ( W ) not [ f ] of human invention .
NASB	Galatians	1	12	For ( X ) I neither received it from man , nor was I taught it , but I received it through a ( Y ) revelation of Jesus Christ .
NASB	Galatians	1	13	For you have heard of ( Z ) my former way of life in Judaism , how I ( AA ) used to persecute ( AB ) the church of God beyond measure and ( AC ) tried to destroy it ;
NASB	Galatians	1	14	and I ( AD ) was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my [ g ] countrymen , being more extremely zealous for my ( AE ) ancestral traditions .
NASB	Galatians	1	15	But when [ h ] He who had set me apart even from my mother ’ s womb and ( AF ) called me through His grace was pleased
NASB	Galatians	1	16	to reveal His Son in me so that I might ( AG ) preach Him among the Gentiles , ( AH ) I did not immediately consult with [ i ] ( AI ) flesh and blood ,
NASB	Galatians	1	17	( AJ ) nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me ; but I went away to Arabia , and returned once more to ( AK ) Damascus .
NASB	Galatians	1	18	Then ( AL ) three years later I went up ( AM ) to Jerusalem to [ j ] become acquainted with [ k ] ( AN ) Cephas , and stayed with him for fifteen days .
NASB	Galatians	1	19	But I did not see another one of the apostles except [ l ] ( AO ) James , the Lord ’ s brother .
NASB	Galatians	1	20	( Now in what I am writing to you , [ m ] I assure you ( AP ) before God that I am not lying . )
NASB	Galatians	1	21	Then ( AQ ) I went into the regions of ( AR ) Syria and ( AS ) Cilicia .
NASB	Galatians	1	22	I was still unknown by [ n ] sight to ( AT ) the churches of Judea which are ( AU ) in Christ ;
NASB	Galatians	1	23	but they only kept hearing , “ The man who once persecuted us is now preaching ( AV ) the faith which he once ( AW ) tried to destroy. ”
NASB	Galatians	1	24	And they ( AX ) were glorifying God [ o ] because of me .

NASB	Galatians	2	3	But not even ( G ) Titus , who was with me , though he was a Greek , was ( H ) compelled to be circumcised .
NASB	Galatians	2	4	Yet it was a concern because of the ( I ) false brothers secretly brought in , who ( J ) had sneaked in to spy on our ( K ) freedom which we have in Christ Jesus , in order to ( L ) enslave us .
NASB	Galatians	2	5	But we did not yield in subjection to them , even for an hour , so that ( M ) the truth of the gospel would remain with you .
NASB	Galatians	2	6	But from those who [ b ] were of considerable ( N ) repute ( what they were makes no difference to me ; ( O ) God shows no favoritism ) —well , those who were of repute contributed nothing to me .

NASB	Galatians	2	9	and recognizing ( T ) the grace that had been given to me , [ f ] ( U ) James and [ g ] ( V ) Cephas and John , who were ( W ) reputed to be ( X ) pillars , gave to me and ( Y ) Barnabas the ( Z ) right [ h ] hand of fellowship , so that we might ( AA ) go to the Gentiles , and they to the circumcised .
NASB	Galatians	2	10	They only asked us to remember the poor— ( AB ) the very thing I also was eager to do . Peter ( Cephas ) Opposed by Paul
NASB	Galatians	2	11	But when ( AC ) Cephas came to ( AD ) Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he [ i ] stood condemned .
NASB	Galatians	2	12	For prior to the coming of some men from [ j ] ( AE ) James , he used to ( AF ) eat with the Gentiles ; but when they came , he began to withdraw and separate himself , ( AG ) fearing those from the circumcision .
NASB	Galatians	2	13	The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy , with the result that even ( AH ) Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy .
NASB	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they ( AI ) were not [ k ] straightforward about ( AJ ) the truth of the gospel , I said to ( AK ) Cephas in the presence of all , “ If you , being a Jew , ( AL ) live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews , how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews ? [ l ]
NASB	Galatians	2	15	“ We are ( AM ) Jews by nature and not ( AN ) sinners from the Gentiles ;
NASB	Galatians	2	16	nevertheless , knowing that ( AO ) a person is not justified by works of [ m ] the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus , even we have believed in Christ Jesus , so that we may be justified by ( AP ) faith in Christ and not by works of [ n ] the Law ; since ( AQ ) by works of [ o ] the Law no [ p ] flesh will be justified .
NASB	Galatians	2	17	But if , while seeking to be justified in Christ , we ourselves have also been found ( AR ) sinners , is Christ then a servant of sin ? [ q ] ( AS ) Far from it !
NASB	Galatians	2	18	For if I rebuild what I have once destroyed , I ( AT ) prove myself to be a wrongdoer .
NASB	Galatians	2	19	For through [ r ] the Law I ( AU ) died to [ s ] the Law , so that I might live for God .
NASB	Galatians	2	20	I have been ( AV ) crucified with Christ ; and it is no longer I who live , but ( AW ) Christ lives in me ; and [ t ] the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in ( AX ) the Son of God , who ( AY ) loved me and ( AZ ) gave Himself up for me .

NASB	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish ? Having begun [ d ] by the Spirit , are you now [ e ] being perfected by the flesh ?
NASB	Galatians	3	2	This is the only thing I want to find out from you : did you receive the Spirit by works of [ b ] the Law , or by ( C ) hearing [ c ] with faith ?
NASB	Galatians	3	4	Did you [ f ] suffer so many things in vain— ( D ) if indeed it was in vain ?
NASB	Galatians	3	5	So then , does He who ( E ) provides you with the Spirit and ( F ) works [ g ] miracles among you , do it by works of [ h ] the Law , or by ( G ) hearing [ i ] with faith ?
NASB	Galatians	3	6	Just as ( H ) Abraham ( I ) believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness .
NASB	Galatians	3	7	Therefore , recognize that ( J ) it is those who are of faith who are ( K ) sons of Abraham .
NASB	Galatians	3	8	The Scripture , foreseeing that God [ j ] would justify the [ k ] Gentiles by faith , preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham , saying , “ ( L ) All the nations will be blessed in you. ”
NASB	Galatians	3	9	So then , ( M ) those who are of faith are blessed with [ l ] Abraham , the believer .
NASB	Galatians	3	10	For all who are of works of [ m ] the Law are under a curse ; for it is written : “ ( N ) Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the book of the Law , to do them. ”
NASB	Galatians	3	11	Now , that ( O ) no one is justified [ n ] by [ o ] the Law before God is evident ; for , “ [ p ] ( P ) the righteous one will live by faith. ”
NASB	Galatians	3	12	[ q ] However , the Law is not [ r ] of faith ; on the contrary , “ ( Q ) The person who performs [ s ] them will live by [ t ] them. ”
NASB	Galatians	3	13	Christ ( R ) redeemed us from the curse of the Law , having become a curse for us—for it is written : “ ( S ) Cursed is everyone who hangs on ( T ) a [ u ] tree ” —
NASB	Galatians	3	14	in order that ( U ) in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles , so that we ( V ) would receive ( W ) the promise of the Spirit through faith . Intent of the Law
NASB	Galatians	3	15	( X ) Brothers and sisters , ( Y ) I speak [ v ] in terms of human relations : ( Z ) even though it is only a man ’ s [ w ] covenant , yet when it has been ratified , no one sets it aside or adds [ x ] conditions to it .
NASB	Galatians	3	16	Now the promises were spoken ( AA ) to Abraham and to his seed . He does not say , “ And to seeds , ” as one would in referring to many , but rather as in referring to one , “ ( AB ) And to your seed , ” that is , Christ .
NASB	Galatians	3	17	What I am saying is this : the Law , which came ( AC )
NASB	Galatians	3	430	years later , does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God , so as to nullify the promise .
NASB	Galatians	3	18	For ( AD ) if the inheritance is [ y ] based on law , it is no longer [ z ] based on a promise ; but ( AE ) God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise .
NASB	Galatians	3	19	( AF ) Why the Law then ? It was added on account of the [ aa ] violations , having been ( AG ) ordered through angels ( AH ) at the hand of a [ ab ] mediator , until ( AI ) the Seed would come to whom the promise had been made .
NASB	Galatians	3	20	Now ( AJ ) a mediator is not [ ac ] for one party only ; but God is only one .
NASB	Galatians	3	21	Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God ? [ ad ] ( AK ) Far from it ! For ( AL ) if a law had been given that was able to impart life , then righteousness [ ae ] would indeed have been [ af ] based on law .
NASB	Galatians	3	22	But the Scripture has ( AM ) confined [ ag ] everyone under sin , so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
NASB	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came , [ ah ] we were kept in custody under the Law , ( AN ) being confined for the faith that was destined to be revealed .

NASB	Galatians	4	4	But when ( C ) the fullness of the time came , God sent His Son , ( D ) born of a woman , born ( E ) under [ f ] the Law ,
NASB	Galatians	4	2	but he is under guardians and [ c ] managers until the [ d ] date set by the father .
NASB	Galatians	4	3	So we too , when we were children , were held ( A ) in bondage under the [ e ] ( B ) elementary principles of the world .
NASB	Galatians	4	5	so that He might redeem those who were under [ g ] the Law , that we might receive the adoption as ( F ) sons and daughters .
NASB	Galatians	4	6	Because you are sons , ( G ) God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts , crying out , “ ( H ) Abba ! [ h ] Father ! ”
NASB	Galatians	4	7	Therefore you are no longer a slave , but a son ; and ( I ) if a son , then an heir [ i ] through God .
NASB	Galatians	4	8	However at that time , ( J ) when you did not know God , you were ( K ) slaves to ( L ) those which by nature are not gods .
NASB	Galatians	4	9	But now that you have come to know God , or rather to be ( M ) known by God , ( N ) how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless [ j ] ( O ) elementary principles , to which you want to be enslaved all over again ?
NASB	Galatians	4	10	You ( P ) meticulously observe days and months and seasons and years .
NASB	Galatians	4	11	I fear for you , that perhaps I have labored [ k ] over you in vain .
NASB	Galatians	4	12	I beg of you , ( Q ) brothers and sisters , ( R ) become as I am , for I also have become as you are . You have done me no wrong ;
NASB	Galatians	4	13	but you know that it was because of a [ l ] bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the [ m ] first time ;
NASB	Galatians	4	14	and you did not despise that which was a trial to you in my [ n ] bodily condition , nor express contempt , but ( S ) you received me as an angel of God , as Christ Jesus Himself .
NASB	Galatians	4	15	Where then is [ o ] that sense of blessing you had ? For I testify about you that , if possible , you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me .
NASB	Galatians	4	16	So have I become your enemy ( T ) by [ p ] telling you the truth ?
NASB	Galatians	4	17	They eagerly seek you , not [ q ] in a commendable way , but they want to shut you out so that you will seek them .
NASB	Galatians	4	18	But it is good always to be eagerly sought [ r ] in a commendable way , and ( U ) not only when I am present with you .
NASB	Galatians	4	19	( V ) My children , with whom ( W ) I am again in labor until ( X ) Christ is formed in you—
NASB	Galatians	4	20	but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone of voice , for ( Y ) I am at a loss about you ! Slave and Free
NASB	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , you who want to be under law , do you not ( Z ) listen to the Law ?
NASB	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , ( AA ) one by the slave woman and ( AB ) one by the free woman .
NASB	Galatians	4	23	But ( AC ) the son by the slave woman [ s ] was born according to the flesh , and ( AD ) the son by the free woman through the promise .
NASB	Galatians	4	24	[ t ] ( AE ) This is speaking allegorically , for these women are two covenants : one coming from ( AF ) Mount Sinai giving birth to children [ u ] who are to be ( AG ) slaves ; [ v ] she is Hagar .
NASB	Galatians	4	25	Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is enslaved with her children .
NASB	Galatians	4	26	But ( AH ) the Jerusalem above is free ; [ w ] she is our mother .
NASB	Galatians	4	27	For it is written : “ ( AI ) Rejoice , infertile one , you who do not give birth ; Break forth and shout , you who are not in labor ; For the children of the desolate one are more numerous Than those of the one who has a husband. ”
NASB	Galatians	4	28	And you , brothers and sisters , ( AJ ) like Isaac , are ( AK ) children of promise .
NASB	Galatians	4	29	But as at that time ( AL ) the son who was born according to the flesh ( AM ) persecuted the one who was born according to the Spirit , ( AN ) so it is even now .

NASB	Galatians	5	5	For we , [ c ] through the Spirit , [ d ] by faith , are ( J ) waiting for the hope of righteousness .
NASB	Galatians	5	2	Look ! I , ( D ) Paul , tell you that if you have yourselves ( E ) circumcised , Christ will be of no benefit to you .
NASB	Galatians	5	3	And I ( F ) testify again to every man who has himself ( G ) circumcised , that he is obligated to ( H ) keep the whole Law .
NASB	Galatians	5	4	You have been severed from Christ , you who [ a ] are seeking to be justified by the [ b ] Law ; you have ( I ) fallen from grace .
NASB	Galatians	5	6	For in ( K ) Christ Jesus ( L ) neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything , but ( M ) faith working through love .
NASB	Galatians	5	7	You were ( N ) running well ; who hindered you from obeying the truth ?
NASB	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion did not come from ( O ) Him who calls you .
NASB	Galatians	5	9	( P ) A little [ e ] leaven leavens the whole lump of dough .
NASB	Galatians	5	10	( Q ) I have confidence [ f ] in you in the Lord , that you ( R ) will adopt no other view ; but the one who is ( S ) disturbing you will bear the punishment , whoever he is .
NASB	Galatians	5	11	But as for me , brothers and sisters , if I still preach circumcision , why am I still ( T ) persecuted ? Then ( U ) the stumbling block of the cross has been eliminated .
NASB	Galatians	5	12	I wish that ( V ) those who are troubling you would even [ g ] ( W ) emasculate themselves .
NASB	Galatians	5	13	For you were called to ( X ) freedom , brothers and sisters ; ( Y ) only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh , but ( Z ) serve one another through love .
NASB	Galatians	5	14	For ( AA ) the whole Law is fulfilled in one word , in the statement , “ ( AB ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”
NASB	Galatians	5	15	But if you ( AC ) bite and devour one another , take care that you are not consumed by one another .
NASB	Galatians	5	16	But I say , ( AD ) walk by the Spirit , and you will not carry out ( AE ) the desire of the flesh .
NASB	Galatians	5	17	For ( AF ) the desire of the flesh is against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; for these are in opposition to one another , ( AG ) in order to keep you from doing whatever you want .
NASB	Galatians	5	18	But if you are ( AH ) led by the Spirit , ( AI ) you are not under the Law .
NASB	Galatians	5	19	Now the deeds of the flesh are evident , which are : ( AJ ) sexual immorality , impurity , indecent behavior ,
NASB	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , ( AK ) witchcraft , hostilities , ( AL ) strife , jealousy , outbursts of anger , ( AM ) selfish ambition , dissensions , ( AN ) factions ,
NASB	Galatians	5	21	envy , ( AO ) drunkenness , carousing , and things like these , of which I forewarn you , just as I have forewarned you , that those who practice such things will not ( AP ) inherit the kingdom of God .
NASB	Galatians	5	22	But ( AQ ) the fruit of the Spirit is ( AR ) love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
NASB	Galatians	5	23	gentleness , ( AS ) self-control ; against such things ( AT ) there is no law .
NASB	Galatians	5	24	Now those who [ h ] belong to ( AU ) Christ Jesus ( AV ) crucified the flesh with its passions and ( AW ) desires .
NASB	Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit , let ’ s follow ( AX ) the Spirit as well .
NASB	Galatians	5	26	Let ’ s not become ( AY ) boastful , challenging one another , envying one another .

NASB	Galatians	6	6	( K ) The one who is taught ( L ) the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches him .
NASB	Galatians	6	2	( E ) Bear one another ’ s burdens , and thereby fulfill ( F ) the law of Christ .
NASB	Galatians	6	3	For ( G ) if anyone thinks that he is something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
NASB	Galatians	6	4	But each one must ( H ) examine his own work , and then he will have reason for ( I ) boasting , but [ a ] to himself alone , and not [ b ] to another .
NASB	Galatians	6	5	For ( J ) each one will bear his own load .
NASB	Galatians	6	7	( M ) Do not be deceived , ( N ) God is not mocked ; for ( O ) whatever a person sows , this he will also reap .
NASB	Galatians	6	8	( P ) For the one who sows to his own flesh will reap ( Q ) destruction from the flesh , but ( R ) the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit .
NASB	Galatians	6	9	( S ) Let ’ s not become discouraged in doing good , for in due time we will reap , if we ( T ) do not become weary .
NASB	Galatians	6	10	So then , [ c ] ( U ) while we have opportunity , let ’ s do good to all people , and especially to those who are of the ( V ) household of ( W ) the faith .
NASB	Galatians	6	11	See with what large letters I have written to you ( X ) with my own hand !
NASB	Galatians	6	12	All who want ( Y ) to make a good showing in the flesh try to ( Z ) compel you to be circumcised , simply so that they ( AA ) will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
NASB	Galatians	6	13	For those who [ d ] are circumcised do not even ( AB ) keep [ e ] the Law themselves , but they want to have you circumcised so that they may ( AC ) boast in your flesh .
NASB	Galatians	6	14	But ( AD ) [ f ] far be it from me to boast , ( AE ) except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , ( AF ) through [ g ] which the world has been crucified to me , and ( AG ) I to the world .
NASB	Galatians	6	15	For ( AH ) neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision , but a ( AI ) new [ h ] creation .
NASB	Galatians	6	16	And all who will follow this rule , peace and mercy be upon them , and upon the ( AJ ) Israel of God .
NASB	Galatians	6	17	From now on let no one cause trouble for me , for I bear on my body the [ i ] ( AK ) marks of Jesus .
NASB	Galatians	6	18	( AL ) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be ( AM ) with your spirit , ( AN ) brothers and sisters . Amen .

NASB	Ephesians	2	3	Among them [ f ] we too all ( F ) previously lived in ( G ) the lusts of our flesh , [ g ] indulging the desires of the flesh and of the [ h ] mind , and were ( H ) by nature ( I ) children of wrath , ( J ) just as the rest .
NASB	Ephesians	2	4	But God , being ( K ) rich in mercy , because of ( L ) His great love with which He loved us ,
NASB	Ephesians	2	5	even when we were ( M ) dead [ i ] in our wrongdoings , made us alive together [ j ] with Christ ( ( N ) by grace you have been saved ) ,

NASB	Ephesians	2	10	For we are His workmanship , ( Z ) created in ( AA ) Christ Jesus for ( AB ) good works , which God ( AC ) prepared beforehand so that we would ( AD ) walk in them .
NASB	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore remember that ( AE ) previously ( AF ) you , the Gentiles in the flesh , who are called “ ( AG ) Uncircumcision ” by the so-called “ ( AH ) Circumcision ” which is performed in the flesh by human hands—
NASB	Ephesians	2	12	remember that you were at that time separate from Christ , [ m ] ( AI ) excluded from [ n ] the people of Israel , and strangers to ( AJ ) the covenants of the promise , having ( AK ) no hope and ( AL ) without God in the world .
NASB	Ephesians	2	13	But now in ( AM ) Christ Jesus you who ( AN ) previously were ( AO ) far away [ o ] have ( AP ) been brought near [ p ] ( AQ ) by the blood of Christ .
NASB	Ephesians	2	14	For He Himself is ( AR ) our peace , ( AS ) who made both groups into one and broke down the [ q ] barrier of the dividing wall ,
NASB	Ephesians	2	15	[ r ] by ( AT ) abolishing [ s ] in His flesh the hostility , which is ( AU ) the Law composed of commandments expressed in ordinances , so that in Himself He might [ t ] ( AV ) make the two ( AW ) one new person , in this way establishing ( AX ) peace ;

NASB	Ephesians	5	5	For this you know with certainty , that ( K ) no sexually immoral or [ f ] impure or greedy person , which [ g ] amounts to an idolater , has an inheritance in the kingdom ( L ) of Christ and God .
NASB	Ephesians	5	2	and ( B ) walk in love , just as Christ also ( C ) loved [ a ] you and ( D ) gave Himself up for us , an ( E ) offering and a sacrifice to God [ b ] as a ( F ) fragrant aroma .
NASB	Ephesians	5	3	But ( G ) sexual immorality [ c ] or any impurity or greed must not even be mentioned among you , as is proper among [ d ] saints ;
NASB	Ephesians	5	4	and there must be no ( H ) filthiness [ e ] or foolish talk , or vulgar joking , which ( I ) are not fitting , but rather ( J ) giving of thanks .
NASB	Ephesians	5	6	( M ) See that no one deceives you with empty words , for because of these things ( N ) the wrath of God comes upon ( O ) the [ h ] sons of disobedience .
NASB	Ephesians	5	7	Therefore do not become ( P ) partners with them ;
NASB	Ephesians	5	8	for ( Q ) you were once ( R ) darkness , but now you are light in the Lord ; walk as ( S ) children of light
NASB	Ephesians	5	9	( for ( T ) the fruit of the light consists in all ( U ) goodness , righteousness , and truth ) ,
NASB	Ephesians	5	10	[ i ] ( V ) as you try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord .
NASB	Ephesians	5	11	( W ) Do not participate in the useless ( X ) deeds of ( Y ) darkness , but instead even ( Z ) expose them ;
NASB	Ephesians	5	12	for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret .
NASB	Ephesians	5	13	But all things become visible ( AA ) when they are exposed by the light , for everything that becomes visible is light .
NASB	Ephesians	5	14	For this reason [ j ] it says ,
NASB	Ephesians	5	15	So then , [ k ] be careful how you ( AE ) walk , not ( AF ) as unwise people but as wise ,
NASB	Ephesians	5	16	[ l ] ( AG ) making the most of your time , because ( AH ) the days are evil .
NASB	Ephesians	5	17	Therefore do not be foolish , but ( AI ) understand what the will of the Lord is .
NASB	Ephesians	5	18	And ( AJ ) do not get drunk with wine , [ m ] in which there is ( AK ) debauchery , but be ( AL ) filled with the Spirit ,
NASB	Ephesians	5	19	( AM ) speaking to [ n ] one another in ( AN ) psalms and ( AO ) hymns and spiritual ( AP ) songs , ( AQ ) singing and making melody with your hearts to the Lord ;
NASB	Ephesians	5	20	( AR ) always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our ( AS ) God and Father ;
NASB	Ephesians	5	21	[ o ] ( AT ) and subject yourselves to one another in the [ p ] ( AU ) fear of Christ . Marriage like Christ and the Church
NASB	Ephesians	5	22	( AV ) Wives , ( AW ) subject yourselves to your own husbands , ( AX ) as to the Lord .
NASB	Ephesians	5	23	For ( AY ) the husband is the head of the wife , as Christ also is the ( AZ ) head of the church , He Himself ( BA ) being the Savior of the body .
NASB	Ephesians	5	24	But as the church is subject to Christ , so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything .
NASB	Ephesians	5	25	( BB ) Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ also loved the church and ( BC ) gave Himself up for her ,
NASB	Ephesians	5	26	( BD ) so that He might sanctify her , having ( BE ) cleansed her by the ( BF ) washing of water with ( BG ) the word ,
NASB	Ephesians	5	27	that He might ( BH ) present to Himself the church [ q ] in all her glory , having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing ; but that she would be ( BI ) holy and blameless .
NASB	Ephesians	5	28	So husbands also ought to ( BJ ) love their own wives as their own bodies . He who loves his own wife loves himself ;
NASB	Ephesians	5	29	for no one ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , just as Christ also does the church ,
NASB	Ephesians	5	30	because we are ( BK ) parts of His ( BL ) body .
NASB	Ephesians	5	31	( BM ) For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh .
NASB	Ephesians	5	32	This mystery is great ; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church .
NASB	Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless , as for you individually , each husband is to ( BN ) love his own wife the same as himself , and the wife must see to it that she ( BO ) respects her husband .

NASB	Ephesians	6	4	( C ) Fathers , do not provoke your children to anger , but ( D ) bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord . Slaves and Masters
NASB	Ephesians	6	5	( E ) Slaves , be obedient to those who are your [ a ] masters according to the flesh , with ( F ) fear and trembling , in the sincerity of your heart , ( G ) as to Christ ;
NASB	Ephesians	6	7	With goodwill [ e ] render service , ( L ) as to the Lord , and not to people ,
NASB	Ephesians	6	8	( M ) knowing that ( N ) whatever good thing each one does , he will receive this back from the Lord , ( O ) whether slave or free .
NASB	Ephesians	6	9	And masters , do the same things to them , and ( P ) give up threatening , knowing that ( Q ) both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is ( R ) no partiality with Him . The Armor of God
NASB	Ephesians	6	10	Finally , ( S ) be strong in the Lord and in ( T ) the strength of His might .
NASB	Ephesians	6	11	( U ) Put on the full armor of God , so that you will be able to stand firm against the ( V ) schemes of the devil .
NASB	Ephesians	6	12	For our ( W ) struggle is not against [ f ] ( X ) flesh and blood , but ( Y ) against the rulers , against the powers , against the ( Z ) world forces of this ( AA ) darkness , against the ( AB ) spiritual forces of wickedness in ( AC ) the heavenly places .
NASB	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore , take up ( AD ) the full armor of God , so that you will be able to ( AE ) resist on ( AF ) the evil day , and having done everything , to stand firm .
NASB	Ephesians	6	14	Stand firm therefore , ( AG ) having belted your waist with truth , and having ( AH ) put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
NASB	Ephesians	6	15	and having ( AI ) strapped on your feet the preparation of the gospel of peace ;
NASB	Ephesians	6	16	[ g ] in addition to all , taking up the ( AJ ) shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the ( AK ) flaming arrows of ( AL ) the evil one .
NASB	Ephesians	6	17	And take ( AM ) the helmet of salvation and the ( AN ) sword of the Spirit , which is ( AO ) the word of God .
NASB	Ephesians	6	18	[ h ] With every ( AP ) prayer and request , [ i ] ( AQ ) pray at all times ( AR ) in the Spirit , and with this in view , [ j ] ( AS ) be alert with all ( AT ) perseverance and every ( AU ) request for all the [ k ] saints ,
NASB	Ephesians	6	19	and ( AV ) pray in my behalf , that speech may be given to me ( AW ) in the opening of my mouth , to make known with ( AX ) boldness ( AY ) the mystery of the gospel ,
NASB	Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ( AZ ) ambassador ( BA ) in [ l ] chains ; that [ m ] in proclaiming it I may speak ( BB ) boldly , ( BC ) as I ought to speak .

NASB	Philippians	1	1	( A ) Paul and ( B ) Timothy , ( C ) bond-servants of ( D ) Christ Jesus , To ( E ) all the [ a ] ( F ) saints in Christ Jesus who are in ( G ) Philippi , [ b ] including the ( H ) overseers and ( I ) deacons :
NASB	Philippians	1	2	( J ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB	Philippians	1	3	( K ) I thank my God in all my remembrance of you ,
NASB	Philippians	1	4	always offering prayer with joy in ( L ) my every prayer for you all ,
NASB	Philippians	1	5	in view of your [ c ] ( M ) participation in the ( N ) gospel ( O ) from the first day until now .
NASB	Philippians	1	6	For I am confident of this very thing , that He who began a good work [ d ] among you will complete it [ e ] by ( P ) the day of Christ Jesus .
NASB	Philippians	1	7	[ f ] For ( Q ) it is only right for me to feel this way about you all , because I ( R ) have you in my heart , since both in my [ g ] ( S ) imprisonment and in the ( T ) defense and confirmation of the ( U ) gospel , you all are [ h ] partakers of grace with me .
NASB	Philippians	1	8	For ( V ) God is my witness , how I long for you all with the [ i ] affection of ( W ) Christ Jesus .
NASB	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray , that ( X ) your love may overflow still more and more in ( Y ) real knowledge and all discernment ,
NASB	Philippians	1	10	so that you may [ j ] ( Z ) discover the things that are excellent , that you may be sincere and blameless for ( AA ) the day of Christ ;
NASB	Philippians	1	11	having been filled with the ( AB ) fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ , for the glory and praise of God . The Gospel Is Preached
NASB	Philippians	1	12	Now I want you to know , brothers and sisters , that my circumstances ( AC ) have turned out for the greater progress of the ( AD ) gospel ,
NASB	Philippians	1	13	so that my [ k ] ( AE ) imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the [ l ] praetorian guard and to ( AF ) everyone else ,
NASB	Philippians	1	14	and that most of the brothers and sisters , [ m ] trusting in the Lord because of my [ n ] ( AG ) imprisonment , have ( AH ) far more courage to speak the word of God without fear .
NASB	Philippians	1	15	( AI ) Some , to be sure , are preaching Christ even [ o ] from envy and strife , but some also [ p ] from goodwill ;
NASB	Philippians	1	16	the latter do it out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the ( AJ ) gospel ;
NASB	Philippians	1	17	the former proclaim Christ ( AK ) out of selfish ambition [ q ] rather than from pure motives , thinking that they are causing me distress in my [ r ] ( AL ) imprisonment .
NASB	Philippians	1	18	What then ? Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed , and in this I rejoice . But not only that , I also will rejoice ,
NASB	Philippians	1	19	for I know that this will turn out for my [ s ] deliverance ( AM ) through your [ t ] prayers and the provision of ( AN ) the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
NASB	Philippians	1	20	according to my ( AO ) eager expectation and ( AP ) hope , that I will not be put to shame in anything , but that with ( AQ ) all boldness , Christ will even now , as always , be ( AR ) exalted in my body , ( AS ) whether by life or by death . To Live Is Christ
NASB	Philippians	1	21	For to me , ( AT ) to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
NASB	Philippians	1	22	[ u ] But if I am to live on in the flesh , this will mean ( AU ) fruitful labor for me ; and I do not know [ v ] which to choose .
NASB	Philippians	1	23	But I am hard-pressed from both directions , having the ( AV ) desire to depart and ( AW ) be with Christ , for that is very much better ;
NASB	Philippians	1	24	yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sakes .
NASB	Philippians	1	25	( AX ) Convinced of this , I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy [ w ] in the faith ,
NASB	Philippians	1	26	so that your ( AY ) pride in Christ Jesus may be abundant because of me by my coming to you again .
NASB	Philippians	1	27	Only conduct yourselves in a manner ( AZ ) worthy of the ( BA ) gospel of Christ , so that whether I come and see you or remain absent , I will hear about you that you are ( BB ) standing firm in ( BC ) one spirit , with one [ x ] mind ( BD ) striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
NASB	Philippians	1	28	and in no way alarmed by your opponents—which is a ( BE ) sign of destruction for them , but of salvation for you , and this too , from God .
NASB	Philippians	1	29	For to you ( BF ) it has been granted for Christ ’ s sake , not only to believe in Him , but also to ( BG ) suffer on His behalf ,

NASB	Philippians	2	2	( C ) make my joy complete [ b ] by ( D ) being of the same mind , maintaining the same love , united in spirit , intent on one purpose .
NASB	Philippians	2	3	Do nothing [ c ] from [ d ] ( E ) selfishness or ( F ) empty conceit , but with humility ( G ) consider one another as more important than yourselves ;
NASB	Philippians	2	4	( H ) do not merely look out for your own personal interests , but also for the interests of others .
NASB	Philippians	2	5	( I ) Have this attitude [ e ] in yourselves which was also in ( J ) Christ Jesus ,
NASB	Philippians	2	6	who , as He already ( K ) existed in the ( L ) form of God , ( M ) did not consider equality with God something to be [ f ] grasped ,
NASB	Philippians	2	7	but [ g ] ( N ) emptied Himself by taking the form of a ( O ) bond-servant and [ h ] ( P ) being born in the likeness of men .
NASB	Philippians	2	8	And being found in appearance as a man , ( Q ) He humbled Himself by becoming ( R ) obedient to the point of death : ( S ) death [ i ] on a cross .
NASB	Philippians	2	9	( T ) For this reason also God ( U ) highly exalted Him , and bestowed on Him ( V ) the name which is above every name ,
NASB	Philippians	2	10	so that at the name of Jesus ( W ) every knee will bow , of ( X ) those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth ,
NASB	Philippians	2	11	and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is ( Y ) Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
NASB	Philippians	2	12	So then , my beloved , ( Z ) just as you have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own ( AA ) salvation with ( AB ) fear and trembling ;
NASB	Philippians	2	13	for it is ( AC ) God who is at work in you , both to [ j ] desire and to work ( AD ) for His good pleasure .
NASB	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without ( AE ) complaining or arguments ;
NASB	Philippians	2	15	so that you will [ k ] prove yourselves to be ( AF ) blameless and innocent , ( AG ) children of God above reproach in the midst of a ( AH ) crooked and perverse generation , among whom you [ l ] ( AI ) appear as [ m ] lights in the world ,
NASB	Philippians	2	16	holding firmly the word of life , so that on ( AJ ) the day of Christ I can take pride because I did not ( AK ) run in vain nor ( AL ) labor in vain .
NASB	Philippians	2	17	But even if I am being ( AM ) poured out as a drink offering upon ( AN ) the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice and share my joy with you all .
NASB	Philippians	2	18	You too , I urge you , rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me . Timothy and Epaphroditus
NASB	Philippians	2	19	But I hope , [ n ] in the Lord Jesus , to ( AO ) send ( AP ) Timothy to you shortly , so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition .
NASB	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one else ( AQ ) of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare .
NASB	Philippians	2	21	For they all ( AR ) seek after their own interests , not those of Christ Jesus .
NASB	Philippians	2	22	But you know ( AS ) of his proven character , that ( AT ) he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel ( AU ) like a child serving his father .
NASB	Philippians	2	23	( AV ) Therefore I hope to send him immediately , as soon as I see how things go with me ;
NASB	Philippians	2	24	and ( AW ) I trust in the Lord that I myself will also be coming shortly .
NASB	Philippians	2	25	But I thought it necessary to send to you ( AX ) Epaphroditus , my brother and ( AY ) fellow worker and ( AZ ) fellow soldier , who is also your [ o ] ( BA ) messenger and ( BB ) minister to my need ,
NASB	Philippians	2	26	because he was longing [ p ] for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick .
NASB	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick to the point of death , but God had mercy on him , and not only on him but also on me , so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow .
NASB	Philippians	2	28	Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly , so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you .
NASB	Philippians	2	29	( BC ) Receive him then in the Lord with all joy , and ( BD ) hold people like him in high regard ,
NASB	Philippians	2	30	because he came close to death [ q ] ( BE ) for the work of Christ , risking his life to ( BF ) compensate [ r ] for your absence in your service to me .

NASB	Philippians	3	3	for ( D ) we are the true [ b ] circumcision , who ( E ) worship in the Spirit of God and take ( F ) pride in ( G ) Christ Jesus , and put no confidence in the flesh ,
NASB	Philippians	3	2	Beware of the ( B ) dogs , beware of the ( C ) evil workers , beware of the [ a ] false circumcision ;
NASB	Philippians	3	4	although ( H ) I myself could boast as having confidence even in the flesh . If anyone else thinks he is confident in the flesh , I have more reason :
NASB	Philippians	3	5	( I ) circumcised the eighth day , of the ( J ) nation of Israel , of the ( K ) tribe of Benjamin , a ( L ) Hebrew of Hebrews ; as to the Law , ( M ) a Pharisee ;
NASB	Philippians	3	6	as to zeal , ( N ) a persecutor of the church ; as to the ( O ) righteousness which is in the Law , found ( P ) blameless .
NASB	Philippians	3	7	But ( Q ) whatever things were gain to me , these things I have counted as loss because of Christ .
NASB	Philippians	3	8	More than that , I count all things to be loss [ c ] in view of the surpassing value of [ d ] ( R ) knowing ( S ) Christ Jesus my Lord , [ e ] for whom I have suffered the loss of all things , and count them mere rubbish , so that I may gain Christ ,
NASB	Philippians	3	9	and may be found in Him , not having ( T ) a righteousness of my own derived from the Law , but that which is through faith in Christ , ( U ) the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith ,
NASB	Philippians	3	10	that I may ( V ) know Him and ( W ) the power of His resurrection and [ f ] ( X ) the fellowship of His sufferings , being ( Y ) conformed to His death ;
NASB	Philippians	3	11	if somehow I may ( Z ) attain to the resurrection from the dead .
NASB	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already [ g ] ( AA ) grasped it all or have already ( AB ) become perfect , but I press on if I may also ( AC ) take hold of that [ h ] for which I ( AD ) was even taken hold of by ( AE ) Christ Jesus .
NASB	Philippians	3	13	Brothers and sisters , I do not regard myself as having taken hold of it yet ; but one thing I do : ( AF ) forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead ,
NASB	Philippians	3	14	I ( AG ) press on toward the goal for the prize of the ( AH ) upward call of God in ( AI ) Christ Jesus .
NASB	Philippians	3	15	Therefore , all who are [ i ] ( AJ ) mature , let ’ s have this attitude ; and if in anything you have a ( AK ) different attitude , ( AL ) God will reveal that to you as well ;
NASB	Philippians	3	16	however , let ’ s keep [ j ] ( AM ) living by that same standard to which we have attained .
NASB	Philippians	3	17	Brothers and sisters , ( AN ) join in following my example , and observe those who walk according to the ( AO ) pattern you have in us .
NASB	Philippians	3	18	For ( AP ) many walk , of whom I often told you , and now tell you even as I ( AQ ) weep , that they are the enemies of ( AR ) the cross of Christ ,
NASB	Philippians	3	19	whose end is destruction , whose god is their [ k ] ( AS ) appetite , and whose ( AT ) glory is in their shame , who ( AU ) have their minds on earthly things .
NASB	Philippians	3	20	For ( AV ) our [ l ] citizenship is in heaven , from which we also eagerly ( AW ) wait for a Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ;
NASB	Philippians	3	21	who will ( AX ) transform the body of our lowly condition into ( AY ) conformity with [ m ] His ( AZ ) glorious body , ( BA ) by the exertion of the power that He has even to ( BB ) subject all things to Himself .

NASB	Philippians	4	3	Indeed , true [ c ] companion , I ask you also , help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel , together with Clement as well as the rest of my ( D ) fellow workers , whose ( E ) names are in the book of life .
NASB	Philippians	4	5	Let your gentle spirit be known to all people . ( G ) The Lord is [ d ] near .
NASB	Philippians	4	6	( H ) Do not [ e ] be anxious about anything , but in everything by ( I ) prayer and pleading with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God .
NASB	Philippians	4	7	And ( J ) the peace of God , which surpasses all [ f ] comprehension , will ( K ) guard your hearts and ( L ) minds in ( M ) Christ Jesus .
NASB	Philippians	4	8	Finally , brothers and sisters , ( N ) whatever is true , whatever is honorable , whatever is right , whatever is pure , whatever is [ g ] lovely , whatever is commendable , if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise , think about these things .
NASB	Philippians	4	9	As for the things you have learned and received and heard and seen ( O ) in me , practice these things , and ( P ) the God of peace will be with you . God ’ s Provisions
NASB	Philippians	4	10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at last ( Q ) you have revived your concern for me ; indeed , you were concerned before , but you lacked an opportunity to act .
NASB	Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak [ h ] from need , for I have learned to be [ i ] ( R ) content in whatever circumstances I am .
NASB	Philippians	4	12	I know how to get along with little , and I also know how to live in prosperity ; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going ( S ) hungry , both of having abundance and ( T ) suffering need .
NASB	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things [ j ] through Him who ( U ) strengthens me .
NASB	Philippians	4	14	Nevertheless , you have done well to ( V ) share with me in my difficulty .
NASB	Philippians	4	15	You yourselves also know , Philippians , that at the [ k ] ( W ) first preaching of the gospel , after I left ( X ) Macedonia , no church ( Y ) shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone ;
NASB	Philippians	4	16	for even in ( Z ) Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs .
NASB	Philippians	4	17	( AA ) Not that I seek the gift itself , but I seek the [ l ] profit which increases to your account .
NASB	Philippians	4	18	But I have received everything in full and have an abundance ; I am [ m ] amply supplied , having received from ( AB ) Epaphroditus [ n ] what you have sent , [ o ] ( AC ) a fragrant aroma , an acceptable sacrifice , pleasing to God .
NASB	Philippians	4	19	And ( AD ) my God will supply [ p ] all your needs according to His ( AE ) riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
NASB	Philippians	4	20	Now to ( AF ) our God and Father ( AG ) be the glory [ q ] forever and ever . Amen .

NASB	Colossians	1	1	( A ) Paul , ( B ) an apostle of Christ Jesus [ a ] ( C ) by the will of God , and ( D ) Timothy [ b ] our brother ,
NASB	Colossians	1	2	To the [ c ] ( E ) saints and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ who are at Colossae : ( F ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father .
NASB	Colossians	1	3	( G ) We [ d ] give thanks to God , ( H ) the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
NASB	Colossians	1	4	( I ) since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the ( J ) love which you have [ e ] for ( K ) all the [ f ] saints ;
NASB	Colossians	1	5	because of the ( L ) hope ( M ) reserved for you in [ g ] heaven , of which you previously ( N ) heard in the word of truth , [ h ] the gospel
NASB	Colossians	1	6	which has come to you , just as [ i ] ( O ) in all the world also it is bearing ( P ) fruit and [ j ] increasing , even as it has been doing in you also since the day you ( Q ) heard it and [ k ] understood the grace of God in truth ;
NASB	Colossians	1	7	just as you learned it from ( R ) Epaphras , our ( S ) beloved fellow bond-servant , who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf ,
NASB	Colossians	1	8	and he also informed us of your ( T ) love in the Spirit .
NASB	Colossians	1	9	For this reason we also , ( U ) since the day we heard about it , ( V ) have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the [ l ] ( W ) knowledge of His will in all spiritual ( X ) wisdom and understanding ,
NASB	Colossians	1	10	so that you will ( Y ) walk in a manner worthy of the Lord , [ m ] ( Z ) to please Him in all respects , ( AA ) bearing fruit in every good work and [ n ] increasing in the [ o ] knowledge of God ;
NASB	Colossians	1	11	( AB ) strengthened with all power , according to [ p ] His glorious might , [ q ] for the attaining of all perseverance and [ r ] patience ; ( AC ) joyously
NASB	Colossians	1	12	giving thanks to ( AD ) the Father , who has qualified us [ s ] to share in ( AE ) the inheritance of the [ t ] saints in ( AF ) light . The Incomparable Christ
NASB	Colossians	1	13	[ u ] For He rescued us from the [ v ] ( AG ) domain of darkness , and transferred us to the kingdom of [ w ] ( AH ) His beloved Son ,
NASB	Colossians	1	14	( AI ) in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of sins .
NASB	Colossians	1	15	[ x ] He is the ( AJ ) image of the ( AK ) invisible God , the ( AL ) firstborn of all creation :
NASB	Colossians	1	16	for [ y ] ( AM ) by Him all things were created , ( AN ) both in the heavens and on earth , visible and invisible , whether ( AO ) thrones , or dominions , or rulers , or authorities— ( AP ) all things have been created through Him and for Him .
NASB	Colossians	1	17	He [ z ] ( AQ ) is before all things , and in Him all things [ aa ] hold together .
NASB	Colossians	1	18	He is also the ( AR ) head of ( AS ) the body , the church ; and He is ( AT ) the beginning , ( AU ) the firstborn from the dead , so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything .
NASB	Colossians	1	19	For [ ab ] it was ( AV ) the Father ’ s good pleasure for all ( AW ) the [ ac ] fullness to dwell in Him ,
NASB	Colossians	1	20	and through Him to ( AX ) reconcile all things to Himself , ( AY ) whether things on earth or things in [ ad ] heaven , having made ( AZ ) peace through ( BA ) the blood of His cross .
NASB	Colossians	1	21	And although you were ( BB ) previously alienated and hostile in attitude , engaged in evil deeds ,
NASB	Colossians	1	22	yet He has now ( BC ) reconciled you in His ( BD ) body of flesh through death , in order to ( BE ) present you before Him ( BF ) holy and blameless and beyond reproach—
NASB	Colossians	1	23	if indeed you continue in [ ae ] the faith firmly ( BG ) established and steadfast , and not shifting from the ( BH ) hope of the gospel that you have heard , which was proclaimed ( BI ) in all creation under heaven , ( BJ ) and of which I , Paul , [ af ] was made a [ ag ] ( BK ) minister .
NASB	Colossians	1	24	( BL ) Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and in my flesh ( BM ) I am supplementing what is lacking [ ah ] in Christ ’ s afflictions in behalf of ( BN ) His body , which is the church .
NASB	Colossians	1	25	( BO ) I [ ai ] was made a minister of this church according to the ( BP ) commission from God granted to me for your benefit , so that I might [ aj ] fully carry out the preaching of the word of God ,
NASB	Colossians	1	26	that is , ( BQ ) the mystery which had been hidden from the past ages and generations , but now has been revealed to His [ ak ] saints ,
NASB	Colossians	1	27	to whom ( BR ) God willed to make known what ( BS ) the wealth of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles is , the mystery that is ( BT ) Christ in you , the ( BU ) hope of glory .
NASB	Colossians	1	28	We proclaim Him , ( BV ) admonishing every person and teaching every person [ al ] with all ( BW ) wisdom , so that we may ( BX ) present every person [ am ] ( BY ) complete in Christ .

NASB	Colossians	2	2	that their ( C ) hearts may be encouraged , having been ( D ) knit together in love , and that they would attain to all ( E ) the wealth [ b ] that comes from the full assurance of understanding , resulting in a ( F ) true knowledge of ( G ) God ’ s mystery , that is , Christ Himself ,
NASB	Colossians	2	3	in whom are hidden all ( H ) the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
NASB	Colossians	2	4	( I ) I say this so that no one will deceive you with ( J ) persuasive arguments .
NASB	Colossians	2	5	For even though I am ( K ) absent in body , I am nevertheless with you in spirit , rejoicing [ c ] to see [ d ] your ( L ) orderly manner and the ( M ) stability of your faith in Christ .
NASB	Colossians	2	6	Therefore , as you have received ( N ) Christ Jesus the Lord , so [ e ] ( O ) walk in Him ,
NASB	Colossians	2	7	having been firmly ( P ) rooted and now being ( Q ) built up in Him and ( R ) established [ f ] in [ g ] your faith , just as you ( S ) were instructed , and overflowing [ h ] with gratitude .
NASB	Colossians	2	8	( T ) See to it that there is no one who takes you captive through ( U ) philosophy and empty deception in accordance with human tradition , in accordance with the ( V ) elementary principles of the world , [ i ] rather than in accordance with Christ .
NASB	Colossians	2	9	For in Him all the ( W ) fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form ,
NASB	Colossians	2	10	and in Him you have been ( X ) made [ j ] complete , and ( Y ) He is the head [ k ] over every ( Z ) ruler and authority ;
NASB	Colossians	2	11	and in Him ( AA ) you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without hands , in the removal of ( AB ) the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ ,
NASB	Colossians	2	12	having been ( AC ) buried with Him in baptism , in which you were also ( AD ) raised with Him through faith in the working of God , who ( AE ) raised Him from the dead .
NASB	Colossians	2	13	And [ l ] when you were ( AF ) dead [ m ] in your wrongdoings and the uncircumcision of your flesh , He ( AG ) made you alive together with Him , having forgiven us all our wrongdoings ,
NASB	Colossians	2	14	having canceled ( AH ) the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us , which was hostile to us ; and ( AI ) He has taken it out of the way , having nailed it to the cross .
NASB	Colossians	2	15	When He had [ n ] ( AJ ) disarmed the ( AK ) rulers and authorities , He ( AL ) made a public display of them , having ( AM ) triumphed over them through [ o ] Him .
NASB	Colossians	2	16	Therefore , no one is to [ p ] ( AN ) act as your judge in regard to ( AO ) food and ( AP ) drink , or in respect to a ( AQ ) festival or a ( AR ) new moon , or a ( AS ) Sabbath [ q ] day—
NASB	Colossians	2	17	things which are only a ( AT ) shadow of what is to come ; but the [ r ] substance [ s ] belongs to Christ .
NASB	Colossians	2	18	Take care that no one keeps [ t ] ( AU ) defrauding you of your prize by ( AV ) delighting in humility and the worship of the angels , [ u ] taking his stand on visions he has seen , [ v ] ( AW ) inflated without cause by his ( AX ) fleshly mind ,
NASB	Colossians	2	19	and not holding firmly to ( AY ) the head , from whom ( AZ ) the entire body , being supplied and held together by the joints and [ w ] ligaments , grows with a growth [ x ] which is from God .
NASB	Colossians	2	20	( BA ) If you have died with Christ [ y ] to the ( BB ) elementary principles of the world , ( BC ) why , as if you were living in the world , do you submit yourself to ( BD ) decrees , such as ,
NASB	Colossians	2	21	“ Do not handle , do not taste , do not touch ! ”
NASB	Colossians	2	22	( which all refer ( BE ) to things destined to perish [ z ] with use ) —in accordance with the ( BF ) commandments and teachings of man ?

NASB	Colossians	3	3	For you have ( D ) died , and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
NASB	Colossians	3	2	[ a ] ( C ) Set your minds on the things that are above , not on the things that are on earth .
NASB	Colossians	3	4	When Christ , ( E ) who is our life , is revealed , ( F ) then you also will be revealed with Him in glory .
NASB	Colossians	3	5	( G ) Therefore , [ b ] treat ( H ) the parts of your earthly body as dead to ( I ) sexual immorality , impurity , passion , evil desire , and greed , which [ c ] amounts to idolatry .
NASB	Colossians	3	6	For it is because of these things that ( J ) the wrath of God is coming [ d ] upon the [ e ] sons of disobedience ,
NASB	Colossians	3	7	and ( K ) in them you also once walked , when you were living [ f ] in them .
NASB	Colossians	3	8	But now you also , ( L ) rid yourselves of all of them : ( M ) anger , wrath , malice , slander , and ( N ) obscene speech from your mouth .
NASB	Colossians	3	9	[ g ] ( O ) Do not lie to one another , since you ( P ) stripped off the old [ h ] self with its evil practices ,
NASB	Colossians	3	10	and have ( Q ) put on the new self , which is being [ i ] ( R ) renewed to a true knowledge ( S ) according to the image of the One who ( T ) created it—
NASB	Colossians	3	11	a renewal in which ( U ) there is no distinction between Greek and Jew , ( V ) circumcised and uncircumcised , [ j ] ( W ) barbarian , [ k ] Scythian , ( X ) slave , and free , but ( Y ) Christ is all , and in all .
NASB	Colossians	3	12	So , as those who have been ( Z ) chosen of God , holy and beloved , ( AA ) put on a ( AB ) heart of compassion , kindness , ( AC ) humility , gentleness , and [ l ] ( AD ) patience ;
NASB	Colossians	3	13	( AE ) bearing with one another , and ( AF ) forgiving each other , whoever has a complaint against anyone ; ( AG ) just as the Lord forgave you , so must you do also .
NASB	Colossians	3	14	In addition to all these things put on love , which is [ m ] ( AH ) the perfect bond of ( AI ) unity .
NASB	Colossians	3	15	Let ( AJ ) the peace of Christ , to which you were [ n ] indeed called in ( AK ) one body , [ o ] rule in your hearts ; and [ p ] be thankful .
NASB	Colossians	3	16	Let ( AL ) the word of [ q ] Christ richly dwell within you , [ r ] with all wisdom ( AM ) teaching and admonishing [ s ] one another ( AN ) with psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs , ( AO ) singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God .
NASB	Colossians	3	17	( AP ) Whatever you do in word or deed , do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus , ( AQ ) giving thanks through Him to God the Father . Family Relations
NASB	Colossians	3	18	( AR ) Wives , ( AS ) be subject to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
NASB	Colossians	3	19	( AT ) Husbands , love your wives and do not become bitter against them .
NASB	Colossians	3	20	( AU ) Children , obey your parents in everything , for this is pleasing [ t ] to the Lord .
NASB	Colossians	3	21	( AV ) Fathers , do not [ u ] antagonize your children , so that they will not become discouraged .
NASB	Colossians	3	22	[ v ] ( AW ) Slaves , obey those who are your [ w ] human masters in everything , ( AX ) not with [ x ] eye-service , as people-pleasers , but with sincerity of heart , fearing the Lord .
NASB	Colossians	3	23	Whatever you do , do your work [ y ] heartily , ( AY ) as for the Lord and not for people ,
NASB	Colossians	3	24	( AZ ) knowing that it is from the Lord that you will receive the reward [ z ] of ( BA ) the inheritance . It is the Lord Christ whom you ( BB ) serve .

NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	but after we had already suffered and been ( C ) treated abusively in ( D ) Philippi , as you know , we had the boldness in our God ( E ) to speak to you the ( F ) gospel of God [ b ] amid much [ c ] ( G ) opposition .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For our ( H ) exhortation does not come from ( I ) error or ( J ) impurity or [ d ] by way of ( K ) deceit ;
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	( L ) but just as we have been approved by God to be ( M ) entrusted with the gospel , so we speak , ( N ) not intending to please people , but to please God , who [ e ] ( O ) examines our hearts .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	For we never came [ f ] with flattering speech , as you know , nor with ( P ) a pretext [ g ] for greed— ( Q ) God is our witness—
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	nor did we ( R ) seek honor from people , either from you or from others , though [ h ] we could have [ i ] asserted our authority as ( S ) apostles of Christ .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	But we [ j ] proved to be [ k ] ( T ) gentle [ l ] among you . ( U ) As a nursing mother [ m ] tenderly cares for her own children ,
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	in the same way we had a fond affection for you and were delighted to ( V ) share with you not only the ( W ) gospel of God , but also our own [ n ] lives , because you had become [ o ] very dear to us .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	For you recall , brothers and sisters , our ( X ) labor and hardship : it was by ( Y ) working night and day so as not to be a ( Z ) burden to any of you , that we proclaimed to you the ( AA ) gospel of God .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses , and so is ( AB ) God , of ( AC ) how devoutly and rightly and blamelessly we [ p ] behaved toward you [ q ] believers ;
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	just as you know how we were ( AD ) exhorting and encouraging and ( AE ) imploring each one of you as ( AF ) a father would his own children ,
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	so that you would ( AG ) walk in a manner worthy of the God who ( AH ) calls you into His own kingdom and ( AI ) glory .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	For this reason we also constantly ( AJ ) thank God that when you received the ( AK ) word of God which you heard from us , you accepted it ( AL ) not as the word of mere men , but as what it really is , the word of God , ( AM ) which also is at work in you who believe .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For you , brothers and sisters , became ( AN ) imitators of ( AO ) the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are ( AP ) in Judea , for ( AQ ) you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen , ( AR ) even as they did from the Jews ,
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	( AS ) who both killed the Lord Jesus and ( AT ) the prophets , and [ r ] drove us out . [ s ] They are not pleasing to God , [ t ] but hostile to all people ,
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	( AU ) hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles ( AV ) so that they may be saved ; with the result that they always [ u ] ( AW ) reach the limit of their sins . But ( AX ) wrath has come upon them [ v ] fully .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	But we , brothers and sisters , having been orphaned from you by absence for a [ w ] short while— ( AY ) in [ x ] person , not in [ y ] spirit—were all the more eager with great desire ( AZ ) to see your face .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	[ z ] For ( BA ) we wanted to come to you—I , Paul , [ aa ] ( BB ) more than once—and ( BC ) Satan ( BD ) hindered us .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	For who is our hope , or ( BE ) joy or crown of pride , in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His [ ab ] ( BF ) coming ? Or is it not indeed you ?
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	2	20	For you are ( BG ) our glory and joy . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	so that no one would be [ a ] disturbed by these afflictions . For you yourselves know that ( D ) we have been destined for this .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	and we sent ( C ) Timothy , our brother and God ’ s fellow worker in the gospel of Christ , to strengthen and encourage you for the benefit of your faith ,
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	For even when we were with you , we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction ; [ b ] ( E ) and so it happened , [ c ] as you know .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	For this reason , ( F ) when I could no longer endure it , I also ( G ) sent to [ d ] find out about your faith , for fear that ( H ) the tempter might have tempted you , and ( I ) our labor would be for nothing .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But now that ( J ) Timothy has come to us from you , and has brought us good news of ( K ) your faith and love , and that you always ( L ) think kindly of us , longing to see us just as we also long to see you ,
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	for this reason , brothers and sisters , in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith ;

NASB	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what instructions we gave you [ c ] by the authority of the Lord Jesus .

NASB	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	not in [ f ] ( J ) lustful passion , like the Gentiles who ( K ) do not know God ;
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	and that no one violate the rights and ( L ) take advantage of his brother or sister ( M ) in the matter , because ( N ) the Lord is the avenger in all these things , just as we also ( O ) told you previously and solemnly warned you .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	For ( P ) God has not called us for [ g ] ( Q ) impurity , but in sanctification .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore , the one who rejects this is not rejecting man , but the God who ( R ) gives His Holy Spirit to you .
NASB	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	Now as to the ( S ) love of the brothers and sisters , you ( T ) have no need for anyone to write to you , for you yourselves are ( U ) taught by God to love one another ;

NASB	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	( A ) Paul , ( B ) Silvanus , and ( C ) Timothy , To the ( D ) church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
NASB	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We ought always ( F ) to give thanks to God for you , ( G ) brothers and sisters , as is only fitting , because your faith is increasing abundantly , and the ( H ) love of each and every one of you toward one another grows ever greater .

NASB	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	This is [ c ] a ( L ) plain indication of God ’ s righteous judgment so that you will be ( M ) considered worthy of the kingdom of God , for which you indeed are suffering .
NASB	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	[ d ] For after all ( N ) it is only right [ e ] for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you ,
NASB	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	and to give relief to you who are afflicted , along with us , [ f ] ( O ) when the Lord Jesus will be revealed ( P ) from heaven ( Q ) with [ g ] His mighty angels

NASB	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	who opposes and exalts himself above [ e ] ( M ) every so-called god or object of worship , so that he takes his seat in the temple of God , ( N ) displaying himself as being God .
NASB	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Do you not remember that ( O ) while I was still with you , I was telling you these things ?
NASB	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And you know ( P ) what restrains him now , so that he will be revealed in his time .
NASB	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For ( Q ) the mystery of lawlessness is already at work ; only [ f ] ( R ) He who now restrains will do so until [ g ] He is [ h ] removed .
NASB	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	Then that lawless one ( S ) will be revealed , whom the Lord will eliminate ( T ) with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the ( U ) appearance of His [ i ] coming ;

NASB	1%20Timothy	2	10	but rather by means of good works , as is proper for women making a claim to godliness .
NASB	1%20Timothy	2	11	( V ) A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness .
NASB	1%20Timothy	2	12	( W ) But I do not allow a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man , but to remain quiet .
NASB	1%20Timothy	2	13	( X ) For it was Adam who was first [ h ] created , and then Eve .

NASB	1%20Timothy	5	5	Now she who is actually a ( G ) widow and has been left alone ( H ) has set her hope on God , and she continues in ( I ) requests and prayers night and day .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	2	to the older women as mothers , and to the younger women as sisters , in all purity .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	3	Honor widows who are actually ( D ) widows ;
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	4	but if any widow has children or grandchildren , ( E ) they must first learn to show proper respect for their own family and to give back compensation to their parents ; for this is ( F ) acceptable in the sight of God .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	6	But she who ( J ) indulges herself in luxury is ( K ) dead , even while she lives .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	7	[ a ] ( L ) Give these instructions as well , so that they may be above reproach .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	8	But if anyone does not provide for his own , and especially for those of his household , he has ( M ) denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	9	A widow is to be ( N ) put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old , having been ( O ) the wife of one man ,
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	10	having a reputation for ( P ) good works ; and if she has brought up children , if she has ( Q ) shown hospitality to strangers , if she ( R ) has washed the [ b ] saints ’ feet , if she has ( S ) assisted those in distress , and if she has devoted herself to every good work .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	11	But refuse to register younger widows , for when they feel ( T ) physical desires alienating them from Christ , they want to get married ,
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	12	thereby incurring condemnation , because they have [ c ] ignored their previous pledge .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	13	At the same time they also learn to be idle , as they go around from house to house ; and not merely idle , but also they become ( U ) gossips and ( V ) busybodies , talking about ( W ) things not proper to mention .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	14	Therefore , I want younger widows to get ( X ) married , have children , ( Y ) manage their households , and ( Z ) give the enemy no opportunity for reproach ;
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	15	for some ( AA ) have already turned away to follow ( AB ) Satan .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any woman who is a believer ( AC ) has dependent widows , she must ( AD ) assist them and the church must not be burdened , so that it may assist those who are actually ( AE ) widows . Concerning Elders
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	17	( AF ) The elders who ( AG ) lead well are to be considered worthy of double honor , especially those who ( AH ) work hard [ d ] at preaching and teaching .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	18	For the Scripture says , “ ( AI ) You shall not muzzle the ox while it is threshing , ” and “ ( AJ ) The laborer is worthy of his wages. ”
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	19	Do not accept an accusation against an ( AK ) elder except on the basis of ( AL ) two or three witnesses .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	20	Those who continue in sin , ( AM ) rebuke in the presence of all , ( AN ) so that the rest also will be fearful of sinning .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	21	( AO ) I solemnly exhort you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of His chosen angels , to maintain these principles without bias , doing nothing in a spirit of partiality .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	22	( AP ) Do not lay hands upon anyone too quickly and [ e ] thereby share ( AQ ) responsibility for the sins of others ; keep yourself [ f ] free from sin .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	23	Do not go on drinking only water , but ( AR ) use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments .
NASB	1%20Timothy	5	24	The sins of some people are quite evident , going before them to judgment ; for others , their sins ( AS ) follow after .

NASB	1%20Timothy	6	2	Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are ( C ) brothers or sisters , but must serve them all the more , because those who [ b ] partake of the benefit are believers and beloved . ( D ) Teach and [ c ] preach these principles .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	3	If anyone ( E ) advocates a different doctrine and does not [ d ] agree with ( F ) sound words , those of our Lord Jesus Christ , and with the doctrine ( G ) conforming to godliness ,
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	4	he is ( H ) conceited and understands nothing ; but he [ e ] has a sick craving for ( I ) controversial questions and ( J ) disputes about words , from which come envy , strife , abusive language , evil suspicions ,
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	5	and constant friction between ( K ) people of depraved mind and deprived of the truth , who ( L ) suppose that [ f ] godliness is a means of gain .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	7	For ( P ) we have brought nothing into the world , so we can not take anything out of it , either .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	8	If we ( Q ) have food and [ g ] covering , with these we shall be content .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	9	( R ) But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and ( S ) a trap , and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	10	For ( T ) the love of money is a root of all [ h ] sorts of evil , and some by longing for it have ( U ) wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many [ i ] griefs .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	11	But ( V ) flee from these things , you ( W ) man of God , and pursue righteousness , godliness , ( X ) faith , ( Y ) love , [ j ] perseverance , and gentleness .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	12	( Z ) Fight the good fight of ( AA ) faith ; ( AB ) take hold of the eternal life ( AC ) to which you were called , and for which you made the good ( AD ) confession in the presence of ( AE ) many witnesses .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	13	( AF ) I direct you in the presence of God , who [ k ] gives life to all things , and of ( AG ) Christ Jesus , who testified the ( AH ) good confession ( AI ) before Pontius Pilate ,
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	14	that you keep the commandment without [ l ] fault or reproach until the ( AJ ) appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	15	which He will [ m ] bring about at ( AK ) the proper time—He who is ( AL ) the blessed and ( AM ) only Sovereign , ( AN ) the King of [ n ] kings and ( AO ) Lord of [ o ] lords ,
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	16	( AP ) who alone possesses immortality and ( AQ ) dwells in unapproachable light , ( AR ) whom [ p ] no one has seen or can see . ( AS ) To Him be honor and eternal dominion ! Amen .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	17	Instruct those who are rich in ( AT ) this present world ( AU ) not to be conceited or to ( AV ) set their hope on the uncertainty of riches , but on God , ( AW ) who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	18	Instruct them to do good , to be rich in ( AX ) good [ q ] works , ( AY ) to be generous and ready to share ,
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	19	( AZ ) storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future , so that they may ( BA ) take hold of that which is truly life .
NASB	1%20Timothy	6	20	( BB ) Timothy , protect ( BC ) what has been entrusted to you , avoiding ( BD ) worldly , empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called “ knowledge ” —

NASB	2%20Timothy	1	5	[ e ] For I am mindful of the ( N ) sincere faith within you , which first dwelled in your grandmother Lois and ( O ) your mother Eunice , and I am sure that it is in you as well .
NASB	2%20Timothy	1	6	For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh ( P ) the gift of God which is in you through ( Q ) the laying on of my hands .

NASB	2%20Timothy	1	10	but has ( AE ) now been revealed by the ( AF ) appearing of our Savior ( AG ) Christ Jesus , who ( AH ) abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	1	11	( AI ) for which I was appointed a preacher , an apostle , and a teacher .
NASB	2%20Timothy	1	12	For this reason I also suffer these things ; but ( AJ ) I am not ashamed , for I know ( AK ) whom I have believed , and I am convinced that He is able to ( AL ) protect what I have entrusted to Him [ h ] until ( AM ) that day .
NASB	2%20Timothy	1	13	( AN ) Hold on to the ( AO ) example of ( AP ) sound words ( AQ ) which you have heard from me , in the ( AR ) faith and love which are in ( AS ) Christ Jesus .

NASB	2%20Timothy	2	3	( I ) Suffer hardship with me , as a good ( J ) soldier of ( K ) Christ Jesus .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	4	No soldier in active service ( L ) entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life , so that he may please the one who enlisted him .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	5	And if someone likewise ( M ) competes as an athlete , he is not [ c ] crowned as victor unless he competes according to the rules .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	6	( N ) The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	7	Consider what I say , for the Lord will give you understanding in everything .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ , ( O ) risen from the dead , ( P ) descendant of David , ( Q ) according to my gospel ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	9	[ d ] for which I ( R ) suffer hardship even to ( S ) imprisonment as a ( T ) criminal ; but ( U ) the word of God ( V ) is not imprisoned .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	10	For this reason ( W ) I endure all things for ( X ) the sake of [ e ] those who are chosen , ( Y ) so that they also may obtain the ( Z ) salvation which is in ( AA ) Christ Jesus and with it ( AB ) eternal glory .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	11	( AC ) The statement is trustworthy : For ( AD ) if we died with Him , we will also live with Him ;
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we endure , ( AE ) we will also reign with Him ; If we [ f ] ( AF ) deny Him , He will also deny us ;
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we are faithless , ( AG ) He remains faithful , for ( AH ) He can not deny Himself . An Unashamed Worker
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	14	Remind them of these things , and solemnly ( AI ) exhort them in the presence of God not to ( AJ ) dispute about words , which is useless and leads to the ruin of the listeners .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	15	Be diligent to ( AK ) present yourself approved to God as a worker who [ g ] does not need to be ashamed , accurately handling ( AL ) the word of truth .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	16	But ( AM ) avoid ( AN ) worldly and empty chatter , for [ h ] it will lead to further ungodliness ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	17	and their [ i ] talk will spread like [ j ] gangrene . Among them are ( AO ) Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	18	men who have gone astray from the truth , claiming that ( AP ) the resurrection has already taken place ; and they are jeopardizing ( AQ ) the faith of some .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	19	Nevertheless , the ( AR ) firm foundation of God stands , having this ( AS ) seal : “ ( AT ) The Lord knows those who are His ; ” and , “ ( AU ) Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to keep away from wickedness. ”
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	20	Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver implements , but also implements of wood and of earthenware , and ( AV ) some are for honor while others are for dishonor .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	21	Therefore , if anyone cleanses himself from ( AW ) these things , he will be an implement for honor , sanctified , useful to the Master , ( AX ) prepared for every good work .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	22	Now ( AY ) flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness , ( AZ ) faith , love , and peace with those who ( BA ) call on the Lord ( BB ) from a pure heart .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	23	But refuse foolish and ignorant ( BC ) speculations , knowing that they ( BD ) produce [ k ] quarrels .
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	24	( BE ) The Lord ’ s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome , but be kind to all , ( BF ) skillful in teaching , patient when wronged ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	2	25	( BG ) with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition , ( BH ) if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to ( BI ) the knowledge of the truth ,

NASB	2%20Timothy	3	3	( J ) unloving , irreconcilable , ( K ) malicious gossips , without self-control , brutal , [ a ] ( L ) haters of good ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	4	( M ) treacherous , ( N ) reckless , ( O ) conceited , ( P ) lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	5	holding to a form of [ b ] ( Q ) godliness although they have ( R ) denied its power ; ( S ) avoid such people as these .
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	6	For among them are those who [ c ] ( T ) slip into households and captivate [ d ] ( U ) weak women weighed down with sins , led on by ( V ) various impulses ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	7	always learning and never able to ( W ) come to the [ e ] knowledge of the truth .
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	8	Just as ( X ) Jannes and Jambres ( Y ) opposed Moses , so these men also oppose the truth , ( Z ) men of depraved mind , [ f ] worthless in regard to the faith .
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they will not make further progress ; for their ( AA ) foolishness will be obvious to all , just ( AB ) as was that also of [ g ] Jannes and Jambres .
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	10	Now you ( AC ) followed my teaching , conduct , purpose , faith , patience , ( AD ) love , [ h ] perseverance ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	11	( AE ) persecutions , and ( AF ) sufferings , such as happened to me at ( AG ) Antioch , at ( AH ) Iconium , and at ( AI ) Lystra ; what ( AJ ) persecutions I endured , and out of them all ( AK ) the Lord rescued me !
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	12	Indeed , all who want to live in a godly way in Christ Jesus ( AL ) will be persecuted .
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	13	But evil people and impostors ( AM ) will proceed from bad to worse , ( AN ) deceiving and being deceived .
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	14	You , however , ( AO ) continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of , knowing from whom you have learned them ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	15	and that ( AP ) from childhood you have known ( AQ ) the sacred writings which are able to ( AR ) give you the wisdom that leads to ( AS ) salvation through faith which is in ( AT ) Christ Jesus .
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	16	( AU ) All Scripture is [ i ] inspired by God and beneficial for teaching , for [ j ] rebuke , for correction , for training in righteousness ;
NASB	2%20Timothy	3	17	so that ( AV ) the man or woman of God may be [ k ] fully capable , ( AW ) equipped for every good work . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Timothy	4	4	and they ( I ) will turn their ears away from the truth and ( J ) will turn aside to myths .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	3	For ( G ) the time will come when they will not tolerate ( H ) sound doctrine ; but wanting to have their ears tickled , they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires ,
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	5	But as for you , ( K ) use self-restraint in all things , ( L ) endure hardship , do the work of an ( M ) evangelist , fulfill your ( N ) ministry .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	6	For I am already being ( O ) poured out as a drink offering , and the time of ( P ) my departure has come .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	7	( Q ) I have fought the good fight , I have finished ( R ) the course , I have kept ( S ) the faith ;
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	8	in the future there ( T ) is reserved for me ( U ) the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will award to me on ( V ) that day ; and not only to me , but also to ( W ) all who have loved His ( X ) appearing . Personal Concerns
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	9	( Y ) Make every effort to come to me soon ;
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	10	for ( Z ) Demas , having loved ( AA ) this present [ d ] world , has deserted me and gone to ( AB ) Thessalonica ; Crescens has gone to [ e ] ( AC ) Galatia , ( AD ) Titus to Dalmatia .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	11	( AE ) Only ( AF ) Luke is with me . Take along ( AG ) Mark and bring him with you , ( AH ) for he is useful to me for service .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	12	But I have sent ( AI ) Tychicus to ( AJ ) Ephesus .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	13	When you come , bring the overcoat which I left at ( AK ) Troas with Carpus , and the books , especially the parchments .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	14	( AL ) Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm ; ( AM ) the Lord will repay him according to his deeds .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	15	Be on guard against him yourself too , for he vigorously opposed our [ f ] teaching .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	16	At my first defense no one supported me , but all deserted me ; ( AN ) may it not be counted against them .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	17	But the Lord stood with me and ( AO ) strengthened me , so that through me ( AP ) the proclamation might [ g ] be ( AQ ) fully accomplished , and that all ( AR ) the Gentiles might hear ; and I was ( AS ) rescued out of ( AT ) the lion ’ s mouth .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed , and will [ h ] ( AU ) bring me safely to His ( AV ) heavenly kingdom ; ( AW ) to [ i ] Him be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	19	Greet Prisca and ( AX ) Aquila , and ( AY ) the household of Onesiphorus .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	20	( AZ ) Erastus remained at ( BA ) Corinth , but I left ( BB ) Trophimus sick at ( BC ) Miletus .
NASB	2%20Timothy	4	21	( BD ) Make every effort to come before ( BE ) winter . Eubulus greets you , also Pudens , Linus , Claudia , and all the brothers and sisters .

NASB	Titus	1	1	Paul , ( A ) a bond-servant of God and an ( B ) apostle of Jesus Christ , [ a ] for the faith of those ( C ) chosen of God and ( D ) the knowledge of the truth which is ( E ) according to godliness ,
NASB	Titus	1	2	in ( F ) the hope of eternal life , which God , ( G ) who can not lie , ( H ) promised [ b ] ( I ) long ages ago ,
NASB	Titus	1	3	but ( J ) at the proper time revealed His word in ( K ) the proclamation ( L ) with which I was entrusted ( M ) according to the commandment of ( N ) God our Savior ;
NASB	Titus	1	4	To ( O ) Titus , ( P ) my true [ c ] son [ d ] in a ( Q ) common faith : ( R ) Grace and peace from God the Father and ( S ) Christ Jesus our Savior . Qualifications of Elders
NASB	Titus	1	5	For this reason I left you in ( T ) Crete , that you would set in order what remains and ( U ) appoint ( V ) elders in every city as I directed you ,
NASB	Titus	1	6	namely , ( W ) if any man is beyond reproach , the ( X ) husband of one wife , having children who believe , not accused of ( Y ) indecent behavior or ( Z ) rebellion .
NASB	Titus	1	7	For the [ e ] ( AA ) overseer must be beyond reproach as ( AB ) God ’ s steward , not ( AC ) self-willed , not quick-tempered , not ( AD ) overindulging in wine , not [ f ] a bully , ( AE ) not greedy for money ,
NASB	Titus	1	8	but ( AF ) hospitable , ( AG ) loving what is good , self-controlled , righteous , holy , disciplined ,
NASB	Titus	1	9	( AH ) holding firmly the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching , so that he will be able both to [ g ] exhort in ( AI ) sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it .
NASB	Titus	1	10	( AJ ) For there are many ( AK ) rebellious people , ( AL ) empty talkers and deceivers , especially ( AM ) those of the circumcision ,
NASB	Titus	1	11	who must be silenced because they are upsetting ( AN ) whole families , teaching ( AO ) things they should not teach ( AP ) for the sake of [ h ] dishonest gain .
NASB	Titus	1	12	One of them , a prophet of their own , said , “ ( AQ ) Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , lazy gluttons. ”
NASB	Titus	1	13	This testimony is true . For this reason ( AR ) reprimand them ( AS ) severely so that they may be ( AT ) sound in the faith ,
NASB	Titus	1	14	not paying attention to Jewish ( AU ) myths and ( AV ) commandments of men who ( AW ) turn away from the truth .
NASB	Titus	1	15	( AX ) To the pure , all things are pure ; but ( AY ) to those who are defiled and unbelieving , nothing is pure , but both their ( AZ ) mind and their conscience are defiled .
NASB	Titus	1	16	( BA ) They profess to know God , but by their deeds they ( BB ) deny Him , being ( BC ) detestable and ( BD ) disobedient and ( BE ) worthless ( BF ) for any good deed . New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Titus	2	2	( B ) Older men are to be [ a ] ( C ) temperate , dignified , self-controlled , ( D ) sound ( E ) in faith , in love , in [ b ] perseverance .
NASB	Titus	2	3	Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior , ( F ) not malicious gossips nor ( G ) enslaved to much wine , teaching what is good ,
NASB	Titus	2	4	so that they may [ c ] encourage the young women to love their husbands , to love their children ,
NASB	Titus	2	5	to be sensible , pure , ( H ) workers at home , kind , being ( I ) subject to their own husbands , ( J ) so that the word of God will not be dishonored .
NASB	Titus	2	6	Likewise urge ( K ) the young men to be [ d ] sensible ;
NASB	Titus	2	7	in all things show yourself to be ( L ) an example of good deeds , with [ e ] purity in doctrine , dignified ,
NASB	Titus	2	8	sound in speech which is beyond reproach , ( M ) so that the opponent will be put to shame , having nothing bad to say about us .
NASB	Titus	2	9	Urge [ f ] ( N ) slaves to be subject to their own masters in everything , to be pleasing , not [ g ] argumentative ,
NASB	Titus	2	10	not stealing , but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of ( O ) God our Savior in every respect .
NASB	Titus	2	11	For the grace of God has ( P ) appeared , [ h ] ( Q ) bringing salvation to all people ,
NASB	Titus	2	12	[ i ] instructing us to deny ungodliness and ( R ) worldly desires and ( S ) to live sensibly , righteously , and in a godly manner ( T ) in the present age ,
NASB	Titus	2	13	looking for the blessed hope and the ( U ) appearing of the glory of [ j ] ( V ) our great God and Savior , Christ Jesus ,
NASB	Titus	2	14	who ( W ) gave Himself for us ( X ) to redeem us from every lawless deed , and to ( Y ) purify for Himself a ( Z ) people for His own possession , ( AA ) eager for good deeds .
NASB	Titus	2	15	These things speak and ( AB ) [ k ] exhort , and ( AC ) rebuke with all authority . ( AD ) No one is to disregard you .

NASB	Titus	3	3	( G ) For we too were once foolish , ( H ) disobedient , ( I ) deceived , ( J ) enslaved to ( K ) various lusts and pleasures , spending our life in ( L ) malice and ( M ) envy , hateful , hating one another .
NASB	Titus	3	2	to slander no one , ( D ) not to be contentious , to be ( E ) gentle , ( F ) showing every consideration for all people .
NASB	Titus	3	4	But when the ( N ) kindness of ( O ) God our Savior and His love for mankind ( P ) appeared ,
NASB	Titus	3	5	( Q ) He saved us , ( R ) not on the basis of deeds which we did in righteousness , but ( S ) in accordance with His mercy , by the ( T ) washing of regeneration and ( U ) renewing by the Holy Spirit ,
NASB	Titus	3	6	( V ) whom He ( W ) richly poured out upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
NASB	Titus	3	7	so that being justified by His grace we would be made ( X ) heirs [ a ] according to the hope of eternal life .
NASB	Titus	3	8	( Y ) This statement is trustworthy ; and concerning these things I ( Z ) want you to speak confidently , so that those who have ( AA ) believed God will be careful to ( AB ) engage in good deeds . These things are good and beneficial for people .
NASB	Titus	3	9	But ( AC ) avoid ( AD ) foolish controversies and ( AE ) genealogies and strife and ( AF ) disputes about the Law , for they are ( AG ) useless and worthless .
NASB	Titus	3	10	( AH ) Reject a [ b ] ( AI ) divisive person ( AJ ) after a first and second warning ,
NASB	Titus	3	11	knowing that such a person has ( AK ) deviated from what is right and is sinning , being self-condemned . Personal Concerns
NASB	Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas or ( AL ) Tychicus to you , ( AM ) make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis , for I have decided to ( AN ) spend the winter there .
NASB	Titus	3	13	Diligently help Zenas the ( AO ) lawyer and ( AP ) Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them .
NASB	Titus	3	14	( AQ ) Our people must also learn to ( AR ) engage in good [ c ] deeds to meet ( AS ) pressing needs , so that they will not be ( AT ) unproductive .
NASB	Titus	3	15	( AU ) All who are with me greet you . Greet those who love us ( AV ) in the faith . ( AW ) Grace be with you all . Footnotes - Titus 3:7 Or of eternal life according to hope - Titus 3:10 Or factious - Titus 3:14 Or occupations New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©

NASB	Philemon	1	6	and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective [ d ] through the ( M ) knowledge of every good thing which is in you [ e ] for the sake of Christ .
NASB	Philemon	1	7	For I have had great ( N ) joy and comfort in your love , because the [ f ] hearts of the [ g ] saints have been ( O ) refreshed through you , brother .
NASB	Philemon	1	8	Therefore , ( P ) though I have [ h ] enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is ( Q ) proper ,
NASB	Philemon	1	9	yet for love ’ s sake I rather ( R ) appeal to you—since I am such a person as Paul , [ i ] an ( S ) old man , and now also ( T ) a prisoner of ( U ) Christ Jesus— Plea for Onesimus , a Free Man
NASB	Philemon	1	10	I ( V ) appeal to you for my ( W ) [ j ] son [ k ] ( X ) Onesimus , whom I [ l ] fathered in my [ m ] imprisonment ,
NASB	Philemon	1	11	who previously was useless to you , but now is useful both to you and to me .
NASB	Philemon	1	12	I have sent him back to you in person , that is , sending my very heart ,
NASB	Philemon	1	13	whom I wanted to keep with me , so that in your behalf he might be at my service in my [ n ] ( Y ) imprisonment for the gospel ;
NASB	Philemon	1	14	but I did not want to do anything without your consent , so that your goodness would ( Z ) not be , in effect , by compulsion , but of your own free will .
NASB	Philemon	1	15	For perhaps it was ( AA ) for this reason that he was separated from you for a while , that you would have him back forever ,
NASB	Philemon	1	16	( AB ) no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , ( AC ) a beloved brother , especially to me , but how much more to you , both ( AD ) in the flesh and in the Lord .
NASB	Philemon	1	17	If then you regard me as a ( AE ) partner , accept him as you would me .
NASB	Philemon	1	18	But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything , charge that to my account ;
NASB	Philemon	1	19	( AF ) I , Paul , have written this with my own hand , I will repay it ( ( AG ) not to [ o ] mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well ) .
NASB	Philemon	1	20	Yes , brother , let me benefit from you in the Lord ; ( AH ) refresh my heart in Christ .
NASB	Philemon	1	21	( AI ) Having confidence in your obedience , I write to you , since I know that you will do even more than what I say .
NASB	Philemon	1	22	At the same time also prepare me a ( AJ ) guest room , for ( AK ) I hope that through ( AL ) your prayers ( AM ) I will be given to you .
NASB	Philemon	1	23	( AN ) Epaphras , my ( AO ) fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , greets you ,

NASB	Hebrews	1	1	God , after He ( A ) spoke long ago to the fathers in ( B ) the prophets in many portions and ( C ) in many ways ,
NASB	Hebrews	1	2	[ a ] ( D ) in these last days ( E ) has spoken to us [ b ] in His ( F ) Son , whom He appointed ( G ) heir of all things , ( H ) through whom He also made the [ c ] ( I ) world .
NASB	Hebrews	1	3	[ d ] And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact ( J ) representation of His nature , and [ e ] ( K ) upholds all things by [ f ] the word of His power . When He had made ( L ) purification of sins , He ( M ) sat down at the right hand of the ( N ) Majesty on high ,
NASB	Hebrews	1	4	having become so much better than the angels , to the extent that He has inherited a more excellent ( O ) name than they .
NASB	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did He ever say , “ ( P ) You are My Son , Today I have fathered You ” ? And again , “ ( Q ) I will be a Father to Him And He will be a Son to Me ” ?
NASB	Hebrews	1	6	And [ g ] when He again ( R ) brings the firstborn into [ h ] ( S ) the world , He says , “ ( T ) And let all the angels of God worship Him. ”
NASB	Hebrews	1	7	And regarding the angels He says , “ ( U ) He makes His angels winds , And His ministers a flame of fire. ”
NASB	Hebrews	1	8	But regarding the Son He says , “ ( V ) Your throne , God , is forever and ever , And the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of [ i ] His kingdom .
NASB	Hebrews	1	9	( W ) You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness ; ( X ) Therefore God , Your God , has ( Y ) anointed You With the oil of joy above Your companions. ”
NASB	Hebrews	1	10	And , “ ( Z ) You , Lord , in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth , And the heavens are the works of Your hands ;
NASB	Hebrews	1	11	( AA ) They will perish , but You remain ; ( AB ) And they all will [ j ] wear out like a garment ,
NASB	Hebrews	1	12	( AC ) And like a robe You will roll them up ; Like a garment they will also be changed . But You are ( AD ) the same , And Your years will not come to an end. ”
NASB	Hebrews	1	13	But to which of the angels has He ever said ,
NASB	Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ( AG ) ministering spirits , sent out to provide service for the sake of those who will ( AH ) inherit ( AI ) salvation ?

NASB	Hebrews	2	2	For if the word ( B ) spoken through ( C ) angels proved [ b ] unalterable , and ( D ) every violation and act of disobedience received a just [ c ] ( E ) punishment ,
NASB	Hebrews	2	3	( F ) how will we escape if we neglect so great a ( G ) salvation ? [ d ] After it was at first ( H ) spoken through the Lord , it was ( I ) confirmed to us by those who heard ,
NASB	Hebrews	2	4	God also testifying with them , both by ( J ) signs and wonders , and by ( K ) various [ e ] miracles and by [ f ] ( L ) gifts of the Holy Spirit ( M ) according to His own will . Earth Subject to Man
NASB	Hebrews	2	5	For He did not subject to angels [ g ] ( N ) the world to come , about which we are speaking .
NASB	Hebrews	2	6	But someone has testified ( O ) somewhere , saying , “ ( P ) What is man , that You think of him ? Or a son of man , that You are concerned about him ?
NASB	Hebrews	2	7	( Q ) You have made him [ h ] for a little while lower than angels ; You have crowned him with glory and honor [ i ] ;
NASB	Hebrews	2	8	( R ) You have put everything in subjection under his feet. ” For in subjecting all things to him , He left nothing that is not subject to him . But now ( S ) we do not yet see all things subjected to him . Jesus Briefly Humbled
NASB	Hebrews	2	9	But we do see Him who was ( T ) made [ j ] for a little while lower than the angels , namely , Jesus , ( U ) because of His suffering death ( V ) crowned with glory and honor , so that ( W ) by the grace of God He might ( X ) taste death ( Y ) for everyone .
NASB	Hebrews	2	10	For ( Z ) it was fitting for Him , ( AA ) for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many sons to glory , to ( AB ) perfect the [ k ] ( AC ) originator of their salvation through sufferings .
NASB	Hebrews	2	11	For both He who ( AD ) sanctifies and those who ( AE ) are [ l ] sanctified are all ( AF ) from one Father ; for this reason He is not ashamed to call them ( AG ) brothers and sisters ,
NASB	Hebrews	2	12	saying , “ ( AH ) I will proclaim Your name to My brothers , In the midst of the assembly I will sing Your praise. ”
NASB	Hebrews	2	13	And again , “ ( AI ) I will put My trust in Him. ” And again , “ ( AJ ) Behold , I and the children whom God has given Me. ”
NASB	Hebrews	2	14	Therefore , since the children share in [ m ] ( AK ) flesh and blood , ( AL ) He Himself likewise also partook of the same , so that ( AM ) through death He might destroy ( AN ) the one who has the power of death , that is , the devil ,
NASB	Hebrews	2	15	and free those who through ( AO ) fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives .
NASB	Hebrews	2	16	For clearly He does not [ n ] give help to angels , but He gives help to the [ o ] descendants of Abraham .
NASB	Hebrews	2	17	Therefore , in all things He [ p ] had ( AP ) to be made like His brothers so that He might ( AQ ) become a merciful and faithful ( AR ) high priest in ( AS ) things pertaining to God , to ( AT ) make [ q ] propitiation for the sins of the people .
NASB	Hebrews	2	18	For since He Himself was [ r ] ( AU ) tempted in that which He has suffered , He is able to come to the aid of those who are [ s ] tempted .

NASB	Hebrews	3	3	( G ) For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses , by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house .

NASB	Hebrews	3	6	but Christ was faithful as ( L ) a Son over His house— ( M ) whose house we are , ( N ) if we hold firmly to our ( O ) confidence and the boast of our [ c ] ( P ) hope .
NASB	Hebrews	3	7	Therefore , just as ( Q ) the Holy Spirit says , “ ( R ) Today if you hear His voice ,
NASB	Hebrews	3	8	( S ) Do not harden your hearts as [ d ] when they provoked Me , As on the day of trial in the wilderness ,
NASB	Hebrews	3	9	( T ) Where your fathers put Me to the test , And saw My works for ( U ) forty years .
NASB	Hebrews	3	10	( V ) Therefore I was angry with this generation , And said , ‘ They always go astray in their heart , And they did not know My ways ’ ;
NASB	Hebrews	3	11	( W ) As I swore in My anger , ‘ They certainly shall not enter My rest. ’ ” The Danger of Unbelief
NASB	Hebrews	3	12	( X ) Take care , brothers and sisters , that there will not be in any one of you an evil , unbelieving heart [ e ] that falls away from ( Y ) the living God .
NASB	Hebrews	3	13	But ( Z ) encourage one another every day , as long as it is still called “ today , ” so that none of you will be hardened by the ( AA ) deceitfulness of sin .
NASB	Hebrews	3	14	For we have become partakers of Christ ( AB ) if we keep the beginning of our [ f ] ( AC ) commitment firm until the end ,
NASB	Hebrews	3	15	while it is said ,
NASB	Hebrews	3	16	For who ( AE ) provoked Him when they had heard ? Indeed , ( AF ) did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses ?
NASB	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was He angry for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , ( AG ) whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness ?
NASB	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did He swear ( AH ) that they would not enter His rest , but to those who were ( AI ) disobedient ?
NASB	Hebrews	3	19	And so we see that they were not able to enter because of ( AJ ) unbelief .

NASB	Hebrews	4	4	For He has said ( E ) somewhere concerning the seventh day : “ ( F ) And God ( G ) rested on the seventh day from all His works ” ;
NASB	Hebrews	4	2	For indeed we have had good news preached to us , just as they also did ; but ( B ) the word [ a ] they heard did not benefit them , because [ b ] they were not united with those who listened with faith .
NASB	Hebrews	4	3	For we who have believed enter that rest , just as He has said , “ ( C ) As I swore in My anger , They certainly shall not enter My rest , ” although His works were finished ( D ) from the foundation of the world .
NASB	Hebrews	4	5	and again in this passage , “ ( H ) They certainly shall not enter My rest. ”
NASB	Hebrews	4	6	Therefore , since it remains for some to enter it , and those who previously had good news preached to them failed to enter because of ( I ) disobedience ,
NASB	Hebrews	4	7	He again sets a certain day , “ Today , ” saying [ c ] through David after so long a time just ( J ) as has been said before , “ ( K ) Today if you hear His voice , Do not harden your hearts. ”
NASB	Hebrews	4	8	For ( L ) if [ d ] Joshua had given them rest , He would not have spoken of another day after that .
NASB	Hebrews	4	9	Consequently , there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God .
NASB	Hebrews	4	10	For the one who has entered His rest has himself also ( M ) rested from his works , as ( N ) God did from His .
NASB	Hebrews	4	11	Therefore let ’ s make every effort to enter that rest , so that no one will fall by following the same ( O ) example of ( P ) disobedience .
NASB	Hebrews	4	12	For ( Q ) the word of God is ( R ) living and ( S ) active , and sharper than any two-edged ( T ) sword , even penetrating as far as the division of ( U ) soul and ( V ) spirit , of both joints and marrow , and ( W ) able to [ e ] judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart .
NASB	Hebrews	4	13	And ( X ) there is no creature hidden from His sight , but all things are ( Y ) open and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom [ f ] we must answer .
NASB	Hebrews	4	14	Therefore , since we have a great ( Z ) high priest who has ( AA ) passed through the heavens , Jesus ( AB ) the Son of God , let ’ s hold firmly to our ( AC ) confession .
NASB	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have ( AD ) a high priest who can not sympathize with our weaknesses , but One who has been ( AE ) tempted in all things just as we are , yet ( AF ) without sin .
NASB	Hebrews	4	16	Therefore let ’ s ( AG ) approach the throne of grace with ( AH ) confidence , so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help at the time of our need .

NASB	Hebrews	5	5	So too Christ ( M ) did not glorify Himself in becoming a ( N ) high priest , but it was He who ( O ) said to Him , “ ( P ) You are My Son , Today I have fathered You ” ;
NASB	Hebrews	5	2	[ a ] ( E ) he can deal gently with the ( F ) ignorant and ( G ) misguided , since he himself also is [ b ] ( H ) clothed in weakness ;
NASB	Hebrews	5	3	and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices ( I ) for sins for himself , ( J ) as well as for the people .
NASB	Hebrews	5	4	And ( K ) no one takes the honor for himself , but receives it when he is called by God , just ( L ) as Aaron also was .
NASB	Hebrews	5	6	just as He also says in another passage ,
NASB	Hebrews	5	7	In the days of [ c ] His humanity , [ d ] ( S ) He offered up both prayers and pleas with ( T ) loud crying and tears to the One ( U ) able to save Him [ e ] from death , and He [ f ] was heard because of His ( V ) devout behavior .
NASB	Hebrews	5	8	Although He was ( W ) a Son , He learned ( X ) obedience from the things which He suffered .
NASB	Hebrews	5	9	And having been ( Y ) perfected , He became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey Him ,
NASB	Hebrews	5	10	being designated by God as ( Z ) High Priest according to ( AA ) the order of Melchizedek .
NASB	Hebrews	5	11	Concerning [ g ] him we have much to say , and it is difficult to explain , since you have become [ h ] poor listeners .
NASB	Hebrews	5	12	For though [ i ] by this time you ought to be teachers , you have need again for someone to teach you ( AB ) the [ j ] ( AC ) elementary principles of the ( AD ) actual words of God , and you have come to need ( AE ) milk and not solid food .
NASB	Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who partakes only of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness , for he is an ( AF ) infant .
NASB	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for ( AG ) the mature , who because of practice have their senses ( AH ) trained to ( AI ) distinguish between good and evil .

NASB	Hebrews	6	9	But , ( U ) beloved , we are convinced of better things regarding you , and things that [ j ] accompany salvation , even though we are speaking in this way .
NASB	Hebrews	6	10	For ( V ) God is not unjust so as to forget ( W ) your work and the love which you have shown toward His name , by having ( X ) served and by still serving the [ k ] saints .
NASB	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that each one of you demonstrate the same diligence [ l ] so as to realize the ( Y ) full assurance of ( Z ) hope until the end ,
NASB	Hebrews	6	12	so that you will not be sluggish , but ( AA ) imitators of those who through ( AB ) faith and endurance ( AC ) inherit the promises .
NASB	Hebrews	6	13	For ( AD ) when God made the promise to Abraham , since He could swear an oath by no one greater , He ( AE ) swore by Himself ,
NASB	Hebrews	6	14	saying , “ ( AF ) indeed I will greatly bless you and I will greatly multiply you. ”
NASB	Hebrews	6	15	And so , ( AG ) having patiently waited , he obtained the promise .
NASB	Hebrews	6	16	( AH ) For people swear an oath by [ m ] one greater than themselves , and with them ( AI ) an oath serving as confirmation is an end of every dispute .
NASB	Hebrews	6	17	[ n ] In the same way God , desiring even more to demonstrate to ( AJ ) the heirs of the promise [ o ] ( AK ) the fact that His purpose is unchangeable , [ p ] confirmed it with an oath ,
NASB	Hebrews	6	18	so that by two unchangeable things in which ( AL ) it is impossible for God to lie , we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to hold firmly to ( AM ) the hope set before us .

NASB	Hebrews	7	7	But without any dispute the lesser person is blessed by the greater .
NASB	Hebrews	7	2	to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of all the spoils , was first of all , by the translation of his name , king of righteousness , and then also king of Salem , which is king of peace .
NASB	Hebrews	7	3	Without father , without mother , ( C ) without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like ( D ) the Son of God , he remains a priest perpetually .
NASB	Hebrews	7	4	Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham , the ( E ) patriarch , ( F ) gave a tenth of the choicest spoils .
NASB	Hebrews	7	5	And those indeed of ( G ) the sons of Levi who receive the priest ’ s office have a commandment [ a ] in the Law to collect [ b ] a tenth from the people , that is , from their countrymen , although they [ c ] are descended from Abraham .
NASB	Hebrews	7	6	But the one ( H ) whose genealogy is not traced from them ( I ) collected [ d ] a tenth from Abraham and [ e ] ( J ) blessed the one who ( K ) had the promises .
NASB	Hebrews	7	8	In this case mortal men receive tithes , but in that case one receives them , ( L ) of whom it is witnessed that he lives on .
NASB	Hebrews	7	9	And , so to speak , through Abraham even Levi , who received tithes , has paid tithes ,
NASB	Hebrews	7	10	for he was still in the loins of his [ f ] forefather when Melchizedek met him .
NASB	Hebrews	7	11	( M ) So if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood ( for on the basis of it ( N ) the people received the Law ) , what further need was there for another priest to arise ( O ) according to the order of Melchizedek , and not be designated according to the order of Aaron ?
NASB	Hebrews	7	12	For when the priesthood is changed , of necessity there takes place a change of law also .
NASB	Hebrews	7	13	For ( P ) the one about whom ( Q ) these things are said belongs to another tribe , from which no one has officiated at the altar .
NASB	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord [ g ] was ( R ) descended from Judah , a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests .
NASB	Hebrews	7	15	And this is clearer still , if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek ,
NASB	Hebrews	7	16	who has become a priest not on the basis of a law of [ h ] ( S ) physical requirement , but according to the power of ( T ) an indestructible life .
NASB	Hebrews	7	17	For it is attested of Him , “ ( U ) You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek. ”
NASB	Hebrews	7	18	For , on the one hand , there is the nullification of a former commandment ( V ) because of its weakness and uselessness
NASB	Hebrews	7	19	( for ( W ) the Law made nothing perfect ) ; on the other hand , there is the introduction of a better ( X ) hope , through which we ( Y ) come near to God .
NASB	Hebrews	7	20	And to the extent that it was not without an oath
NASB	Hebrews	7	21	( for they indeed became priests without an oath , but He with an oath through the One who said to Him ,
NASB	Hebrews	7	22	by the same extent Jesus also has become the [ i ] ( AC ) guarantee of ( AD ) a better covenant .
NASB	Hebrews	7	23	[ j ] The former priests , on the one hand , existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing ;
NASB	Hebrews	7	24	[ k ] Jesus , on the other hand , because He continues ( AE ) forever , holds His priesthood permanently .
NASB	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore He is also able to ( AF ) save [ l ] forever those who ( AG ) come to God through Him , since He always lives to ( AH ) make intercession for them .
NASB	Hebrews	7	26	For it was fitting for us to have such a ( AI ) high priest , ( AJ ) holy , ( AK ) innocent , undefiled , separated from sinners , and ( AL ) exalted above the heavens ;
NASB	Hebrews	7	27	who has no daily need , like those high priests , to ( AM ) offer up sacrifices , ( AN ) first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people , because He did this ( AO ) once for all time when He ( AP ) offered up Himself .
NASB	Hebrews	7	28	For the Law appoints men as high priests ( AQ ) who are weak , but the word of the oath , which came after the Law , appoints ( AR ) a Son , who has been ( AS ) made perfect forever .

NASB	Hebrews	8	8	For in finding fault with [ h ] the people , He says , “ ( Q ) Behold , days are coming , says the Lord , [ i ] When I will bring about ( R ) a new covenant With the house of Israel and the house of Judah ,
NASB	Hebrews	8	2	a ( D ) minister [ a ] in the sanctuary and [ b ] in the ( E ) true [ c ] tabernacle , which the Lord ( F ) set up , not man .
NASB	Hebrews	8	3	For every ( G ) high priest is appointed ( H ) to offer both gifts and sacrifices ; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer .
NASB	Hebrews	8	4	Now if He were on earth , He would not be a priest at all , since there are [ d ] those who ( I ) offer the gifts according to the Law ;
NASB	Hebrews	8	5	who serve ( J ) a copy and ( K ) shadow of the heavenly things , just as Moses [ e ] was ( L ) warned by God when he was about to erect the [ f ] tabernacle ; for , “ ( M ) See , ” He says , “ that you make all things by the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain. ”
NASB	Hebrews	8	6	But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry , to the extent that He is also the ( N ) mediator of ( O ) a better covenant , which has been enacted on better promises . A New Covenant
NASB	Hebrews	8	7	For ( P ) if that first covenant had been free of fault , no [ g ] circumstances would have been sought for a second .
NASB	Hebrews	8	9	( S ) Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers On the day I took them by the hand To bring them out of the land of Egypt ; For they did not continue in My covenant , And I did not care about them , says the Lord .
NASB	Hebrews	8	10	( T ) For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel After those days , declares the Lord : [ j ] I will put My laws into their minds , And write them ( U ) on their hearts . And I will be their God , And they shall be My people .

NASB	Hebrews	9	9	which is a symbol for the present time . Accordingly ( Y ) both gifts and sacrifices are offered which ( Z ) can not make the worshiper perfect in conscience ,
NASB	Hebrews	9	2	For ( C ) a [ a ] tabernacle was equipped , the [ b ] outer sanctuary , in which were ( D ) the lampstand , ( E ) the table , and ( F ) the [ c ] sacred bread ; this is called the Holy Place .
NASB	Hebrews	9	3	Behind ( G ) the second veil there was a [ d ] tabernacle which is called the ( H ) Most Holy Place ,
NASB	Hebrews	9	4	having a golden [ e ] ( I ) altar of incense and ( J ) the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold , in which was ( K ) a golden jar holding the manna , ( L ) Aaron ’ s staff which budded , and ( M ) the tablets of the covenant ;
NASB	Hebrews	9	5	and above it were the ( N ) cherubim of glory ( O ) overshadowing the [ f ] atoning cover ; but about these things we can not now speak in detail .
NASB	Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things have been so prepared , the priests ( P ) are continually entering the [ g ] outer [ h ] tabernacle , performing the divine worship ,
NASB	Hebrews	9	7	but into ( Q ) the second , only ( R ) the high priest enters ( S ) once a year , ( T ) not without taking blood which he ( U ) offers for himself and for the [ i ] ( V ) sins of the people committed in ignorance .
NASB	Hebrews	9	8	( W ) The Holy Spirit is signifying this , ( X ) that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the [ j ] outer tabernacle is still standing ,
NASB	Hebrews	9	10	since they relate only to ( AA ) food , ( AB ) drink , and various ( AC ) washings , ( AD ) regulations for the [ k ] body imposed until ( AE ) a time of reformation .
NASB	Hebrews	9	11	But when Christ appeared as a ( AF ) high priest of the ( AG ) good things [ l ] having come , He entered through ( AH ) the greater and more perfect [ m ] tabernacle , ( AI ) not made by hands , that is , ( AJ ) not of this creation ;
NASB	Hebrews	9	12	and not through ( AK ) the blood of goats and calves , but ( AL ) through His own blood , He ( AM ) entered the holy place ( AN ) once for all time , [ n ] having obtained ( AO ) eternal redemption .
NASB	Hebrews	9	13	For if ( AP ) the blood of goats and bulls , and ( AQ ) the [ o ] ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled , sanctify for the [ p ] cleansing of the flesh ,
NASB	Hebrews	9	14	how much more will ( AR ) the blood of Christ , who through [ q ] ( AS ) the eternal Spirit ( AT ) offered Himself without blemish to God , ( AU ) cleanse your conscience from ( AV ) dead works to serve ( AW ) the living God ?
NASB	Hebrews	9	15	For this reason ( AX ) He is the ( AY ) mediator of a ( AZ ) new covenant , so that , since a death has taken place for the redemption of the violations that were committed under the first covenant , those who have been ( BA ) called may ( BB ) receive the promise of ( BC ) the eternal inheritance .
NASB	Hebrews	9	16	For where there is a [ r ] covenant , there must of necessity [ s ] be the death of the one who made it .
NASB	Hebrews	9	17	For a [ t ] covenant is valid only when people are dead , [ u ] for it is never in force while the one who made it lives .
NASB	Hebrews	9	18	Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood .
NASB	Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment had been ( BD ) spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law , ( BE ) he took the ( BF ) blood of the calves and the goats , with ( BG ) water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both ( BH ) the book itself and all the people ,
NASB	Hebrews	9	20	saying , “ ( BI ) This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you. ”
NASB	Hebrews	9	21	And in the same way he ( BJ ) sprinkled both the [ v ] tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood .
NASB	Hebrews	9	22	And ( BK ) almost all things are cleansed with blood , according to the Law , and ( BL ) without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
NASB	Hebrews	9	23	Therefore it was necessary for the ( BM ) copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these things , but ( BN ) the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
NASB	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ ( BO ) did not enter a holy place made by hands , a mere copy of ( BP ) the true one , but into ( BQ ) heaven itself , now ( BR ) to appear in the presence of God for us ;
NASB	Hebrews	9	25	nor was it that He would offer Himself often , as ( BS ) the high priest enters ( BT ) the Holy Place ( BU ) year by year with blood that is not his own .
NASB	Hebrews	9	26	Otherwise , He would have needed to suffer often since ( BV ) the foundation of the world ; but now ( BW ) once at ( BX ) the consummation of the ages He has been ( BY ) revealed to put away sin [ w ] ( BZ ) by the sacrifice of Himself .
NASB	Hebrews	9	27	And just as ( CA ) it is destined for people to die once , and after this ( CB ) comes judgment ,
NASB	Hebrews	9	28	so Christ also , having been ( CC ) offered once to ( CD ) bear the sins of many , will appear ( CE ) a second time for ( CF ) salvation ( CG ) without reference to sin , to those who ( CH ) eagerly await Him .

NASB	Hebrews	10	10	By [ e ] this will , we have been ( S ) sanctified through ( T ) the offering of ( U ) the body of Jesus Christ ( V ) once for all time .
NASB	Hebrews	10	2	Otherwise , would they not have ceased to be offered , because the worshipers , having once been cleansed , would no longer have had ( E ) consciousness of sins ?
NASB	Hebrews	10	3	But ( F ) in [ c ] those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year .
NASB	Hebrews	10	4	For it is ( G ) impossible for the ( H ) blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
NASB	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore , ( I ) when He comes into the world , He says , “ ( J ) You have not desired sacrifice and offering , But ( K ) You have prepared a body for Me ;
NASB	Hebrews	10	6	( L ) You have not taken pleasure in whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin .
NASB	Hebrews	10	7	( M ) Then I said , ‘ Behold , I have come ( It is written of Me in ( N ) the scroll of the book ) To do Your will , O God. ’ ”
NASB	Hebrews	10	8	After saying above , “ ( O ) Sacrifices and offerings and ( P ) whole burnt offerings and offerings ( Q ) for sin You have not desired , nor have You taken pleasure in them ” ( which are offered according to the Law ) ,
NASB	Hebrews	10	9	then He [ d ] said , “ ( R ) Behold , I have come to do Your will. ” He takes away the first in order to establish the second .
NASB	Hebrews	10	11	Every priest stands daily ministering and ( W ) offering time after time the same sacrifices , which ( X ) can never take away sins ;
NASB	Hebrews	10	12	but He , having offered one sacrifice ( Y ) for [ f ] sins ( Z ) for all time , ( AA ) sat down at the right hand of God ,
NASB	Hebrews	10	13	waiting from that time onward ( AB ) until His enemies are made a footstool for His feet .
NASB	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering He has ( AC ) perfected ( AD ) for all time those who are [ g ] sanctified .
NASB	Hebrews	10	15	And ( AE ) the Holy Spirit also testifies to us ; for after saying ,
NASB	Hebrews	10	16	“ ( AF ) This is the covenant which I will make with them After those days , declares the Lord : I will put My laws upon their hearts , And write them on their mind , ” He then says ,
NASB	Hebrews	10	17	“ ( AG ) And their sins and their lawless deeds I will no longer remember. ”
NASB	Hebrews	10	18	Now where there is forgiveness of these things , an offering for sin is no longer required . A New and Living Way
NASB	Hebrews	10	19	Therefore , brothers and sisters , since we ( AH ) have confidence to ( AI ) enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus ,
NASB	Hebrews	10	20	by ( AJ ) a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through ( AK ) the veil , that is , through His flesh ,
NASB	Hebrews	10	21	and since we have ( AL ) a great priest ( AM ) over the house of God ,
NASB	Hebrews	10	22	let ’ s ( AN ) approach God with a [ h ] sincere heart in ( AO ) full assurance of faith , having our hearts ( AP ) sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies ( AQ ) washed with pure water .
NASB	Hebrews	10	23	Let ’ s hold firmly to the ( AR ) confession of our ( AS ) hope without wavering , for ( AT ) He who promised is faithful ;
NASB	Hebrews	10	24	and let ’ s consider how ( AU ) to [ i ] encourage one another in love and ( AV ) good deeds ,
NASB	Hebrews	10	25	not abandoning our own ( AW ) meeting together , as is the habit of some people , but ( AX ) encouraging one another ; and all the more as you see ( AY ) the day drawing near . Christ or Judgment
NASB	Hebrews	10	26	For if we go on ( AZ ) sinning willfully after receiving ( BA ) the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins ,
NASB	Hebrews	10	27	but a terrifying expectation of ( BB ) judgment and ( BC ) the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries .
NASB	Hebrews	10	28	( BD ) Anyone who has ignored the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
NASB	Hebrews	10	29	( BE ) How much more severe punishment do you think he will deserve ( BF ) who has trampled underfoot the Son of God , and has regarded as unclean ( BG ) the blood of the covenant ( BH ) by which he was sanctified , and has ( BI ) insulted the Spirit of grace ?
NASB	Hebrews	10	30	For we know Him who said , “ ( BJ ) Vengeance is Mine , I will repay. ” And again , “ ( BK ) The Lord will judge His people. ”
NASB	Hebrews	10	31	It is a ( BL ) terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the ( BM ) living God .
NASB	Hebrews	10	32	But remember ( BN ) the former days , [ j ] when , after being ( BO ) enlightened , you endured a great ( BP ) conflict of sufferings ,
NASB	Hebrews	10	33	partly by being ( BQ ) made a public spectacle through insults and distress , and partly by becoming [ k ] ( BR ) companions with those who were so treated .
NASB	Hebrews	10	34	For you ( BS ) showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted ( BT ) joyfully the seizure of your property , knowing that you have for yourselves ( BU ) a better and lasting possession .
NASB	Hebrews	10	35	Therefore , do not throw away your ( BV ) confidence , which has a great ( BW ) reward .
NASB	Hebrews	10	36	For you have need of ( BX ) endurance , so that when you have ( BY ) done the will of God , you may ( BZ ) receive [ l ] what was promised .
NASB	Hebrews	10	37	( CA ) For yet in a very little while , ( CB ) He who is coming will come , and will not delay .
NASB	Hebrews	10	38	( CC ) But My righteous one will live by faith ; And if he shrinks back , My soul has no pleasure in him .
NASB	Hebrews	10	39	But [ m ] we are not among those who shrink back to destruction , but of those who have faith for the safekeeping of the soul .

NASB	Hebrews	11	11	By faith even ( AD ) Sarah herself received [ i ] ability to conceive , even beyond the proper time of life , since she considered Him ( AE ) faithful who had promised .
NASB	Hebrews	11	2	For by it the ( D ) people of old [ c ] ( E ) gained approval .
NASB	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the [ d ] ( F ) world has been created ( G ) by the word of God so that what is seen ( H ) has not been made out of things that are visible .
NASB	Hebrews	11	4	By faith ( I ) Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain , through which he was ( J ) attested to be righteous , God testifying [ e ] about his ( K ) gifts , and through [ f ] faith , though ( L ) he is dead , he still speaks .
NASB	Hebrews	11	5	By faith ( M ) Enoch was taken up so that he would not ( N ) see death ; and he was not found because God took him up ; for before he was taken up , he was attested to have been pleasing to God .
NASB	Hebrews	11	6	And without faith it is impossible to please Him , for the one who ( O ) comes to God must believe that He exists , and that He proves to be One who rewards those who seek Him .
NASB	Hebrews	11	7	By faith ( P ) Noah , being ( Q ) warned by God about ( R ) things not yet seen , [ g ] ( S ) in reverence ( T ) prepared an ark for the salvation of his household , by which he condemned the world , and became an heir of ( U ) the righteousness which is according to faith .
NASB	Hebrews	11	8	By faith ( V ) Abraham , when he was called , obeyed [ h ] by going out to a place which he was to ( W ) receive for an inheritance ; and he left , not knowing where he was going .
NASB	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he lived as a stranger in ( X ) the land of promise , as in a foreign land , ( Y ) living in tents with Isaac and Jacob , ( Z ) fellow heirs of the same promise ;
NASB	Hebrews	11	10	for he was looking for ( AA ) the city which has ( AB ) foundations , ( AC ) whose architect and builder is God .
NASB	Hebrews	11	12	Therefore even from one man , and ( AF ) one who was as good as dead [ j ] at that , there were born descendants who were ( AG ) just as the stars of heaven in number , and as the innumerable grains of sand along the seashore .
NASB	Hebrews	11	13	( AH ) All these died in faith , ( AI ) without receiving the promises , but ( AJ ) having seen and welcomed them from a distance , and ( AK ) having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth .
NASB	Hebrews	11	14	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own .
NASB	Hebrews	11	15	And indeed if they had been [ k ] thinking of that country which they left , ( AL ) they would have had opportunity to return .
NASB	Hebrews	11	16	But as it is , they desire a better country , that is , a ( AM ) heavenly one . Therefore ( AN ) God is not [ l ] ashamed to be ( AO ) called their God ; for ( AP ) He has prepared a city for them .
NASB	Hebrews	11	17	By faith ( AQ ) Abraham , when he was tested , offered up Isaac , and the one who had ( AR ) received the promises was offering up his [ m ] only son ;
NASB	Hebrews	11	18	it was he to whom it was said , “ ( AS ) Through Isaac your [ n ] descendants shall be named. ”
NASB	Hebrews	11	19	[ o ] He considered that ( AT ) God is able to raise people even from the dead , from which he also received him back [ p ] as a [ q ] ( AU ) type .
NASB	Hebrews	11	20	By faith ( AV ) Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , even regarding things to come .

NASB	Hebrews	11	22	By faith ( AY ) Joseph , when he was dying , made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel , and gave orders concerning his bones .
NASB	Hebrews	11	23	By faith ( AZ ) Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw he was a beautiful child ; and they were not afraid of the ( BA ) king ’ s edict .
NASB	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , ( BB ) when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter ,
NASB	Hebrews	11	25	choosing rather to ( BC ) endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin ,
NASB	Hebrews	11	26	( BD ) considering the [ r ] reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt ; for he was looking to the ( BE ) reward .
NASB	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he ( BF ) left Egypt , not ( BG ) fearing the wrath of the king ; for he persevered , as though ( BH ) seeing Him who is unseen .
NASB	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he [ s ] ( BI ) kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood , so that ( BJ ) the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them .
NASB	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they ( BK ) passed through the Red Sea as through dry land ; and the Egyptians , when they attempted it , were [ t ] drowned .
NASB	Hebrews	11	30	By faith ( BL ) the walls of Jericho fell down [ u ] ( BM ) after the Israelites had marched around them for seven days .
NASB	Hebrews	11	31	By faith the prostitute ( BN ) Rahab did not perish along with those who were disobedient , after she had welcomed the spies [ v ] in peace .
NASB	Hebrews	11	32	And what more shall I say ? For time will fail me if I tell of ( BO ) Gideon , ( BP ) Barak , ( BQ ) Samson , ( BR ) Jephthah , of ( BS ) David and ( BT ) Samuel and the prophets ,
NASB	Hebrews	11	33	who by faith ( BU ) conquered kingdoms , ( BV ) performed acts of righteousness , ( BW ) obtained promises , ( BX ) shut the mouths of lions ,
NASB	Hebrews	11	34	( BY ) quenched the power of fire , ( BZ ) escaped the edge of the sword , from weakness were made strong , ( CA ) became mighty in war , ( CB ) put foreign armies to flight .
NASB	Hebrews	11	35	( CC ) Women received back their dead by resurrection ; and others were tortured , not accepting their [ w ] release , so that they might obtain a better resurrection ;
NASB	Hebrews	11	36	and others [ x ] experienced mocking and flogging , and further , ( CD ) chains and imprisonment .
NASB	Hebrews	11	37	They were ( CE ) stoned , they were sawn in two , [ y ] they were tempted , they were ( CF ) put to death with the sword ; they went about ( CG ) in sheepskins , in goatskins , being destitute , afflicted , ( CH ) tormented
NASB	Hebrews	11	38	( people of whom the world was not worthy ) , ( CI ) wandering in deserts , on mountains , and sheltering in caves and holes [ z ] in the ground .

NASB	Hebrews	12	12	Therefore , [ f ] ( X ) strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble ,
NASB	Hebrews	12	2	looking only at Jesus , the [ a ] ( D ) originator and perfecter of the faith , who for the joy set before Him ( E ) endured the cross , ( F ) despising the shame , and has ( G ) sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
NASB	Hebrews	12	3	For ( H ) consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself , so that you will not grow weary [ b ] ( I ) and lose heart . A Father ’ s Discipline
NASB	Hebrews	12	4	( J ) You have not yet resisted [ c ] ( K ) to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin ;
NASB	Hebrews	12	5	and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons , “ ( L ) My son , do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord , Nor ( M ) faint when you are punished by Him ;
NASB	Hebrews	12	6	( N ) For ( O ) whom the Lord loves He disciplines , And He punishes every son whom He accepts. ”
NASB	Hebrews	12	7	It is for discipline that you endure ; ( P ) God deals with you as with sons ; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline ?
NASB	Hebrews	12	8	But if you are without discipline , ( Q ) of which all have become partakers , then you are illegitimate children and not sons .
NASB	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore , we had [ d ] earthly fathers to discipline us , and we ( R ) respected them ; shall we not much more be subject to ( S ) the Father of [ e ] spirits , and ( T ) live ?
NASB	Hebrews	12	10	For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them , but He disciplines us for our good , ( U ) so that we may share His holiness .
NASB	Hebrews	12	11	( V ) For the moment , all discipline seems not to be pleasant , but painful ; yet to those who have been trained by it , afterward it yields the ( W ) peaceful fruit of righteousness .
NASB	Hebrews	12	13	and ( Y ) make straight paths for your feet , so that the limb which is impaired may not be dislocated , but rather ( Z ) be healed .
NASB	Hebrews	12	14	( AA ) Pursue peace with all people , and the ( AB ) holiness without which no one will ( AC ) see the Lord .
NASB	Hebrews	12	15	See to it that no one ( AD ) comes short of the grace of God ; that no ( AE ) root of bitterness springing up causes trouble , and by it many become ( AF ) defiled ;
NASB	Hebrews	12	16	that there be no ( AG ) sexually immoral or ( AH ) godless person like Esau , ( AI ) who sold his own birthright for a single meal .
NASB	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that even afterward , ( AJ ) when he wanted to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no place for repentance , though he sought for it with tears . Contrast of Sinai and Zion
NASB	Hebrews	12	18	( AK ) For you have not come to ( AL ) a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire , and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind ,
NASB	Hebrews	12	19	and to the ( AM ) blast of a trumpet and the ( AN ) sound of words , which sound was such that those who heard ( AO ) begged that no further word be spoken to them .
NASB	Hebrews	12	20	For they could not [ g ] cope with the command , “ ( AP ) If even an animal touches the mountain , it shall be stoned. ”
NASB	Hebrews	12	21	And so terrible was the sight , that Moses said , “ ( AQ ) I am terrified and trembling. ”
NASB	Hebrews	12	22	But ( AR ) you have come to Mount Zion and to ( AS ) the city of ( AT ) the living God , ( AU ) the heavenly Jerusalem , and to ( AV ) myriads of [ h ] angels ,
NASB	Hebrews	12	23	to the general assembly and ( AW ) church of the firstborn who ( AX ) are enrolled in heaven , and to God , ( AY ) the Judge of all , and to the ( AZ ) spirits of the righteous made perfect ,
NASB	Hebrews	12	24	and to Jesus , the ( BA ) mediator of a new covenant , and to the ( BB ) sprinkled blood , which speaks better than ( BC ) the blood of Abel . The Unshaken Kingdom
NASB	Hebrews	12	25	( BD ) See to it that you do not refuse Him who is ( BE ) speaking . For ( BF ) if those did not escape when they ( BG ) refused him who ( BH ) warned them on earth , [ i ] much less will we escape who turn away from Him who ( BI ) warns us from heaven .
NASB	Hebrews	12	26	And ( BJ ) His voice shook the earth then , but now He has promised , saying , “ ( BK ) Yet once more I will shake not only the earth , but also the heaven. ”
NASB	Hebrews	12	27	This expression , “ Yet once more , ” denotes ( BL ) the removing of those things which can be shaken , as of created things , so that those things which can not be shaken may remain .
NASB	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore , since we receive a ( BM ) kingdom which can not be shaken , let ’ s [ j ] show gratitude , by which we may ( BN ) offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe ;

NASB	Hebrews	13	3	( D ) Remember ( E ) the prisoners , as though in prison with them , and those who are badly treated , since you yourselves also are in the body .
NASB	Hebrews	13	4	( F ) Marriage is to be held in honor among all , and the marriage bed is to be undefiled ; ( G ) for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers .
NASB	Hebrews	13	5	Make sure that your character is ( H ) free from the love of money , ( I ) being content with what you have ; for He Himself has said , “ ( J ) I will never desert you , nor will I ever abandon you , ”
NASB	Hebrews	13	6	so that we confidently say , “ ( K ) The Lord is my helper , I will not be afraid . What will man do to me ? ”
NASB	Hebrews	13	7	Remember ( L ) those who led you , who spoke ( M ) the word of God to you ; and considering the [ a ] result of their way of life , ( N ) imitate their faith .
NASB	Hebrews	13	8	( O ) Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today , and forever .
NASB	Hebrews	13	9	( P ) Do not be misled by varied and strange teachings ; for it is good for the heart to ( Q ) be strengthened by grace , not by ( R ) foods , ( S ) through which those who [ b ] were so occupied were not benefited .
NASB	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar ( T ) from which those ( U ) who serve the [ c ] tabernacle have no right to eat .
NASB	Hebrews	13	11	For ( V ) the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy Place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp .
NASB	Hebrews	13	12	Therefore Jesus also suffered ( W ) outside the gate , ( X ) that He might sanctify the people ( Y ) through His own blood .
NASB	Hebrews	13	14	For here ( AA ) we do not have a lasting city , but we are seeking ( AB ) the city which is to come . God-pleasing Sacrifices
NASB	Hebrews	13	15	( AC ) Through Him then , let ’ s continually offer up a ( AD ) sacrifice of praise to God , that is , ( AE ) the fruit of lips praising His name .
NASB	Hebrews	13	16	And do not neglect doing good and ( AF ) sharing , for ( AG ) with such sacrifices God is pleased .
NASB	Hebrews	13	17	( AH ) Obey your leaders and submit to them—for ( AI ) they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account—so that they may do this with joy , not [ d ] groaning ; for this would be unhelpful for you .
NASB	Hebrews	13	18	( AJ ) Pray for us , for we are sure that we have a ( AK ) good conscience , desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things .
NASB	Hebrews	13	19	And I urge you all the more to do this , ( AL ) so that I may be restored to you more quickly . Benediction
NASB	Hebrews	13	20	Now may ( AM ) the God of peace , who ( AN ) brought up from the dead the ( AO ) great Shepherd of the sheep [ e ] through ( AP ) the blood of the ( AQ ) eternal covenant , that is , Jesus our Lord ,
NASB	Hebrews	13	21	( AR ) equip you in every good thing to do His will , ( AS ) working in us that ( AT ) which is pleasing in His sight , through Jesus Christ , ( AU ) to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
NASB	Hebrews	13	22	But ( AV ) I urge you , ( AW ) brothers and sisters , [ f ] listen patiently to [ g ] this ( AX ) word of exhortation , for ( AY ) I have written to you briefly .
NASB	Hebrews	13	23	Know that ( AZ ) our brother Timothy has been released , with whom , if he comes soon , I will see you .

NASB	James	1	1	[ a ] ( A ) James , a ( B ) bond-servant of God and ( C ) of the Lord Jesus Christ , To ( D ) the twelve tribes who are [ b ] ( E ) dispersed abroad : ( F ) Greetings .
NASB	James	1	2	( G ) Consider it all joy , my brothers and sisters , when you encounter ( H ) various [ c ] trials ,
NASB	James	1	3	knowing that ( I ) the testing of your ( J ) faith produces [ d ] ( K ) endurance .
NASB	James	1	4	And let [ e ] ( L ) endurance have its perfect [ f ] result , so that you may be [ g ] ( M ) perfect and complete , lacking in nothing .
NASB	James	1	5	But if any of you ( N ) lacks wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all generously and [ h ] without reproach , and ( O ) it will be given to him .
NASB	James	1	6	But he must ( P ) ask in faith ( Q ) without any doubting , for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea , ( R ) driven and tossed by the wind .
NASB	James	1	7	For that person ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord ,
NASB	James	1	8	being a ( S ) [ i ] double-minded man , ( T ) unstable in all his ways .
NASB	James	1	9	( U ) Now the brother or sister of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position ;
NASB	James	1	10	but the rich person is to glory in his [ j ] humiliation , because ( V ) like [ k ] flowering grass he will pass away .
NASB	James	1	11	For the sun rises with ( W ) its scorching heat and ( X ) withers the grass ; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed ; so also the rich person , in the midst of his pursuits , will die out .
NASB	James	1	12	( Y ) Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial ; for once he has [ l ] been approved , he will receive ( Z ) the crown of life which the Lord ( AA ) has promised to those who ( AB ) love Him .
NASB	James	1	13	No one is to say when he is tempted , “ ( AC ) I am being tempted [ m ] by God ” ; for God can not be tempted [ n ] by evil , and He Himself does not tempt anyone .
NASB	James	1	14	But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust .
NASB	James	1	15	Then ( AD ) when lust has conceived , it gives birth to sin ; and ( AE ) sin , when it has run its course , brings forth death .
NASB	James	1	16	( AF ) Do not be [ o ] deceived , ( AG ) my beloved brothers and sisters .
NASB	James	1	17	Every good thing given and every perfect gift is ( AH ) from above , coming down from ( AI ) the Father of lights , ( AJ ) with whom there is no variation or [ p ] shifting shadow .
NASB	James	1	18	In the exercise of ( AK ) His will He ( AL ) gave us birth by ( AM ) the word of truth , so that we would be [ q ] a kind of ( AN ) first fruits [ r ] among His creatures .
NASB	James	1	19	[ s ] ( AO ) You know this , ( AP ) my beloved brothers and sisters . Now everyone must be quick to hear , ( AQ ) slow to speak , and ( AR ) slow to anger ;
NASB	James	1	20	for a man ’ s ( AS ) anger does not bring about the righteousness of God .
NASB	James	1	21	Therefore , ( AT ) ridding yourselves of all filthiness and all [ t ] that remains of wickedness , in [ u ] humility receive ( AU ) the word implanted , which is able to save your souls .
NASB	James	1	22	( AV ) But prove yourselves doers of the word , and not just hearers who deceive themselves .
NASB	James	1	23	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man who looks at his [ v ] natural face ( AW ) in a mirror ;
NASB	James	1	24	for once he has looked at himself and gone away , [ w ] he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was .
NASB	James	1	25	But one who has looked intently at the perfect law , ( AX ) the law of freedom , and has continued in it , not having become a forgetful hearer but [ x ] an active doer , this person will be ( AY ) blessed in [ y ] what he does .

NASB	James	2	2	For if a man comes into your [ a ] assembly with a gold ring and is dressed in ( E ) bright clothes , and a poor man in ( F ) dirty clothes also comes in ,
NASB	James	2	3	and you [ b ] pay special attention to the one who is wearing the ( G ) bright clothes , and say , “ You sit here in a good place , ” and you say to the poor man , “ You stand over there , or sit down by my footstool , ”
NASB	James	2	4	have you not made distinctions among yourselves , and become judges ( H ) with evil [ c ] motives ?
NASB	James	2	5	Listen , ( I ) my beloved brothers and sisters : did ( J ) God not choose the poor [ d ] of this world to be ( K ) rich in faith and ( L ) heirs of the kingdom which He ( M ) promised to those who love Him ?
NASB	James	2	6	But you have dishonored the poor man . Is it not the rich who oppress you and [ e ] personally ( N ) drag you into [ f ] court ?
NASB	James	2	7	( O ) Do they not blaspheme the good name [ g ] by which you have been called ?
NASB	James	2	8	If , however , you ( P ) are fulfilling the [ h ] royal law according to the Scripture , “ ( Q ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” you are doing well .
NASB	James	2	9	But if you ( R ) show partiality , you are committing sin and are convicted by the Law as violators .
NASB	James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole Law , yet ( S ) stumbles in one point , has become ( T ) guilty of all .
NASB	James	2	11	For He who said , “ ( U ) Do not commit adultery , ” also said , “ ( V ) Do not murder. ” Now if you do not commit adultery , but do murder , you have become a violator of the Law .
NASB	James	2	12	So speak , and so act , as those who are to be judged by ( W ) the law of freedom .
NASB	James	2	13	For ( X ) judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy ; mercy [ i ] triumphs over judgment . Faith and Works
NASB	James	2	14	( Y ) What use is it , ( Z ) my brothers and sisters , if someone says he has faith , but he has no works ? Can [ j ] that faith save him ?
NASB	James	2	15	( AA ) If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food ,
NASB	James	2	16	and one of you says to them , “ ( AB ) Go in peace , [ k ] be warmed and be filled , ” yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body , what use is that ?
NASB	James	2	17	In the same way , ( AC ) faith also , if it has no works , is [ l ] dead , being by itself .
NASB	James	2	18	( AD ) But someone [ m ] may well say , “ You have faith and I have works ; show me your ( AE ) faith without the works , and I will ( AF ) show you my faith ( AG ) by my works. ”
NASB	James	2	19	You believe that [ n ] ( AH ) God is one . ( AI ) You do well ; ( AJ ) the demons also believe , and shudder .
NASB	James	2	20	But are you willing to acknowledge , ( AK ) you foolish person , that ( AL ) faith without works is useless ?
NASB	James	2	21	( AM ) Was our father Abraham not justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar ?
NASB	James	2	22	You see that ( AN ) faith was working with his works , and [ o ] as a result of the ( AO ) works , faith was [ p ] perfected ;
NASB	James	2	23	and the Scripture was fulfilled which says , “ ( AP ) And Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness , ” and he was called a ( AQ ) friend of God .
NASB	James	2	24	You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone .
NASB	James	2	25	In the same way , was ( AR ) Rahab the prostitute not justified by works also ( AS ) when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way ?
NASB	James	2	26	For just as the body without the spirit is dead , so also ( AT ) faith without works is dead .

NASB	James	3	3	Now ( G ) if we put the bits into the horses ’ mouths so that they will obey us , we direct their whole body as well .
NASB	James	3	2	For we all ( C ) stumble in many ways . ( D ) If anyone does not stumble in [ b ] what he says , he is a ( E ) perfect man , able to [ c ] ( F ) rein in the whole body as well .
NASB	James	3	4	Look at the ships too : though they are so large and are driven by strong winds , they are nevertheless directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot determines .
NASB	James	3	5	So also the tongue is a small part of the body , and yet it ( H ) boasts of great things . ( I ) See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire !
NASB	James	3	6	And ( J ) the tongue is a fire , the very world of unrighteousness ; the tongue is set among [ d ] our body ’ s parts as that which ( K ) defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of our [ e ] life , and is set on fire by [ f ] ( L ) hell .
NASB	James	3	7	For every [ g ] species of beasts and birds , of reptiles and creatures of the sea , is tamed and has been tamed by the human [ h ] race .
NASB	James	3	8	But no one among mankind can tame the tongue ; it is a restless evil , full of ( M ) deadly poison .
NASB	James	3	9	With it we bless ( N ) our Lord and Father , and with it we curse people , ( O ) who have been made in the likeness of God ;
NASB	James	3	10	from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing . My brothers and sisters , these things should not be this way .
NASB	James	3	11	Does a spring send out from the same opening both [ i ] fresh and bitter water ?
NASB	James	3	12	( P ) Can a fig tree , my brothers and sisters , bear olives , or a vine bear figs ? Nor can salt water produce [ j ] fresh . Wisdom from Above
NASB	James	3	13	Who among you is wise and understanding ? ( Q ) Let him show by his ( R ) good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom .
NASB	James	3	14	But if you have bitter ( S ) jealousy and [ k ] selfish ambition in your heart , do not be arrogant and so lie against ( T ) the truth .
NASB	James	3	15	This wisdom is not that which comes down ( U ) from above , but is ( V ) earthly , [ l ] ( W ) natural , ( X ) demonic .
NASB	James	3	16	For where ( Y ) jealousy and [ m ] selfish ambition exist , [ n ] there is disorder and every evil thing .
NASB	James	3	17	But the wisdom ( Z ) from above is first ( AA ) pure , then ( AB ) peace-loving , ( AC ) gentle , [ o ] reasonable , ( AD ) full of mercy and good fruits , [ p ] ( AE ) impartial , free of ( AF ) hypocrisy .
NASB	James	3	18	And the ( AG ) fruit of righteousness is sown in peace [ q ] by those who make peace .

NASB	James	4	4	You ( E ) adulteresses , do you not know that friendship with ( F ) the world is ( G ) hostility toward God ? ( H ) Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
NASB	James	4	2	You lust and do not have , so you ( C ) commit murder . And you are envious and can not obtain , so you fight and quarrel . You do not have because you do not ask .
NASB	James	4	3	You ask and ( D ) do not receive , because you ask [ d ] with the wrong motives , so that you may spend what you request [ e ] on your pleasures .
NASB	James	4	5	Or do you think that the Scripture ( I ) says to no purpose , “ [ f ] He [ g ] jealously desires ( J ) the Spirit whom He has made to dwell in us ” ?
NASB	James	4	6	But ( K ) He gives a greater grace . Therefore it says , “ ( L ) God is opposed to the proud , but gives grace to the humble. ”
NASB	James	4	7	( M ) Submit therefore to God . But [ h ] ( N ) resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
NASB	James	4	8	( O ) Come close to God and He will come close to you . ( P ) Cleanse your hands , you sinners ; and ( Q ) purify your hearts , you ( R ) [ i ] double-minded .
NASB	James	4	9	( S ) Be miserable , and mourn , and weep ; let your laughter be turned into mourning , and your joy into gloom .
NASB	James	4	10	( T ) Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord , and He will exalt you .
NASB	James	4	11	( U ) Do not speak against one another , ( V ) brothers and sisters . The one who speaks against a brother or sister , or ( W ) judges his brother or sister , speaks against ( X ) the law and judges the law ; but if you judge the law , you are not ( Y ) a doer of the law but a judge of it .
NASB	James	4	12	There is only one ( Z ) Lawgiver and Judge , the One who is ( AA ) able to save and to destroy ; but ( AB ) who are you , [ j ] judging your neighbor ?
NASB	James	4	13	( AC ) Come now , you who say , “ ( AD ) Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city , and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit. ”
NASB	James	4	14	[ k ] Yet you do not know [ l ] what your life will be like tomorrow . ( AE ) For you are just a vapor that appears for a little while , and then vanishes away .
NASB	James	4	15	[ m ] Instead , you ought to say , “ ( AF ) If the Lord wills , we will live and also do this or that. ”
NASB	James	4	16	But as it is , you boast in your [ n ] arrogance ; ( AG ) all such boasting is evil .
NASB	James	4	17	So ( AH ) for one who knows the [ o ] right thing to do and does not do it , for him it is sin .

NASB	James	5	5	You have [ c ] ( I ) lived for pleasure on the earth and lived luxuriously ; you have [ d ] fattened your hearts in ( J ) a day of slaughter .
NASB	James	5	2	( D ) Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten .
NASB	James	5	3	Your gold and your silver have corroded , and their corrosion will [ a ] serve as a testimony against you and will consume your flesh like fire . It is ( E ) in the last days that you have stored up your treasure !
NASB	James	5	4	Behold , ( F ) the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields , and which has been withheld by you , cries out against you ; and ( G ) the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of ( H ) the Lord [ b ] of armies .
NASB	James	5	6	You have condemned and [ e ] ( K ) put to death ( L ) the righteous person ; he offers you no resistance . Exhortation
NASB	James	5	7	Therefore be patient , ( M ) brothers and sisters , ( N ) until the coming of the Lord . ( O ) The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil , being patient about it , until [ f ] it gets ( P ) the early and late rains .
NASB	James	5	8	( Q ) You too be patient ; ( R ) strengthen your hearts , for ( S ) the coming of the Lord is ( T ) near .
NASB	James	5	9	( U ) Do not [ g ] complain , ( V ) brothers and sisters , against one another , so that you may not be judged ; behold , ( W ) the Judge is standing [ h ] ( X ) right at the [ i ] door .
NASB	James	5	10	As an example , ( Y ) brothers and sisters , of suffering and patience , take ( Z ) the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
NASB	James	5	11	We count those ( AA ) blessed who endured . You have heard of ( AB ) the [ j ] endurance of Job and have seen ( AC ) the [ k ] outcome of the Lord ’ s dealings , that ( AD ) the Lord is full of compassion and is merciful .
NASB	James	5	12	But above all , ( AE ) my brothers and sisters , ( AF ) do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath ; but [ l ] your yes is to be yes , and your no , no , so that you do not fall under judgment .
NASB	James	5	13	Is anyone among you ( AG ) suffering ? ( AH ) Then he must pray . Is anyone cheerful ? He is to ( AI ) sing praises .
NASB	James	5	14	Is anyone among you sick ? Then he must call for ( AJ ) the elders of the church and they are to pray over him , [ m ] ( AK ) anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ;
NASB	James	5	15	and the ( AL ) prayer of faith will [ n ] ( AM ) restore the one who is sick , and the Lord will ( AN ) raise him up , and if he has committed sins , [ o ] they will be forgiven him .
NASB	James	5	16	Therefore , ( AO ) confess your sins to one another , and pray for one another so that you may be ( AP ) healed . ( AQ ) A [ p ] prayer of a righteous person , when it is [ q ] brought about , can accomplish much .
NASB	James	5	17	Elijah was ( AR ) a man with a nature like ours , and ( AS ) he prayed [ r ] earnestly that it would not rain , and it did not rain on the earth for ( AT ) three years and six months .
NASB	James	5	18	Then he ( AU ) prayed again , and ( AV ) the sky [ s ] poured rain and the earth produced its fruit .
NASB	James	5	19	My brothers and sisters , ( AW ) if anyone among you strays from ( AX ) the truth and someone turns him back ,
NASB	James	5	20	let him know that the one who has turned a sinner from the error of his way will ( AY ) save his soul from death and ( AZ ) cover a multitude of sins .

NASB	1%20Peter	1	2	according to the ( J ) foreknowledge of God the Father , ( K ) by the sanctifying work of the Spirit , [ a ] to ( L ) obey Jesus Christ and be ( M ) sprinkled with His blood : ( N ) May grace and peace be multiplied to you .
NASB	1%20Peter	1	3	( O ) Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who ( P ) according to His great mercy ( Q ) has caused us to be born again to ( R ) a living hope through the ( S ) resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
NASB	1%20Peter	1	4	to obtain an ( T ) inheritance which is imperishable , undefiled , and ( U ) will not fade away , ( V ) reserved in heaven for you ,
NASB	1%20Peter	1	5	who are ( W ) protected by the power of God ( X ) through faith for ( Y ) a salvation ready ( Z ) to be revealed in the last time .
NASB	1%20Peter	1	6	( AA ) In this you greatly rejoice , even though now ( AB ) for a little while , ( AC ) if necessary , you have been distressed by ( AD ) various [ b ] trials ,
NASB	1%20Peter	1	7	so that the [ c ] ( AE ) proof of your faith , being more precious than gold which perishes ( AF ) though tested by fire , ( AG ) may be found to result in praise , glory , and honor at ( AH ) the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
NASB	1%20Peter	1	8	and ( AI ) though you have not seen Him , you ( AJ ) love Him , and though you do not see Him now , but believe in Him , you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and [ d ] full of glory ,
NASB	1%20Peter	1	9	obtaining as ( AK ) the outcome of your faith , the salvation of [ e ] your souls .
NASB	1%20Peter	1	10	( AL ) As to this salvation , the prophets who ( AM ) prophesied of the ( AN ) grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries ,
NASB	1%20Peter	1	11	[ f ] seeking to know what person or time ( AO ) the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He ( AP ) predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories [ g ] to follow .
NASB	1%20Peter	1	12	It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves , but you , in these things which now have been announced to you through those who ( AQ ) preached the gospel to you by ( AR ) the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which ( AS ) angels long to [ h ] look .
NASB	1%20Peter	1	13	Therefore , [ i ] ( AT ) prepare your minds for action , [ j ] ( AU ) keep sober in spirit , set your ( AV ) hope completely on the ( AW ) grace to be brought to you at ( AX ) the revelation of Jesus Christ .
NASB	1%20Peter	1	14	As [ k ] ( AY ) obedient children , do not [ l ] ( AZ ) be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ( BA ) ignorance ,
NASB	1%20Peter	1	15	but [ m ] ( BB ) like the Holy One who called you , [ n ] ( BC ) be holy yourselves also ( BD ) in all your behavior ;
NASB	1%20Peter	1	16	because it is written : “ ( BE ) You shall be holy , for I am holy. ”
NASB	1%20Peter	1	17	If you ( BF ) address as Father the One who ( BG ) impartially ( BH ) judges according to each one ’ s work , conduct yourselves ( BI ) in fear during the time of your ( BJ ) stay on earth ;
NASB	1%20Peter	1	18	knowing that you were not [ o ] ( BK ) redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your ( BL ) futile way of life inherited from your forefathers ,
NASB	1%20Peter	1	19	but with precious ( BM ) blood , as of a ( BN ) lamb unblemished and spotless , the blood of Christ .
NASB	1%20Peter	1	20	For He was ( BO ) foreknown before ( BP ) the foundation of the world , but has ( BQ ) appeared [ p ] in these last times ( BR ) for the sake of you
NASB	1%20Peter	1	21	who through Him are ( BS ) believers in God , who raised Him from the dead and ( BT ) gave Him glory , so that your faith and ( BU ) hope are in God .

NASB	1%20Peter	2	2	( C ) and like newborn babies , long for the [ e ] ( D ) pure [ f ] milk of the word , so that by it you may ( E ) grow [ g ] in respect to salvation ,

NASB	1%20Peter	2	4	And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been ( H ) rejected by people , but is [ i ] choice and precious in the sight of God ,
NASB	1%20Peter	2	5	( I ) you also , as living stones , [ j ] are being built up as a ( J ) spiritual house for a holy ( K ) priesthood , to ( L ) offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
NASB	1%20Peter	2	6	For this is contained in [ k ] Scripture : “ ( M ) Behold , I am laying in Zion a choice stone , a ( N ) precious cornerstone , And the one who believes in [ l ] Him will not be [ m ] put to shame. ”
NASB	1%20Peter	2	7	( O ) This precious value , then , is for you who believe ; but for unbelievers ,
NASB	1%20Peter	2	8	and , “ ( R ) A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense ” ; ( S ) for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word , ( T ) and to this they were also appointed .
NASB	1%20Peter	2	9	But you are ( U ) a chosen people , a royal ( V ) priesthood , a ( W ) holy nation , ( X ) a people for God ’ s own possession , so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you ( Y ) out of darkness into His marvelous light ;
NASB	1%20Peter	2	10	( Z ) for you once were not a people , but now you are the people of God ; you had not received mercy , but now you have received mercy .

NASB	1%20Peter	2	13	( AJ ) Submit yourselves for the Lord ’ s sake to every human institution , whether to a king as the one in authority ,
NASB	1%20Peter	2	14	or to governors as sent [ q ] by him ( AK ) for the punishment of evildoers and the ( AL ) praise of those who do right .
NASB	1%20Peter	2	15	For [ r ] ( AM ) such is the will of God , that by doing right you ( AN ) silence the ignorance of foolish people .
NASB	1%20Peter	2	16	Act as ( AO ) free people , and [ s ] do not use your freedom as a [ t ] covering for evil , but use it as ( AP ) bond-servants of God .
NASB	1%20Peter	2	17	( AQ ) Honor all people , ( AR ) love the brotherhood , ( AS ) fear God , ( AT ) honor the [ u ] king .
NASB	1%20Peter	2	18	( AU ) Servants , be subject to your masters with all respect , not only to those who are good and ( AV ) gentle , but also to those who are [ v ] harsh .
NASB	1%20Peter	2	19	For this finds favor , if for the sake of ( AW ) conscience toward God a person endures [ w ] grief when suffering unjustly .
NASB	1%20Peter	2	20	For what credit is there if , when you sin and are harshly treated , you endure it with patience ? But if ( AX ) when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it , this finds favor with God . Christ Is Our Example
NASB	1%20Peter	2	21	For ( AY ) you have been called for this purpose , ( AZ ) because Christ also suffered for you , leaving you ( BA ) an example , so that you would follow in His steps ,
NASB	1%20Peter	2	22	He who ( BB ) committed no sin , nor was any deceit found in His mouth ;
NASB	1%20Peter	2	23	[ x ] and while being ( BC ) abusively insulted , He did not insult in return ; while suffering , He did not threaten , but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously ;

NASB	1%20Peter	3	3	( D ) Your adornment must not be merely the external—braiding the hair , wearing gold jewelry , or putting on apparel ;
NASB	1%20Peter	3	2	as they observe your pure [ a ] and respectful behavior .
NASB	1%20Peter	3	4	but it should be ( E ) the hidden person of the heart , with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is precious in the sight of God .
NASB	1%20Peter	3	5	For in this way the holy women of former times , ( F ) who hoped in God , also used to adorn themselves , being subject to their own husbands ,
NASB	1%20Peter	3	6	just as Sarah obeyed Abraham , ( G ) calling him lord ; and you have proved to be her children if you do what is right [ b ] ( H ) without being frightened by any fear .
NASB	1%20Peter	3	7	( I ) You husbands in the same way , live with your wives in an understanding way , as with [ c ] ( J ) someone weaker , since she is a woman ; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life , so that your prayers will not be hindered .
NASB	1%20Peter	3	8	[ d ] To sum up , ( K ) all of you be harmonious , sympathetic , [ e ] ( L ) loving , ( M ) compassionate , and ( N ) humble ;
NASB	1%20Peter	3	9	( O ) not returning evil for evil or ( P ) insult for insult , but giving a ( Q ) blessing instead ; for ( R ) you were called for the very purpose that you would ( S ) inherit a blessing .
NASB	1%20Peter	3	10	For , “ ( T ) The one who desires life , to love and see good days , Must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit .
NASB	1%20Peter	3	11	( U ) He must turn away from evil and do good ; He must seek peace and pursue it .
NASB	1%20Peter	3	12	( V ) For the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous , And His ears attend to their prayer , But the face of the Lord is against evildoers. ”
NASB	1%20Peter	3	13	( W ) And who is [ f ] there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good ?
NASB	1%20Peter	3	14	But even if you should ( X ) suffer for the sake of righteousness , ( Y ) you [ g ] are blessed . ( Z ) And do not fear their [ h ] intimidation , and do not be in dread ,
NASB	1%20Peter	3	15	but [ i ] sanctify ( AA ) Christ as Lord in your hearts , always being ready ( AB ) to make a [ j ] defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the ( AC ) hope that is in you , but ( AD ) with gentleness and ( AE ) respect ;
NASB	1%20Peter	3	16	[ k ] and keep a ( AF ) good conscience so that in the thing in which ( AG ) you are slandered , those who disparage your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame .
NASB	1%20Peter	3	17	For ( AH ) it is better , ( AI ) if [ l ] God should will it so , that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong .
NASB	1%20Peter	3	18	For ( AJ ) Christ also [ m ] suffered for sins ( AK ) once for all time , the just for the unjust , so that He might ( AL ) bring us to God , having been put to death ( AM ) in the flesh , but made alive ( AN ) in the [ n ] spirit ;
NASB	1%20Peter	3	19	in [ o ] which He also went and made proclamation to the spirits in prison ,
NASB	1%20Peter	3	20	who once were disobedient when the ( AO ) patience of God ( AP ) kept waiting in the days of Noah , during the construction of ( AQ ) the ark , in which a few , that is , ( AR ) eight ( AS ) persons , were brought safely through the water .
NASB	1%20Peter	3	21	( AT ) Corresponding to that , baptism now saves you— ( AU ) not the removal of dirt from the flesh , but an appeal to God [ p ] for a ( AV ) good conscience—through ( AW ) the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
NASB	1%20Peter	3	22	( AX ) who is at the right hand of God , ( AY ) having gone into heaven , ( AZ ) after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Peter	4	4	In all this , they are surprised that you do not run with them in the same excesses of ( I ) [ d ] debauchery , and they ( J ) slander you ;
NASB	1%20Peter	4	2	( D ) so as to live ( E ) the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human lusts , but for the ( F ) will of God .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	3	For ( G ) the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles , [ c ] ( H ) having pursued a course of indecent behavior , lusts , drunkenness , carousing , drinking parties , and wanton idolatries .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	5	but they will give an account to Him who is ready to judge ( K ) the living and the dead .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	6	For ( L ) the gospel has for this purpose been [ e ] preached even to those who are dead , that though they are judged in the flesh as people , they may live in the spirit according to the will of God .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	7	( M ) The end of all things [ f ] is near ; therefore , ( N ) be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of [ g ] prayer .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	8	Above all , ( O ) keep fervent in your love for one another , because ( P ) love covers a multitude of sins .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	9	( Q ) Be hospitable to one another without ( R ) complaint .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	10	( S ) As each one has received a special gift , employ it in serving one another as good ( T ) stewards of the [ h ] multifaceted grace of God .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	11	( U ) Whoever speaks is to do so as one who is speaking ( V ) actual words of God ; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving [ i ] ( W ) by the strength which God supplies ; so that ( X ) in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ , ( Y ) to whom belongs the glory and [ j ] dominion forever and ever . Amen . Share the Sufferings of Christ
NASB	1%20Peter	4	12	( Z ) Beloved , do not be surprised at the ( AA ) fiery ordeal among you , which comes upon you for your testing , as though something strange were happening to you ;
NASB	1%20Peter	4	13	but to the degree that you ( AB ) share the sufferings of Christ , keep on rejoicing , so that at the ( AC ) revelation of His glory ( AD ) you may also rejoice and be overjoyed .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	14	If you are insulted [ k ] ( AE ) for the name of Christ , ( AF ) you are blessed , ( AG ) because the Spirit of glory , and of God , rests upon you .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	15	Make sure that ( AH ) none of you suffers as a murderer , or thief , or evildoer , or a [ l ] ( AI ) troublesome meddler ;
NASB	1%20Peter	4	16	but if anyone suffers as a ( AJ ) Christian , he is not to be ashamed , but is to ( AK ) glorify God in this name .
NASB	1%20Peter	4	17	For it is time for judgment ( AL ) to begin [ m ] with ( AM ) the household of God ; and if it ( AN ) begins [ n ] with us first , what will be the outcome for those ( AO ) who do not obey the ( AP ) gospel of God ?
NASB	1%20Peter	4	18	( AQ ) And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved , [ o ] what will become of the ( AR ) godless man and the sinner ?
NASB	1%20Peter	4	19	Therefore , those also who suffer according to ( AS ) the will of God are to entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20Peter	5	5	( M ) You [ g ] younger men , likewise , ( N ) be subject to your elders ; and all of you , clothe yourselves with ( O ) humility toward one another , because ( P ) God is opposed to the proud , but He gives grace to the humble .
NASB	1%20Peter	5	2	shepherd ( E ) the flock of God among you , exercising oversight , ( F ) not under compulsion but voluntarily , according to the will of God ; and ( G ) not [ b ] with greed but with eagerness ;
NASB	1%20Peter	5	3	nor yet as ( H ) domineering over [ c ] those assigned to your care , but by [ d ] proving to be [ e ] ( I ) examples to the flock .
NASB	1%20Peter	5	4	And when the Chief ( J ) Shepherd appears , you will receive the ( K ) unfading [ f ] ( L ) crown of glory .
NASB	1%20Peter	5	6	Therefore ( Q ) humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God , so that He may exalt you at the proper time ,
NASB	1%20Peter	5	7	having cast all your ( R ) anxiety on Him , because He cares about you .
NASB	1%20Peter	5	8	( S ) Be of sober spirit , ( T ) be on the alert . Your adversary , ( U ) the devil , prowls around like a roaring ( V ) lion , seeking someone to devour .
NASB	1%20Peter	5	9	[ h ] ( W ) So resist him , ( X ) firm in your faith , knowing that ( Y ) the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your [ i ] brothers and sisters who are in the world .
NASB	1%20Peter	5	10	After you have suffered ( Z ) for a little while , the ( AA ) God of all grace , who ( AB ) called you to His ( AC ) eternal glory in Christ , will Himself ( AD ) perfect , ( AE ) confirm , strengthen , and establish you .
NASB	1%20Peter	5	11	( AF ) To Him be dominion forever and ever . Amen .
NASB	1%20Peter	5	12	Through ( AG ) Silvanus , our faithful brother [ j ] ( for so I regard him ) , ( AH ) I have written to you briefly , [ k ] exhorting and testifying that this is ( AI ) the true grace of God . ( AJ ) Stand firm in it !
NASB	1%20Peter	5	13	She who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , sends you greetings , and so does my son , ( AK ) Mark .
NASB	1%20Peter	5	14	( AL ) Greet one another with a kiss of love . ( AM ) Peace be to you all who are in Christ . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Peter	1	2	Peter 1:20 Or the prophet ’ s own New American Standard Bible® , Copyright ©
NASB	2%20Peter	1	1	[ a ] Simon Peter , a ( A ) bond-servant and ( B ) apostle of Jesus Christ , To those who have received ( C ) a faith of the same [ b ] kind as ours , [ c ] by ( D ) the righteousness of ( E ) our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
NASB	2%20Peter	1	3	for His ( H ) divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness , through the true ( I ) knowledge of Him who ( J ) called us [ e ] by His own glory and [ f ] excellence .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	4	Through [ g ] these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent ( K ) promises , so that by them you may become ( L ) partakers of the divine nature , having ( M ) escaped the ( N ) corruption that is in ( O ) the world on account of lust .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	5	Now for this very reason also , applying all diligence , in your faith ( P ) supply ( Q ) moral [ h ] excellence , and in your moral excellence , ( R ) knowledge ,
NASB	2%20Peter	1	6	and in your knowledge , ( S ) self-control , and in your self-control , ( T ) perseverance , and in your perseverance , ( U ) godliness ,
NASB	2%20Peter	1	7	and in your godliness , ( V ) brotherly kindness , and in your brotherly kindness , love .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	8	For if these qualities are yours and are increasing , they do not make you useless nor ( W ) unproductive in the true ( X ) knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	9	For the one who lacks these qualities is ( Y ) blind or short-sighted , having forgotten his ( Z ) purification from his former sins .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	10	Therefore , brothers and sisters , be all the more diligent to make certain about His ( AA ) calling and ( AB ) choice of you ; for as long as you practice these things , you will never ( AC ) stumble ;
NASB	2%20Peter	1	11	for in this way the entrance into ( AD ) the eternal kingdom of our ( AE ) Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be ( AF ) abundantly ( AG ) supplied to you .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	12	Therefore , ( AH ) I will always be ready to remind you of these things , even though you already know them and have been established in ( AI ) the truth which is present with you .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	13	I consider it ( AJ ) right , as long as I am in ( AK ) this earthly [ i ] dwelling , to ( AL ) stir you up by way of reminder ,
NASB	2%20Peter	1	14	knowing that ( AM ) the laying aside of my earthly dwelling is imminent , ( AN ) as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	15	And I will also be diligent that at any time after my ( AO ) departure you will be able to call these things to mind . Eyewitnesses
NASB	2%20Peter	1	16	For we did not follow cleverly devised ( AP ) tales when we made known to you the ( AQ ) power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were ( AR ) eyewitnesses of His majesty .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	17	For when He received honor and glory from God the Father , such a ( AS ) [ j ] declaration as this was made to Him by the ( AT ) Majestic Glory : “ This is [ k ] My beloved Son with whom I am well pleased ” —
NASB	2%20Peter	1	18	and we ourselves heard this [ l ] declaration made from heaven when we were with Him on the ( AU ) holy mountain .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	19	And so we have ( AV ) the prophetic word made more ( AW ) sure , to which you do well to pay attention as to ( AX ) a lamp shining in a dark place , until the ( AY ) day dawns and the ( AZ ) morning star arises ( BA ) in your hearts .
NASB	2%20Peter	1	20	But ( BB ) know this first of all , that ( BC ) no prophecy of Scripture [ m ] becomes a matter of [ n ] someone ’ s own interpretation ,
NASB	2%20Peter	1	21	for ( BD ) no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will , but men ( BE ) moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God . Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Peter	2	3	and in their ( L ) greed they will ( M ) exploit you with ( N ) false words ; ( O ) their judgment from long ago is not idle , and their destruction is not asleep .
NASB	2%20Peter	2	4	For ( P ) if God did not spare angels when they sinned , but cast them into [ a ] hell and ( Q ) committed them to [ b ] pits of darkness , held for judgment ;
NASB	2%20Peter	2	5	and did not spare ( R ) the ancient world , but protected ( S ) Noah , a [ c ] preacher of righteousness , with seven others , when He brought a ( T ) flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
NASB	2%20Peter	2	6	and if He ( U ) condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes , having made them an ( V ) example [ d ] of what is coming for the ( W ) ungodly ;
NASB	2%20Peter	2	7	and if He ( X ) rescued righteous Lot , who was oppressed by the ( Y ) perverted conduct of [ e ] ( Z ) unscrupulous people
NASB	2%20Peter	2	8	( for by what he saw and heard that ( AA ) righteous man , while living among them , felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds ) ,
NASB	2%20Peter	2	9	( AB ) then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from [ f ] a trial , and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the ( AC ) day of judgment ,
NASB	2%20Peter	2	10	and especially those who [ g ] ( AD ) indulge the flesh in its corrupt passion , and ( AE ) despise [ h ] authority . [ i ] Reckless , ( AF ) self-centered , they ( AG ) speak abusively of angelic [ j ] majesties without trembling ,
NASB	2%20Peter	2	11	( AH ) whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a demeaning judgment against them before the Lord .
NASB	2%20Peter	2	12	But ( AI ) these , like unreasoning animals , ( AJ ) born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed , using abusive speech where they have no knowledge , will in [ k ] the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed ,
NASB	2%20Peter	2	13	suffering wrong as ( AK ) the wages of doing wrong . They count it a pleasure to ( AL ) revel in the ( AM ) daytime . They are stains and blemishes , ( AN ) reveling in their [ l ] deceptions as they ( AO ) feast with you ,
NASB	2%20Peter	2	14	having eyes full of adultery [ m ] that never cease from sin , ( AP ) enticing ( AQ ) unstable souls , having hearts trained in ( AR ) greed , ( AS ) accursed children ;
NASB	2%20Peter	2	15	abandoning ( AT ) the right way , they have gone astray , having followed ( AU ) the way of Balaam , the son of Beor , who loved ( AV ) the [ n ] reward of unrighteousness ;
NASB	2%20Peter	2	16	but he received a rebuke for his own offense , ( AW ) for a mute donkey , speaking with a human voice , restrained the insanity of the prophet .
NASB	2%20Peter	2	17	These are ( AX ) springs without water and mists driven by a storm , ( AY ) for whom the [ o ] black darkness has been reserved .
NASB	2%20Peter	2	18	For , while speaking out ( AZ ) arrogant words of no ( BA ) value they ( BB ) entice by fleshly desires , by ( BC ) indecent behavior , those who barely ( BD ) escape from the ones who live in error ,
NASB	2%20Peter	2	19	promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption ; for ( BE ) by what anyone is overcome , by this he is enslaved .
NASB	2%20Peter	2	20	For if , after they have ( BF ) escaped the defilements of the world by ( BG ) the knowledge of the ( BH ) Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again ( BI ) entangled in them and are overcome , ( BJ ) the last state has become worse for them than the first .
NASB	2%20Peter	2	21	( BK ) For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than having known it , to turn away from ( BL ) the holy commandment ( BM ) handed on to them .
NASB	2%20Peter	2	22	[ p ] It has happened to them according to the true proverb , “ ( BN ) A dog returns to its own vomit , ” and , “ A sow , after washing , returns to wallowing in the mire. ” Footnotes -

NASB	2%20Peter	3	3	( F ) Know this first of all , that ( G ) in the last days ( H ) mockers will come with their mocking , ( I ) following after their own lusts ,
NASB	2%20Peter	3	4	and saying , “ ( J ) Where is the promise of His ( K ) coming ? For ever since the fathers [ a ] ( L ) fell asleep , all things continue just as they were ( M ) from the beginning of creation. ”
NASB	2%20Peter	3	5	For [ b ] when they maintain this , it escapes their notice that ( N ) by the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was ( O ) formed out of water and by water ,
NASB	2%20Peter	3	6	through which ( P ) the world at that time was ( Q ) destroyed by being flooded with water .
NASB	2%20Peter	3	7	But by His word ( R ) the present heavens and earth are being reserved for ( S ) fire , kept for ( T ) the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly people .
NASB	2%20Peter	3	8	But do not let this one fact escape your notice , ( U ) beloved , that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years , and ( V ) a thousand years like one day .
NASB	2%20Peter	3	9	( W ) The Lord is not slow about His promise , as some count slowness , but ( X ) is patient toward you , ( Y ) not willing for any to perish , but for all to come to repentance . A New Heaven and Earth
NASB	2%20Peter	3	10	But ( Z ) the day of the Lord ( AA ) will come like a thief , in which ( AB ) the heavens ( AC ) will pass away with a roar and the ( AD ) elements will be destroyed with intense heat , and ( AE ) the earth and [ c ] its works will be [ d ] discovered .
NASB	2%20Peter	3	11	Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way , what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness ,
NASB	2%20Peter	3	12	( AF ) looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God , because of which ( AG ) the heavens will be destroyed by burning , and the ( AH ) elements will melt with intense heat !
NASB	2%20Peter	3	13	But according to His ( AI ) promise we are looking for ( AJ ) new heavens and a new earth , ( AK ) in which righteousness dwells .
NASB	2%20Peter	3	14	( AL ) Therefore , ( AM ) beloved , since you look for these things , be diligent to be ( AN ) found ( AO ) spotless and blameless by Him , at peace ,
NASB	2%20Peter	3	15	and regard the ( AP ) patience of our Lord as salvation ; just as also ( AQ ) our beloved brother Paul , ( AR ) according to the wisdom given him , wrote to you ,
NASB	2%20Peter	3	16	as also in all his letters , speaking in them of ( AS ) these things , ( AT ) in which there are some things that are hard to understand , which the untaught and ( AU ) unstable distort , as they do also ( AV ) the rest of the Scriptures , to their own destruction .
NASB	2%20Peter	3	17	You therefore , ( AW ) beloved , knowing this beforehand , ( AX ) be on your guard so that you are not carried away by ( AY ) the error of [ e ] ( AZ ) unscrupulous people and ( BA ) lose your own [ f ] firm commitment ,
NASB	2%20Peter	3	18	but grow in the grace and ( BB ) knowledge of our ( BC ) Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . ( BD ) To Him be the glory , both now and to the day of eternity . Amen . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20John	2	4	The one who says , “ ( J ) I have come to ( K ) know Him , ” and does not keep His commandments , is a ( L ) liar , and ( M ) the truth is not in him ;

NASB	1%20John	2	6	the one who says that he ( Q ) remains in Him ( R ) ought , himself also , walk just as He walked .
NASB	1%20John	2	7	( S ) Beloved , I am ( T ) not writing a new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you have had ( U ) from the beginning ; the old commandment is the word which you have heard .
NASB	1%20John	2	8	[ c ] On the other hand , I am writing ( V ) a new commandment to you , which is true in Him and in you , because ( W ) the darkness is passing away and ( X ) the true Light is already shining .
NASB	1%20John	2	9	The one who says that he is in the Light and yet ( Y ) hates his ( Z ) brother or sister is in the darkness until now .
NASB	1%20John	2	10	( AA ) The one who loves his brother and sister remains in the Light , and there is nothing in him to cause stumbling .
NASB	1%20John	2	11	But the one who ( AB ) hates his brother or sister is in the darkness and ( AC ) walks in the darkness , and does not know where he is going because the darkness has ( AD ) blinded his eyes .

NASB	1%20John	2	14	I have written to you , fathers , because you know Him ( AK ) who has been from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are ( AL ) strong , and the ( AM ) word of God remains in you , and ( AN ) you have overcome the evil one . Do Not Love the World
NASB	1%20John	2	15	Do not love ( AO ) the world nor the things in the world . ( AP ) If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
NASB	1%20John	2	16	For all that is in the world , ( AQ ) the lust of the flesh and ( AR ) the lust of the eyes and ( AS ) the boastful pride of life , is not from the Father , but is from the world .
NASB	1%20John	2	17	( AT ) The world is passing away and also its lusts ; but the one who ( AU ) does the will of God continues to live forever .
NASB	1%20John	2	18	Children , ( AV ) it is the last hour ; and just as you heard that ( AW ) antichrist is coming , ( AX ) even now many antichrists have appeared ; from this we know that it is the last hour .
NASB	1%20John	2	19	( AY ) They went out from us , but they were not really of us ; for if they had been of us , they would have remained with us ; but they went out , ( AZ ) so that [ d ] it would be evident that they all are not of us .
NASB	1%20John	2	20	[ e ] But you have an ( BA ) anointing from ( BB ) the Holy One , and ( BC ) you all know .
NASB	1%20John	2	21	I have not written to you because you do not know the truth , but ( BD ) because you do know it , and [ f ] because no lie is ( BE ) of the truth .
NASB	1%20John	2	22	Who is the liar except ( BF ) the one who denies that Jesus is the [ g ] Christ ? This is ( BG ) the antichrist , the one who denies the Father and the Son .
NASB	1%20John	2	23	( BH ) Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father ; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also .
NASB	1%20John	2	24	As for you , see that what you heard ( BI ) from the beginning remains in you . If what you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also ( BJ ) will remain in the Son and in the Father . The Promise Is Eternal Life
NASB	1%20John	2	25	( BK ) This is the promise which He Himself [ h ] made to us : eternal life .
NASB	1%20John	2	26	These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to ( BL ) deceive you .
NASB	1%20John	2	27	And as for you , the ( BM ) anointing which you received from Him remains in you , and you have no need for anyone to teach you ; but as His anointing ( BN ) teaches you about all things , and is ( BO ) true and is not a lie , and just as it has taught you , [ i ] you remain in Him .
NASB	1%20John	2	28	Now , ( BP ) little children , remain in Him , so that when He ( BQ ) appears , we may have ( BR ) confidence and ( BS ) not [ j ] draw back from Him in shame [ k ] at His ( BT ) coming .
NASB	1%20John	2	29	If you know that ( BU ) He is righteous , you know that everyone who practices righteousness also ( BV ) has been born of Him . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20John	3	3	And everyone who has this ( J ) hope set on Him ( K ) purifies himself , just as He is pure .
NASB	1%20John	3	2	( D ) Beloved , now we are ( E ) children of God , and ( F ) it has not appeared as yet what we will be . We know that when He ( G ) appears , we will be ( H ) like Him , because we will ( I ) see Him just as He is .
NASB	1%20John	3	4	Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness ; and ( L ) sin is lawlessness .
NASB	1%20John	3	5	You know that He ( M ) appeared in order to ( N ) take away sins ; and ( O ) in Him there is no sin .
NASB	1%20John	3	6	No one who remains in Him ( P ) sins continually ; no one who sins continually has seen Him or [ b ] ( Q ) knows Him .
NASB	1%20John	3	7	( R ) Little children , make sure no one ( S ) deceives you ; ( T ) the one who practices righteousness is righteous , just as He is righteous ;
NASB	1%20John	3	8	the one who practices sin is ( U ) of the devil ; for the devil [ c ] has been sinning from the beginning . ( V ) The Son of God ( W ) appeared for this purpose , ( X ) to destroy the works of the devil .
NASB	1%20John	3	9	No one who has been ( Y ) born of God practices sin , because His seed remains in him ; and he can not sin continually , because he has been born of God .
NASB	1%20John	3	10	By this the ( Z ) children of God and the ( AA ) children of the devil are obvious : [ d ] anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God , nor the one who ( AB ) does not love his ( AC ) brother and sister .
NASB	1%20John	3	11	( AD ) For this is the message ( AE ) which you have heard from the beginning , ( AF ) that we are to love one another ;
NASB	1%20John	3	12	not as ( AG ) Cain , who was of ( AH ) the evil one and murdered his brother . And for what reason did he murder him ? Because ( AI ) his own deeds were evil , but his brother ’ s were righteous .
NASB	1%20John	3	13	Do not be surprised , brothers and sisters , if ( AJ ) the world hates you .
NASB	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have ( AK ) passed out of death into life , ( AL ) because we love the brothers and sisters . The one who does not love remains in death .
NASB	1%20John	3	15	Everyone who ( AM ) hates his brother or sister is a murderer , and you know that ( AN ) no murderer has eternal life remaining in him .
NASB	1%20John	3	16	We know love by this , that ( AO ) He laid down His life for us ; and ( AP ) we ought to lay down our lives for the ( AQ ) brothers and sisters .
NASB	1%20John	3	17	But ( AR ) whoever has worldly goods and sees his brother or sister in need , and ( AS ) closes his [ e ] heart [ f ] against him , ( AT ) how does the love of God remain in him ?
NASB	1%20John	3	18	( AU ) Little children , let ’ s not love with word or with tongue , but in deed and ( AV ) truth .
NASB	1%20John	3	19	We will know by this that we are ( AW ) of the truth , and will set our heart at ease before Him ,
NASB	1%20John	3	20	that if our heart condemns us , that God is greater than our heart , and He knows all things .
NASB	1%20John	3	21	( AX ) Beloved , if our heart does not condemn us , we have ( AY ) confidence [ g ] before God ;
NASB	1%20John	3	22	and ( AZ ) whatever we ask , we receive from Him , because we ( BA ) keep His commandments and do ( BB ) the things that are pleasing in His sight .
NASB	1%20John	3	23	This is His commandment , that we [ h ] ( BC ) believe in ( BD ) the name of His Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , just as ( BE ) He [ i ] commanded us .
NASB	1%20John	3	24	The one who ( BF ) keeps His commandments ( BG ) remains in Him , and He in him . ( BH ) We know by this that ( BI ) He remains in us , by the Spirit whom He has given us . Footnotes -

NASB	1%20John	4	4	You are from God , ( J ) little children , and ( K ) have overcome them ; because ( L ) greater is He who is in you than ( M ) he who is in the world .
NASB	1%20John	4	2	By this you know the Spirit of God : ( D ) every spirit that ( E ) confesses that ( F ) Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God ;
NASB	1%20John	4	3	and every spirit that ( G ) does not confess Jesus is not from God ; this is the spirit of the ( H ) antichrist , which you have heard is coming , and ( I ) now it is already in the world .
NASB	1%20John	4	5	( N ) They are from the world , therefore they speak as from the world , and the world listens to them .
NASB	1%20John	4	6	( O ) We are from God . ( P ) The one who knows God listens to us ; ( Q ) the one who is not from God does not listen to us . By this we know ( R ) the spirit of truth and ( S ) the spirit of error . God Is Love
NASB	1%20John	4	7	( T ) Beloved , let ’ s ( U ) love one another ; for love is from God , and ( V ) everyone who loves has been ( W ) born of God and ( X ) knows God .
NASB	1%20John	4	8	The one who does not love does not know God , because ( Y ) God is love .
NASB	1%20John	4	9	By this the love of God was revealed [ a ] ( Z ) in us , that ( AA ) God has sent His only Son into the world so that we may live through Him .
NASB	1%20John	4	10	In this is love , ( AB ) not that we loved God , but that ( AC ) He loved us and sent His Son to be ( AD ) the [ b ] propitiation for our sins .
NASB	1%20John	4	11	( AE ) Beloved , if God so loved us , ( AF ) we also ought to love one another .
NASB	1%20John	4	12	( AG ) No one has ever seen God ; if we love one another , God remains in us , and His ( AH ) love is perfected in us .
NASB	1%20John	4	13	( AI ) By this we know that we remain in Him and He in us , because He has given to us of His Spirit .
NASB	1%20John	4	14	We have seen and ( AJ ) testify that the Father has ( AK ) sent the Son to be the Savior of the world .
NASB	1%20John	4	15	( AL ) Whoever confesses that ( AM ) Jesus is the Son of God , God ( AN ) remains in him , and he in God .
NASB	1%20John	4	16	( AO ) We have come to know and have believed the love which God has [ c ] ( AP ) for us . ( AQ ) God is love , and the one who ( AR ) remains in love remains in God , and God remains in him .
NASB	1%20John	4	17	By this , ( AS ) love is perfected with us , so that we may have ( AT ) confidence in ( AU ) the day of judgment ; because ( AV ) as He is , we also are in this world .
NASB	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love , but ( AW ) perfect love drives out fear , because fear [ d ] involves punishment , and the one who fears is not ( AX ) perfected in love .
NASB	1%20John	4	19	( AY ) We love , because He first loved us .
NASB	1%20John	4	20	( AZ ) If someone says , “ I love God , ” and yet he ( BA ) hates his brother or sister , he is a ( BB ) liar ; for ( BC ) the one who does not love his brother and sister whom he has seen , ( BD ) can not love God , whom he has not seen .

NASB	1%20John	5	5	Who is the one who overcomes the world , but the one who ( K ) believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
NASB	1%20John	5	2	( D ) By this we know that ( E ) we love the children of God , when we love God and [ c ] follow His commandments .
NASB	1%20John	5	3	For ( F ) this is the love of God , that we ( G ) keep His commandments ; and ( H ) His commandments are not burdensome .
NASB	1%20John	5	4	For [ d ] whoever has been ( I ) born of God ( J ) overcomes the world ; and this is the victory that has overcome the world : our faith .
NASB	1%20John	5	6	This is the One who came ( L ) by water and blood , Jesus Christ ; not [ e ] with the water only , but [ f ] with the water and [ g ] with the blood . It is ( M ) the Spirit who testifies , because the Spirit is the truth .
NASB	1%20John	5	7	For there are ( N ) three that testify :
NASB	1%20John	5	8	[ h ] the Spirit and the water and the blood ; and the three are [ i ] in agreement .
NASB	1%20John	5	9	( O ) If we receive the testimony of people , the testimony of God is greater ; for the testimony of God is this , that ( P ) He has testified concerning His Son .
NASB	1%20John	5	10	The one who believes in the Son of God ( Q ) has the testimony in himself ; the one who does not believe God has ( R ) made Him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son .
NASB	1%20John	5	11	And the testimony is this , that God has given us ( S ) eternal life , and ( T ) this life is in His Son .
NASB	1%20John	5	12	( U ) The one who has the Son has the life ; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life . This Is Written That You May Know
NASB	1%20John	5	13	( V ) These things I have written to you who ( W ) believe in the name of the Son of God , so that you may know that you have ( X ) eternal life .
NASB	1%20John	5	14	This is ( Y ) the confidence which we have [ j ] before Him , that , ( Z ) if we ask anything according to His will , He hears us .
NASB	1%20John	5	15	And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask , ( AA ) we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him .
NASB	1%20John	5	16	If anyone sees his brother or sister [ k ] committing a sin not leading to death , ( AB ) he shall ask and [ l ] God will , for him , give life to those who commit sin not leading to death . ( AC ) There is sin leading to death ; ( AD ) I am not saying that he should ask about that .
NASB	1%20John	5	17	( AE ) All unrighteousness is sin , and ( AF ) there is sin not leading to death .
NASB	1%20John	5	18	( AG ) We know that ( AH ) no one who has been born of God [ m ] sins ; but He who was born of God ( AI ) keeps him , and ( AJ ) the evil one does not ( AK ) touch him .

NASB	2%20John	1	4	( J ) I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in truth , just as we have received a commandment to do from the Father .
NASB	2%20John	1	5	Now I ask you , lady , ( K ) not as though I were writing to you a new commandment , but the one which we have had ( L ) from the beginning , that we ( M ) love one another .
NASB	2%20John	1	6	And ( N ) this is love , that we walk according to His commandments . This is the commandment , ( O ) just as you have heard ( P ) from the beginning , that you are to walk in it .
NASB	2%20John	1	7	For ( Q ) many deceivers have ( R ) gone out into the world , those who ( S ) do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh . This is ( T ) the deceiver and the ( U ) antichrist .

NASB	3%20John	1	4	I have no greater joy than [ a ] this , to hear of ( G ) my children ( H ) walking in the truth .
NASB	3%20John	1	5	Beloved , you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the ( I ) brothers and sisters , and [ b ] especially when they are ( J ) strangers ;
NASB	3%20John	1	6	and they have testified to your love before the church . You will do well to [ c ] ( K ) send them on their way in a manner ( L ) worthy of God .
NASB	3%20John	1	7	For they went out for the sake of ( M ) the Name , ( N ) accepting nothing from the Gentiles .
NASB	3%20John	1	8	Therefore we ought to [ d ] support such people , so that we may [ e ] prove to be fellow workers [ f ] with the truth .
NASB	3%20John	1	9	I wrote something to the church ; but Diotrephes , who loves to ( O ) be first among them , does not accept [ g ] what we say .
NASB	3%20John	1	10	For this reason , ( P ) if I come , I will call attention to his deeds which he does , unjustly accusing us with malicious words ; and not satisfied with this , he himself does not ( Q ) receive the ( R ) brothers either , and he forbids those who want to do so and ( S ) puts them out of the church .
NASB	3%20John	1	11	Beloved , ( T ) do not imitate what is evil , but what is good . ( U ) The one who does what is good is of God ; ( V ) the one who does what is evil has not seen God .

NASB	Jude	1	1	[ a ] ( A ) Jude , a ( B ) bond-servant of Jesus Christ and brother of [ b ] James , To ( C ) those who are the called , beloved in God the Father , and ( D ) kept for Jesus Christ :
NASB	Jude	1	2	( E ) May mercy , peace , and love ( F ) be multiplied to you .
NASB	Jude	1	3	( G ) Beloved , while I was making every effort to write you about our ( H ) common salvation , I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you ( I ) contend earnestly for ( J ) the faith that was once for all time ( K ) handed down to ( L ) the [ c ] saints .
NASB	Jude	1	4	For certain people have ( M ) crept in unnoticed , those who were long beforehand [ d ] ( N ) marked out for this condemnation , ungodly persons who turn ( O ) the grace of our God into ( P ) indecent behavior and ( Q ) deny our only Master and Lord , Jesus Christ .
NASB	Jude	1	5	Now I want to ( R ) remind you , though ( S ) you know everything once and for all , that [ e ] the Lord , ( T ) after saving a people out of the land of Egypt , [ f ] subsequently destroyed those who did not believe .
NASB	Jude	1	6	And ( U ) angels who did not keep their own domain but abandoned their proper dwelling place , these He has ( V ) kept in eternal restraints under darkness for the judgment of the great day ,
NASB	Jude	1	7	just as ( W ) Sodom and Gomorrah and the ( X ) cities around them , since they in the same way as these angels indulged in sexual perversion and ( Y ) went after [ g ] strange flesh , are exhibited as an [ h ] ( Z ) example in undergoing the ( AA ) punishment of eternal fire .
NASB	Jude	1	8	Yet in the same way these people also , dreaming , ( AB ) defile the flesh , reject authority , and speak abusively of angelic [ i ] majesties .
NASB	Jude	1	9	But ( AC ) Michael ( AD ) the archangel , when he disputed with the devil and argued about ( AE ) the body of Moses , did not dare pronounce against him an abusive judgment , but said , “ ( AF ) The Lord rebuke you ! ”
NASB	Jude	1	10	But ( AG ) these people disparage all the things that they do not understand ; and ( AH ) all the things that they know by instinct , ( AI ) like unreasoning animals , by these things they are destroyed .
NASB	Jude	1	11	Woe to them ! For they have gone ( AJ ) the way of Cain , and for pay [ j ] they have given themselves up to ( AK ) the error of Balaam , and ( AL ) perished in the rebellion of Korah .
NASB	Jude	1	12	These are the ones who are [ k ] hidden reefs ( AM ) in your love feasts when they feast with you ( AN ) without fear , like shepherds caring only for themselves ; ( AO ) clouds without water , ( AP ) carried along by winds ; autumn trees without fruit , [ l ] doubly dead , ( AQ ) uprooted ;
NASB	Jude	1	13	( AR ) wild waves of the sea , churning up ( AS ) their own shameful deeds like dirty foam ; wandering stars , ( AT ) for whom the [ m ] gloom of darkness has been reserved forever .
NASB	Jude	1	14	It was also about these people that ( AU ) Enoch , in the seventh generation from Adam , prophesied , saying , “ ( AV ) Behold , the Lord has come with [ n ] many thousands of His holy ones ,
NASB	Jude	1	15	( AW ) to execute judgment upon all , and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way , and of all the harsh things which ( AX ) ungodly sinners have spoken against Him. ”
NASB	Jude	1	16	These are ( AY ) grumblers , finding fault , ( AZ ) following after their own lusts ; [ o ] they speak ( BA ) arrogantly , flattering people ( BB ) for the sake of gaining an advantage . Keep Yourselves in the Love of God
NASB	Jude	1	17	But you , ( BC ) beloved , ( BD ) ought to remember the words that were spoken beforehand by ( BE ) the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NASB	Jude	1	18	that they were saying to you , “ ( BF ) In the last time there will be mockers , ( BG ) following after their own ungodly lusts. ”
NASB	Jude	1	19	These are the ones who cause divisions , [ p ] ( BH ) worldly-minded , [ q ] devoid of the Spirit .
NASB	Jude	1	20	But you , ( BI ) beloved , ( BJ ) building yourselves up on your most holy ( BK ) faith , ( BL ) praying in the Holy Spirit ,
NASB	Jude	1	21	keep yourselves in the love of God , ( BM ) looking forward to the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life .
NASB	Jude	1	22	And have mercy on some , who are doubting ;
NASB	Jude	1	23	save others , ( BN ) snatching them out of the fire ; and on some have mercy with fear , ( BO ) hating even the garment polluted by the flesh .
NASB	Jude	1	24	( BP ) Now to Him who is able to protect you from stumbling , and to ( BQ ) make you stand in the presence of His glory , blameless with ( BR ) great joy ,
NASB	Jude	1	25	to the ( BS ) only ( BT ) God our Savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord , ( BU ) be glory , majesty , dominion , and authority ( BV ) before all time and now and [ r ] forever .

NASB	Revelation	7	12	saying , “ ( Y ) Amen , ( Z ) blessing , glory , wisdom , thanksgiving , honor , power , and might belong to our God forever and ever . ( AA ) Amen. ”
NASB	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders ( AB ) responded , saying to me , “ These who are clothed in the ( AC ) white robes , who are they , and where have they come from ? ”
NASB	Revelation	7	14	I [ a ] said to him , “ My lord , you know. ” And he said to me , “ These are the ones who come out of the ( AD ) great tribulation , and they have ( AE ) washed their robes and made them ( AF ) white in the ( AG ) blood of the Lamb .

NASB	Revelation	9	9	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron ; and the ( Q ) sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots , of many horses rushing to battle .
NASB	Revelation	9	2	He opened the shaft of the abyss , and ( E ) smoke ascended out of the shaft like the smoke of a great furnace ; and ( F ) the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the shaft .
NASB	Revelation	9	3	Then out of the smoke came ( G ) locusts [ a ] upon the earth , and power was given them , as the ( H ) scorpions of the earth have power .
NASB	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to ( I ) hurt the ( J ) grass of the earth , nor any green thing , nor any tree , but only the people who do not have the ( K ) seal of God on their foreheads .
NASB	Revelation	9	5	And [ b ] they were not permitted to kill [ c ] anyone , but to torment for ( L ) five months ; and their torment was like the torment of a ( M ) scorpion when it [ d ] stings a person .

NASB	Revelation	9	16	The number of the armies of the horsemen was ( AE ) two hundred million ; ( AF ) I heard the number of them .
NASB	Revelation	9	17	And this is how I saw ( AG ) in my vision the horses and those who sat on them : the riders had breastplates the color of fire , of hyacinth , and of [ k ] ( AH ) brimstone ; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions ; and ( AI ) out of their mouths * came fire and smoke and [ l ] ( AJ ) brimstone .
NASB	Revelation	9	18	A ( AK ) third of mankind was killed by these three plagues , by the ( AL ) fire , the smoke , and the [ m ] brimstone which came out of their mouths .
NASB	Revelation	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails ; for their tails are like serpents and have heads , and with them they do harm .
NASB	Revelation	9	20	The rest of mankind , who were not killed by these plagues , ( AM ) did not repent of ( AN ) the works of their hands so as not to ( AO ) worship demons and ( AP ) the idols of gold , silver , brass , stone , and wood , which can neither see nor hear nor walk ;

NASB	Revelation	18	4	I heard another voice from heaven , saying , “ ( K ) Come out of her , my people , so that you will not participate in her sins and receive any of her plagues ;
