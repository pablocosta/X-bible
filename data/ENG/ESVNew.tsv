ESV	Matthew	7	5	You hypocrite , first take the log out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother 's eye .
ESV	Matthew	7	6	( E ) “ Do not give ( F ) dogs what is holy , and do not throw your ( G ) pearls before pigs , lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you . Ask , and It Will Be Given
ESV	Matthew	7	8	For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks it will be opened .
ESV	Matthew	7	9	Or which one of you , if his son asks him for ( L ) bread , will give him ( M ) a stone ?
ESV	Matthew	7	10	Or if he asks for a fish , will give him a serpent ?
ESV	Matthew	7	11	If you then , ( N ) who are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will ( O ) your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him ! The Golden Rule
ESV	Matthew	7	12	“ So ( P ) whatever you wish that others would do to you , do also to them , for this is ( Q ) the Law and the Prophets .
ESV	Matthew	7	13	( R ) “ Enter by the narrow gate . For the gate is wide and the way is easy [ a ] that leads to destruction , and those who enter by it are many .
ESV	Matthew	7	14	For the gate is narrow and ( S ) the way is hard that leads to life , and ( T ) those who find it are few . A Tree and Its Fruit
ESV	Matthew	7	15	( U ) “ Beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep 's clothing but inwardly are ( V ) ravenous wolves .
ESV	Matthew	7	16	You will recognize them ( W ) by their fruits . Are grapes gathered from thornbushes , or figs from thistles ?
ESV	Matthew	7	17	So , ( X ) every healthy tree bears good fruit , but the diseased tree bears bad fruit .
ESV	Matthew	7	18	A healthy tree can not bear bad fruit , nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit .
ESV	Matthew	7	19	( Y ) Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
ESV	Matthew	7	20	Thus you will recognize them ( Z ) by their fruits . I Never Knew You
ESV	Matthew	7	21	( AA ) “ Not everyone who ( AB ) says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will ( AC ) enter the kingdom of heaven , but the one who ( AD ) does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
ESV	Matthew	7	22	( AE ) On that day ( AF ) many will say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not ( AG ) prophesy in your name , and cast out demons ( AH ) in your name , and do many mighty works in your name ? ’
ESV	Matthew	7	23	( AI ) And then will I declare to them , ‘ I ( AJ ) never knew you ; ( AK ) depart from me , ( AL ) you workers of lawlessness. ’ Build Your House on the Rock
ESV	Matthew	7	24	( AM ) “ Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like ( AN ) a wise man who built his house on the rock .
ESV	Matthew	7	25	And the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat on that house , but it did not fall , because it had been founded on the rock .
ESV	Matthew	7	26	And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like ( AO ) a foolish man who built his house on the sand .
ESV	Matthew	7	27	And the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat against that house , and it fell , and great was the fall of it. ” The Authority of Jesus

ESV	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard this , ( J ) he marveled and said to those who followed him , “ Truly , I tell you , with ( K ) no one in Israel [ d ] have I found such faith .
ESV	Matthew	8	11	I tell you , ( L ) many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven ,

ESV	Matthew	8	16	That evening they brought to him many who were ( U ) oppressed by demons , and he cast out the spirits ( V ) with a word and healed all who were sick .
ESV	Matthew	8	17	( W ) This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah : ( X ) “ He took our illnesses and bore our diseases. ” The Cost of Following Jesus
ESV	Matthew	8	18	Now ( Y ) when Jesus saw a crowd around him , ( Z ) he gave orders to go over to the other side .
ESV	Matthew	8	19	( AA ) And a scribe came up and said to him , “ Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go. ”
ESV	Matthew	8	20	And Jesus said to him , “ Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. ”
ESV	Matthew	8	21	Another of the disciples said to him , “ Lord , let me first go and bury my father. ”

ESV	Matthew	8	26	And he said to them , “ Why are you ( AF ) afraid , ( AG ) O you of little faith ? ” Then he rose and ( AH ) rebuked the winds and the sea , and ( AI ) there was a great calm .

ESV	Matthew	8	30	Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them .
ESV	Matthew	8	31	And the demons begged him , saying , “ If you cast us out , send us away into the herd of pigs. ”

ESV	Matthew	9	3	And behold , some of the scribes said to themselves , ( F ) “ This man is blaspheming. ”
ESV	Matthew	9	4	But Jesus , ( G ) knowing [ a ] their thoughts , said , “ Why do you think evil in your hearts ?

ESV	Matthew	9	14	Then ( T ) the disciples of John came to him , saying , ( U ) “ Why do we and ( V ) the Pharisees fast , [ c ] but your disciples do not fast ? ”
ESV	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said to them , ( W ) “ Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them ? ( X ) The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and ( Y ) then they will fast .
ESV	Matthew	9	16	No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , for the patch tears away from the garment , and a worse tear is made .
ESV	Matthew	9	17	Neither is new wine put into old ( Z ) wineskins . If it is , the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed . But new wine is put into fresh wineskins , and so both are preserved. ” A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed
ESV	Matthew	9	18	( AA ) While he was saying these things to them , behold , a ruler came in and ( AB ) knelt before him , saying , “ My daughter has just died , but come and lay your hand on her , and she will live. ”
ESV	Matthew	9	19	And Jesus rose and followed him , with his disciples .
ESV	Matthew	9	20	And behold , a woman ( AC ) who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched ( AD ) the fringe of his garment ,

ESV	Matthew	9	33	And when the demon had been cast out , the mute man spoke . And the crowds ( AT ) marveled , saying , “ Never was anything like this seen in Israel. ”

ESV	Matthew	12	9	He went on from there and ( L ) entered their synagogue .
ESV	Matthew	12	10	And a man was there with a withered hand . And they asked him , ( M ) “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? ” — ( N ) so that they might accuse him .
ESV	Matthew	12	11	He said to them , “ Which one of you who has a sheep , ( O ) if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will not take hold of it and lift it out ?
ESV	Matthew	12	13	Then he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” And ( R ) the man stretched it out , and it was restored , healthy like the other .
ESV	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him , how to destroy him . God 's Chosen Servant
ESV	Matthew	12	15	Jesus , aware of this , ( S ) withdrew from there . And ( T ) many followed him , and he healed them all
ESV	Matthew	12	16	and ( U ) ordered them not to make him known .
ESV	Matthew	12	17	( V ) This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah :
ESV	Matthew	12	18	( W ) “ Behold , my ( X ) servant whom I have chosen , my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased . ( Y ) I will put my Spirit upon him , and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles .
ESV	Matthew	12	19	He will not quarrel or cry aloud , nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets ;
ESV	Matthew	12	20	a bruised reed he will not break , and a smoldering wick he will not quench , until he brings justice to victory ;
ESV	Matthew	12	21	( Z ) and in his name the Gentiles will hope. ” Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit
ESV	Matthew	12	22	( AA ) Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him , and he healed him , so that the man spoke and saw .
ESV	Matthew	12	23	( AB ) And all the people were amazed , and said , ( AC ) “ Can this be the Son of David ? ”
ESV	Matthew	12	24	But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , ( AD ) “ It is only by Beelzebul , the prince of demons , that this man casts out demons. ”
ESV	Matthew	12	25	( AE ) Knowing their thoughts , ( AF ) he said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste , and no city or house divided against itself will stand .
ESV	Matthew	12	26	And if Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
ESV	Matthew	12	27	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul , ( AG ) by whom do ( AH ) your sons cast them out ? Therefore they will be your judges .
ESV	Matthew	12	28	But if it is ( AI ) by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons , then ( AJ ) the kingdom of God has come upon you .
ESV	Matthew	12	29	Or ( AK ) how can someone enter a strong man 's house and plunder his goods , unless he first binds the strong man ? Then indeed ( AL ) he may plunder his house .
ESV	Matthew	12	30	( AM ) Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters .
ESV	Matthew	12	31	( AN ) Therefore I tell you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people , but ( AO ) the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven .
ESV	Matthew	12	32	And whoever speaks a word ( AP ) against the Son of Man ( AQ ) will be forgiven , but ( AR ) whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven , either in ( AS ) this age or in the age to come . A Tree Is Known by Its Fruit
ESV	Matthew	12	33	( AT ) “ Either make the tree good and its fruit good , or make the tree bad and its fruit bad , ( AU ) for the tree is known by its fruit .
ESV	Matthew	12	34	( AV ) You brood of vipers ! How can you speak good , ( AW ) when you are evil ? ( AX ) For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks .
ESV	Matthew	12	35	( AY ) The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good , and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil .
ESV	Matthew	12	36	I tell you , ( AZ ) on the day of judgment ( BA ) people will give account for ( BB ) every careless word they speak ,
ESV	Matthew	12	37	for ( BC ) by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned. ” The Sign of Jonah
ESV	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him , saying , “ Teacher , ( BD ) we wish to see a sign from you. ”
ESV	Matthew	12	39	But he answered them , ( BE ) “ An evil and ( BF ) adulterous generation seeks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
ESV	Matthew	12	40	For ( BG ) just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish , ( BH ) so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
ESV	Matthew	12	41	( BI ) The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and ( BJ ) condemn it , for ( BK ) they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , ( BL ) something greater than Jonah is here .
ESV	Matthew	12	42	( BM ) The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , ( BN ) something greater than Solomon is here . Return of an Unclean Spirit
ESV	Matthew	12	43	“ When ( BO ) the unclean spirit has gone out of a person , it passes through ( BP ) waterless places seeking rest , but finds none .
ESV	Matthew	12	44	Then it says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came. ’ And when it comes , it finds the house empty , swept , and put in order .
ESV	Matthew	12	45	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they enter and dwell there , and ( BQ ) the last state of that person is worse than the first . So also will it be with this ( BR ) evil generation. ” Jesus ' Mother and Brothers
ESV	Matthew	12	46	While he was still speaking to the people , behold , ( BS ) his mother and his ( BT ) brothers [ a ] stood outside , asking to speak to him . [ b ]

ESV	Matthew	13	13	This is why I speak to them in parables , because ( N ) seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear , ( O ) nor do they understand .
ESV	Matthew	13	2	And great crowds gathered about him , ( B ) so that he got into a boat and sat down . And the whole crowd stood on the beach .
ESV	Matthew	13	3	And ( C ) he told them many things in parables , saying : ( D ) “ A sower went out to sow .
ESV	Matthew	13	4	And as he sowed , some seeds fell along the path , and the birds came and devoured them .
ESV	Matthew	13	5	Other seeds fell on rocky ground , where they did not have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , since they had no depth of soil ,
ESV	Matthew	13	6	but ( E ) when the sun rose they were scorched . And since they had no root , ( F ) they withered away .
ESV	Matthew	13	7	Other seeds fell among ( G ) thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked them .
ESV	Matthew	13	8	Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain , some ( H ) a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
ESV	Matthew	13	9	( I ) He who has ears , [ a ] let him hear. ” The Purpose of the Parables
ESV	Matthew	13	10	Then the disciples came and said to him , “ Why do you speak to them in parables ? ”
ESV	Matthew	13	11	And he answered them , ( J ) “ To you it has been given to know ( K ) the secrets of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been given .
ESV	Matthew	13	12	( L ) For to the one who has , more will be given , and he will have an abundance , but from the one who has not , ( M ) even what he has will be taken away .
ESV	Matthew	13	14	Indeed , in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says : ( P ) “ ‘ “ You will indeed hear but never understand , and you will indeed see but never perceive. ”
ESV	Matthew	13	15	For this people 's heart has grown dull , and with their ears ( Q ) they can barely hear , and ( R ) their eyes they have closed , lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and ( S ) understand with their heart and ( T ) turn , and I would heal them. ’
ESV	Matthew	13	16	But ( U ) blessed are your eyes , for they see , and your ears , for they hear .
ESV	Matthew	13	17	( V ) For truly , I say to you , ( W ) many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it . The Parable of the Sower Explained
ESV	Matthew	13	18	( X ) “ Hear then the parable of the sower :
ESV	Matthew	13	19	When anyone hears the word of ( Y ) the kingdom and ( Z ) does not understand it , ( AA ) the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart . This is what was sown along the path .
ESV	Matthew	13	20	As for what was sown on rocky ground , this is the one who hears the word and immediately ( AB ) receives it with joy ,
ESV	Matthew	13	21	yet he has no root in himself , but ( AC ) endures for a while , and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word , immediately ( AD ) he falls away . [ b ]
ESV	Matthew	13	22	As for what was sown among thorns , this is the one who hears the word , but ( AE ) the cares of ( AF ) the world and ( AG ) the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and it proves unfruitful .
ESV	Matthew	13	23	As for what was sown on good soil , this is the one who hears the word and ( AH ) understands it . He indeed ( AI ) bears fruit and yields , in one case ( AJ ) a hundredfold , in another sixty , and in another thirty. ” The Parable of the Weeds
ESV	Matthew	13	24	He put another parable before them , saying , ( AK ) “ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field ,
ESV	Matthew	13	25	but while his men were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed weeds [ c ] among the wheat and went away .
ESV	Matthew	13	26	So when the plants came up and bore grain , then the weeds appeared also .
ESV	Matthew	13	27	And the servants [ d ] of the master of the house came and said to him , ‘ Master , did you not sow good seed in your field ? How then does it have weeds ? ’
ESV	Matthew	13	28	- Matthew 13:35 Some manuscripts Isaiah the prophet The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	Matthew	13	29	But he said , ( AL ) ‘ No , lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them .
ESV	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest , and at harvest time I will tell the reapers , ( AM ) “ Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned , but gather the wheat into my barn. ” ’ ” The Mustard Seed and the Leaven
ESV	Matthew	13	31	He put another parable before them , saying , ( AN ) “ The kingdom of heaven is like ( AO ) a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field .
ESV	Matthew	13	32	It is the smallest of all seeds , but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches. ”
ESV	Matthew	13	33	He told them another parable . ( AP ) “ The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in ( AQ ) three measures of flour , till it was ( AR ) all leavened. ” Prophecy and Parables
ESV	Matthew	13	34	( AS ) All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables ; indeed , he said nothing to them without a parable .
ESV	Matthew	13	35	This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet : [ e ] ( AT ) “ I will open my mouth in parables ; ( AU ) I will utter what has been hidden ( AV ) since the foundation of the world. ” The Parable of the Weeds Explained
ESV	Matthew	13	36	Then he left the crowds and went into ( AW ) the house . And his disciples came to him , saying , ( AX ) “ Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field. ”
ESV	Matthew	13	37	He answered , “ The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man .
ESV	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world , and the good seed is ( AY ) the sons of the kingdom . The weeds are ( AZ ) the sons of the evil one ,
ESV	Matthew	13	39	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil . ( BA ) The harvest is ( BB ) the end of the age , and the reapers are angels .
ESV	Matthew	13	40	Just as the weeds ( BC ) are gathered and burned with fire , so will it be at ( BD ) the end of the age .
ESV	Matthew	13	41	( BE ) The Son of Man will send his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom all ( BF ) causes of sin and ( BG ) all law-breakers ,
ESV	Matthew	13	42	( BH ) and throw them into the fiery furnace . In that place ( BI ) there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .

ESV	Matthew	13	45	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls ,
ESV	Matthew	13	46	who , on finding ( BP ) one pearl of great value , ( BQ ) went and sold all that he had and ( BR ) bought it . The Parable of the Net
ESV	Matthew	13	47	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is ( BS ) like a net that was thrown into the sea and ( BT ) gathered fish of every kind .
ESV	Matthew	13	48	When it was full , ( BU ) men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad .
ESV	Matthew	13	49	So it will be at ( BV ) the end of the age . The angels will come out and ( BW ) separate the evil from the righteous
ESV	Matthew	13	50	( BX ) and throw them into the fiery furnace . In that place ( BY ) there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . New and Old Treasures
ESV	Matthew	13	51	( BZ ) “ Have you understood all these things ? ” They said to him , “ Yes. ”
ESV	Matthew	13	52	And he said to them , “ Therefore every ( CA ) scribe ( CB ) who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house , who ( CC ) brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old. ” Jesus Rejected at Nazareth
ESV	Matthew	13	53	And when Jesus had finished these parables , he went away from there ,
ESV	Matthew	13	54	( CD ) and coming to ( CE ) his hometown ( CF ) he taught them in their synagogue , so that ( CG ) they were astonished , and said , “ Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works ?
ESV	Matthew	13	55	( CH ) Is not this ( CI ) the carpenter 's son ? Is not his mother called Mary ? And are not ( CJ ) his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas ?
ESV	Matthew	13	56	And are not all his sisters with us ? Where then did this man get all these things ? ”
ESV	Matthew	13	57	And ( CK ) they took offense at him . But Jesus said to them , ( CL ) “ A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household. ”

ESV	Matthew	14	15	Now when it was evening , the disciples came to him and said , “ This is a desolate place , and the day is now over ; ( N ) send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves. ”

ESV	Matthew	21	23	( AL ) And when he entered the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him ( AM ) as he was teaching , and said , ( AN ) “ By what authority are you doing these things , and who gave you this authority ? ”
ESV	Matthew	21	24	Jesus answered them , “ I also will ask you one question , and if you tell me the answer , then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things .

ESV	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , ‘ From man , ’ ( AR ) we are afraid of the crowd , for they all hold that John was ( AS ) a prophet. ”
ESV	Matthew	21	27	So they answered Jesus , “ We do not know. ” And he said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . The Parable of the Two Sons
ESV	Matthew	21	28	( AT ) “ What do you think ? A man had two sons . And he went to the first and said , ‘ Son , go and work in ( AU ) the vineyard today. ’

ESV	Matthew	21	30	And he went to the other son and said the same . And he answered , ‘ I go , sir , ’ but did not go .

ESV	Matthew	21	33	( BD ) “ Hear another parable . There was a master of a house who planted ( BE ) a vineyard ( BF ) and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and ( BG ) leased it to tenants , and ( BH ) went into another country .

ESV	Matthew	21	38	But when the tenants saw the son , they said to themselves , ( BM ) ‘ This is the heir . Come , ( BN ) let us kill him and have his inheritance. ’
ESV	Matthew	21	39	And they took him and ( BO ) threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .
ESV	Matthew	21	40	( BP ) When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenants ? ”
ESV	Matthew	21	41	They said to him , ( BQ ) “ He will put those wretches to a miserable death and ( BR ) let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons. ”
ESV	Matthew	21	42	Jesus said to them , ( BS ) “ Have you never read in the Scriptures : ( BT ) “ ‘ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ; [ d ] this was the Lord 's doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ?

ESV	Matthew	22	2	( B ) “ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave ( C ) a wedding feast for his son ,

ESV	Matthew	22	12	And he said to him , ( O ) ‘ Friend , how did you get in here without a wedding garment ? ’ And he was speechless .
ESV	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the attendants , ‘ Bind him hand and foot and ( P ) cast him into the outer darkness . In that place ( Q ) there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ’
ESV	Matthew	22	14	For many are ( R ) called , but few are ( S ) chosen. ” Paying Taxes to Caesar
ESV	Matthew	22	15	( T ) Then the Pharisees went and plotted how ( U ) to entangle him in his words .
ESV	Matthew	22	16	And they sent ( V ) their disciples to him , along with ( W ) the Herodians , saying , “ Teacher , ( X ) we know that you are true and teach ( Y ) the way of God truthfully , and you do not care about anyone 's opinion , for ( Z ) you are not swayed by appearances . [ b ]
ESV	Matthew	22	17	Tell us , then , what you think . Is it lawful to pay ( AA ) taxes to ( AB ) Caesar , or not ? ”
ESV	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus , aware of their malice , said , “ Why ( AC ) put me to the test , you hypocrites ?
ESV	Matthew	22	19	Show me the coin for the tax. ” And they brought him a denarius . [ c ]
ESV	Matthew	22	20	And Jesus said to them , “ Whose likeness and inscription is this ? ”
ESV	Matthew	22	21	They said , “ Caesar's. ” Then he said to them , ( AD ) “ Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God's. ”
ESV	Matthew	22	23	The same day ( AF ) Sadducees came to him , ( AG ) who say that there is no resurrection , and they asked him a question ,
ESV	Matthew	22	24	saying , “ Teacher , Moses said , ( AH ) ‘ If a man dies having no children , his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. ’
ESV	Matthew	22	25	Now there were seven brothers among us . The first married and died , and having no offspring left his wife to his brother .
ESV	Matthew	22	26	So too the second and third , down to the seventh .
ESV	Matthew	22	27	After them all , the woman died .
ESV	Matthew	22	28	In the resurrection , therefore , of the seven , whose wife will she be ? For they all had her. ”
ESV	Matthew	22	29	But Jesus answered them , “ You are wrong , ( AI ) because you know neither the Scriptures nor ( AJ ) the power of God .
ESV	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither ( AK ) marry nor ( AL ) are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
ESV	Matthew	22	31	And as for the resurrection of the dead , ( AM ) have you not read what was said to you by God :
ESV	Matthew	22	32	( AN ) ‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? He is not God of the dead , but of the living. ”
ESV	Matthew	22	33	And when the crowd heard it , ( AO ) they were astonished at his teaching . The Great Commandment
ESV	Matthew	22	34	( AP ) But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced ( AQ ) the Sadducees , they gathered together .
ESV	Matthew	22	35	( AR ) And one of them , ( AS ) a lawyer , asked him a question ( AT ) to test him .
ESV	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , which is the great commandment in the Law ? ”
ESV	Matthew	22	37	And he said to him , ( AU ) “ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind .
ESV	Matthew	22	38	This is the great and first commandment .
ESV	Matthew	22	39	And ( AV ) a second is like it : ( AW ) You shall love your neighbor as yourself .

ESV	Matthew	22	41	( AZ ) Now while the Pharisees ( BA ) were gathered together , Jesus asked them a question ,
ESV	Matthew	22	42	saying , “ What do you think about ( BB ) the Christ ? Whose son is he ? ” They said to him , ( BC ) “ The son of David. ”
ESV	Matthew	22	43	He said to them , “ How is it then that David , ( BD ) in the Spirit , calls him Lord , saying ,
ESV	Matthew	22	44	( BE ) “ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand , until I put your enemies under your feet ” ’ ?

ESV	Matthew	26	43	And again he came and found them sleeping , for ( BO ) their eyes were heavy .
ESV	Matthew	26	44	So , leaving them again , he went away and prayed for ( BP ) the third time , saying the same words again .

ESV	Matthew	26	47	( BS ) While he was still speaking , ( BT ) Judas came , one of the twelve , and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs , from the chief priests and the elders of the people .

ESV	Matthew	26	52	Then Jesus said to him , “ Put your sword back into its place . For ( BY ) all who take the sword will perish by the sword .

ESV	Matthew	26	54	( CC ) But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled , that it must be so ? ”
ESV	Matthew	26	55	At that hour Jesus said to the crowds , “ Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs to capture me ? Day after day ( CD ) I sat in the temple ( CE ) teaching , and you did not seize me .
ESV	Matthew	26	56	But ( CF ) all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. ” ( CG ) Then all the disciples left him and fled . Jesus Before Caiaphas and the Council
ESV	Matthew	26	57	( CH ) Then ( CI ) those who had seized Jesus led him to ( CJ ) Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders had gathered .
ESV	Matthew	26	58	And ( CK ) Peter was following him at a distance , as far as ( CL ) the courtyard of the high priest , and going inside he sat with ( CM ) the guards to see the end .
ESV	Matthew	26	59	Now the chief priests and the whole council [ h ] ( CN ) were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death ,
ESV	Matthew	26	60	but they found none , ( CO ) though many false witnesses came forward . At last ( CP ) two came forward
ESV	Matthew	26	61	and said , “ This man said , ( CQ ) ‘ I am able to ( CR ) destroy the temple of God , and to rebuild it in three days. ’ ”
ESV	Matthew	26	62	And the high priest stood up and said , “ Have you no answer to make ? What is it that these men testify against you ? ” [ i ]
ESV	Matthew	26	63	( CS ) But Jesus remained silent . ( CT ) And the high priest said to him , ( CU ) “ I adjure you by ( CV ) the living God , ( CW ) tell us if you are ( CX ) the Christ , ( CY ) the Son of God. ”
ESV	Matthew	26	64	Jesus said to him , ( CZ ) “ You have said so . But I tell you , from now on ( DA ) you will see the Son of Man ( DB ) seated at the right hand of Power and ( DC ) coming on the clouds of heaven. ”
ESV	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest ( DD ) tore his robes and said , ( DE ) “ He has uttered blasphemy . What further witnesses do we need ? You have now heard his blasphemy .
ESV	Matthew	26	66	What is your judgment ? ” They answered , ( DF ) “ He deserves death. ”
ESV	Matthew	26	67	Then ( DG ) they spit in his face ( DH ) and ( DI ) struck him . And some slapped him ,
ESV	Matthew	26	68	saying , “ Prophesy to us , you ( DJ ) Christ ! Who is it that struck you ? ” Peter Denies Jesus
ESV	Matthew	26	69	( DK ) Now Peter was sitting outside ( DL ) in the courtyard . And a servant girl came up to him and said , “ You also were with Jesus the Galilean. ”
ESV	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it before them all , saying , “ I do not know what you mean. ”
ESV	Matthew	26	71	And when he went out to the entrance , another servant girl saw him , and she said to the bystanders , “ This man was with Jesus ( DM ) of Nazareth. ”
ESV	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied it with an oath : “ I do not know the man. ”
ESV	Matthew	26	73	After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter , “ Certainly you too are one of them , for ( DN ) your accent betrays you. ”
ESV	Matthew	26	74	Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear , “ I do not know the man. ” And immediately the rooster crowed .
ESV	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus , ( DO ) “ Before the rooster crows , you will ( DP ) deny me three times. ” And he went out and wept bitterly . Footnotes - Matthew 26:6 Leprosy was a term for several skin diseases ; see Leviticus

ESV	Matthew	27	5	And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple , ( J ) he departed , and he went and hanged himself .
ESV	Matthew	27	6	But the chief priests , taking the pieces of silver , said , “ It is not lawful to put them into ( K ) the treasury , since it is blood money. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	7	So they took counsel and bought with them the potter 's field as a burial place for strangers .
ESV	Matthew	27	8	Therefore ( L ) that field has been called the Field of Blood ( M ) to this day .
ESV	Matthew	27	9	( N ) Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah , saying , ( O ) “ And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel ,
ESV	Matthew	27	10	and they gave them for the potter 's field , as the Lord directed me. ” Jesus Before Pilate
ESV	Matthew	27	11	( P ) Now Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor asked him , “ Are you ( Q ) the King of the Jews ? ” Jesus said , ( R ) “ You have said so. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	12	( S ) But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he gave no answer .
ESV	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate said to him , ( T ) “ Do you not hear how many things they testify against you ? ”
ESV	Matthew	27	14	But he gave him no answer , not even to a single charge , so that the governor was greatly amazed . The Crowd Chooses Barabbas
ESV	Matthew	27	15	( U ) Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted .
ESV	Matthew	27	16	And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas .
ESV	Matthew	27	17	So when they had gathered , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you want me to release for you : Barabbas , or ( V ) Jesus who is called Christ ? ”
ESV	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that it was out ( W ) of envy that they had delivered him up .
ESV	Matthew	27	19	Besides , while he was sitting on ( X ) the judgment seat , his wife sent word to him , “ Have nothing to do with ( Y ) that righteous man , for I have suffered much because of him today ( Z ) in a dream. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	20	Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ( AA ) ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus .
ESV	Matthew	27	21	The governor again said to them , “ Which of the two do you want me to release for you ? ” And they said , “ Barabbas. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	22	Pilate said to them , “ Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? ” ( AB ) They all said , “ Let him be crucified ! ”
ESV	Matthew	27	23	And he said , “ Why ? ( AC ) What evil has he done ? ” But they shouted all the more , “ Let him be crucified ! ” Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified
ESV	Matthew	27	24	So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing , but rather that ( AD ) a riot was beginning , he took water and ( AE ) washed his hands before the crowd , saying , “ I am innocent of ( AF ) this man 's blood ; [ b ] ( AG ) see to it yourselves. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	25	And all the people answered , ( AH ) “ His blood be on us and ( AI ) on our children ! ”
ESV	Matthew	27	26	Then he released for them Barabbas , and having ( AJ ) scourged [ c ] Jesus , delivered him to be crucified . Jesus Is Mocked
ESV	Matthew	27	28	And they stripped him and put ( AN ) a scarlet robe on him ,
ESV	Matthew	27	29	and twisting together a crown of thorns , they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand . And kneeling before him , they ( AO ) mocked him , saying , “ Hail , ( AP ) King of the Jews ! ”
ESV	Matthew	27	30	And ( AQ ) they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head .
ESV	Matthew	27	31	And when they had mocked him , they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and ( AR ) led him away to crucify him . The Crucifixion
ESV	Matthew	27	32	( AS ) ( AT ) As they went out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name . They compelled this man to ( AU ) carry his cross .
ESV	Matthew	27	33	( AV ) And when they came to a place called Golgotha ( which means Place of a Skull ) ,
ESV	Matthew	27	34	( AW ) they offered him wine to drink , mixed with ( AX ) gall , but when he tasted it , he would not drink it .
ESV	Matthew	27	35	And when they had crucified him , ( AY ) they divided his garments among them by casting lots .
ESV	Matthew	27	36	Then they sat down and ( AZ ) kept watch over him there .
ESV	Matthew	27	37	And over his head they put the charge against him , which read , “ This is Jesus , ( BA ) the King of the Jews. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	38	Then two ( BB ) robbers were crucified with him , ( BC ) one on the right and one on the left .
ESV	Matthew	27	39	And ( BD ) those who passed by ( BE ) derided him , ( BF ) wagging their heads
ESV	Matthew	27	40	and saying , ( BG ) “ You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , save yourself ! ( BH ) If you are ( BI ) the Son of God , come down from the cross. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	41	So also the chief priests , with the scribes and elders , mocked him , saying ,
ESV	Matthew	27	42	( BJ ) “ He saved others ; ( BK ) he can not save himself . ( BL ) He is the King of Israel ; let him come down now from the cross , and we will believe in him .
ESV	Matthew	27	43	( BM ) He trusts in God ; let God deliver him now , if he desires him . For he said , ‘ I am the Son of God. ’ ”
ESV	Matthew	27	44	( BN ) And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way . The Death of Jesus
ESV	Matthew	27	45	Now from the sixth hour [ f ] there was darkness over all the land [ g ] until the ninth hour . [ h ]
ESV	Matthew	27	46	And about the ninth hour Jesus ( BO ) cried out with a loud voice , saying , ( BP ) “ Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? ” that is , “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
ESV	Matthew	27	47	And some of the bystanders , hearing it , said , “ This man is calling Elijah. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	48	And one of them at once ran and took a sponge , filled it with ( BQ ) sour wine , and put it on a reed and ( BR ) gave it to him to drink .
ESV	Matthew	27	49	But the others said , “ Wait , let us see whether Elijah will come to save him. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	50	And Jesus ( BS ) cried out again with a loud voice and ( BT ) yielded up his spirit .
ESV	Matthew	27	51	And behold , ( BU ) the curtain of the temple was torn in two , from top to bottom . And ( BV ) the earth shook , and the rocks were split .
ESV	Matthew	27	52	The tombs also were opened . And many bodies of ( BW ) the saints ( BX ) who had fallen asleep were raised ,
ESV	Matthew	27	53	and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into ( BY ) the holy city and appeared to many .
ESV	Matthew	27	54	( BZ ) When the centurion and those who were with him , ( CA ) keeping watch over Jesus , saw the earthquake and what took place , they were filled with awe and said , ( CB ) “ Truly this was the Son [ i ] of God ! ”
ESV	Matthew	27	55	There were also ( CC ) many women there , looking on ( CD ) from a distance , who had followed Jesus from Galilee , ( CE ) ministering to him ,
ESV	Matthew	27	56	among whom were ( CF ) Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and ( CG ) the mother of the sons of Zebedee . Jesus Is Buried
ESV	Matthew	27	57	( CH ) When it was evening , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who also was a disciple of Jesus .
ESV	Matthew	27	58	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him .
ESV	Matthew	27	59	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud
ESV	Matthew	27	60	and ( CI ) laid it in his own new tomb , ( CJ ) which he had cut in the rock . And he rolled ( CK ) a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away .
ESV	Matthew	27	61	Mary Magdalene and ( CL ) the other Mary were there , sitting opposite the tomb . The Guard at the Tomb
ESV	Matthew	27	62	The next day , that is , after the day of ( CM ) Preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
ESV	Matthew	27	63	and said , “ Sir , we remember how ( CN ) that impostor said , while he was still alive , ( CO ) ‘ After three days I will rise. ’
ESV	Matthew	27	64	Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day , ( CP ) lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people , ‘ He has risen from the dead , ’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said to them , “ You have ( CQ ) a guard [ j ] of soldiers . Go , make it as secure as you can. ”
ESV	Matthew	27	66	So they went and made the tomb secure by ( CR ) sealing the stone and setting a guard .

ESV	Matthew	28	28	( A ) Now after the Sabbath , toward the dawn of the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and ( B ) the other Mary went to see the tomb .
ESV	Matthew	28	2	And behold , there was a great earthquake , for ( C ) an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it .
ESV	Matthew	28	3	( D ) His appearance was like lightning , and ( E ) his clothing white as snow .
ESV	Matthew	28	4	And for fear of him the guards trembled and ( F ) became like dead men .
ESV	Matthew	28	5	But the angel said to the women , “ Do not be afraid , for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified .
ESV	Matthew	28	6	He is not here , for he has risen , ( G ) as he said . Come , see the place where he [ a ] lay .
ESV	Matthew	28	7	Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead , and behold , ( H ) he is going before you to Galilee ; there you will see him . See , I have told you. ”
ESV	Matthew	28	8	So they departed quickly from the tomb ( I ) with fear and great joy , and ran to tell his disciples .
ESV	Matthew	28	9	And behold , Jesus ( J ) met them and said , “ Greetings ! ” And they came up and ( K ) took hold of his feet and ( L ) worshiped him .
ESV	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus said to them , “ Do not be afraid ; ( M ) go and tell ( N ) my brothers to go to Galilee , and there they will see me. ” The Report of the Guard
ESV	Matthew	28	11	While they were going , behold , some of ( O ) the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place .
ESV	Matthew	28	12	And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel , they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers
ESV	Matthew	28	13	and said , “ Tell people , ( P ) ‘ His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep. ’
ESV	Matthew	28	14	And if this comes to ( Q ) the governor 's ears , we will ( R ) satisfy him and keep you out of trouble. ”

ESV	Mark	1	3	( D ) the voice of one crying in the wilderness : ( E ) ‘ Prepare [ c ] the way of the Lord , make his paths straight , ’ ”
ESV	Mark	1	4	( F ) John appeared , baptizing in ( G ) the wilderness and proclaiming ( H ) a baptism of ( I ) repentance ( J ) for the forgiveness of sins .
ESV	Mark	1	5	And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan , ( K ) confessing their sins .
ESV	Mark	1	6	Now John was ( L ) clothed with camel 's hair and ( M ) wore a leather belt around his waist and ate ( N ) locusts and ( O ) wild honey .
ESV	Mark	1	7	And he preached , saying , ( P ) “ After me comes he who is mightier than I , the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie .
ESV	Mark	1	8	( Q ) I have baptized you with water , but ( R ) he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. ” The Baptism of Jesus
ESV	Mark	1	9	( S ) In those days Jesus ( T ) came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan .

ESV	Mark	1	16	( AJ ) Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea , for they were fishermen .
ESV	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said to them , “ Follow me , and I will make you become ( AK ) fishers of men. ” [ f ]
ESV	Mark	1	18	And immediately they left their nets and followed him .
ESV	Mark	1	19	And going on a little farther , he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother , who were in their boat mending the nets .
ESV	Mark	1	20	And immediately he called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him . Jesus Heals a Man with an Unclean Spirit
ESV	Mark	1	21	( AL ) And they went into Capernaum , and immediately ( AM ) on the Sabbath ( AN ) he entered the synagogue and was teaching .
ESV	Mark	1	22	And ( AO ) they were astonished at his teaching , ( AP ) for he taught them as one who had authority , and not as the scribes .
ESV	Mark	1	23	And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit . And he cried out ,
ESV	Mark	1	24	( AQ ) “ What have you to do with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? ( AR ) I know who you are— ( AS ) the Holy One of God. ”
ESV	Mark	1	25	But Jesus ( AT ) rebuked him , saying , “ Be silent , and come out of him ! ”
ESV	Mark	1	26	And the unclean spirit , ( AU ) convulsing him and ( AV ) crying out with a loud voice , came out of him .
ESV	Mark	1	27	And they were all ( AW ) amazed , so that they questioned among themselves , saying , “ What is this ? ( AX ) A new teaching with authority ! He commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him. ”
ESV	Mark	1	28	And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee . Jesus Heals Many
ESV	Mark	1	29	( AY ) And immediately he [ g ] ( AZ ) left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
ESV	Mark	1	30	Now ( BA ) Simon 's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever , and immediately they told him about her .
ESV	Mark	1	31	And he came and ( BB ) took her by the hand and lifted her up , and the fever left her , and she began to serve them .
ESV	Mark	1	32	That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or ( BC ) oppressed by demons .
ESV	Mark	1	33	And the whole city was gathered together at the door .

ESV	Mark	1	37	and they found him and said to him , ( BH ) “ Everyone is looking for you. ”
ESV	Mark	1	38	And he said to them , “ Let us go on to the next towns , that I may preach there also , for ( BI ) that is why I came out. ”
ESV	Mark	1	39	( BJ ) And ( BK ) he went throughout all Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons . Jesus Cleanses a Leper
ESV	Mark	1	40	( BL ) And a leper [ h ] came to him , imploring him , and ( BM ) kneeling said to him , ( BN ) “ If you will , you can make me clean. ”

ESV	Mark	1	42	And immediately the leprosy left him , and he was made clean .

ESV	Mark	2	2	And many were gathered together , so that there was no more room , not even at the door . And he was preaching the word to them .
ESV	Mark	2	3	( B ) And they came , bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men .
ESV	Mark	2	4	And when they could not get near him because of the crowd , ( C ) they removed the roof above him , and when they had made an opening , they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay .
ESV	Mark	2	5	And when Jesus ( D ) saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , “ Son , ( E ) your sins are forgiven. ”
ESV	Mark	2	6	Now some of the scribes were sitting there , questioning in their hearts ,
ESV	Mark	2	7	“ Why does this man speak like that ? ( F ) He is blaspheming ! ( G ) Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
ESV	Mark	2	8	And immediately Jesus , ( H ) perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves , said to them , “ Why do you question these things in your hearts ?
ESV	Mark	2	9	Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise , take up your bed and walk ’ ?
ESV	Mark	2	10	But that you may know that ( I ) the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —he said to the paralytic—
ESV	Mark	2	11	“ I say to you , rise , pick up your bed , and go home. ”
ESV	Mark	2	12	And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all , so that they were all amazed and ( J ) glorified God , saying , “ We never saw anything like this ! ” Jesus Calls Levi
ESV	Mark	2	13	He went out again beside the sea , and ( K ) all the crowd was coming to him , and he was teaching them .
ESV	Mark	2	14	( L ) And as he passed by , he saw ( M ) Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth , and he said to him , “ Follow me. ” And he rose and followed him .
ESV	Mark	2	15	And as he reclined at table in his house , many ( N ) tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many who followed him .
ESV	Mark	2	16	And ( O ) the scribes of [ a ] the Pharisees , when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors , said to his disciples , ( P ) “ Why does he eat [ b ] with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
ESV	Mark	2	17	And when Jesus heard it , he said to them , “ Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick . ( Q ) I came not to call the righteous , ( R ) but sinners. ” A Question About Fasting
ESV	Mark	2	18	Now ( S ) John 's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting . And people came and said to him , ( T ) “ Why do John 's disciples and ( U ) the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but your disciples do not fast ? ”
ESV	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said to them , ( V ) “ Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast .
ESV	Mark	2	20	( W ) The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and ( X ) then they will fast in that day .
ESV	Mark	2	21	No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment . If he does , the patch tears away from it , the new from the old , and a worse tear is made .
ESV	Mark	2	22	And no one puts new wine into old ( Y ) wineskins . If he does , the wine will burst the skins—and the wine is destroyed , and so are the skins . But new wine is for fresh wineskins. ” [ c ] Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath
ESV	Mark	2	23	( Z ) One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields , and as they made their way , his disciples ( AA ) began to pluck heads of grain .
ESV	Mark	2	24	And the Pharisees were saying to him , “ Look , ( AB ) why are they doing ( AC ) what is not lawful on the Sabbath ? ”
ESV	Mark	2	25	And he said to them , ( AD ) “ Have you never read ( AE ) what David did , when he was in need and was hungry , he and those who were with him :
ESV	Mark	2	26	how he entered the house of God , in the time of [ d ] ( AF ) Abiathar the high priest , and ate ( AG ) the bread of the Presence , which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat , and also gave it to those who were with him ? ”
ESV	Mark	2	27	And he said to them , ( AH ) “ The Sabbath was made for man , ( AI ) not man for the Sabbath .
ESV	Mark	2	28	So ( AJ ) the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath. ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Mark	3	3	And he said to the man with the withered hand , “ Come here. ”
ESV	Mark	3	2	And ( C ) they watched Jesus , [ a ] to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath , so that they might accuse him .
ESV	Mark	3	4	And he said to them , ( D ) “ Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm , to save life or to kill ? ” But they were silent .
ESV	Mark	3	5	And he ( E ) looked around at them with anger , grieved at ( F ) their hardness of heart , and said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” ( G ) He stretched it out , and his hand was restored .
ESV	Mark	3	6	( H ) The Pharisees went out and immediately ( I ) held counsel with ( J ) the Herodians against him , how to destroy him . A Great Crowd Follows Jesus
ESV	Mark	3	7	( K ) Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea , and ( L ) a great crowd followed , from Galilee and Judea
ESV	Mark	3	8	and Jerusalem and ( M ) Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around ( N ) Tyre and Sidon . When the great crowd heard all that he was doing , they came to him .
ESV	Mark	3	9	And he told his disciples to ( O ) have a boat ready for him because of the crowd , lest they ( P ) crush him ,
ESV	Mark	3	10	for ( Q ) he had healed many , so that all who had ( R ) diseases pressed around him ( S ) to touch him .
ESV	Mark	3	11	( T ) And whenever the unclean spirits saw him , they ( U ) fell down before him and cried out , “ You are ( V ) the Son of God. ”
ESV	Mark	3	12	And ( W ) he strictly ordered them not to make him known . The Twelve Apostles
ESV	Mark	3	13	( X ) And he went up on the mountain and called to him those ( Y ) whom he desired , and they came to him .
ESV	Mark	3	14	( Z ) And he appointed twelve ( whom he also named apostles ) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach
ESV	Mark	3	15	( AA ) and have authority to cast out demons .
ESV	Mark	3	16	He appointed the twelve : ( AB ) Simon ( to whom ( AC ) he gave the name Peter ) ;
ESV	Mark	3	17	( AD ) James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James ( to whom he gave the name Boanerges , that is , Sons of Thunder ) ;
ESV	Mark	3	18	Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and ( AE ) Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Zealot , [ b ]
ESV	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him .
ESV	Mark	3	20	Then he went ( AF ) home , and the crowd gathered again , ( AG ) so that they could not even eat .
ESV	Mark	3	21	( AH ) And when ( AI ) his family heard it , they went out to seize him , for they were saying , “ He ( AJ ) is out of his mind. ” Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit
ESV	Mark	3	22	And ( AK ) the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying , ( AL ) “ He is possessed by Beelzebul , ” and “ by the prince of demons he casts out the demons. ”
ESV	Mark	3	23	( AM ) And he called them to him and said to them in parables , “ How can Satan cast out Satan ?
ESV	Mark	3	24	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
ESV	Mark	3	25	And if a house is divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand .
ESV	Mark	3	26	And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided , he can not stand , but is coming to an end .
ESV	Mark	3	27	But ( AN ) no one can enter a strong man 's house and plunder his goods , unless he first binds the strong man . ( AO ) Then indeed he may plunder his house .
ESV	Mark	3	28	( AP ) “ Truly , I say to you , all sins will be forgiven the children of man , and whatever blasphemies they utter ,
ESV	Mark	3	29	but whoever ( AQ ) blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness , but is guilty of an eternal sin ” —
ESV	Mark	3	30	for they were saying , “ He has an unclean spirit. ” Jesus ' Mother and Brothers
ESV	Mark	3	31	( AR ) And his mother and his ( AS ) brothers came , and standing outside they sent to him and called him .
ESV	Mark	3	32	And a crowd was sitting around him , and they said to him , “ Your mother and your brothers [ c ] are outside , seeking you. ”
ESV	Mark	3	33	And he answered them , “ Who are my mother and my brothers ? ”
ESV	Mark	3	34	And ( AT ) looking about at those who sat around him , he said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers !

ESV	Mark	4	4	And as he sowed , some seed fell along the path , and the birds came and devoured it .
ESV	Mark	4	2	And ( C ) he was teaching them many things in parables , and in his teaching he said to them :
ESV	Mark	4	3	“ Listen ! Behold , ( D ) a sower went out to sow .
ESV	Mark	4	5	Other seed fell on rocky ground , where it did not have much soil , and immediately it sprang up , since it had no depth of soil .
ESV	Mark	4	6	And ( E ) when the sun rose , it was scorched , and since it had no root , ( F ) it withered away .
ESV	Mark	4	7	Other seed fell among ( G ) thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked it , and it yielded no grain .
ESV	Mark	4	8	And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain , growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and ( H ) a hundredfold. ”
ESV	Mark	4	9	And he said , ( I ) “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear. ” The Purpose of the Parables
ESV	Mark	4	10	And ( J ) when he was alone , those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables .
ESV	Mark	4	11	And he said to them , ( K ) “ To you has been given ( L ) the secret of the kingdom of God , but for ( M ) those outside everything is in parables ,
ESV	Mark	4	12	( N ) so that “ ‘ they ( O ) may indeed see but not perceive , and may indeed hear but not understand , lest they ( P ) should turn and be forgiven. ’ ”
ESV	Mark	4	13	( Q ) And he said to them , “ Do you not understand this parable ? How then will you understand all the parables ?
ESV	Mark	4	14	( R ) The sower sows ( S ) the word .
ESV	Mark	4	15	And these are the ones along the path , where the word is sown : when they hear , Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them .
ESV	Mark	4	16	And these are the ones sown on rocky ground : the ones who , when they hear the word , immediately receive it ( T ) with joy .
ESV	Mark	4	17	And they have no root in themselves , but ( U ) endure for a while ; then , when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word , immediately ( V ) they fall away . [ a ]
ESV	Mark	4	18	And others are the ones sown among thorns . They are those who hear the word ,
ESV	Mark	4	19	but ( W ) the cares of ( X ) the world and ( Y ) the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word , and it proves unfruitful .
ESV	Mark	4	20	But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and ( Z ) bear fruit , ( AA ) thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold. ” A Lamp Under a Basket
ESV	Mark	4	21	( AB ) And he said to them , ( AC ) “ Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket , or under a bed , and not on a stand ?
ESV	Mark	4	22	( AD ) For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest ; nor is anything secret except to come to light .
ESV	Mark	4	23	( AE ) If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear. ”
ESV	Mark	4	24	And he said to them , “ Pay attention to what you hear : ( AF ) with the measure you use , it will be measured to you , and still more will be added to you .
ESV	Mark	4	25	( AG ) For to the one who has , more will be given , and from the one who has not , even what he has will be taken away. ” The Parable of the Seed Growing
ESV	Mark	4	26	And he said , ( AH ) “ The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground .
ESV	Mark	4	27	He sleeps and rises night and day , and the seed sprouts and grows ; ( AI ) he knows not how .
ESV	Mark	4	28	The earth produces by itself , first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
ESV	Mark	4	29	But when the grain is ripe , at once ( AJ ) he puts in the sickle , because the harvest has come. ” The Parable of the Mustard Seed
ESV	Mark	4	30	( AK ) And he said , “ With what can we compare the kingdom of God , or what parable shall we use for it ?
ESV	Mark	4	31	It is like ( AL ) a grain of mustard seed , which , when sown on the ground , is the smallest of all the seeds on earth ,
ESV	Mark	4	32	yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches , so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade. ”
ESV	Mark	4	33	( AM ) With many such parables he spoke ( AN ) the word to them , ( AO ) as they were able to hear it .
ESV	Mark	4	34	He did not speak to them ( AP ) without a parable , but ( AQ ) privately to his own disciples he ( AR ) explained everything . Jesus Calms a Storm
ESV	Mark	4	35	( AS ) On that day , when evening had come , he said to them , “ Let us go across to the other side. ”
ESV	Mark	4	36	And leaving the crowd , they took him with them in the boat , just as he was . And other boats were with him .
ESV	Mark	4	37	And a great windstorm arose , and the waves ( AT ) were breaking into the boat , so that the boat was already filling .
ESV	Mark	4	38	But he was in the stern , asleep on the cushion . And they woke him and said to him , “ Teacher , do you not care that we are perishing ? ”
ESV	Mark	4	39	And he awoke and ( AU ) rebuked the wind and said to the sea , “ Peace ! Be still ! ” And the wind ceased , and ( AV ) there was a great calm .
ESV	Mark	4	40	He said to them , “ Why are you ( AW ) so afraid ? Have you still no faith ? ”
ESV	Mark	4	41	And they were filled with great fear and said to one another , ( AX ) “ Who then is this , that even ( AY ) the wind and the sea obey him ? ” Footnotes - Mark 4:17 Or stumble The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Mark	5	5	Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones .
ESV	Mark	5	2	And when Jesus [ b ] had stepped out of the boat , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit .
ESV	Mark	5	3	( B ) He lived among the tombs . And no one could bind him anymore , not even with a chain ,
ESV	Mark	5	4	for he had often been bound with shackles and chains , but he wrenched the chains apart , and he broke the shackles in pieces . No one had the strength to subdue him .
ESV	Mark	5	6	And when he saw Jesus from afar , he ran and ( C ) fell down before him .
ESV	Mark	5	7	And ( D ) crying out with a loud voice , he said , “ What have you to do with me , Jesus , ( E ) Son of ( F ) the Most High God ? ( G ) I adjure you by God , do not torment me. ”
ESV	Mark	5	8	For he was saying to him , “ Come out of the man , you unclean spirit ! ”
ESV	Mark	5	9	And Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He replied , “ My name is ( H ) Legion , for we are many. ”
ESV	Mark	5	10	And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country .
ESV	Mark	5	11	Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside ,
ESV	Mark	5	12	and they begged him , saying , “ Send us to the pigs ; let us enter them. ”
ESV	Mark	5	13	So he gave them permission . And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs ; and the herd , numbering about two thousand , rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the sea .
ESV	Mark	5	14	The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country . And people came to see what it was that had happened .
ESV	Mark	5	15	And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed [ c ] man , the one who had had ( I ) the legion , sitting there , ( J ) clothed and in his right mind , and they were afraid .
ESV	Mark	5	16	And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs .
ESV	Mark	5	17	And ( K ) they began to beg Jesus [ d ] to depart from their region .
ESV	Mark	5	18	As he was getting into the boat , the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him .
ESV	Mark	5	19	And he did not permit him but said to him , “ Go home to your friends and ( L ) tell them how much the Lord has done for you , and how he has had mercy on you. ”
ESV	Mark	5	20	And he went away and began to proclaim in ( M ) the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him , and everyone marveled . Jesus Heals a Woman and Jairus 's Daughter
ESV	Mark	5	21	And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side , a great crowd gathered about him , and he was beside the sea .
ESV	Mark	5	22	( N ) Then came one of ( O ) the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name , and seeing him , he fell at his feet
ESV	Mark	5	23	and implored him earnestly , saying , “ My little daughter is at the point of death . Come and ( P ) lay your hands on her , so that she may be made well and live. ”
ESV	Mark	5	24	And he went with him . And a great crowd followed him and ( Q ) thronged about him .
ESV	Mark	5	25	And there was a woman ( R ) who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years ,
ESV	Mark	5	26	and who had suffered much under many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was no better but rather grew worse .
ESV	Mark	5	27	She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment .
ESV	Mark	5	28	For she said , “ If I touch even his garments , I will be made well. ”
ESV	Mark	5	29	( S ) And immediately the flow of blood dried up , and she felt in her body that she was healed of her ( T ) disease .
ESV	Mark	5	30	And Jesus , perceiving in himself that ( U ) power had gone out from him , immediately turned about in the crowd and said , “ Who touched my garments ? ”
ESV	Mark	5	31	And his disciples said to him , “ You see the crowd pressing around you , and yet you say , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
ESV	Mark	5	32	And he looked around to see who had done it .
ESV	Mark	5	33	But the woman , knowing what had happened to her , came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth .
ESV	Mark	5	34	And he said to her , “ Daughter , ( V ) your faith has made you well ; ( W ) go in peace , and be healed of your ( X ) disease. ”
ESV	Mark	5	35	While he was still speaking , there came from ( Y ) the ruler 's house some who said , “ Your daughter is dead . Why ( Z ) trouble ( AA ) the Teacher any further ? ”
ESV	Mark	5	36	But overhearing [ e ] what they said , Jesus said to ( AB ) the ruler of the synagogue , “ Do not fear , only believe. ”
ESV	Mark	5	37	And he allowed no one to follow him except ( AC ) Peter and James and ( AD ) John the brother of James .
ESV	Mark	5	38	They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and Jesus [ f ] saw a commotion , people weeping and wailing loudly .
ESV	Mark	5	39	And when he had entered , he said to them , ( AE ) “ Why are you making a commotion and weeping ? The child is not dead but ( AF ) sleeping. ”
ESV	Mark	5	40	And they laughed at him . But he ( AG ) put them all outside and took the child 's father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was .
ESV	Mark	5	41	( AH ) Taking her by the hand he said to her , “ Talitha cumi , ” which means , “ Little girl , I say to you , ( AI ) arise. ”
ESV	Mark	5	42	And immediately the girl got up and began walking ( for she was twelve years of age ) , and they were immediately overcome with amazement .

ESV	Mark	6	6	And ( L ) he marveled because of their unbelief . ( M ) And he went about among the villages teaching . Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Apostles
ESV	Mark	6	2	And ( C ) on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue , and ( D ) many who heard him were astonished , saying , “ Where did this man get these things ? What is the wisdom given to him ? How are such mighty works done by his hands ?
ESV	Mark	6	3	( E ) Is not this ( F ) the carpenter , the son of Mary and ( G ) brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon ? And are not his sisters here with us ? ” And ( H ) they took offense at him .
ESV	Mark	6	4	And Jesus said to them , ( I ) “ A prophet is not without honor , except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household. ”
ESV	Mark	6	5	And ( J ) he could do no mighty work there , except that ( K ) he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them .
ESV	Mark	6	7	( N ) And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two , and gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
ESV	Mark	6	8	He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread , no bag , no money in their belts—
ESV	Mark	6	9	but to ( O ) wear sandals and not put on two tunics . [ a ]
ESV	Mark	6	10	And he said to them , “ Whenever you enter a house , stay there until you depart from there .
ESV	Mark	6	11	And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you , when you leave , ( P ) shake off the dust that is on your feet ( Q ) as a testimony against them. ”
ESV	Mark	6	12	( R ) So they went out and ( S ) proclaimed ( T ) that people should repent .
ESV	Mark	6	13	( U ) And they cast out many demons and ( V ) anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them . The Death of John the Baptist
ESV	Mark	6	14	( W ) King Herod heard of it , for Jesus ' [ b ] name had become known . Some [ c ] said , ( X ) “ John the Baptist [ d ] has been raised from the dead . That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him. ”
ESV	Mark	6	15	( Y ) But others said , “ He is Elijah. ” And others said , “ He is ( Z ) a prophet , like one of the prophets of old. ”
ESV	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard of it , he said , “ John , whom I beheaded , has been raised. ”
ESV	Mark	6	17	( AA ) For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and ( AB ) bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife , because he had married her .
ESV	Mark	6	18	( AC ) For John had been saying to Herod , ( AD ) “ It is not lawful for you to have your brother 's wife. ”
ESV	Mark	6	19	And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death . But she could not ,
ESV	Mark	6	20	for Herod ( AE ) feared John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and he kept him safe . When he heard him , he was greatly perplexed , and yet he ( AF ) heard him gladly .
ESV	Mark	6	21	But an opportunity came when Herod ( AG ) on his birthday ( AH ) gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee .
ESV	Mark	6	22	For when Herodias 's daughter came in and danced , she pleased Herod and his guests . And the king said to the girl , “ Ask me for whatever you wish , and I will give it to you. ”
ESV	Mark	6	23	And he vowed to her , “ Whatever you ask me , I will give you , ( AI ) up to half of my kingdom. ”
ESV	Mark	6	24	And she went out and said to her mother , “ For what should I ask ? ” And she said , “ The head of John the Baptist. ”
ESV	Mark	6	25	And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked , saying , “ I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter. ”
ESV	Mark	6	26	And the king was exceedingly sorry , but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her .
ESV	Mark	6	27	And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John 's [ e ] head . He went and beheaded him in the prison
ESV	Mark	6	28	and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother .
ESV	Mark	6	29	When his ( AJ ) disciples heard of it , they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb . Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand
ESV	Mark	6	30	( AK ) ( AL ) The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught .
ESV	Mark	6	31	And he said to them , “ Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while. ” For many were coming and going , and ( AM ) they had no leisure even to eat .
ESV	Mark	6	32	( AN ) And they went away in ( AO ) the boat to a desolate place by themselves .
ESV	Mark	6	33	Now many saw them going and ( AP ) recognized them , and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them .
ESV	Mark	6	34	When he went ashore he ( AQ ) saw a great crowd , and ( AR ) he had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd . And he began to teach them many things .
ESV	Mark	6	35	And when it grew late , his disciples came to him and said , “ This is a desolate place , and the hour is now late .
ESV	Mark	6	36	( AS ) Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat. ”
ESV	Mark	6	37	But he answered them , ( AT ) “ You give them something to eat. ” And ( AU ) they said to him , ( AV ) “ Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii [ f ] worth of bread and give it to them to eat ? ”
ESV	Mark	6	38	And he said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go and see. ” And when they had found out , they said , ( AW ) “ Five , and two fish. ”
ESV	Mark	6	39	Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass .
ESV	Mark	6	40	So they sat down in groups , by hundreds and by fifties .
ESV	Mark	6	41	And taking the five loaves and the two fish , he ( AX ) looked up to heaven and ( AY ) said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people . And he divided the two fish among them all .
ESV	Mark	6	42	And they all ate and were satisfied .
ESV	Mark	6	43	And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish .
ESV	Mark	6	44	And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men . Jesus Walks on the Water
ESV	Mark	6	45	( AZ ) Immediately he ( BA ) made his disciples get into ( BB ) the boat and go before him to the other side , ( BC ) to Bethsaida , while he dismissed the crowd .
ESV	Mark	6	46	And after he had taken leave of them , ( BD ) he went up on the mountain to pray .
ESV	Mark	6	47	And when ( BE ) evening came , the boat was out on the sea , and he was alone on the land .
ESV	Mark	6	48	And he saw that they were making headway painfully , for the wind was against them . And about ( BF ) the fourth watch of the night [ g ] he came to them , walking on the sea . ( BG ) He meant to pass by them ,
ESV	Mark	6	49	but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost , and cried out ,
ESV	Mark	6	50	for they all saw him and ( BH ) were terrified . But immediately he spoke to them and said , ( BI ) “ Take heart ; it is I . ( BJ ) Do not be afraid. ”
ESV	Mark	6	51	And he got into the boat with them , and the wind ceased . And they were utterly astounded ,
ESV	Mark	6	52	for ( BK ) they did not understand about the loaves , but their hearts ( BL ) were hardened . Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret
ESV	Mark	6	53	( BM ) When they had crossed over , they came to land at ( BN ) Gennesaret and moored to the shore .
ESV	Mark	6	54	And when they got out of the boat , the people immediately ( BO ) recognized him
ESV	Mark	6	55	and ran about the whole region and began to bring ( BP ) the sick people ( BQ ) on their beds to wherever they heard he was .
ESV	Mark	6	56	And wherever he came , in villages , cities , or countryside , ( BR ) they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even ( BS ) the fringe of his garment . And ( BT ) as many as touched it were made well . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Mark	7	7	in vain do they worship me , teaching as ( N ) doctrines the commandments of men. ’
ESV	Mark	7	2	they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were ( C ) defiled , that is , unwashed .
ESV	Mark	7	3	( For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly , [ a ] holding to ( D ) the tradition of ( E ) the elders ,
ESV	Mark	7	4	and when they come from the marketplace , they do not eat unless they wash. [ b ] And there are many other traditions that they observe , such as ( F ) the washing of ( G ) cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches . [ c ] )
ESV	Mark	7	5	And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him , “ Why do your disciples not walk according to ( H ) the tradition of ( I ) the elders , ( J ) but eat with ( K ) defiled hands ? ”
ESV	Mark	7	6	And he said to them , “ Well did Isaiah prophesy of you ( L ) hypocrites , as it is written , ( M ) “ ‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their heart is far from me ;
ESV	Mark	7	8	You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men. ”
ESV	Mark	7	9	And he said to them , “ You have a fine way of ( O ) rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition !
ESV	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , ( P ) ‘ Honor your father and your mother ’ ; and , ( Q ) ‘ Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die. ’
ESV	Mark	7	11	But you say , ‘ If a man tells his father or his mother , “ Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban ” ’ ( that is , given to God ) [ d ] —
ESV	Mark	7	12	then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother ,
ESV	Mark	7	13	thus ( R ) making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down . And many such things you do. ” What Defiles a Person
ESV	Mark	7	14	And he called the people to him again and said to them , ( S ) “ Hear me , all of you , and understand :
ESV	Mark	7	15	( T ) There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him , but the things that come out of a person are what defile him. ” [ e ]
ESV	Mark	7	17	And when he had entered ( U ) the house and left the people , ( V ) his disciples asked him about the parable .
ESV	Mark	7	18	And he said to them , “ Then ( W ) are you also without understanding ? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside can not defile him ,
ESV	Mark	7	19	since it enters not his heart ( X ) but his stomach , and is expelled ? ” [ f ] ( ( Y ) Thus he declared all foods clean . )
ESV	Mark	7	20	And he said , ( Z ) “ What comes out of a person is what defiles him .
ESV	Mark	7	21	For from within , out of the heart of man , come evil thoughts , sexual immorality , theft , ( AA ) murder , adultery ,
ESV	Mark	7	22	coveting , wickedness , deceit , ( AB ) sensuality , ( AC ) envy , ( AD ) slander , ( AE ) pride , ( AF ) foolishness .
ESV	Mark	7	23	( AG ) All these evil things come from within , and they defile a person. ” The Syrophoenician Woman 's Faith
ESV	Mark	7	24	And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon . [ g ] And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know , yet he could not be hidden .
ESV	Mark	7	25	But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet .
ESV	Mark	7	26	( AH ) Now the woman was a ( AI ) Gentile , ( AJ ) a Syrophoenician by birth . And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter .
ESV	Mark	7	27	And he said to her , “ Let the children be ( AK ) fed first , for it is not right to take the children 's bread and ( AL ) throw it to the dogs. ”
ESV	Mark	7	28	But she answered him , “ Yes , Lord ; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children 's ( AM ) crumbs. ”
ESV	Mark	7	29	And he said to her , “ For this statement you may ( AN ) go your way ; the demon has left your daughter. ”
ESV	Mark	7	30	And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone . Jesus Heals a Deaf Man
ESV	Mark	7	31	( AO ) Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to ( AP ) the Sea of Galilee , in the region of the ( AQ ) Decapolis .
ESV	Mark	7	32	And they brought to him ( AR ) a man who was deaf and ( AS ) had a speech impediment , and they begged him to ( AT ) lay his hand on him .
ESV	Mark	7	33	And ( AU ) taking him aside from the crowd privately , he put his fingers into his ears , and ( AV ) after spitting touched his tongue .
ESV	Mark	7	34	And ( AW ) looking up to heaven , ( AX ) he sighed and said to him , “ Ephphatha , ” that is , “ Be opened. ”
ESV	Mark	7	35	( AY ) And his ears were opened , his tongue was released , and he spoke plainly .
ESV	Mark	7	36	And ( AZ ) Jesus [ h ] charged them to tell no one . But ( BA ) the more he charged them , the more zealously they proclaimed it .

ESV	Mark	8	3	And if I send them away hungry to their homes , they will faint on the way . And some of them have come from far away. ”

ESV	Mark	8	11	( J ) The Pharisees came and began to argue with him , ( K ) seeking from him ( L ) a sign from heaven ( M ) to test him .
ESV	Mark	8	12	And ( N ) he sighed deeply ( O ) in his spirit and said , “ Why does this generation seek a sign ? Truly , I say to you , no sign will be given to this generation. ”
ESV	Mark	8	13	And ( P ) he left them , got into the boat again , and went to the other side . The Leaven of the Pharisees and Herod

ESV	Mark	8	18	( X ) Having eyes do you not see , and having ears do you not hear ? And do you not remember ?
ESV	Mark	8	19	When I broke ( Y ) the five loaves for the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? ” They said to him , “ Twelve. ”

ESV	Mark	8	27	( AG ) And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi . And on the way he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that I am ? ”

ESV	Mark	9	24	Immediately the father of the child cried out [ d ] and said , “ I believe ; ( AJ ) help my unbelief ! ”
ESV	Mark	9	25	And when Jesus saw that ( AK ) a crowd came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , ( AL ) “ You mute and deaf spirit , I command you , come out of him and never enter him again. ”
ESV	Mark	9	26	And after crying out and ( AM ) convulsing him terribly , it came out , and the boy was like a corpse , so that most of them said , “ He is dead. ”
ESV	Mark	9	27	But Jesus ( AN ) took him by the hand and lifted him up , and he arose .
ESV	Mark	9	28	And when he had ( AO ) entered the house , his disciples asked him privately , “ Why could we not cast it out ? ”

ESV	Mark	10	6	But ( G ) from the beginning of creation , ‘ God made them ( H ) male and female. ’
ESV	Mark	10	7	( I ) ‘ Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife , [ a ]
ESV	Mark	10	8	and ( J ) the two shall become one flesh. ’ So they are no longer two but one flesh .
ESV	Mark	10	9	( K ) What therefore God has joined together , let not man separate. ”
ESV	Mark	10	11	And he said to them , ( L ) “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her ,
ESV	Mark	10	12	and ( M ) if she divorces her husband and marries another , she commits adultery. ” Let the Children Come to Me
ESV	Mark	10	13	( N ) And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them , and the disciples ( O ) rebuked them .
ESV	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw it , he was indignant and said to them , ( P ) “ Let the children come to me ; ( Q ) do not hinder them , for to such belongs the kingdom of God .
ESV	Mark	10	15	( R ) Truly , I say to you , whoever does not ( S ) receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it. ”
ESV	Mark	10	16	And ( T ) he took them in his arms and blessed them , ( U ) laying his hands on them . The Rich Young Man
ESV	Mark	10	17	( V ) And as he was setting out on his journey , a man ran up and ( W ) knelt before him and asked him , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to ( X ) inherit eternal life ? ”
ESV	Mark	10	18	And Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone .
ESV	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments : ( Y ) ‘ Do not murder , Do not commit adultery , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Do not defraud , Honor your father and mother. ’ ”
ESV	Mark	10	20	And he said to him , “ Teacher , ( Z ) all these I have kept from my youth. ”
ESV	Mark	10	21	And Jesus , ( AA ) looking at him , ( AB ) loved him , and said to him , “ You lack one thing : go , ( AC ) sell all that you have and give to the poor , and you will have ( AD ) treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me. ”
ESV	Mark	10	22	( AE ) Disheartened by the saying , he went away sorrowful , for he had great possessions .
ESV	Mark	10	23	And Jesus ( AF ) looked around and said to his disciples , ( AG ) “ How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter ( AH ) the kingdom of God ! ”
ESV	Mark	10	24	And the disciples ( AI ) were amazed at his words . But Jesus said to them again , ( AJ ) “ Children , ( AK ) how difficult it is [ b ] to enter ( AL ) the kingdom of God !
ESV	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter ( AM ) the kingdom of God. ”
ESV	Mark	10	26	And they were exceedingly astonished , and said to him , [ c ] “ Then who can be saved ? ”
ESV	Mark	10	27	Jesus ( AN ) looked at them and said , ( AO ) “ With man it is impossible , but not with God . For all things are possible with God. ”
ESV	Mark	10	28	Peter began to say to him , “ See , ( AP ) we have left everything and followed you. ”
ESV	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , “ Truly , I say to you , ( AQ ) there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands , for my sake and ( AR ) for the gospel ,
ESV	Mark	10	30	who will not receive a hundredfold ( AS ) now in this time , houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands , ( AT ) with persecutions , and in ( AU ) the age to come eternal life .
ESV	Mark	10	31	But ( AV ) many who are first will be last , and the last first. ” Jesus Foretells His Death a Third Time
ESV	Mark	10	32	( AW ) And they were on the road , going up to Jerusalem , and ( AX ) Jesus was walking ahead of them . And ( AY ) they were amazed , and those who followed were afraid . And taking the twelve again , he began to tell them what was to happen to him ,
ESV	Mark	10	33	saying , “ See , ( AZ ) we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes , and they will ( BA ) condemn him to death and ( BB ) deliver him over to the Gentiles .
ESV	Mark	10	34	And they will ( BC ) mock him and ( BD ) spit on him , and flog him and kill him . And ( BE ) after three days he will rise. ” The Request of James and John
ESV	Mark	10	35	( BF ) And James and John , ( BG ) the sons of Zebedee , came up to him and said to him , “ Teacher , we want you to do for us ( BH ) whatever we ask of you. ”
ESV	Mark	10	36	And he said to them , ( BI ) “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
ESV	Mark	10	37	And they said to him , “ Grant us ( BJ ) to sit , one at your right hand and one at your left , ( BK ) in your glory. ”
ESV	Mark	10	38	Jesus said to them , ( BL ) “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able ( BM ) to drink the cup that I drink , or ( BN ) to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ? ”
ESV	Mark	10	39	And they said to him , “ We are able. ” And Jesus said to them , ( BO ) “ The cup that I drink ( BP ) you will drink , and with the baptism with which I am baptized , ( BQ ) you will be baptized ,
ESV	Mark	10	40	but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant , ( BR ) but it is for those for whom it has been ( BS ) prepared. ”
ESV	Mark	10	41	And when the ten heard it , they began to be indignant at James and John .
ESV	Mark	10	42	( BT ) And Jesus called them to him and said to them , “ You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles ( BU ) lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
ESV	Mark	10	43	But ( BV ) it shall not be so among you . But whoever would be great among you must be your servant , [ d ]
ESV	Mark	10	44	and whoever would be first among you must be ( BW ) slave [ e ] of all .
ESV	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of Man came not to be served but ( BX ) to serve , and ( BY ) to give his life as a ransom for ( BZ ) many. ” Jesus Heals Blind Bartimaeus
ESV	Mark	10	46	( CA ) And they came to Jericho . And ( CB ) as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd , Bartimaeus , ( CC ) a blind beggar , the son of Timaeus , was sitting by the roadside .
ESV	Mark	10	47	And when he heard that it was ( CD ) Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out and say , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
ESV	Mark	10	48	And many ( CE ) rebuked him , telling him to be silent . But he cried out all the more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
ESV	Mark	10	49	And Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him. ” And they called the blind man , saying to him , ( CF ) “ Take heart . Get up ; he is calling you. ”
ESV	Mark	10	50	And throwing off his ( CG ) cloak , he sprang up and came to Jesus .
ESV	Mark	10	51	And Jesus said to him , ( CH ) “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” And the blind man said to him , ( CI ) “ Rabbi , let me recover my sight. ”
ESV	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said to him , “ Go your way ; ( CJ ) your faith has ( CK ) made you well. ” And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him on the way .

ESV	Mark	11	11	( O ) And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple . And when he had looked around at everything , as it was already late , ( P ) he went out to Bethany with the twelve . Jesus Curses the Fig Tree
ESV	Mark	11	2	and said to them , “ Go into the village in front of you , and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied , ( E ) on which no one has ever sat . Untie it and bring it .
ESV	Mark	11	3	If anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately. ’ ”
ESV	Mark	11	4	And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street , and they untied it .
ESV	Mark	11	5	And some of those standing there said to them , “ What are you doing , untying the colt ? ”
ESV	Mark	11	6	And they told them what Jesus had said , and they let them go .
ESV	Mark	11	7	And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it , and he sat on it .
ESV	Mark	11	8	And many ( F ) spread their cloaks on the road , and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields .
ESV	Mark	11	9	And those who went before and those who followed were shouting , ( G ) “ Hosanna ! ( H ) Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
ESV	Mark	11	10	Blessed is ( I ) the coming ( J ) kingdom of ( K ) our father ( L ) David ! ( M ) Hosanna ( N ) in the highest ! ”
ESV	Mark	11	12	( Q ) On the following day , when they came from Bethany , ( R ) he was hungry .
ESV	Mark	11	13	( S ) And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf , he went to see if he could find anything on it . When he came to it , he found nothing but leaves , for ( T ) it was not the season for figs .
ESV	Mark	11	14	And he said to it , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again. ” And his disciples heard it . Jesus Cleanses the Temple
ESV	Mark	11	15	( U ) And they came to Jerusalem . And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple , and he overturned the tables of ( V ) the money-changers and the seats of those who sold ( W ) pigeons .
ESV	Mark	11	16	And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple .
ESV	Mark	11	17	And he was teaching them and saying to them , “ Is it not written , ( X ) ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ’ ? But ( Y ) you have made it a den of robbers. ”
ESV	Mark	11	18	And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and ( Z ) were seeking a way to destroy him , for they feared him , because ( AA ) all the crowd was astonished at his teaching .
ESV	Mark	11	19	( AB ) And when evening came they [ b ] went out of the city . The Lesson from the Withered Fig Tree
ESV	Mark	11	20	( AC ) As they passed by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots .
ESV	Mark	11	21	And Peter remembered and said to him , ( AD ) “ Rabbi , look ! The fig tree that you cursed has withered. ”
ESV	Mark	11	22	And Jesus answered them , “ Have ( AE ) faith in God .
ESV	Mark	11	23	( AF ) Truly , I say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ( AG ) ‘ Be taken up and thrown into the sea , ’ and does not ( AH ) doubt in his heart , but ( AI ) believes that what he says will come to pass , it will be done for him .
ESV	Mark	11	24	Therefore I tell you , ( AJ ) whatever you ask in prayer , ( AK ) believe that you ( AL ) have received [ c ] it , and it will be yours .
ESV	Mark	11	25	And whenever ( AM ) you stand praying , ( AN ) forgive , ( AO ) if you have anything against anyone , so that ( AP ) your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. ” [ d ] The Authority of Jesus Challenged
ESV	Mark	11	27	( AQ ) And they came again to Jerusalem . And as he was walking in the temple , the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him ,
ESV	Mark	11	28	and they said to him , ( AR ) “ By what authority are you doing these things , or who gave you this authority to do them ? ”
ESV	Mark	11	29	Jesus said to them , “ I will ask you one question ; answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
ESV	Mark	11	30	Was the baptism of John ( AS ) from heaven or from man ? Answer me. ”
ESV	Mark	11	31	And they discussed it with one another , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ( AT ) ‘ Why then did you not believe him ? ’
ESV	Mark	11	32	But shall we say , ‘ From man ’ ? ” — ( AU ) they were afraid of the people , for they all held that John really was ( AV ) a prophet .
ESV	Mark	11	33	So they answered Jesus , “ We do not know. ” And Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. ” Footnotes - Mark 11:1 Greek he - Mark 11:19 Some manuscripts he - Mark 11:24 Some manuscripts are receiving - Mark 11:25 Some manuscripts add verse

ESV	Mark	12	2	When the season came , he sent a servant [ a ] to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard .
ESV	Mark	12	3	( F ) And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed .

ESV	Mark	12	5	( K ) And he sent another , and him they killed . And so with many others : some they beat , and some they killed .
ESV	Mark	12	6	He had still one other , ( L ) a beloved son . ( M ) Finally he sent him to them , saying , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
ESV	Mark	12	7	But those tenants said to one another , ( N ) ‘ This is the heir . Come , ( O ) let us kill him , and the inheritance will be ours. ’
ESV	Mark	12	8	And they took him and killed him and ( P ) threw him out of the vineyard .
ESV	Mark	12	9	What will the owner of the vineyard do ? ( Q ) He will ( R ) come and destroy the tenants and ( S ) give the vineyard to others .
ESV	Mark	12	10	( T ) Have you not read ( U ) this Scripture : ( V ) “ ‘ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ; [ b ]
ESV	Mark	12	11	this was the Lord 's doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ? ”
ESV	Mark	12	13	( Z ) And they sent to him some of ( AA ) the Pharisees and some of ( AB ) the Herodians , to ( AC ) trap him in his talk .
ESV	Mark	12	14	And they came and said to him , “ Teacher , ( AD ) we know that you are true and do not care about anyone 's opinion . For ( AE ) you are not swayed by appearances , [ c ] but truly teach ( AF ) the way of God . Is it lawful to pay ( AG ) taxes to ( AH ) Caesar , or not ? Should we pay them , or should we not ? ”
ESV	Mark	12	15	But , knowing ( AI ) their hypocrisy , he said to them , “ Why ( AJ ) put me to the test ? Bring me ( AK ) a denarius [ d ] and let me look at it. ”
ESV	Mark	12	16	And they brought one . And he said to them , “ Whose likeness and inscription is this ? ” They said to him , “ Caesar's. ”
ESV	Mark	12	17	Jesus said to them , ( AL ) “ Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God's. ” And they marveled at him . The Sadducees Ask About the Resurrection
ESV	Mark	12	18	And ( AM ) Sadducees came to him , ( AN ) who say that there is no resurrection . And they asked him a question , saying ,
ESV	Mark	12	19	“ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that ( AO ) if a man 's brother dies and leaves a wife , but leaves no child , the man [ e ] must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother .
ESV	Mark	12	20	There were seven brothers ; the first took a wife , and when he died left no offspring .
ESV	Mark	12	21	And the second took her , and died , leaving no offspring . And the third likewise .
ESV	Mark	12	22	And the seven left no offspring . Last of all the woman also died .
ESV	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection , when they rise again , whose wife will she be ? For the seven had her as wife. ”
ESV	Mark	12	24	Jesus said to them , “ Is this not the reason you are wrong , because ( AP ) you know neither the Scriptures nor ( AQ ) the power of God ?
ESV	Mark	12	25	For when they rise from the dead , they neither ( AR ) marry nor ( AS ) are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
ESV	Mark	12	26	And as for the dead being raised , ( AT ) have you not read in ( AU ) the book of Moses , in ( AV ) the passage about the bush , how God spoke to him , saying , ( AW ) ‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ?
ESV	Mark	12	27	He is not God of the dead , but of the living . You are quite wrong. ” The Great Commandment
ESV	Mark	12	28	( AX ) And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another , and seeing that he answered them well , asked him , “ Which commandment is the most important of all ? ”
ESV	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered , “ The most important is , ( AY ) ‘ Hear , O Israel : The Lord our God , ( AZ ) the Lord is one .
ESV	Mark	12	30	And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. ’
ESV	Mark	12	31	( BA ) The second is this : ( BB ) ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’ There is no other commandment ( BC ) greater than these. ”
ESV	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said to him , “ You are right , Teacher . You have truly said that ( BD ) he is one , and ( BE ) there is no other besides him .
ESV	Mark	12	33	And to love him with all the heart and with all ( BF ) the understanding and with all the strength , and to love one 's neighbor as oneself , ( BG ) is much more than all ( BH ) whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. ”
ESV	Mark	12	34	And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely , he said to him , “ You are not far from the kingdom of God. ” ( BI ) And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions . Whose Son Is the Christ ?
ESV	Mark	12	35	( BJ ) And as ( BK ) Jesus taught in the temple , he said , “ How can the scribes say that ( BL ) the Christ is the son of David ?
ESV	Mark	12	36	David himself , ( BM ) in the Holy Spirit , declared , ( BN ) “ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand , until I put your enemies ( BO ) under your feet. ” ’
ESV	Mark	12	37	David himself calls him Lord . So ( BP ) how is he his son ? ” And the great throng ( BQ ) heard him gladly . Beware of the Scribes
ESV	Mark	12	38	( BR ) And in his teaching he said , “ Beware of the scribes , who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces
ESV	Mark	12	39	and have the best seats in the synagogues and ( BS ) the places of honor at feasts ,
ESV	Mark	12	40	( BT ) who devour widows ' houses and ( BU ) for a pretense make long prayers . They will receive the greater condemnation. ” The Widow 's Offering
ESV	Mark	12	41	( BV ) And he sat down opposite ( BW ) the treasury and watched the people ( BX ) putting money into the offering box . Many rich people put in large sums .
ESV	Mark	12	42	And a poor widow came and put in two ( BY ) small copper coins , which make a penny . [ f ]
ESV	Mark	12	43	And he called his disciples to him and said to them , “ Truly , I say to you , ( BZ ) this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box .
ESV	Mark	12	44	For they all contributed out of their abundance , but she out of her ( CA ) poverty has put in everything she had , all ( CB ) she had to live on. ” Footnotes - Mark 12:2 Or bondservant ; also verse

ESV	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , ( G ) when will these things be , and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished ? ”
ESV	Mark	13	5	And Jesus began to say to them , ( H ) “ See that no one leads you astray .
ESV	Mark	13	6	( I ) Many will come in my name , saying , ( J ) ‘ I am he ! ’ and they will lead many astray .
ESV	Mark	13	7	And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars , ( K ) do not be alarmed . This ( L ) must take place , but the end is not yet .
ESV	Mark	13	8	For ( M ) nation will rise against nation , and ( N ) kingdom against kingdom . There will be ( O ) earthquakes in various places ; there will be ( P ) famines . These are but the beginning of the birth pains .
ESV	Mark	13	9	( Q ) “ But ( R ) be on your guard . For they will deliver you over to councils , and you will be beaten ( S ) in synagogues , and you will stand before ( T ) governors and ( U ) kings for my sake , ( V ) to bear witness before them .
ESV	Mark	13	10	And the gospel must first be proclaimed ( W ) to all nations .
ESV	Mark	13	11	And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over , ( X ) do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say , but say ( Y ) whatever is given you in that hour , ( Z ) for it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spirit .
ESV	Mark	13	12	( AA ) And brother will deliver brother over to death , and the father his child , and children will rise against parents and have them put to death .
ESV	Mark	13	14	“ But when you see ( AD ) the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not to be ( ( AE ) let the reader understand ) , then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains .
ESV	Mark	13	15	( AF ) Let the one who is on ( AG ) the housetop not go down , nor enter his house , to take anything out ,
ESV	Mark	13	16	and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak .
ESV	Mark	13	17	And ( AH ) alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days !
ESV	Mark	13	18	Pray that it may not happen in winter .
ESV	Mark	13	19	For in those days there will be ( AI ) such ( AJ ) tribulation as has not been ( AK ) from the beginning of the creation that ( AL ) God created until now , and never will be .
ESV	Mark	13	20	And if the Lord had not cut short the days , no human being would be saved . But for ( AM ) the sake of the elect , whom ( AN ) he chose , he shortened the days .
ESV	Mark	13	21	And ( AO ) then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Christ ! ’ or ‘ Look , there he is ! ’ do not believe it .
ESV	Mark	13	22	( AP ) For false christs and false prophets will arise and ( AQ ) perform signs and wonders , ( AR ) to lead astray , if possible , ( AS ) the elect .
ESV	Mark	13	23	But ( AT ) be on guard ; ( AU ) I have told you all things beforehand . The Coming of the Son of Man
ESV	Mark	13	24	“ But in those days , after ( AV ) that tribulation , ( AW ) the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ,
ESV	Mark	13	25	and ( AX ) the stars will be falling from heaven , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken .
ESV	Mark	13	26	And then they will see ( AY ) the Son of Man coming in clouds ( AZ ) with great power and glory .
ESV	Mark	13	27	And then ( BA ) he will send out the angels and ( BB ) gather ( BC ) his elect from ( BD ) the four winds , from ( BE ) the ends of the earth ( BF ) to the ends of heaven . The Lesson of the Fig Tree
ESV	Mark	13	28	“ From the fig tree learn its lesson : as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves , you know that summer is near .
ESV	Mark	13	29	So also , when you see these things taking place , you know that he is near , ( BG ) at the very gates .
ESV	Mark	13	30	( BH ) Truly , I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things take place .

ESV	Luke	5	17	On one of those days , as he was teaching , Pharisees and ( W ) teachers of the law were sitting there , who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem . And ( X ) the power of the Lord was with him to heal . [ d ]
ESV	Luke	5	18	( Y ) And behold , some men were bringing ( Z ) on a bed a man who was paralyzed , and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus ,
ESV	Luke	5	19	but finding no way to bring him in , because of the crowd , they went up on ( AA ) the roof and let him down with his bed ( AB ) through the tiles into the midst before Jesus .
ESV	Luke	5	20	And ( AC ) when he saw their faith , he said , “ Man , ( AD ) your sins are forgiven you. ”
ESV	Luke	5	21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question , saying , “ Who is this who speaks ( AE ) blasphemies ? ( AF ) Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
ESV	Luke	5	22	When Jesus ( AG ) perceived their thoughts , he answered them , “ Why do you question in your hearts ?
ESV	Luke	5	23	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise and walk ’ ?
ESV	Luke	5	24	But that you may know that ( AH ) the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —he said to the man who was paralyzed— “ I say to you , rise , pick up your bed and go home. ”
ESV	Luke	5	25	And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home , ( AI ) glorifying God .
ESV	Luke	5	26	And amazement seized them all , and they ( AJ ) glorified God and were filled ( AK ) with awe , saying , “ We have seen extraordinary things today. ” Jesus Calls Levi
ESV	Luke	5	27	( AL ) After this he went out and saw ( AM ) a tax collector named ( AN ) Levi , sitting at the tax booth . And he said to him , “ Follow me. ”
ESV	Luke	5	28	And ( AO ) leaving everything , he rose and followed him .
ESV	Luke	5	29	And Levi made him a great feast in his house , and there was a large company ( AP ) of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them .
ESV	Luke	5	30	And the Pharisees and ( AQ ) their scribes grumbled at his disciples , saying , ( AR ) “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
ESV	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answered them , “ Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick .
ESV	Luke	5	32	( AS ) I have not come to call the righteous ( AT ) but sinners ( AU ) to repentance. ” A Question About Fasting
ESV	Luke	5	33	And they said to him , ( AV ) “ The disciples of John ( AW ) fast often and ( AX ) offer prayers , ( AY ) and so do the disciples of the Pharisees , but yours eat and drink. ”
ESV	Luke	5	34	And Jesus said to them , ( AZ ) “ Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them ?
ESV	Luke	5	35	( BA ) The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and ( BB ) then they will fast in those days. ”
ESV	Luke	5	36	He also told them a parable : “ No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment . If he does , he will tear the new , and the piece from the new will not match the old .
ESV	Luke	5	37	And no one puts new wine into old ( BC ) wineskins . If he does , the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled , and the skins will be destroyed .
ESV	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins .
ESV	Luke	5	39	And no one after drinking old wine desires new , for he says , ‘ The old is good. ’ ” [ e ] The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Luke	6	6	On another Sabbath , ( J ) he entered the synagogue ( K ) and was teaching , and a man was there whose right hand was withered .
ESV	Luke	6	2	But some of the Pharisees said , ( C ) “ Why are you doing ( D ) what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath ? ”
ESV	Luke	6	3	And Jesus answered them , ( E ) “ Have you not read ( F ) what David did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him :
ESV	Luke	6	4	how he entered the house of God and took and ate ( G ) the bread of the Presence , ( H ) which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat , and also gave it to those with him ? ”
ESV	Luke	6	5	And he said to them , ( I ) “ The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath. ” A Man with a Withered Hand
ESV	Luke	6	7	And the scribes and the Pharisees ( L ) watched him , to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath , ( M ) so that they might find a reason to accuse him .
ESV	Luke	6	8	But ( N ) he knew their thoughts , and he said to the man with the withered hand , “ Come and stand here. ” And he rose and stood there .
ESV	Luke	6	9	And Jesus said to them , “ I ask you , ( O ) is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm , to save life or to destroy it ? ”
ESV	Luke	6	10	And ( P ) after looking around at them all he said to him , “ Stretch out your hand. ” And ( Q ) he did so , and his hand was restored .
ESV	Luke	6	11	But they were filled with ( R ) fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus . The Twelve Apostles
ESV	Luke	6	12	In these days ( S ) he went out to the mountain to pray , and all night he continued in prayer to God .
ESV	Luke	6	13	And when day came , ( T ) he called his disciples ( U ) and ( V ) chose from them twelve , whom he named ( W ) apostles :

ESV	Luke	6	17	And ( AD ) he came down with them and stood on a level place , with ( AE ) a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of ( AF ) Tyre and Sidon ,
ESV	Luke	6	18	who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases . ( AG ) And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured .
ESV	Luke	6	19	And all the crowd ( AH ) sought to touch him , for ( AI ) power came out from him and healed them all . The Beatitudes
ESV	Luke	6	20	And ( AJ ) he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , ( AK ) and said : “ Blessed are you who are poor , for ( AL ) yours is the kingdom of God .
ESV	Luke	6	21	( AM ) “ Blessed are you who are hungry now , for you shall be satisfied . ( AN ) “ Blessed are you who weep now , for you shall laugh .
ESV	Luke	6	22	“ Blessed are you when ( AO ) people hate you and when they ( AP ) exclude you and revile you and ( AQ ) spurn your name as evil , ( AR ) on account of the Son of Man !

ESV	Luke	6	28	( BF ) bless those who curse you , ( BG ) pray for those who abuse you .
ESV	Luke	6	29	( BH ) To one who ( BI ) strikes you on the cheek , offer the other also , and from one who takes away your cloak do not withhold your tunic [ b ] either .
ESV	Luke	6	30	( BJ ) Give to everyone who begs from you , and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back .
ESV	Luke	6	31	And ( BK ) as you wish that others would do to you , do so to them .
ESV	Luke	6	32	( BL ) “ If you love those who love you , what benefit is that to you ? For even sinners love those who love them .
ESV	Luke	6	33	And if you do good to those who do good to you , what benefit is that to you ? For even sinners do the same .
ESV	Luke	6	34	And ( BM ) if you ( BN ) lend to those from whom you expect to receive , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners , to get back the same amount .
ESV	Luke	6	35	But ( BO ) love your enemies , and do good , and lend , expecting nothing in return , and your reward will be great , and ( BP ) you will be sons of ( BQ ) the Most High , for ( BR ) he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil .
ESV	Luke	6	36	( BS ) Be merciful , even as ( BT ) your Father is merciful . Judging Others
ESV	Luke	6	37	( BU ) ( BV ) “ Judge not , and you will not be judged ; condemn not , and you will not be condemned ; ( BW ) forgive , and you will be forgiven ;
ESV	Luke	6	38	( BX ) give , and it will be given to you . Good measure , pressed down , shaken together , running over , will be put ( BY ) into your lap . For ( BZ ) with the measure you use it will be measured back to you. ”
ESV	Luke	6	39	He also told them a parable : ( CA ) “ Can a blind man lead a blind man ? Will they not both fall into a pit ?
ESV	Luke	6	40	( CB ) A disciple is not above his teacher , but everyone when he is ( CC ) fully trained will be like his teacher .
ESV	Luke	6	41	( CD ) Why do you see the speck that is in your brother 's eye , but ( CE ) do not notice the log that is in your own eye ?
ESV	Luke	6	42	How can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me take out the speck that is in your eye , ’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye ? You hypocrite , first take the log out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother 's eye . A Tree and Its Fruit
ESV	Luke	6	43	“ For ( CF ) no good tree bears bad fruit , nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit ,

ESV	Luke	7	7	Therefore I did not presume to come to you . But ( F ) say the word , and let my servant be healed .
ESV	Luke	7	2	Now a centurion had a servant [ a ] who was sick and at the point of death , who was highly valued by him .
ESV	Luke	7	3	When the centurion [ b ] heard about Jesus , ( B ) he sent to him elders of the Jews , asking him to come and heal his servant .
ESV	Luke	7	4	And when they came to Jesus , they pleaded with him earnestly , saying , ( C ) “ He is worthy to have you do this for him ,
ESV	Luke	7	5	for he loves our nation , and he is the one who built us ( D ) our synagogue. ”
ESV	Luke	7	6	And Jesus went with them . When he was not far from the house , the centurion sent friends , saying to him , “ Lord , ( E ) do not trouble yourself , for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof .
ESV	Luke	7	8	For I too am a man set under authority , with soldiers under me : and I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it. ”
ESV	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard these things , ( G ) he marveled at him , and turning to the crowd that followed him , said , “ I tell you , not even in Israel have I found such ( H ) faith. ”
ESV	Luke	7	10	And when those who had been sent returned to the house , they found the servant well . Jesus Raises a Widow 's Son
ESV	Luke	7	11	Soon afterward [ c ] he went to a town called Nain , and his disciples and a great crowd went with him .
ESV	Luke	7	12	As he drew near to the gate of the town , behold , a man who had died was being carried out , ( I ) the only son of his mother , and she was a widow , and a considerable crowd from the town was with her .
ESV	Luke	7	13	And when the Lord saw her , ( J ) he had compassion on her and ( K ) said to her , “ Do not weep. ”
ESV	Luke	7	14	Then he came up and touched ( L ) the bier , and the bearers stood still . And he said , “ Young man , I say to you , ( M ) arise. ”
ESV	Luke	7	15	And the dead man sat up and began to speak , and Jesus [ d ] ( N ) gave him to his mother .
ESV	Luke	7	16	Fear seized them all , and ( O ) they glorified God , saying , ( P ) “ A great prophet has arisen among us ! ” and ( Q ) “ God has visited his people ! ”
ESV	Luke	7	17	And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country . Messengers from John the Baptist
ESV	Luke	7	18	( R ) ( S ) The disciples of John reported all these things to him . And John ,
ESV	Luke	7	19	calling two of his disciples to him , sent them to the Lord , saying , “ Are you the one ( T ) who is to come , or ( U ) shall we look for another ? ”
ESV	Luke	7	20	And when the men had come to him , they said , “ John the Baptist has sent us to you , saying , ‘ Are you the one ( V ) who is to come , or ( W ) shall we look for another ? ’ ”
ESV	Luke	7	21	In that hour ( X ) he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits , and ( Y ) on many who were blind he bestowed sight .
ESV	Luke	7	22	And he answered them , “ Go and tell John what you have seen and heard : ( Z ) the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , ( AA ) lepers [ e ] are cleansed , and ( AB ) the deaf hear , ( AC ) the dead are raised up , ( AD ) the poor have good news preached to them .
ESV	Luke	7	23	And blessed is the one who is ( AE ) not offended by me. ”
ESV	Luke	7	24	When John 's messengers had gone , Jesus [ f ] began to speak to the crowds concerning John : “ What did you go out ( AF ) into the wilderness to see ? ( AG ) A reed shaken by the wind ?
ESV	Luke	7	25	What then did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothing ? Behold , those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings ' courts .
ESV	Luke	7	26	What then did you go out to see ? ( AH ) A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
ESV	Luke	7	27	This is he of whom it is written , ( AI ) “ ‘ Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you. ’
ESV	Luke	7	28	I tell you , among those born of women none is greater than John . Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. ”
ESV	Luke	7	29	( ( AJ ) When all the people heard this , and ( AK ) the tax collectors too , they declared God just , [ g ] ( AL ) having been baptized with ( AM ) the baptism of John ,
ESV	Luke	7	30	( AN ) but the Pharisees and ( AO ) the lawyers ( AP ) rejected ( AQ ) the purpose of God for themselves , not having been baptized by him . )
ESV	Luke	7	31	“ To what then shall I compare the people of this generation , and what are they like ?
ESV	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another , “ ‘ We played the flute for you , and you did not dance ; we sang a dirge , and you did not weep. ’
ESV	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist has come ( AR ) eating no bread and ( AS ) drinking no wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon. ’
ESV	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man has come ( AT ) eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Look at him ! A glutton and a drunkard , ( AU ) a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’
ESV	Luke	7	35	Yet ( AV ) wisdom is justified by all her children. ” A Sinful Woman Forgiven
ESV	Luke	7	36	( AW ) One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him , and he went into the Pharisee 's house and reclined at table .
ESV	Luke	7	37	( AX ) And behold , a woman of the city , who was a sinner , when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee 's house , brought an alabaster flask of ointment ,
ESV	Luke	7	38	and standing behind him at his feet , weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears and ( AY ) wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment .
ESV	Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this , he said to himself , “ If ( AZ ) this man were ( BA ) a prophet , he ( BB ) would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him , for she is a sinner. ”
ESV	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answering said to him , “ Simon , I have something to say to you. ” And he answered , “ Say it , Teacher. ”
ESV	Luke	7	41	“ A certain moneylender had two debtors . One owed five hundred ( BC ) denarii , and the other fifty .
ESV	Luke	7	42	( BD ) When they could not pay , he ( BE ) cancelled the debt of both . Now which of them will love him more ? ”
ESV	Luke	7	43	Simon answered , “ The one , I suppose , for whom he cancelled the larger debt. ” And he said to him , “ You have judged rightly. ”
ESV	Luke	7	44	Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I entered your house ; ( BF ) you gave me no water for my feet , but ( BG ) she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
ESV	Luke	7	45	( BH ) You gave me no kiss , but from the time I came in she has not ceased to ( BI ) kiss my feet .
ESV	Luke	7	46	( BJ ) You did not anoint my head with oil , but she has anointed my feet with ointment .
ESV	Luke	7	47	Therefore I tell you , her sins , ( BK ) which are many , are forgiven—for she loved much . But he who is forgiven little , loves little. ”
ESV	Luke	7	48	And he said to her , ( BL ) “ Your sins are forgiven. ”
ESV	Luke	7	49	Then those who were at table with him began to say among [ h ] themselves , ( BM ) “ Who is this , who even forgives sins ? ”

ESV	Luke	8	2	and also ( C ) some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities : ( D ) Mary , called Magdalene , ( E ) from whom seven demons had gone out ,
ESV	Luke	8	3	and ( F ) Joanna , the wife of Chuza , Herod 's household manager , and Susanna , and many others , who provided for them [ a ] out of their means . The Parable of the Sower
ESV	Luke	8	4	( G ) And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him , he said in a parable ,
ESV	Luke	8	5	( H ) “ A sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot , and the birds of the air devoured it .
ESV	Luke	8	6	And some fell on the rock , and as it grew up , ( I ) it withered away , because it had no moisture .
ESV	Luke	8	7	And some fell among ( J ) thorns , and the thorns grew up with it and choked it .
ESV	Luke	8	9	And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant ,
ESV	Luke	8	10	he said , ( M ) “ To you it has been given to know ( N ) the secrets of the kingdom of God , but for others they are in parables , so ( O ) that ‘ seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand. ’
ESV	Luke	8	11	( P ) Now the parable is this : The seed is ( Q ) the word of God .
ESV	Luke	8	12	The ones along the path are those who have heard ; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts , so that they may not ( R ) believe and be saved .
ESV	Luke	8	13	And the ones on the rock are those who , when they hear the word , receive it ( S ) with joy . But these have no root ; they ( T ) believe for a while , and in time of testing ( U ) fall away .
ESV	Luke	8	14	And as for what fell among the thorns , they are those who hear , but ( V ) as they go on their way they are choked by the ( W ) cares and riches and pleasures of life , and their fruit does not mature .
ESV	Luke	8	15	As for that in the good soil , they are those who , hearing the word , hold it fast in an honest and good heart , and ( X ) bear fruit ( Y ) with patience . A Lamp Under a Jar
ESV	Luke	8	16	( Z ) ( AA ) “ No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed , but puts it on a stand , so that those who enter may see the light .
ESV	Luke	8	17	( AB ) For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest , nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light .
ESV	Luke	8	18	( AC ) Take care then how you hear , ( AD ) for to the one who has , more will be given , and from the one who has not , even what he thinks that he has will be taken away. ” Jesus ' Mother and Brothers
ESV	Luke	8	19	( AE ) Then his mother and ( AF ) his brothers [ b ] came to him , but they could not reach him because of the crowd .
ESV	Luke	8	20	,
ESV	Luke	8	21	- Luke 8:26 Some manuscripts Gadarenes ; others Gergesenes ; also verse
ESV	Luke	8	22	( AH ) One day he got into a boat with his disciples , and he said to them , “ Let us go across to the other side of ( AI ) the lake. ” So they set out ,
ESV	Luke	8	23	and as they sailed he fell asleep . And a windstorm came down on ( AJ ) the lake , and they were filling with water and were in danger .
ESV	Luke	8	24	And they went and woke him , saying , “ Master , Master , we are perishing ! ” And he awoke and ( AK ) rebuked the wind and the raging waves , and they ceased , ( AL ) and there was a calm .
ESV	Luke	8	25	He said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” And they ( AM ) were afraid , and they ( AN ) marveled , saying to one another , “ Who then is this , that ( AO ) he commands even winds and water , and they obey him ? ” Jesus Heals a Man with a Demon
ESV	Luke	8	26	( AP ) Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes , [ c ] which is opposite Galilee .
ESV	Luke	8	27	When Jesus [ d ] had stepped out on land , there met him a man from the city who had demons . For a long time he had worn no clothes , and he had not lived in a house ( AQ ) but among the tombs .
ESV	Luke	8	28	When he saw Jesus , he ( AR ) cried out and fell down before him and said ( AS ) with a loud voice , “ What have you to do with me , Jesus , ( AT ) Son of ( AU ) the Most High God ? I beg you , do not torment me. ”
ESV	Luke	8	29	For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . ( For many a time it had seized him . He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles , but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon ( AV ) into the desert . )
ESV	Luke	8	30	Jesus then asked him , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , ( AW ) “ Legion , ” for many demons had entered him .
ESV	Luke	8	31	And they begged him not to command them to depart into ( AX ) the abyss .
ESV	Luke	8	32	Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside , and they begged him to let them enter these . So he gave them permission .
ESV	Luke	8	33	Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into ( AY ) the lake and drowned .
ESV	Luke	8	34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened , they fled and told it in the city and in the country .
ESV	Luke	8	35	Then people went out to see what had happened , and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone , sitting ( AZ ) at the feet of Jesus , ( BA ) clothed and in his right mind , and they were afraid .
ESV	Luke	8	36	And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed [ e ] man had been healed .

ESV	Luke	8	39	“ Return to your home , and ( BC ) declare how much God has done for you. ” And he went away , proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him . Jesus Heals a Woman and Jairus 's Daughter
ESV	Luke	8	40	Now when Jesus returned , the crowd ( BD ) welcomed him , for they were all waiting for him .
ESV	Luke	8	41	( BE ) And there came a man named Jairus , who was ( BF ) a ruler of the synagogue . And falling at Jesus ' feet , he implored him to come to his house ,

ESV	Luke	8	43	And there was a woman ( BI ) who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years , and though she had spent all her ( BJ ) living on physicians , [ f ] she could not be healed by anyone .
ESV	Luke	8	44	She came up behind him and touched ( BK ) the fringe of his garment , and ( BL ) immediately her discharge of blood ceased .
ESV	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , “ Who was it that touched me ? ” When all denied it , Peter [ g ] said , “ Master , the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you ! ”
ESV	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone touched me , for I perceive that ( BM ) power has gone out from me. ”
ESV	Luke	8	47	And when the woman saw that she was not hidden , she came trembling , and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him , and how she had been immediately healed .
ESV	Luke	8	48	And he said to her , “ Daughter , ( BN ) your faith has made you well ; ( BO ) go in peace. ”
ESV	Luke	8	49	While he was still speaking , someone from ( BP ) the ruler 's house came and said , “ Your daughter is dead ; ( BQ ) do not trouble ( BR ) the Teacher any more. ”
ESV	Luke	8	50	But Jesus on hearing this answered him , “ Do not fear ; only believe , and she will be well. ”
ESV	Luke	8	51	And when he came to the house , he allowed no one to enter with him , except ( BS ) Peter and ( BT ) John and James , and the father and mother of the child .

ESV	Luke	9	7	( J ) Now ( K ) Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening , and he was perplexed , because it was said by some that ( L ) John had been raised from the dead ,
ESV	Luke	9	8	( M ) by some that Elijah had appeared , and ( N ) by others that one of the prophets of old had risen .
ESV	Luke	9	10	On their return ( P ) the apostles told him all that they had done . ( Q ) And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida .
ESV	Luke	9	11	When the crowds learned it , they followed him , and he ( R ) welcomed them and ( S ) spoke to them of the kingdom of God and ( T ) cured those who had need of healing .
ESV	Luke	9	12	Now ( U ) the day began to wear away , and the twelve came and said to him , ( V ) “ Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions , for we are here in a desolate place. ”
ESV	Luke	9	13	But he said to them , ( W ) “ You give them something to eat. ” They said , “ We have no more than ( X ) five loaves and two fish—unless we are to go and buy food for all these people. ”
ESV	Luke	9	14	For there were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , “ Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each. ”
ESV	Luke	9	15	And they did so , and had them all sit down .
ESV	Luke	9	16	And taking the five loaves and the two fish , ( Y ) he looked up to heaven and ( Z ) said a blessing over them . Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd .

ESV	Luke	9	20	Then he said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” And Peter answered , ( AD ) “ The Christ of God. ” Jesus Foretells His Death

ESV	Luke	9	23	And he said to all , “ If anyone would come after me , let him ( AK ) deny himself and ( AL ) take up his cross ( AM ) daily and follow me .
ESV	Luke	9	24	For ( AN ) whoever would save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it .
ESV	Luke	9	25	( AO ) For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself ?
ESV	Luke	9	26	For ( AP ) whoever is ashamed of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be ashamed ( AQ ) when he comes in ( AR ) his glory and the glory of the Father and of ( AS ) the holy angels .

ESV	Luke	9	31	who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure , [ b ] which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem .
ESV	Luke	9	32	Now Peter and those who were with him ( BA ) were heavy with sleep , but when they became fully awake ( BB ) they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him .
ESV	Luke	9	33	And as the men were parting from him , Peter said to Jesus , “ Master , it is good that we are here . Let us make three ( BC ) tents , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah ” — ( BD ) not knowing what he said .
ESV	Luke	9	34	As he was saying these things , ( BE ) a cloud came and overshadowed them , and they were afraid as they entered the cloud .
ESV	Luke	9	35	And ( BF ) a voice came out of the cloud , saying , “ This is my Son , ( BG ) my Chosen One ; [ c ] ( BH ) listen to him ! ”
ESV	Luke	9	36	And when the voice had spoken , Jesus was found alone . ( BI ) And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen . Jesus Heals a Boy with an Unclean Spirit
ESV	Luke	9	37	( BJ ) On the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , a great crowd met him .

ESV	Luke	9	39	And behold , a spirit seizes him , and he suddenly cries out . It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth , and shatters him , and will hardly leave him .
ESV	Luke	9	40	And I begged your disciples to cast it out , but ( BL ) they could not. ”
ESV	Luke	9	41	Jesus answered , “ O ( BM ) faithless and twisted generation , ( BN ) how long am I to be with you and bear with you ? Bring your son here. ”
ESV	Luke	9	42	While he was coming , the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him . But Jesus ( BO ) rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy , and ( BP ) gave him back to his father .
ESV	Luke	9	43	And all were astonished at ( BQ ) the majesty of God . Jesus Again Foretells His Death ( BR ) But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing , Jesus [ d ] said ( BS ) to his disciples ,
ESV	Luke	9	44	“ Let these words sink into your ears : ( BT ) The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men. ”
ESV	Luke	9	45	( BU ) But they did not understand this saying , and ( BV ) it was concealed from them , so that they might not perceive it . And they were afraid to ask him about this saying . Who Is the Greatest ?
ESV	Luke	9	46	( BW ) An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest .
ESV	Luke	9	47	But Jesus , knowing the reasoning of their hearts , took a child and put him by his side

ESV	Luke	9	51	When the days drew near for ( CE ) him to be taken up , ( CF ) he set his face ( CG ) to go to Jerusalem .
ESV	Luke	9	52	And ( CH ) he sent messengers ahead of him , who went and entered a village of ( CI ) the Samaritans , to make preparations for him .
ESV	Luke	9	53	But ( CJ ) the people did not receive him , because ( CK ) his face was set toward Jerusalem .
ESV	Luke	9	54	And when his disciples James and John saw it , they said , “ Lord , do you want us to tell ( CL ) fire to come down from heaven and consume them ? ” [ e ]
ESV	Luke	9	55	But he turned and rebuked them . [ f ]

ESV	Luke	9	59	To another he said , “ Follow me. ” But he said , “ Lord , let me first go and bury my father. ”
ESV	Luke	9	60	And Jesus [ g ] said to him , “ Leave ( CO ) the dead to bury their own dead . But as for you , go and ( CP ) proclaim the kingdom of God. ”

ESV	Luke	10	21	( AH ) In that same hour ( AI ) he rejoiced ( AJ ) in the Holy Spirit and said , “ I thank you , Father , ( AK ) Lord of heaven and earth , that ( AL ) you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and ( AM ) revealed them to little children ; yes , Father , for ( AN ) such was your gracious will .

ESV	Luke	10	27	And he answered , ( AY ) “ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind , and ( AZ ) your neighbor as yourself. ”
ESV	Luke	10	28	And he said to him , “ You have answered correctly ; ( BA ) do this , and you will live. ”
ESV	Luke	10	29	But he , ( BB ) desiring to justify himself , said to Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
ESV	Luke	10	30	Jesus replied , “ A man ( BC ) was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he fell among robbers , who stripped him and beat him and departed , leaving him half dead .
ESV	Luke	10	31	Now by chance a ( BD ) priest was going down that road , and when he saw him he passed by on the other side .
ESV	Luke	10	32	So likewise ( BE ) a Levite , when he came to the place and saw him , passed by on the other side .

ESV	Luke	11	18	And if Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul .
ESV	Luke	11	19	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul , ( W ) by whom do ( X ) your sons cast them out ? Therefore they will be your judges .
ESV	Luke	11	20	But if it is by ( Y ) the finger of God that I cast out demons , then ( Z ) the kingdom of God has come upon you .

ESV	Luke	11	25	And when it comes , it finds the house swept and put in order .

ESV	Luke	11	29	( AN ) When the crowds were increasing , he began to say , ( AO ) “ This generation is an evil generation . ( AP ) It seeks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah .
ESV	Luke	11	30	For as ( AQ ) Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh , so will the Son of Man be to this generation .
ESV	Luke	11	31	( AR ) The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and ( AS ) condemn them , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , ( AT ) something greater than Solomon is here .

ESV	Luke	11	35	( BB ) Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness .
ESV	Luke	11	36	If then your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wholly bright , ( BC ) as when a lamp with its rays gives you light. ” Woes to the Pharisees and Lawyers
ESV	Luke	11	37	While Jesus [ e ] was speaking , ( BD ) a Pharisee asked him to dine with him , so he went in and reclined at table .
ESV	Luke	11	38	The Pharisee was astonished to see ( BE ) that he did not first wash before dinner .
ESV	Luke	11	39	And the Lord said to him , ( BF ) “ Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish , but inside you are full of ( BG ) greed and wickedness .
ESV	Luke	11	40	( BH ) You fools ! ( BI ) Did not he who made the outside make the inside also ?

ESV	Luke	11	45	One of ( BS ) the lawyers answered him , “ Teacher , in saying these things you insult us also. ”
ESV	Luke	11	46	And he said , “ Woe to you ( BT ) lawyers also ! For ( BU ) you load people with burdens hard to bear , and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers .

ESV	Luke	11	48	( BW ) So you are witnesses and you ( BX ) consent to the deeds of ( BY ) your fathers , for they killed them , and you build their tombs .
ESV	Luke	11	49	Therefore also ( BZ ) the Wisdom of God said , ( CA ) ‘ I will send them ( CB ) prophets and apostles , ( CC ) some of whom they will ( CD ) kill and persecute , ’
ESV	Luke	11	50	so that ( CE ) the blood of all the prophets , shed ( CF ) from the foundation of the world , may be ( CG ) charged against this generation ,

ESV	Luke	12	11	( V ) And when they ( W ) bring you before the synagogues and ( X ) the rulers and ( Y ) the authorities , ( Z ) do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say ,
ESV	Luke	12	13	( AB ) Someone in the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me. ”
ESV	Luke	12	14	But he said to him , ( AC ) “ Man , ( AD ) who made me a judge or arbitrator over you ? ”
ESV	Luke	12	15	And he said to them , ( AE ) “ Take care , and be on your guard against all covetousness , for one 's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. ”
ESV	Luke	12	16	And he told them a parable , saying , ( AF ) “ The land of a rich man produced plentifully ,
ESV	Luke	12	17	and he thought to himself , ( AG ) ‘ What shall I do , for I have nowhere to store my crops ? ’
ESV	Luke	12	18	inches or
ESV	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my soul , “ Soul , you have ample goods laid up ( AI ) for many years ; relax , ( AJ ) eat , drink , be merry. ” ’
ESV	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , ( AK ) ‘ Fool ! ( AL ) This night ( AM ) your soul is required of you , and the things you have prepared , ( AN ) whose will they be ? ’
ESV	Luke	12	21	So is the one ( AO ) who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God. ” Do Not Be Anxious
ESV	Luke	12	22	And he said to his disciples , ( AP ) “ Therefore I tell you , ( AQ ) do not be anxious about your life , what you will eat , nor about your body , what you will put on .
ESV	Luke	12	23	For life is more than food , and the body more than clothing .
ESV	Luke	12	24	( AR ) Consider the ravens : they neither sow nor reap , they have neither storehouse nor barn , and yet God feeds them . ( AS ) Of how much more value are you than the birds !
ESV	Luke	12	25	And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his ( AT ) span of life ? [ c ]
ESV	Luke	12	26	If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that , why are you anxious about the rest ?
ESV	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies , how they grow : they neither toil nor spin , [ d ] yet I tell you , ( AU ) even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
ESV	Luke	12	28	But if God so clothes the grass , which is alive in the field today , and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , ( AV ) O you of little faith !
ESV	Luke	12	29	And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink , nor ( AW ) be worried .
ESV	Luke	12	30	For ( AX ) all the nations of the world seek after these things , and ( AY ) your Father knows that you need them .
ESV	Luke	12	31	Instead , ( AZ ) seek ( BA ) his [ e ] kingdom , ( BB ) and these things will be added to you .
ESV	Luke	12	32	( BC ) “ Fear not , little ( BD ) flock , for ( BE ) it is your Father 's good pleasure to give you ( BF ) the kingdom .
ESV	Luke	12	33	( BG ) Sell your possessions , and ( BH ) give to the needy . ( BI ) Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old , with ( BJ ) a treasure in the heavens that does not fail , where no thief approaches and no moth destroys .
ESV	Luke	12	34	( BK ) For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . You Must Be Ready
ESV	Luke	12	35	( BL ) “ Stay dressed for action [ f ] and ( BM ) keep your lamps burning ,
ESV	Luke	12	36	and be like men who are ( BN ) waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast , so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and ( BO ) knocks .
ESV	Luke	12	37	( BP ) Blessed are those servants [ g ] whom the master finds ( BQ ) awake when he comes . Truly , I say to you , ( BR ) he will dress himself for service and ( BS ) have them recline at table , and he will come and serve them .
ESV	Luke	12	38	If he comes in the second watch , or in the third , and finds them awake , blessed are those servants !
ESV	Luke	12	39	( BT ) But know this , that if the master of the house had known at what hour ( BU ) the thief was coming , he [ h ] would not have left his house to be broken into .
ESV	Luke	12	40	You also must be ( BV ) ready , for ( BW ) the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. ”
ESV	Luke	12	41	Peter said , “ Lord , ( BX ) are you telling this parable for us or for all ? ”
ESV	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , “ Who then is ( BY ) the faithful and ( BZ ) wise ( CA ) manager , whom his master will set over his household , to give them their portion of food at the proper time ?
ESV	Luke	12	43	( CB ) Blessed is that servant [ i ] whom his master will find so doing when he comes .
ESV	Luke	12	44	Truly , I say to you , ( CC ) he will set him over all his possessions .

ESV	Luke	12	49	( CP ) “ I came to cast fire on the earth , and would that it were already kindled !
ESV	Luke	12	50	( CQ ) I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how ( CR ) great is my distress until it is accomplished !
ESV	Luke	12	51	( CS ) Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth ? ( CT ) No , I tell you , but rather division .
ESV	Luke	12	52	For from now on in one house there will be five divided , three against two and two against three .
ESV	Luke	12	53	They will be divided , ( CU ) father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ” Interpreting the Time
ESV	Luke	12	54	He also said to the crowds , ( CV ) “ When you see ( CW ) a cloud rising in the west , you say at once , ‘ A shower is coming. ’ And so it happens .
ESV	Luke	12	55	And ( CX ) when you see the south wind blowing , you say , ‘ There will be ( CY ) scorching heat , ’ and it happens .
ESV	Luke	12	56	You hypocrites ! ( CZ ) You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky , but why do you not know how to interpret the present time ? Settle with Your Accuser
ESV	Luke	12	57	“ And why ( DA ) do you not judge ( DB ) for yourselves what is right ?
ESV	Luke	12	58	( DC ) As you go with your accuser before the magistrate , make an effort to settle with him on the way , lest he drag you to the judge , and the judge hand you over to the officer , and the officer put you in prison .

ESV	Luke	13	13	And he ( J ) laid his hands on her , and immediately she was made straight , and she ( K ) glorified God .
ESV	Luke	13	2	And he answered them , ( B ) “ Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans , because they suffered in this way ?
ESV	Luke	13	3	No , I tell you ; but unless you ( C ) repent , you will all likewise perish .
ESV	Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen on whom the tower in ( D ) Siloam fell and killed them : do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem ?
ESV	Luke	13	5	No , I tell you ; but unless you ( E ) repent , you will all likewise perish. ” The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree
ESV	Luke	13	6	And he told this parable : “ A man had ( F ) a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit on it and found none .
ESV	Luke	13	7	And he said to the vinedresser , ‘ Look , for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and I find none . ( G ) Cut it down . Why should it use up the ground ? ’
ESV	Luke	13	8	And he answered him , ‘ Sir , let it alone this year also , until I dig around it and put on manure .
ESV	Luke	13	9	Then if it should bear fruit next year , well and good ; but if not , you can cut it down. ’ ” A Woman with a Disabling Spirit
ESV	Luke	13	10	Now ( H ) he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
ESV	Luke	13	11	And behold , there was a woman who had had ( I ) a disabling spirit for eighteen years . She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself .
ESV	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her , he called her over and said to her , “ Woman , you are freed from your disability. ”
ESV	Luke	13	14	But ( L ) the ruler of the synagogue , indignant because Jesus ( M ) had healed on the Sabbath , said to the people , ( N ) “ There are six days in which work ought to be done . Come on those days and be healed , and not on the Sabbath day. ”
ESV	Luke	13	15	Then the Lord answered him , “ You hypocrites ! ( O ) Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it ?
ESV	Luke	13	16	And ought not this woman , ( P ) a daughter of Abraham whom ( Q ) Satan bound for eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day ? ”
ESV	Luke	13	17	As he said these things , ( R ) all his adversaries were put to shame , and ( S ) all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him . The Mustard Seed and the Leaven
ESV	Luke	13	18	( T ) He said therefore , “ What is the kingdom of God like ? And to what shall I compare it ?
ESV	Luke	13	19	It is like ( U ) a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden , and it grew and became a tree , and the birds of the air made nests in its branches. ”
ESV	Luke	13	20	And again he said , “ To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
ESV	Luke	13	21	( V ) It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in ( W ) three measures of flour , until it was ( X ) all leavened. ” The Narrow Door
ESV	Luke	13	22	( Y ) He went on his way through towns and villages , teaching and ( Z ) journeying toward Jerusalem .
ESV	Luke	13	23	And someone said to him , “ Lord , ( AA ) will those who are saved be few ? ” And he said to them ,
ESV	Luke	13	24	( AB ) “ Strive ( AC ) to enter through the narrow door . For many , I tell you , will seek to enter and will not be able .
ESV	Luke	13	25	( AD ) When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door , and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door , saying , ( AE ) ‘ Lord , open to us , ’ then he will answer you , ( AF ) ‘ I do not know where you come from. ’
ESV	Luke	13	26	Then you will begin to say , ( AG ) ‘ We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets. ’
ESV	Luke	13	27	But he will say , ‘ I tell you , ( AH ) I do not know where you come from . ( AI ) Depart from me , all you workers of evil ! ’
ESV	Luke	13	28	( AJ ) In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when you see ( AK ) Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but ( AL ) you yourselves cast out .
ESV	Luke	13	29	And ( AM ) people will come from east and west , and from north and south , and ( AN ) recline at table in the kingdom of God .
ESV	Luke	13	30	And behold , ( AO ) some are last who will be first , and some are first who will be last. ” Lament over Jerusalem
ESV	Luke	13	31	At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him , “ Get away from ( AP ) here , for ( AQ ) Herod wants to kill you. ”
ESV	Luke	13	32	And he said to them , “ Go and tell that fox , ‘ Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third day ( AR ) I finish my course .
ESV	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless , ( AS ) I ( AT ) must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following , for it can not be that ( AU ) a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem. ’
ESV	Luke	13	34	( AV ) O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , the city that ( AW ) kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it ! ( AX ) How often would I have ( AY ) gathered ( AZ ) your children together ( BA ) as a hen gathers her brood ( BB ) under her wings , and ( BC ) you were not willing !

ESV	Luke	14	2	And behold , there was a man before him who had dropsy .
ESV	Luke	14	3	And Jesus responded to ( C ) the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , ( D ) “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath , or not ? ”
ESV	Luke	14	4	But they remained silent . Then he took him and healed him and sent him away .
ESV	Luke	14	5	And he said to them , ( E ) “ Which of you , having a son [ a ] or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day , will not immediately pull him out ? ”
ESV	Luke	14	6	( F ) And they could not reply to these things . The Parable of the Wedding Feast
ESV	Luke	14	7	Now he told a parable to those who were invited , when he noticed ( G ) how they chose the places of honor , saying to them ,
ESV	Luke	14	8	“ When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast , do not sit down in a place of honor , lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him ,
ESV	Luke	14	9	and he who invited you both will come and say to you , ‘ Give your place to this person , ’ and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place .
ESV	Luke	14	10	But when you are invited , go and sit in the lowest place , ( H ) so that when your host comes he may say to you , ‘ Friend , move up higher. ’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you .
ESV	Luke	14	11	For ( I ) everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and he who humbles himself will be exalted. ” The Parable of the Great Banquet
ESV	Luke	14	12	He said also to the man who had invited him , “ When you give ( J ) a dinner or a banquet , do not invite your friends or your brothers [ b ] or your relatives or rich neighbors , ( K ) lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid .
ESV	Luke	14	13	But when you give a feast , ( L ) invite ( M ) the poor , the crippled , the lame , the blind ,
ESV	Luke	14	15	When one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things , he said to him , ( P ) “ Blessed is everyone who will ( Q ) eat bread in the kingdom of God ! ”
ESV	Luke	14	16	But he said to him , ( R ) “ A man once ( S ) gave a great banquet and invited many .
ESV	Luke	14	17	And at the time for the banquet he ( T ) sent his servant [ c ] to say to those who had been invited , ‘ Come , for everything is now ready. ’
ESV	Luke	14	18	But they all alike began to make excuses . The first said to him , ‘ I have bought a field , and I must go out and see it . Please have me excused. ’
ESV	Luke	14	19	And another said , ‘ I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to examine them . Please have me excused. ’
ESV	Luke	14	20	And another said , ( U ) ‘ I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come. ’

ESV	Luke	14	24	For I tell you , [ d ] ( W ) none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet. ’ ” The Cost of Discipleship
ESV	Luke	14	25	Now great crowds accompanied him , and he turned and said to them ,
ESV	Luke	14	26	( X ) “ If anyone comes to me and ( Y ) does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters , ( Z ) yes , and even his own life , he can not be my disciple .
ESV	Luke	14	27	( AA ) Whoever does not ( AB ) bear his own cross and come after me can not be my disciple .
ESV	Luke	14	28	For which of you , desiring to build a tower , does not ( AC ) first sit down and count the cost , whether he has enough to complete it ?
ESV	Luke	14	29	Otherwise , when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish , all who see it begin to mock him ,
ESV	Luke	14	30	saying , ‘ This man began to build and was not able to finish. ’
ESV	Luke	14	31	Or what king , going out to encounter another king in war , will not ( AD ) sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
ESV	Luke	14	32	And if not , while the other is yet a great way off , he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace .
ESV	Luke	14	33	( AE ) So therefore , any one of you who ( AF ) does not renounce all that he has can not be my disciple . Salt Without Taste Is Worthless
ESV	Luke	14	34	( AG ) “ Salt is good , ( AH ) but if salt has lost its taste , how shall its saltiness be restored ?
ESV	Luke	14	35	It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile . It is thrown away . ( AI ) He who has ears to hear , let him hear. ” Footnotes - Luke 14:5 Some manuscripts a donkey - Luke 14:12 Or your brothers and sisters - Luke 14:17 Or bondservant ; also verses

ESV	Luke	15	15	So he went and hired himself out to [ b ] one of the citizens of that country , who sent him into his fields to feed pigs .
ESV	Luke	15	2	And the Pharisees and the scribes ( B ) grumbled , saying , ( C ) “ This man receives sinners and ( D ) eats with them. ”
ESV	Luke	15	3	So he told them this parable :
ESV	Luke	15	4	( E ) “ What man of you , having a hundred sheep , ( F ) if he has lost one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine ( G ) in the open country , and ( H ) go after the one that is lost , until he finds it ?
ESV	Luke	15	5	And when he has found it , ( I ) he lays it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
ESV	Luke	15	6	And when he comes home , he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying to them , ‘ Rejoice with me , for ( J ) I have found my sheep that was lost. ’
ESV	Luke	15	7	Just so , I tell you , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who ( K ) repents than over ninety-nine ( L ) righteous persons who need no repentance . The Parable of the Lost Coin
ESV	Luke	15	8	“ Or what woman , having ten silver coins , [ a ] if she loses one coin , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it ?
ESV	Luke	15	9	And when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found the coin that I had lost. ’
ESV	Luke	15	10	Just so , I tell you , there is joy before ( M ) the angels of God over one sinner who repents. ” The Parable of the Prodigal Son
ESV	Luke	15	11	And he said , “ There was a man who had two sons .
ESV	Luke	15	12	And the younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me ( N ) the share of property that is coming to me. ’ And he divided ( O ) his property between them .
ESV	Luke	15	13	Not many days later , the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country , and there he squandered his property in ( P ) reckless living .
ESV	Luke	15	14	And when he had spent everything , a severe famine arose in that country , and he began to be in need .
ESV	Luke	15	16	And he ( Q ) was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate , and no one gave him anything .
ESV	Luke	15	17	“ But ( R ) when he ( S ) came to himself , he said , ‘ How many of my father 's hired servants have more than enough bread , but I perish here with hunger !
ESV	Luke	15	18	I will arise and go to my father , and I will say to him , “ Father , ( T ) I have sinned against ( U ) heaven and before you .
ESV	Luke	15	19	( V ) I am no longer worthy to be called your son . Treat me as one of your hired servants. ” ’
ESV	Luke	15	20	And he arose and came to his father . But while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and felt compassion , and ( W ) ran and ( X ) embraced him and ( Y ) kissed him .
ESV	Luke	15	21	And the son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you . ( Z ) I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ’ [ c ]
ESV	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his servants , [ d ] ‘ Bring quickly ( AA ) the best robe , and put it on him , and put ( AB ) a ring on his hand , and ( AC ) shoes on his feet .
ESV	Luke	15	23	And bring ( AD ) the fattened calf and kill it , and ( AE ) let us eat and celebrate .
ESV	Luke	15	24	For this my son ( AF ) was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found. ’ And they began to celebrate .
ESV	Luke	15	25	“ Now his older son was in the field , and as he came and drew near to the house , he heard music and dancing .
ESV	Luke	15	26	And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant .
ESV	Luke	15	27	And he said to him , ‘ Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fattened calf , because he has received him back safe and sound. ’
ESV	Luke	15	28	But he was angry and refused to go in . His father came out and entreated him ,
ESV	Luke	15	29	but he answered his father , ‘ Look , these many years I have served you , and I never disobeyed your command , yet you never gave me a young goat , that I might ( AG ) celebrate with my friends .
ESV	Luke	15	30	But when this son of yours came , ( AH ) who has devoured ( AI ) your property with prostitutes , you killed the fattened calf for him ! ’
ESV	Luke	15	31	And he said to him , ‘ Son , ( AJ ) you are always with me , and all that is mine is yours .

ESV	Luke	16	2	And he called him and said to him , ‘ What is this that I hear about you ? Turn in the account of your ( B ) management , for you can no longer be manager. ’
ESV	Luke	16	3	And the manager said to himself , ‘ What shall I do , since my master is taking the management away from me ? I am not strong enough to dig , and I am ashamed to beg .
ESV	Luke	16	4	I have decided what to do , so that when I am removed from management , people may receive me into their houses. ’
ESV	Luke	16	5	So , summoning his master 's debtors one by one , he said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
ESV	Luke	16	6	He said , ‘ A hundred measures [ a ] of oil. ’ He said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty. ’
ESV	Luke	16	7	Then he said to another , ‘ And how much do you owe ? ’ He said , ‘ A hundred measures [ b ] of wheat. ’ He said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and write eighty. ’
ESV	Luke	16	8	The master commended the dishonest manager for his ( C ) shrewdness . For ( D ) the sons of this world [ c ] are ( E ) more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than ( F ) the sons of light .
ESV	Luke	16	9	And I tell you , ( G ) make friends for yourselves by means of ( H ) unrighteous wealth , [ d ] so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings .

ESV	Luke	16	26	And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm has been fixed , in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able , and none may cross from there to us. ’
ESV	Luke	16	27	And he said , ‘ Then I beg you , father , to send him to my father 's house—
ESV	Luke	16	28	for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them , lest they also come into this place of torment. ’
ESV	Luke	16	29	But Abraham said , ‘ They have ( AK ) Moses and the Prophets ; ( AL ) let them hear them. ’
ESV	Luke	16	30	And he said , ‘ No , ( AM ) father Abraham , but if someone goes to them from the dead , they will repent. ’
ESV	Luke	16	31	He said to him , ‘ If they do not hear ( AN ) Moses and the Prophets , ( AO ) neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 16:6 About

ESV	Luke	17	17	Then Jesus answered , “ Were not ( W ) ten cleansed ? Where are the nine ?
ESV	Luke	17	2	( D ) It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin . [ b ]
ESV	Luke	17	3	Pay attention to yourselves ! ( E ) If your brother sins , ( F ) rebuke him , and if he repents , ( G ) forgive him ,
ESV	Luke	17	4	and if he sins against you ( H ) seven times in the day , and turns to you seven times , saying , ‘ I repent , ’ you must forgive him. ” Increase Our Faith
ESV	Luke	17	5	( I ) The apostles said to the Lord , ( J ) “ Increase our faith ! ”
ESV	Luke	17	6	And the Lord said , ( K ) “ If you had faith like ( L ) a grain of mustard seed , you could say to this ( M ) mulberry tree , ‘ Be uprooted and planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you . Unworthy Servants
ESV	Luke	17	7	“ Will any one of you who has a servant [ c ] plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field , ‘ Come at once and recline at table ’ ?
ESV	Luke	17	8	Will he not rather say to him , ‘ Prepare supper for me , and ( N ) dress properly , [ d ] and serve me while I eat and drink , and afterward you will eat and drink ’ ?
ESV	Luke	17	9	- Luke 17:8 Greek gird yourself - Luke 17:10 Or bondservants - Luke 17:12 Leprosy was a term for several skin diseases ; see Leviticus
ESV	Luke	17	10	So you also , when you have done all that you were commanded , say , ‘ We are ( O ) unworthy servants ; [ e ] we have only done what was our duty. ’ ” Jesus Cleanses Ten Lepers
ESV	Luke	17	11	( P ) On the way to Jerusalem ( Q ) he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee .
ESV	Luke	17	12	And as he entered a village , he was met by ten lepers , [ f ] ( R ) who stood at a distance

ESV	Luke	17	14	When he saw them he said to them , “ Go and ( S ) show yourselves to the priests. ” And as they went they were cleansed .
ESV	Luke	17	15	Then one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , ( T ) praising God with a loud voice ;
ESV	Luke	17	16	and ( U ) he fell on his face at Jesus ' feet , giving him thanks . Now he was ( V ) a Samaritan .
ESV	Luke	17	18	Was no one found to return and ( X ) give praise to God except this ( Y ) foreigner ? ”
ESV	Luke	17	19	And he said to him , “ Rise and go your way ; ( Z ) your faith has ( AA ) made you well. ” [ g ] The Coming of the Kingdom
ESV	Luke	17	20	Being asked by the Pharisees ( AB ) when the kingdom of God would come , he answered them , “ The kingdom of God ( AC ) is not coming in ways that can be observed ,
ESV	Luke	17	21	nor ( AD ) will they say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or ‘ There ! ’ for behold , the kingdom of God is in the midst of you. ” [ h ]
ESV	Luke	17	22	And he said to the disciples , ( AE ) “ The days are coming when you will desire ( AF ) to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
ESV	Luke	17	23	( AG ) And they will say to you , ‘ Look , there ! ’ or ‘ Look , here ! ’ Do not go out or follow them .
ESV	Luke	17	24	( AH ) For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other , so will the Son of Man be ( AI ) in his day . [ i ]
ESV	Luke	17	25	But first ( AJ ) he must suffer many things and ( AK ) be rejected by this generation .
ESV	Luke	17	26	( AL ) Just as it was in the days of ( AM ) Noah , so will it be in the days of the Son of Man .
ESV	Luke	17	27	( AN ) They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage , until the day when Noah entered the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
ESV	Luke	17	28	Likewise , just as it was in the days of ( AO ) Lot—they were eating and drinking , buying and selling , planting and building ,
ESV	Luke	17	29	( AP ) but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom , fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all—
ESV	Luke	17	30	so will it be ( AQ ) on the day when the Son of Man is revealed .
ESV	Luke	17	31	On that day , ( AR ) let the one who is on ( AS ) the housetop , with his goods in the house , not come down to take them away , and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back .
ESV	Luke	17	32	( AT ) Remember Lot 's wife .
ESV	Luke	17	33	( AU ) Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life will ( AV ) keep it .
ESV	Luke	17	34	I tell you , in that night there will be two in one bed . One will be taken and the other left .
ESV	Luke	17	35	( AW ) There will be two women ( AX ) grinding together . One will be taken and the other left. ” [ j ]

ESV	Luke	18	18	( AF ) And a ruler asked him , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to ( AG ) inherit eternal life ? ”
ESV	Luke	18	2	He said , “ In a certain city there was a judge who ( C ) neither feared God nor respected man .
ESV	Luke	18	3	And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying , ‘ Give me justice against my adversary. ’
ESV	Luke	18	4	For a while he refused , but afterward he said to himself , ( D ) ‘ Though I neither fear God nor respect man ,
ESV	Luke	18	5	yet because this widow keeps bothering me , I will give her justice , so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming. ’ ”
ESV	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said , “ Hear what the unrighteous judge says .
ESV	Luke	18	7	And ( E ) will not God give justice to ( F ) his elect , ( G ) who cry to him day and night ? ( H ) ( I ) Will he delay long over them ?
ESV	Luke	18	8	I tell you , he will give justice to them ( J ) speedily . Nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , ( K ) will he find faith on earth ? ” The Pharisee and the Tax Collector
ESV	Luke	18	9	He also told this parable to some ( L ) who trusted ( M ) in themselves that they were righteous , ( N ) and treated others with contempt :
ESV	Luke	18	10	“ Two men ( O ) went up into the temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
ESV	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee , ( P ) standing by himself , prayed [ a ] ( Q ) thus : ‘ God , I thank you that I am not like other men , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even like this tax collector .
ESV	Luke	18	12	( R ) I fast twice a week ; ( S ) I give tithes of all that I get. ’
ESV	Luke	18	13	But the tax collector , ( T ) standing far off , ( U ) would not even lift up his eyes to heaven , but ( V ) beat his breast , saying , ‘ God , ( W ) be merciful to me , a sinner ! ’
ESV	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went down to his house justified , rather than the other . For ( X ) everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but the one who humbles himself will be exalted. ” Let the Children Come to Me
ESV	Luke	18	15	( Y ) Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them . And when the disciples saw it , they ( Z ) rebuked them .
ESV	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called them to him , saying , ( AA ) “ Let the children come to me , and ( AB ) do not hinder them , ( AC ) for to such belongs the kingdom of God .
ESV	Luke	18	17	( AD ) Truly , I say to you , whoever does not ( AE ) receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it. ” The Rich Ruler
ESV	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone .
ESV	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments : ( AH ) ‘ Do not commit adultery , Do not murder , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honor your father and mother. ’ ”
ESV	Luke	18	21	And he said , ( AI ) “ All these I have kept from my youth. ”
ESV	Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard this , he said to him , “ One thing you still lack . ( AJ ) Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor , and you will have ( AK ) treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me. ”
ESV	Luke	18	23	( AL ) But when he heard these things , he became very sad , for he was extremely rich .
ESV	Luke	18	24	Jesus , seeing that he had become sad , said , ( AM ) “ How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter ( AN ) the kingdom of God !
ESV	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter ( AO ) the kingdom of God. ”
ESV	Luke	18	26	Those who heard it said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
ESV	Luke	18	27	But he said , ( AP ) “ What is impossible with man is possible with God. ”
ESV	Luke	18	28	And Peter said , “ See , ( AQ ) we have left our homes and followed you. ”
ESV	Luke	18	29	And he said to them , “ Truly , I say to you , ( AR ) there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers [ b ] or parents or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
ESV	Luke	18	30	who will not receive ( AS ) many times more ( AT ) in this time , and in ( AU ) the age to come eternal life. ” Jesus Foretells His Death a Third Time
ESV	Luke	18	31	( AV ) And taking the twelve , he said to them , “ See , ( AW ) we are going up to Jerusalem , and ( AX ) everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished .
ESV	Luke	18	32	For he will be ( AY ) delivered over to the Gentiles and will be ( AZ ) mocked and shamefully treated and ( BA ) spit upon .
ESV	Luke	18	33	And after flogging him , they will kill him , and on ( BB ) the third day he will rise. ”
ESV	Luke	18	34	( BC ) But they understood none of these things . ( BD ) This saying was hidden from them , and they did not grasp what was said . Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar
ESV	Luke	18	35	( BE ) As he drew near to Jericho , ( BF ) a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging .
ESV	Luke	18	36	And hearing a crowd going by , he inquired what this meant .
ESV	Luke	18	37	They told him , ( BG ) “ Jesus of Nazareth is passing by. ”
ESV	Luke	18	38	And he cried out , “ Jesus , ( BH ) Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
ESV	Luke	18	39	And those who were in front ( BI ) rebuked him , telling him to be silent . But he cried out all the more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
ESV	Luke	18	40	And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him . And when he came near , he asked him ,
ESV	Luke	18	41	( BJ ) “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” He said , “ Lord , let me recover my sight. ”
ESV	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said to him , “ Recover your sight ; ( BK ) your faith has ( BL ) made you well. ”
ESV	Luke	18	43	And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him , ( BM ) glorifying God . And ( BN ) all the people , when they saw it , gave praise to God .

ESV	Luke	19	19	And he said to him , ‘ And you are to be over five cities. ’
ESV	Luke	19	2	And behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus . He was a chief tax collector and was rich .
ESV	Luke	19	3	And ( B ) he was seeking to see who Jesus was , but on account of the crowd he could not , because he was small in stature .
ESV	Luke	19	4	So he ran on ahead and climbed up into ( C ) a sycamore tree to see him , for he was about to pass that way .
ESV	Luke	19	5	And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up and said to him , “ Zacchaeus , hurry and come down , for ( D ) I must stay at your house today. ”
ESV	Luke	19	6	So he hurried and came down and ( E ) received him joyfully .
ESV	Luke	19	7	And when they saw it , they all ( F ) grumbled , “ He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner. ”
ESV	Luke	19	8	And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord , “ Behold , Lord , the half of my goods ( G ) I give to the poor . And if I have ( H ) defrauded anyone of anything , I restore it ( I ) fourfold. ”
ESV	Luke	19	9	And Jesus said to him , “ Today salvation has come to this house , since ( J ) he also is a son of Abraham .
ESV	Luke	19	10	For ( K ) the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost. ” The Parable of the Ten Minas
ESV	Luke	19	11	As they heard these things , he proceeded to tell a parable , because he was near to Jerusalem , and because ( L ) they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately .
ESV	Luke	19	12	He said therefore , ( M ) “ A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return .
ESV	Luke	19	13	Calling ( N ) ten of his servants , [ a ] he gave them ten minas , [ b ] and said to them , ‘ Engage in business ( O ) until I come. ’
ESV	Luke	19	14	But ( P ) his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him , saying , ‘ We do not want this man to reign over us. ’
ESV	Luke	19	15	- Luke 19:13 A mina was about three months ' wages for a laborer - Luke 19:17 Or bondservant ; also verse
ESV	Luke	19	16	The first came before him , saying , ‘ Lord , your mina has made ten minas more. ’
ESV	Luke	19	17	And he said to him , ‘ Well done , good servant ! [ c ] Because you have been ( Q ) faithful in a very little , ( R ) you shall have authority over ten cities. ’
ESV	Luke	19	18	And the second came , saying , ‘ Lord , your mina has made five minas. ’
ESV	Luke	19	20	Then another came , saying , ‘ Lord , here is your mina , which I kept laid away in ( S ) a handkerchief ;
ESV	Luke	19	21	for I was afraid of you , because you are ( T ) a severe man . You take ( U ) what you did not deposit , and reap what you did not sow. ’
ESV	Luke	19	22	The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	Luke	19	23	Why then did you not put my money in the bank , and at my coming I might have collected it with interest ? ’
ESV	Luke	19	24	And he said to those who stood by , ‘ Take the mina from him , and give it to the one who has the ten minas. ’
ESV	Luke	19	25	And they said to him , ‘ Lord , he has ten minas ! ’
ESV	Luke	19	26	‘ I tell you that ( Y ) to everyone who has , more will be given , but from the one who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
ESV	Luke	19	27	But ( Z ) as for these enemies of mine , who did not want me to reign over them , bring them here and ( AA ) slaughter them before me. ’ ” The Triumphal Entry
ESV	Luke	19	28	And when he had said these things , ( AB ) he went on ahead , ( AC ) going up to Jerusalem .
ESV	Luke	19	29	( AD ) When he drew near to Bethphage and ( AE ) Bethany , at ( AF ) the mount that is called Olivet , he sent ( AG ) two of the disciples ,
ESV	Luke	19	30	saying , “ Go into the village in front of you , where on entering you will find a colt tied , ( AH ) on which no one has ever yet sat . Untie it and bring it here .
ESV	Luke	19	31	If anyone asks you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ you shall say this : ‘ The Lord has need of it. ’ ”
ESV	Luke	19	32	So those who were sent went away and found it ( AI ) just as he had told them .
ESV	Luke	19	33	And as they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
ESV	Luke	19	34	And they said , “ The Lord has need of it. ”
ESV	Luke	19	35	And they brought it to Jesus , and throwing their cloaks on the colt , they set Jesus on it .
ESV	Luke	19	36	And as he rode along , they ( AJ ) spread their cloaks on the road .
ESV	Luke	19	37	As he was drawing near—already on the way down the Mount of Olives— ( AK ) the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice ( AL ) for all the mighty works that they had seen ,
ESV	Luke	19	38	saying , ( AM ) “ Blessed is ( AN ) the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven and ( AO ) glory in the highest ! ”
ESV	Luke	19	39	( AP ) And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , rebuke your disciples. ”
ESV	Luke	19	40	He answered , “ I tell you , if these were silent , ( AQ ) the very stones would cry out. ” Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem
ESV	Luke	19	41	( AR ) And when he drew near and saw the city , ( AS ) he wept over it ,
ESV	Luke	19	42	saying , ( AT ) “ Would that you , even you , had known on this day the things that make for peace ! But now ( AU ) they are hidden from your eyes .
ESV	Luke	19	43	For ( AV ) the days will come upon you , when your enemies ( AW ) will set up a barricade around you and ( AX ) surround you and hem you in on every side
ESV	Luke	19	44	( AY ) and tear you down to the ground , you and your children within you . And ( AZ ) they will not leave one stone upon another in you , because you did not know ( BA ) the time of your ( BB ) visitation. ” Jesus Cleanses the Temple
ESV	Luke	19	45	( BC ) And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold ,
ESV	Luke	19	46	saying to them , “ It is written , ( BD ) ‘ My house shall be a house of prayer , ’ but ( BE ) you have made it a den of robbers. ”
ESV	Luke	19	47	( BF ) And he was teaching daily in the temple . ( BG ) The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy him ,

ESV	Luke	20	20	( AD ) So they ( AE ) watched him and sent spies , who ( AF ) pretended to be sincere , that they might ( AG ) catch him in something he said , so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of ( AH ) the governor .
ESV	Luke	20	2	and said to him , “ Tell us ( D ) by what authority you do these things , or who it is that gave you this authority. ”
ESV	Luke	20	3	He answered them , “ I also will ask you a question . Now tell me ,
ESV	Luke	20	4	was the baptism of John ( E ) from heaven or from man ? ”
ESV	Luke	20	5	And they discussed it with one another , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ( F ) ‘ Why did you not believe him ? ’
ESV	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ From man , ’ all the people will stone us to death , for they are convinced that John was ( G ) a prophet. ”
ESV	Luke	20	7	So they answered that they did not know where it came from .
ESV	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. ” The Parable of the Wicked Tenants
ESV	Luke	20	9	( H ) And he began to tell the people this parable : “ A man planted ( I ) a vineyard and ( J ) let it out to tenants and ( K ) went into another country for a long while .
ESV	Luke	20	10	When the time came , he sent a servant [ b ] to the tenants , so that ( L ) they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard . ( M ) But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed .

ESV	Luke	20	12	( Q ) And he sent yet a third . This one also they wounded and cast out .
ESV	Luke	20	13	Then the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my ( R ) beloved son ; perhaps they will respect him. ’
ESV	Luke	20	14	But when the tenants saw him , they said to themselves , ( S ) ‘ This is the heir . ( T ) Let us kill him , so that the inheritance may be ours. ’
ESV	Luke	20	15	And they ( U ) threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
ESV	Luke	20	16	( V ) He will ( W ) come and destroy those tenants and ( X ) give the vineyard to others. ” When they heard this , they said , “ Surely not ! ”
ESV	Luke	20	17	But he ( Y ) looked directly at them and said , “ What then is this that is written :
ESV	Luke	20	18	( AA ) Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces , and when it falls ( AB ) on anyone , it will crush him. ” Paying Taxes to Caesar
ESV	Luke	20	19	( AC ) The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour , for they perceived that he had told this parable against them , but they feared the people .
ESV	Luke	20	21	So they asked him , “ Teacher , we know that you speak and teach rightly , and ( AI ) show no partiality , [ d ] but truly teach ( AJ ) the way of God .
ESV	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to give ( AK ) tribute to ( AL ) Caesar , or not ? ”
ESV	Luke	20	23	But he perceived their ( AM ) craftiness , and said to them ,
ESV	Luke	20	24	“ Show me ( AN ) a denarius . [ e ] Whose likeness and inscription does it have ? ” They said , “ Caesar's. ”
ESV	Luke	20	25	He said to them , “ Then ( AO ) render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God's. ”
ESV	Luke	20	26	And they were not able in the presence of the people ( AP ) to catch him in what he said , but marveling at his answer they became silent . Sadducees Ask About the Resurrection
ESV	Luke	20	27	There came to him ( AQ ) some Sadducees , ( AR ) those who deny that there is a resurrection ,
ESV	Luke	20	28	and they asked him a question , saying , “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us ( AS ) that if a man 's brother dies , having a wife but no children , the man [ f ] must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother .
ESV	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brothers . The first took a wife , and died without children .
ESV	Luke	20	30	And the second
ESV	Luke	20	31	and the third took her , and likewise all seven left no children and died .
ESV	Luke	20	32	Afterward the woman also died .
ESV	Luke	20	33	In the resurrection , therefore , whose wife will the woman be ? For the seven had her as wife. ”
ESV	Luke	20	34	And Jesus said to them , ( AT ) “ The sons of this age ( AU ) marry and ( AV ) are given in marriage ,
ESV	Luke	20	35	but those who are ( AW ) considered worthy to attain to ( AX ) that age and to the resurrection from the dead ( AY ) neither marry ( AZ ) nor are given in marriage ,
ESV	Luke	20	36	for ( BA ) they can not die anymore , because they are ( BB ) equal to angels and ( BC ) are ( BD ) sons of God , being ( BE ) sons [ g ] of the resurrection .
ESV	Luke	20	37	But that the dead are raised , ( BF ) even Moses showed , in ( BG ) the passage about the bush , where he calls ( BH ) the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob .
ESV	Luke	20	38	Now he is not God of the dead , but of the living , for all ( BI ) live to him. ”
ESV	Luke	20	39	Then some of the scribes ( BJ ) answered , “ Teacher , you have spoken well. ”
ESV	Luke	20	40	For ( BK ) they no longer dared to ask him any question . Whose Son Is the Christ ?
ESV	Luke	20	41	( BL ) But he said to them , “ How can they say that ( BM ) the Christ is ( BN ) David 's son ?
ESV	Luke	20	42	For David himself says in the Book of Psalms , ( BO ) “ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand ,
ESV	Luke	20	43	until I make your enemies ( BP ) your footstool. ” ’
ESV	Luke	20	44	David thus calls him Lord , so ( BQ ) how is he his son ? ” Beware of the Scribes
ESV	Luke	20	45	( BR ) And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples ,
ESV	Luke	20	46	“ Beware of the scribes , who like to walk around in long robes , and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and ( BS ) the places of honor at feasts ,

ESV	Luke	22	49	And when those who were around him saw what would follow , they said , “ Lord , shall we strike ( BR ) with the sword ? ”
ESV	Luke	22	50	And one of them struck the servant [ h ] of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
ESV	Luke	22	51	But Jesus said , “ No more of this ! ” And he touched his ear and healed him .
ESV	Luke	22	52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests and ( BS ) officers of the temple and elders , who had come out against him , “ Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs ?

ESV	Luke	22	54	( BW ) Then they seized him and led him away , bringing him into the high priest 's house , ( BX ) and Peter was following at a distance .
ESV	Luke	22	55	( BY ) And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of ( BZ ) the courtyard and sat down together , Peter sat down among them .
ESV	Luke	22	56	Then a servant girl , seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him , said , “ This man also was with him. ”
ESV	Luke	22	57	But he denied it , saying , “ Woman , I do not know him. ”
ESV	Luke	22	58	And a little later someone else saw him and said , “ You also are one of them. ” But Peter said , “ Man , I am not. ”
ESV	Luke	22	59	And after an interval of about an hour still another ( CA ) insisted , saying , “ Certainly this man also was with him , for he too is a Galilean. ”
ESV	Luke	22	60	But Peter said , “ Man , I do not know what you are talking about. ” And immediately , while he was still speaking , the rooster crowed .
ESV	Luke	22	61	And the Lord turned and ( CB ) looked at Peter . And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord , how he had said to him , ( CC ) “ Before the rooster crows today , you will ( CD ) deny me three times. ”
ESV	Luke	22	62	And he went out and wept bitterly . Jesus Is Mocked
ESV	Luke	22	63	( CE ) Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him .

ESV	Luke	22	69	But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated ( CP ) at the right hand of the power of God. ”
ESV	Luke	22	70	So they all said , “ Are you ( CQ ) the Son of God , then ? ” And he said to them , ( CR ) “ You say that I am. ”

ESV	Luke	23	6	When Pilate heard this , he asked whether the man was a Galilean .
ESV	Luke	23	7	And when he learned that he belonged to ( K ) Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him over to Herod , who was himself in Jerusalem at that time .
ESV	Luke	23	8	When Herod saw Jesus , he was very glad , ( L ) for he had long desired to see him , ( M ) because he had heard about him , and he was hoping ( N ) to see some sign done by him .
ESV	Luke	23	9	So he questioned him at some length , but he made no answer .
ESV	Luke	23	10	The chief priests and the scribes stood by , vehemently accusing him .
ESV	Luke	23	11	And Herod with his soldiers ( O ) treated him with contempt and ( P ) mocked him . Then , ( Q ) arraying him in splendid clothing , he sent him back to Pilate .
ESV	Luke	23	12	And ( R ) Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day , for before this they had been at enmity with each other .
ESV	Luke	23	13	Pilate then called together the chief priests and ( S ) the rulers and the people ,
ESV	Luke	23	14	and said to them , “ You brought me this man ( T ) as one who was misleading the people . And ( U ) after examining him before you , behold , I ( V ) did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him .
ESV	Luke	23	15	Neither did Herod , for ( W ) he sent him back to us . Look , nothing deserving death has been done by him .
ESV	Luke	23	16	( X ) I will therefore punish and release him. ” [ a ] Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified
ESV	Luke	23	18	( Y ) But they all cried out together , ( Z ) “ Away with this man , and release to us Barabbas ” —
ESV	Luke	23	19	, some manuscripts add verse
ESV	Luke	23	20	Pilate addressed them once more , desiring to release Jesus ,
ESV	Luke	23	21	but they kept shouting , “ Crucify , crucify him ! ”
ESV	Luke	23	22	A third time he said to them , “ Why ? ( AB ) What evil has he done ? ( AC ) I have found in him no guilt deserving death . ( AD ) I will therefore punish and release him. ”
ESV	Luke	23	24	So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted .
ESV	Luke	23	25	He released the man who had been thrown into prison ( AE ) for insurrection and murder , for whom they asked , ( AF ) but he delivered Jesus over to their will . The Crucifixion
ESV	Luke	23	26	( AG ) And as they led him away , they seized one Simon of Cyrene , who was coming in from the country , and laid on him the cross , to carry it behind Jesus .
ESV	Luke	23	27	And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were ( AH ) mourning and lamenting for him .
ESV	Luke	23	28	But turning to them Jesus said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
ESV	Luke	23	29	For behold , ( AI ) the days are coming when they will say , ( AJ ) ‘ Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed ! ’
ESV	Luke	23	30	( AK ) Then they will begin to say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us , ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us. ’
ESV	Luke	23	31	For ( AL ) if they do these things when ( AM ) the wood is green , what will happen ( AN ) when it is dry ? ”
ESV	Luke	23	32	( AO ) Two others , who were criminals , were led away to be put to death with him .
ESV	Luke	23	33	( AP ) And when they came to the place that is called The Skull , there they crucified him , and the criminals , ( AQ ) one on his right and one on his left .
ESV	Luke	23	34	And Jesus said , “ Father , ( AR ) forgive them , ( AS ) for they know not what they do. ” [ b ] And they cast lots ( AT ) to divide his garments .
ESV	Luke	23	35	And ( AU ) the people stood by , watching , ( AV ) but ( AW ) the rulers ( AX ) scoffed at him , saying , ( AY ) “ He saved others ; ( AZ ) let him save himself , ( BA ) if he is ( BB ) the Christ of God , ( BC ) his Chosen One ! ”
ESV	Luke	23	36	The soldiers also mocked him , coming up and ( BD ) offering him sour wine
ESV	Luke	23	37	and saying , ( BE ) “ If you are ( BF ) the King of the Jews , save yourself ! ”
ESV	Luke	23	38	( BG ) There was also an inscription over him , [ c ] “ This is ( BH ) the King of the Jews. ”
ESV	Luke	23	39	( BI ) One of the criminals who were hanged ( BJ ) railed at him , [ d ] saying , “ Are you not ( BK ) the Christ ? Save yourself and us ! ”
ESV	Luke	23	40	But the other rebuked him , saying , “ Do you not fear God , since you are under the same sentence of condemnation ?
ESV	Luke	23	41	And we indeed justly , for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds ; but this man has done nothing wrong. ”
ESV	Luke	23	42	And he said , “ Jesus , remember me ( BL ) when you come into your kingdom. ”
ESV	Luke	23	43	And he said to him , “ Truly , I say to you , today you will be with me in ( BM ) paradise. ” The Death of Jesus
ESV	Luke	23	44	( BN ) It was now about the sixth hour , [ e ] and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour , [ f ]
ESV	Luke	23	45	while the sun 's light failed . And ( BO ) the curtain of the temple was torn in two .
ESV	Luke	23	46	Then Jesus , ( BP ) calling out with a loud voice , said , “ Father , ( BQ ) into your hands I ( BR ) commit my spirit ! ” And having said this ( BS ) he breathed his last .
ESV	Luke	23	47	Now ( BT ) when the centurion saw what had taken place , ( BU ) he praised God , saying , “ Certainly this man was innocent ! ”
ESV	Luke	23	48	And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle , when they saw what had taken place , returned home ( BV ) beating their breasts .
ESV	Luke	23	49	And all ( BW ) his acquaintances and ( BX ) the women who had followed him from Galilee ( BY ) stood at a distance watching these things . Jesus Is Buried
ESV	Luke	23	50	( BZ ) Now there was a man named Joseph , from the Jewish town of Arimathea . He was a member of the council , a good and righteous man ,
ESV	Luke	23	51	who had not consented to their decision and action ; and he ( CA ) was looking for the kingdom of God .
ESV	Luke	23	52	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
ESV	Luke	23	53	Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and ( CB ) laid him in a tomb cut in stone , ( CC ) where no one had ever yet been laid .
ESV	Luke	23	54	It was the day of ( CD ) Preparation , and the Sabbath was beginning . [ g ]
ESV	Luke	23	55	( CE ) The women ( CF ) who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid .
ESV	Luke	23	56	Then they returned and ( CG ) prepared spices and ointments . On the Sabbath they rested ( CH ) according to the commandment . Footnotes - Luke 23:16 Here , or after verse

ESV	Luke	24	2	And they found ( C ) the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
ESV	Luke	24	3	but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
ESV	Luke	24	4	While they were perplexed about this , behold , ( D ) two ( E ) men stood by them in dazzling apparel .
ESV	Luke	24	5	And as they were ( F ) frightened and bowed their faces to the ground , the men said to them , “ Why do you seek the living among the dead ?
ESV	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but has risen . Remember how he told you , ( G ) while he was still in Galilee ,
ESV	Luke	24	7	( H ) that the Son of Man ( I ) must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and ( J ) be crucified and on ( K ) the third day rise. ”
ESV	Luke	24	8	And ( L ) they remembered his words ,
ESV	Luke	24	9	and returning from the tomb they ( M ) told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest .
ESV	Luke	24	10	Now it was ( N ) Mary Magdalene and ( O ) Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles ,
ESV	Luke	24	11	but these words seemed to them an idle tale , and ( P ) they did not believe them .
ESV	Luke	24	12	But ( Q ) Peter rose and ran to the tomb ; stooping and looking in , he saw ( R ) the linen cloths by themselves ; and he went home marveling at what had happened . On the Road to Emmaus
ESV	Luke	24	13	That very day ( S ) two of them were going to a village named Emmaus , about seven miles [ a ] from Jerusalem ,
ESV	Luke	24	14	and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened .
ESV	Luke	24	15	While they were talking and discussing together , Jesus himself drew near and went with them .
ESV	Luke	24	16	( T ) But their eyes were kept from recognizing him .
ESV	Luke	24	17	And he said to them , “ What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk ? ” And they stood still , looking sad .
ESV	Luke	24	18	Then one of them , named Cleopas , answered him , “ Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days ? ”
ESV	Luke	24	19	And he said to them , “ What things ? ” And they said to him , “ Concerning Jesus of Nazareth , a man who was ( U ) a prophet ( V ) mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ,
ESV	Luke	24	20	and ( W ) how our chief priests and ( X ) rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
ESV	Luke	24	21	But we had hoped that he was ( Y ) the one to redeem Israel . Yes , and besides all this , it is now ( Z ) the third day since these things happened .
ESV	Luke	24	22	Moreover , some women of our company amazed us . ( AA ) They were at the tomb early in the morning ,
ESV	Luke	24	23	and ( AB ) when they did not find his body , they came back saying that ( AC ) they had even seen a vision of angels , who said that he was alive .
ESV	Luke	24	25	And he said to them , “ O foolish ones , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken !
ESV	Luke	24	26	( AE ) Was it not necessary that ( AF ) the Christ should suffer these things and enter into ( AG ) his glory ? ”
ESV	Luke	24	27	And ( AH ) beginning with ( AI ) Moses and ( AJ ) all the Prophets , he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself .
ESV	Luke	24	28	So they drew near to the village to which they were going . ( AK ) He acted as if he were going farther ,
ESV	Luke	24	29	but they urged him strongly , saying , “ Stay with us , for it is toward evening and ( AL ) the day is now far spent. ” So he went in to stay with them .
ESV	Luke	24	30	When he was at table with them , he took the bread and ( AM ) blessed and broke it and gave it to them .
ESV	Luke	24	31	( AN ) And their eyes were opened , and they recognized him . And ( AO ) he vanished from their sight .
ESV	Luke	24	32	They said to each other , ( AP ) “ Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road , while he ( AQ ) opened to us the Scriptures ? ”
ESV	Luke	24	33	And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem . And they ( AR ) found the eleven and ( AS ) those who were with them gathered together ,
ESV	Luke	24	34	saying , “ The Lord has risen indeed , and ( AT ) has appeared to Simon ! ”
ESV	Luke	24	35	Then they told what had happened on the road , and ( AU ) how he was known to them in ( AV ) the breaking of the bread . Jesus Appears to His Disciples
ESV	Luke	24	36	As they were talking about these things , ( AW ) Jesus himself stood among them , and said to them , “ Peace to you ! ”
ESV	Luke	24	37	But they were ( AX ) startled and ( AY ) frightened and ( AZ ) thought they saw a spirit .
ESV	Luke	24	38	And he said to them , “ Why are you troubled , and why do doubts arise in your hearts ?
ESV	Luke	24	39	See my hands and my feet , that it is I myself . ( BA ) Touch me , and see . For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have. ”
ESV	Luke	24	40	And when he had said this , ( BB ) he showed them his hands and his feet .
ESV	Luke	24	41	And while they still disbelieved ( BC ) for joy and were marveling , ( BD ) he said to them , “ Have you anything here to eat ? ”
ESV	Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of broiled fish , [ b ]
ESV	Luke	24	43	and he took it and ate before them .
ESV	Luke	24	44	Then he said to them , ( BE ) “ These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you , ( BF ) that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled. ”
ESV	Luke	24	45	Then ( BG ) he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures ,
ESV	Luke	24	46	and said to them , “ Thus ( BH ) it is written , ( BI ) that the Christ should suffer and on the third day ( BJ ) rise from the dead ,
ESV	Luke	24	47	and that ( BK ) repentance for [ c ] the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed ( BL ) in his name ( BM ) to all nations , ( BN ) beginning from Jerusalem .
ESV	Luke	24	48	( BO ) You are witnesses of these things .
ESV	Luke	24	49	And behold , I am sending ( BP ) the promise of my Father upon you . But stay in the city until you ( BQ ) are clothed with ( BR ) power ( BS ) from on high. ” The Ascension
ESV	Luke	24	50	And ( BT ) he led them out as far as ( BU ) Bethany , and lifting up his hands he blessed them .
ESV	Luke	24	51	While he blessed them , ( BV ) he parted from them and was carried up into heaven .
ESV	Luke	24	52	And they ( BW ) worshiped him and ( BX ) returned to Jerusalem ( BY ) with great joy ,
ESV	Luke	24	53	and ( BZ ) were continually in the temple ( CA ) blessing God . Footnotes - Luke 24:13 Greek sixty stadia ; a stadion was about

ESV	John	1	5	( H ) The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not overcome it .
ESV	John	1	6	There was a man ( I ) sent from God , whose name was ( J ) John .
ESV	John	1	7	He came as a ( K ) witness , to bear witness about the light , ( L ) that all might believe through him .
ESV	John	1	8	( M ) He was not the light , but came to bear witness about the light .
ESV	John	1	9	( N ) The true light , which gives light to everyone , was coming into the world .
ESV	John	1	10	He was in the world , and the world was made through him , yet ( O ) the world did not know him .
ESV	John	1	11	He came to ( P ) his own , [ b ] and ( Q ) his own people [ c ] ( R ) did not receive him .
ESV	John	1	12	But to all who did receive him , ( S ) who believed in his name , ( T ) he gave the right ( U ) to become ( V ) children of God ,
ESV	John	1	13	who ( W ) were born , ( X ) not of blood ( Y ) nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man , but of God .
ESV	John	1	14	And ( Z ) the Word ( AA ) became flesh and ( AB ) dwelt among us , ( AC ) and we have seen his glory , glory as of the only Son [ d ] from the Father , full of ( AD ) grace and ( AE ) truth .
ESV	John	1	15	( ( AF ) John bore witness about him , and cried out , “ This was he of whom I said , ( AG ) ‘ He who comes after me ranks before me , because he was before me. ’ ” )
ESV	John	1	16	For from ( AH ) his fullness we have all received , ( AI ) grace upon grace . [ e ]
ESV	John	1	17	For ( AJ ) the law was given through Moses ; ( AK ) grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
ESV	John	1	18	( AL ) No one has ever seen God ; ( AM ) the only God , [ f ] who is at the Father 's side , [ g ] ( AN ) he has made him known . The Testimony of John the Baptist
ESV	John	1	19	And this is the ( AO ) testimony of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , ( AP ) “ Who are you ? ”
ESV	John	1	20	( AQ ) He confessed , and did not deny , but confessed , “ I am not the Christ. ”
ESV	John	1	21	And they asked him , “ What then ? ( AR ) Are you Elijah ? ” He said , “ I am not. ” “ Are you ( AS ) the Prophet ? ” And he answered , “ No. ”
ESV	John	1	22	So they said to him , “ Who are you ? We need to give an answer to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
ESV	John	1	23	He said , “ I am ( AT ) the voice of one crying out in the wilderness , ‘ Make straight [ h ] the way of the Lord , ’ as the prophet Isaiah said. ”
ESV	John	1	24	( Now they had been sent from the Pharisees . )
ESV	John	1	25	They asked him , ( AU ) “ Then why are you baptizing , if you are neither the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? ”
ESV	John	1	26	John answered them , ( AV ) “ I baptize with water , but among you stands one you do not know ,
ESV	John	1	27	even ( AW ) he who comes after me , the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie. ”
ESV	John	1	28	These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan , where John was baptizing . Behold , the Lamb of God
ESV	John	1	29	The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him , and said , “ Behold , ( AX ) the Lamb of God , who ( AY ) takes away the sin ( AZ ) of the world !
ESV	John	1	30	This is he of whom I said , ( BA ) ‘ After me comes a man who ranks before me , because he was before me. ’
ESV	John	1	31	I myself did not know him , but ( BB ) for this purpose I came baptizing with water , that he might be revealed to Israel. ”
ESV	John	1	32	And John ( BC ) bore witness : ( BD ) “ I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove , and ( BE ) it remained on him .
ESV	John	1	33	I myself did not know him , but ( BF ) he who sent me to baptize ( BG ) with water said to me , ‘ He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain , ( BH ) this is he who baptizes ( BI ) with the Holy Spirit. ’
ESV	John	1	34	And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son [ i ] of God. ” Jesus Calls the First Disciples
ESV	John	1	35	The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples ,
ESV	John	1	36	and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said , “ Behold , ( BJ ) the Lamb of God ! ”
ESV	John	1	37	The two disciples heard him say this , and they followed Jesus .
ESV	John	1	38	Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them , ( BK ) “ What are you seeking ? ” And they said to him , ( BL ) “ Rabbi ” ( which means Teacher ) , “ where are you staying ? ”
ESV	John	1	39	He said to them , “ Come and you will see. ” So they came and saw where he was staying , and they stayed with him that day , for it was about the tenth hour . [ j ]
ESV	John	1	40	( BM ) One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus [ k ] was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother .
ESV	John	1	41	He first found his own brother Simon and said to him , “ We have found ( BN ) the Messiah ” ( which means Christ ) .
ESV	John	1	42	He brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon the son of ( BO ) John . You shall be called ( BP ) Cephas ” ( which means ( BQ ) Peter [ l ] ) . Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael
ESV	John	1	43	( BR ) The next day Jesus decided ( BS ) to go to Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , “ Follow me. ”
ESV	John	1	44	Now ( BT ) Philip was from Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
ESV	John	1	45	Philip found ( BU ) Nathanael and said to him , “ We have found him of whom ( BV ) Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote , Jesus ( BW ) of Nazareth , ( BX ) the son of Joseph. ”
ESV	John	1	46	Nathanael said to him , ( BY ) “ Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? ” Philip said to him , “ Come and see. ”
ESV	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him , “ Behold , ( BZ ) an Israelite indeed , ( CA ) in whom there is no deceit ! ”
ESV	John	1	48	Nathanael said to him , “ How ( CB ) do you know me ? ” Jesus answered him , “ Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you. ”
ESV	John	1	49	Nathanael answered him , ( CC ) “ Rabbi , ( CD ) you are the Son of God ! You are the ( CE ) King of Israel ! ”
ESV	John	1	50	Jesus answered him , “ Because I said to you , ‘ I saw you under the fig tree , ’ do you believe ? You will see greater things than these. ”
ESV	John	1	51	And he said to him , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , [ m ] you will see ( CF ) heaven opened , and ( CG ) the angels of God ascending and descending on ( CH ) the Son of Man. ” Footnotes - John 1:4 Or was not any thing made .

ESV	John	2	2	Jesus also was invited to the wedding with ( C ) his disciples .
ESV	John	2	3	When the wine ran out , the mother of Jesus said to him , “ They have no wine. ”
ESV	John	2	4	And Jesus said to her , ( D ) “ Woman , ( E ) what does this have to do with me ? ( F ) My hour has not yet come. ”
ESV	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you. ”
ESV	John	2	6	Now there were six stone water jars there ( G ) for the Jewish rites of purification , each holding twenty or thirty ( H ) gallons . [ a ]
ESV	John	2	7	Jesus said to the servants , “ Fill the jars with water. ” And they filled them up to the brim .
ESV	John	2	8	And he said to them , “ Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast. ” So they took it .

ESV	John	2	13	( M ) The Passover of the Jews was at hand , and Jesus ( N ) went up to Jerusalem .
ESV	John	2	14	( O ) In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons , and the money-changers sitting there .
ESV	John	2	15	And making a whip of cords , he drove them all out of the temple , with the sheep and oxen . And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables .
ESV	John	2	16	And he told those who sold the pigeons , “ Take these things away ; do not make ( P ) my Father 's house a house of trade. ”
ESV	John	2	17	His disciples remembered that it was written , ( Q ) “ Zeal for your house will consume me. ”
ESV	John	2	18	So the Jews said to him , ( R ) “ What sign do you show us for doing these things ? ”
ESV	John	2	19	Jesus answered them , ( S ) “ Destroy this temple , and in three days ( T ) I will raise it up. ”
ESV	John	2	20	The Jews then said , “ It has taken forty-six years to build this temple , [ c ] and will you raise it up in three days ? ”
ESV	John	2	21	But he was speaking about ( U ) the temple of his body .
ESV	John	2	22	When therefore he was raised from the dead , ( V ) his disciples remembered that he had said this , and they believed ( W ) the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken . Jesus Knows What Is in Man
ESV	John	2	23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast , many believed in his name ( X ) when they saw the signs that he was doing .
ESV	John	2	24	But Jesus ( Y ) on his part did not entrust himself to them , because ( Z ) he knew all people
ESV	John	2	25	and needed no one to bear witness about man , for ( AA ) he himself knew what was in man . Footnotes - John 2:6 Greek two or three measures ( metrētas ) ; a metrētēs was about

ESV	John	3	3	Jesus answered him , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is ( G ) born ( H ) again [ b ] he can not ( I ) see the kingdom of God. ”
ESV	John	3	2	This man came to Jesus [ a ] ( C ) by night and said to him , ( D ) “ Rabbi , ( E ) we know that you are a teacher come from God , for no one can do these signs that you do ( F ) unless God is with him. ”
ESV	John	3	4	Nicodemus said to him , “ How can a man be born when he is old ? Can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb and be born ? ”
ESV	John	3	5	Jesus answered , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is born ( J ) of water and the Spirit , he can not enter the kingdom of God .

ESV	John	3	8	( O ) The wind [ e ] blows ( P ) where it wishes , and you hear its sound , but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes . So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit. ”
ESV	John	3	9	Nicodemus said to him , ( Q ) “ How can these things be ? ”
ESV	John	3	10	Jesus answered him , “ Are you the teacher of Israel ( R ) and yet you do not understand these things ?
ESV	John	3	11	Truly , truly , I say to you , ( S ) we speak of what we know , and bear witness to what we have seen , but ( T ) you [ f ] do not receive our testimony .
ESV	John	3	12	- John 3:13 Some manuscripts add who is in heaven - John 3:15 Some interpreters hold that the quotation ends at verse
ESV	John	3	13	( U ) No one has ( V ) ascended into heaven except ( W ) he who descended from heaven , the Son of Man . [ g ]
ESV	John	3	14	And ( X ) as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , so must the Son of Man ( Y ) be lifted up ,
ESV	John	3	15	- John 3:16 Or For this is how God loved the world - John 3:30 Some interpreters hold that the quotation continues through verse
ESV	John	3	16	“ For ( AB ) God so loved ( AC ) the world , [ i ] ( AD ) that he gave his only Son , that whoever believes in him should not ( AE ) perish but have eternal life .
ESV	John	3	17	For ( AF ) God did not send his Son into the world ( AG ) to condemn the world , but in order that the world might be saved through him .
ESV	John	3	18	( AH ) Whoever believes in him is not condemned , but whoever does not believe is condemned already , because he has not ( AI ) believed in the name of the only Son of God .
ESV	John	3	19	( AJ ) And this is the judgment : ( AK ) the light has come into the world , and ( AL ) people loved the darkness rather than the light because ( AM ) their works were evil .
ESV	John	3	20	( AN ) For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light , ( AO ) lest his works should be exposed .
ESV	John	3	21	But whoever ( AP ) does what is true ( AQ ) comes to the light , so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God. ” John the Baptist Exalts Christ
ESV	John	3	22	After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside , and he remained there with them and ( AR ) was baptizing .
ESV	John	3	23	John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim , because water was plentiful there , and people were coming and being baptized
ESV	John	3	24	( for ( AS ) John had not yet been put in prison ) .
ESV	John	3	25	Now a discussion arose between some of John 's disciples and a Jew over ( AT ) purification .
ESV	John	3	26	And they came to John and said to him , ( AU ) “ Rabbi , he who was with you across the Jordan , ( AV ) to whom you bore witness—look , he is baptizing , and ( AW ) all are going to him. ”
ESV	John	3	27	John answered , ( AX ) “ A person can not receive even one thing ( AY ) unless it is given him ( AZ ) from heaven .
ESV	John	3	28	You yourselves bear me witness , that I said , ( BA ) ‘ I am not the Christ , but ( BB ) I have been sent before him. ’
ESV	John	3	29	( BC ) The one who has the bride is the bridegroom . ( BD ) The friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , ( BE ) rejoices greatly at the bridegroom 's voice . Therefore this joy of mine is now complete .
ESV	John	3	30	( BF ) He must increase , but I must decrease. ” [ j ]
ESV	John	3	31	( BG ) He who comes from above ( BH ) is above all . He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and ( BI ) speaks in an earthly way . ( BJ ) He who comes from heaven ( BK ) is above all .
ESV	John	3	32	( BL ) He bears witness to what he has seen and heard , ( BM ) yet no one receives his testimony .
ESV	John	3	33	Whoever receives his testimony ( BN ) sets his seal to this , ( BO ) that God is true .
ESV	John	3	34	For he whom ( BP ) God has sent utters the words of God , for he gives the Spirit ( BQ ) without measure .

ESV	John	4	4	( C ) And he had to pass through Samaria .
ESV	John	4	2	( although Jesus himself did not baptize , but only his disciples ) ,
ESV	John	4	3	he left Judea and departed ( B ) again for Galilee .
ESV	John	4	5	So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar , near the field ( D ) that Jacob had given to his son Joseph .
ESV	John	4	6	Jacob 's well was there ; so Jesus , ( E ) wearied as he was from his journey , was sitting beside the well . It was about the sixth hour . [ a ]
ESV	John	4	7	A woman from Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , ( F ) “ Give me a drink. ”
ESV	John	4	8	( For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food . )
ESV	John	4	9	The Samaritan woman said to him , “ How is it that you , a Jew , ask for a drink from me , a woman of Samaria ? ” ( ( G ) For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans . )
ESV	John	4	10	Jesus answered her , “ If you knew the gift of God , and who it is that is saying to you , ‘ Give me a drink , ’ you would have asked him , and he would have given you ( H ) living water. ”
ESV	John	4	11	The woman said to him , “ Sir , you have nothing to draw water with , and the well is deep . Where do you get that living water ?
ESV	John	4	12	( I ) Are you greater than our father Jacob ? ( J ) He gave us the well and drank from it himself , as did his sons and his livestock. ”
ESV	John	4	13	Jesus said to her , “ Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again ,
ESV	John	4	14	but ( K ) whoever drinks of the water that I will give him ( L ) will never be thirsty again . [ b ] The water that I will give him will become ( M ) in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. ”
ESV	John	4	15	The woman said to him , “ Sir , ( N ) give me this water , so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water. ”
ESV	John	4	16	Jesus said to her , “ Go , ( O ) call your husband , and come here. ”
ESV	John	4	17	The woman answered him , “ I have no husband. ” Jesus said to her , “ You are right in saying , ‘ I have no husband ’ ;
ESV	John	4	18	for you have had five husbands , and the one you now have is not your husband . What you have said is true. ”
ESV	John	4	19	The woman said to him , “ Sir , I perceive that ( P ) you are ( Q ) a prophet .
ESV	John	4	20	( R ) Our fathers worshiped on ( S ) this mountain , but you say that ( T ) in Jerusalem is ( U ) the place where people ought to worship. ”
ESV	John	4	21	Jesus said to her , ( V ) “ Woman , believe me , ( W ) the hour is coming when ( X ) neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father .
ESV	John	4	22	( Y ) You worship what you do not know ; ( Z ) we worship what we know , for ( AA ) salvation is ( AB ) from the Jews .
ESV	John	4	23	But ( AC ) the hour is coming , and is now here , when the true worshipers will worship the Father ( AD ) in spirit and ( AE ) truth , for the Father ( AF ) is seeking such people to worship him .
ESV	John	4	24	God is spirit , and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. ”
ESV	John	4	25	The woman said to him , “ I know that ( AG ) Messiah is coming ( he who is called Christ ) . When he comes , ( AH ) he will tell us all things. ”
ESV	John	4	26	Jesus said to her , ( AI ) “ I who speak to you am he. ”
ESV	John	4	27	Just then ( AJ ) his disciples came back . They marveled that he was talking with a woman , but no one said , “ What do you seek ? ” or , “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
ESV	John	4	28	So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people ,
ESV	John	4	29	“ Come , see a man ( AK ) who told me all that I ever did . Can this be the Christ ? ”
ESV	John	4	30	They went out of the town and were coming to him .
ESV	John	4	31	Meanwhile the disciples were urging him , saying , ( AL ) “ Rabbi , eat. ”
ESV	John	4	32	But he said to them , “ I have food to eat that you do not know about. ”
ESV	John	4	33	So the disciples said to one another , ( AM ) “ Has anyone brought him something to eat ? ”
ESV	John	4	34	Jesus said to them , ( AN ) “ My food is ( AO ) to do the will of him who sent me and ( AP ) to accomplish his work .
ESV	John	4	35	Do you not say , ‘ There are yet four months , then comes the harvest ’ ? Look , I tell you , lift up your eyes , and see that ( AQ ) the fields are white for harvest .
ESV	John	4	36	Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life , so that ( AR ) sower and ( AS ) reaper ( AT ) may rejoice together .
ESV	John	4	37	For here the saying holds true , ( AU ) ‘ One sows and another reaps. ’
ESV	John	4	38	I sent you to reap ( AV ) that for which you did not labor . Others have labored , ( AW ) and you have entered into their labor. ”
ESV	John	4	39	Many Samaritans ( AX ) from that town believed in him ( AY ) because of ( AZ ) the woman 's testimony , “ He told me all that I ever did. ”
ESV	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to him , they asked him to stay with them , and he stayed there two days .
ESV	John	4	41	And many more believed ( BA ) because of his word .
ESV	John	4	42	They said to the woman , “ It is no longer because of what you said that we believe , for we have heard for ourselves , ( BB ) and we know that this is indeed ( BC ) the Savior ( BD ) of the world. ”
ESV	John	4	43	After ( BE ) the two days he departed for Galilee .
ESV	John	4	44	( For Jesus himself had testified ( BF ) that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown . )
ESV	John	4	45	So when he came to Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him , ( BG ) having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast . For ( BH ) they too had gone to the feast . Jesus Heals an Official 's Son
ESV	John	4	46	So he came again to ( BI ) Cana in Galilee , ( BJ ) where he had made the water wine . And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill.
ESV	John	4	47	When this man heard that Jesus ( BK ) had come from Judea to Galilee , he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
ESV	John	4	48	So Jesus said to him , ( BL ) “ Unless you [ c ] see signs and wonders you will not believe. ”
ESV	John	4	49	The official said to him , “ Sir , come down ( BM ) before my child dies. ”
ESV	John	4	50	Jesus said to him , “ Go ; your son will live. ” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way .
ESV	John	4	51	As he was going down , his servants [ d ] met him and told him that his son was recovering .
ESV	John	4	52	So he asked them the hour when he began to get better , and they said to him , “ Yesterday at the seventh hour [ e ] the fever left him. ”
ESV	John	4	53	The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him , “ Your son will live. ” And he himself believed , ( BN ) and all his household .

ESV	John	5	5	One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years .
ESV	John	5	2	Now there is in Jerusalem by ( B ) the Sheep Gate a pool , in Aramaic [ a ] called Bethesda , [ b ] which has five roofed colonnades .
ESV	John	5	3	In these lay a multitude of invalids—blind , lame , and ( C ) paralyzed . [ c ]
ESV	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time , he said to him , “ Do you want to be healed ? ”
ESV	John	5	7	The sick man answered him , “ Sir , I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up , and while I am going another steps down before me. ”
ESV	John	5	8	Jesus said to him , ( D ) “ Get up , take up your bed , and walk. ”
ESV	John	5	9	( E ) And at once the man was healed , and he took up his bed and walked . ( F ) Now that day was the Sabbath .
ESV	John	5	10	So the Jews [ d ] said to the man who had been healed , “ It is the Sabbath , and ( G ) it is not lawful for you to take up your bed. ”
ESV	John	5	11	But he answered them , “ The man who healed me , that man said to me , ‘ Take up your bed , and walk. ’ ”
ESV	John	5	12	They asked him , “ Who is the man who said to you , ‘ Take up your bed and walk ’ ? ”
ESV	John	5	13	Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was , for ( H ) Jesus had withdrawn , as there was a crowd in the place .
ESV	John	5	14	Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him , “ See , you are well ! ( I ) Sin no more , ( J ) that nothing worse may happen to you. ”

ESV	John	5	18	- John 5:19 Greek he The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	John	5	19	So Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , ( R ) the Son ( S ) can do nothing of his own accord , but only what he sees the Father doing . For whatever the Father [ e ] does , that the Son does likewise .
ESV	John	5	20	For ( T ) the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing . And ( U ) greater works than these will he show him , so that ( V ) you may marvel .
ESV	John	5	21	For as the Father ( W ) raises the dead and ( X ) gives them life , so ( Y ) also the Son gives life ( Z ) to whom he will .
ESV	John	5	22	( AA ) For the Father judges no one , but ( AB ) has given all judgment to the Son ,
ESV	John	5	23	that all may honor the Son , just as they ( AC ) honor the Father . ( AD ) Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
ESV	John	5	24	Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AE ) whoever hears my word and ( AF ) believes him who sent me has eternal life . He ( AG ) does not come into judgment , but ( AH ) has passed from death to life .
ESV	John	5	25	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AI ) an hour is coming , and is now here , when ( AJ ) the dead will hear ( AK ) the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear ( AL ) will live .
ESV	John	5	26	( AM ) For as the Father has life in himself , ( AN ) so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself .
ESV	John	5	27	And he ( AO ) has given him authority to execute judgment , because he is the Son of Man .
ESV	John	5	28	Do not marvel at this , for ( AP ) an hour is coming when ( AQ ) all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
ESV	John	5	29	and come out , ( AR ) those who have done good to the resurrection of life , and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment . Witnesses to Jesus
ESV	John	5	30	( AS ) “ I can do nothing on my own . As I hear , I judge , and ( AT ) my judgment is just , because ( AU ) I seek not my own will ( AV ) but the will of him who sent me .
ESV	John	5	31	( AW ) If I alone bear witness about myself , my testimony is not true .
ESV	John	5	32	There is ( AX ) another who bears witness about me , and ( AY ) I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true .
ESV	John	5	33	( AZ ) You sent to John , and he has borne witness to the truth .
ESV	John	5	34	Not that ( BA ) the testimony that I receive is from man , but I say these things so that you may be saved .
ESV	John	5	35	He was a burning and ( BB ) shining lamp , and ( BC ) you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light .
ESV	John	5	36	But ( BD ) the testimony that I have is greater than that of John . For ( BE ) the works that the Father has given me ( BF ) to accomplish , the very works that I am doing , ( BG ) bear witness about me that ( BH ) the Father has sent me .
ESV	John	5	37	And the Father who sent me ( BI ) has himself borne witness about me . His voice you have never heard , ( BJ ) his form you have never seen ,
ESV	John	5	38	and ( BK ) you do not have his word abiding in you , for you do not believe the one whom he has sent .
ESV	John	5	39	( BL ) You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and ( BM ) it is they that bear witness about me ,
ESV	John	5	40	yet ( BN ) you refuse to come to me that you may have life .
ESV	John	5	41	( BO ) I do not receive glory from people .
ESV	John	5	42	But ( BP ) I know that you do not have ( BQ ) the love of God within you .
ESV	John	5	43	I have come ( BR ) in my Father 's name , and ( BS ) you do not receive me . ( BT ) If another comes in his own name , you will receive him .
ESV	John	5	44	How can you believe , when you receive glory from one another and ( BU ) do not seek the glory that comes from ( BV ) the only God ?
ESV	John	5	45	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father . There is one who accuses you : Moses , ( BW ) on whom you have set your hope .
ESV	John	5	46	For if you believed Moses , you would believe me ; for ( BX ) he wrote of me .

ESV	John	6	6	He said this to test him , for he himself knew what he would do .
ESV	John	6	2	And a large crowd was following him , because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick .
ESV	John	6	3	Jesus went up on ( D ) the mountain , and there he sat down with his disciples .
ESV	John	6	4	Now ( E ) the Passover , the ( F ) feast of the Jews , was at hand .
ESV	John	6	5	( G ) Lifting up his eyes , then , and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him , Jesus said to ( H ) Philip , “ Where are we to buy bread , so that these people may eat ? ”
ESV	John	6	7	( I ) Philip answered him , “ Two hundred denarii [ a ] worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to get a little. ”
ESV	John	6	8	One of his disciples , ( J ) Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , said to him ,
ESV	John	6	9	“ There is a boy here who has five ( K ) barley loaves and two fish , but ( L ) what are they for so many ? ”
ESV	John	6	10	Jesus said , “ Have the people sit down. ” ( M ) Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , about five thousand in number .
ESV	John	6	11	Jesus then took the loaves , and ( N ) when he had given thanks , he distributed them to those who were seated . So also the fish , as much as they wanted .
ESV	John	6	12	And when they had eaten their fill , he told his disciples , “ Gather up the leftover fragments , that nothing may be lost. ”
ESV	John	6	13	So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten .
ESV	John	6	14	When the people saw the sign that he had done , they said , ( O ) “ This is indeed ( P ) the Prophet ( Q ) who is to come into the world ! ”
ESV	John	6	15	( R ) Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king , Jesus ( S ) withdrew again to ( T ) the mountain by himself . Jesus Walks on Water
ESV	John	6	16	When evening came , his disciples went down to the sea ,
ESV	John	6	17	got into a boat , and started across the sea to Capernaum . It was now dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them .
ESV	John	6	18	The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing .
ESV	John	6	19	When they had rowed about three or four miles , [ b ] they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat , and they were frightened .
ESV	John	6	20	( U ) But he said to them , “ It is I ; do not be afraid. ”
ESV	John	6	21	Then they were glad to take him into the boat , and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going . I Am the Bread of Life
ESV	John	6	22	On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only ( V ) one boat there , and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples , but that his disciples had gone away alone .
ESV	John	6	23	Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord ( W ) had given thanks .
ESV	John	6	24	( X ) So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there , nor his disciples , they themselves got into the boats and ( Y ) went to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
ESV	John	6	25	When they found him on the other side of the sea , they said to him , ( Z ) “ Rabbi , when did you come here ? ”
ESV	John	6	26	Jesus answered them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AA ) you are seeking me , not because you saw ( AB ) signs , but because you ate your fill of the loaves .
ESV	John	6	27	( AC ) Do not work for the food that perishes , but for ( AD ) the food that endures to eternal life , which ( AE ) the Son of Man will give to you . For on ( AF ) him God the Father has ( AG ) set his seal. ”
ESV	John	6	28	Then they said to him , “ What must we do , to be doing ( AH ) the works of God ? ”
ESV	John	6	29	Jesus answered them , “ This is the work of God , ( AI ) that you believe in him whom ( AJ ) he has sent. ”
ESV	John	6	30	So they said to him , ( AK ) “ Then what sign do you do , that we may see and believe you ? What work do you perform ?
ESV	John	6	31	( AL ) Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written , ( AM ) ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ’ ”
ESV	John	6	32	Jesus then said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven , but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven .
ESV	John	6	33	For the bread of God is ( AN ) he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. ”
ESV	John	6	34	They said to him , ( AO ) “ Sir , give us this bread always. ”
ESV	John	6	35	Jesus said to them , ( AP ) “ I am the bread of life ; ( AQ ) whoever comes to me shall not hunger , and whoever believes in me shall never thirst .
ESV	John	6	36	But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe .
ESV	John	6	37	( AR ) All that ( AS ) the Father gives me will come to me , and ( AT ) whoever comes to me I will never cast out .
ESV	John	6	38	For ( AU ) I have come down from heaven , not to do ( AV ) my own will but ( AW ) the will of him ( AX ) who sent me .
ESV	John	6	39	And ( AY ) this is the will of him who sent me , ( AZ ) that I should lose nothing of ( BA ) all that he has given me , but ( BB ) raise it up on the last day .
ESV	John	6	40	For this is the will of my Father , that everyone who ( BC ) looks on the Son and ( BD ) believes in him ( BE ) should have eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day. ”
ESV	John	6	41	So the Jews grumbled about him , because he said , ( BF ) “ I am the bread that came down from heaven. ”
ESV	John	6	42	They said , ( BG ) “ Is not this Jesus , ( BH ) the son of Joseph , whose father and mother ( BI ) we know ? How does he now say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? ”
ESV	John	6	43	Jesus answered them , “ Do not grumble among yourselves .
ESV	John	6	44	No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me ( BJ ) draws him . And ( BK ) I will raise him up on the last day .
ESV	John	6	45	It is written in the Prophets , ( BL ) ‘ And they will all be ( BM ) taught by God. ’ ( BN ) Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me—
ESV	John	6	46	( BO ) not that anyone has seen the Father except ( BP ) he who is from God ; he ( BQ ) has seen the Father .
ESV	John	6	47	Truly , truly , I say to you , ( BR ) whoever believes has eternal life .
ESV	John	6	48	( BS ) I am the bread of life .
ESV	John	6	49	( BT ) Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and ( BU ) they died .
ESV	John	6	50	( BV ) This is the bread that comes down from heaven , so that one may eat of it ( BW ) and not die .
ESV	John	6	51	I am the living bread ( BX ) that came down from heaven . If anyone eats of this bread , he will live forever . And the bread that I will give ( BY ) for the life of the world is ( BZ ) my flesh. ”
ESV	John	6	52	The Jews then ( CA ) disputed among themselves , saying , ( CB ) “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
ESV	John	6	53	So Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of ( CC ) the Son of Man and drink his blood , you ( CD ) have no life in you .
ESV	John	6	54	Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood ( CE ) has eternal life , and ( CF ) I will raise him up on the last day .
ESV	John	6	55	For my flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
ESV	John	6	56	Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood ( CG ) abides in me , and I in him .
ESV	John	6	57	As ( CH ) the living Father ( CI ) sent me , and ( CJ ) I live because of the Father , so whoever feeds on me , he also will live because of me .
ESV	John	6	58	( CK ) This is the bread that came down from heaven , not like the bread [ c ] the fathers ate , and died . Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever. ”
ESV	John	6	59	Jesus [ d ] said these things in the synagogue , as he taught ( CL ) at Capernaum . The Words of Eternal Life
ESV	John	6	60	( CM ) When many of his disciples heard it , they said , “ This is a hard saying ; who can listen to it ? ”
ESV	John	6	61	But Jesus , ( CN ) knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this , said to them , “ Do you take offense at this ?
ESV	John	6	62	Then what if you were to see ( CO ) the Son of Man ( CP ) ascending to ( CQ ) where he was before ?
ESV	John	6	63	( CR ) It is the Spirit who gives life ; ( CS ) the flesh is no help at all . ( CT ) The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life .
ESV	John	6	64	But ( CU ) there are some of you who do not believe. ” ( For Jesus ( CV ) knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe , and ( CW ) who it was who would betray him . )
ESV	John	6	65	And he said , “ This is why I told you ( CX ) that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father. ”
ESV	John	6	66	( CY ) After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him .
ESV	John	6	67	So Jesus said to ( CZ ) the twelve , “ Do you want to go away as well ? ”
ESV	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have ( DA ) the words of eternal life ,
ESV	John	6	69	and ( DB ) we have believed , and have come to know , that ( DC ) you are ( DD ) the Holy One of God. ”
ESV	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , ( DE ) “ Did I not choose you , ( DF ) the twelve ? And yet one of you is ( DG ) a devil. ”

ESV	John	7	7	The world can not hate you , but ( I ) it hates me because I testify about it that ( J ) its works are evil .
ESV	John	7	2	Now ( B ) the Jews ' Feast of ( C ) Booths was at hand .
ESV	John	7	3	( D ) So his brothers [ b ] said to him , “ Leave here and go to Judea , that your disciples also may see the works you are doing .
ESV	John	7	4	For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly . If you do these things , ( E ) show yourself to the world. ”
ESV	John	7	5	,
ESV	John	7	6	Jesus said to them , ( H ) “ My time has not yet come , but your time is always here .
ESV	John	7	8	You go up to the feast . I am not [ c ] going up to this feast , for ( K ) my time has not yet fully come. ”

ESV	John	7	11	( M ) The Jews ( N ) were looking for him at the feast , and saying , “ Where is he ? ”
ESV	John	7	12	And there was much ( O ) muttering about him among the people . ( P ) While some said , “ He is a good man , ” others said , “ No , ( Q ) he is leading the people astray. ”
ESV	John	7	13	Yet ( R ) for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him .
ESV	John	7	14	About the middle of the feast Jesus went up ( S ) into the temple and began teaching .
ESV	John	7	15	The Jews therefore ( T ) marveled , saying , “ How is it that this man has learning , [ d ] when he has never studied ? ”
ESV	John	7	16	So Jesus answered them , ( U ) “ My teaching is not mine , but his ( V ) who sent me .
ESV	John	7	17	( W ) If anyone 's will is to do God 's [ e ] will , ( X ) he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I ( Y ) am speaking on my own authority .
ESV	John	7	18	The one who speaks on his own authority ( Z ) seeks his own glory ; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and in him there is no falsehood .
ESV	John	7	19	( AA ) Has not Moses given you the law ? Yet none of you keeps the law . ( AB ) Why do you seek to kill me ? ”
ESV	John	7	20	The crowd answered , ( AC ) “ You have a demon ! Who is seeking to kill you ? ”
ESV	John	7	21	Jesus answered them , “ I did ( AD ) one work , and you all marvel at it .
ESV	John	7	22	( AE ) Moses gave you circumcision ( not that it is from Moses , but ( AF ) from the fathers ) , and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath .
ESV	John	7	23	If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision , so that the law of Moses may not be broken , ( AG ) are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man 's whole body well ?
ESV	John	7	24	( AH ) Do not judge by appearances , but judge with right judgment. ” Can This Be the Christ ?
ESV	John	7	25	Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said , “ Is not this the man whom ( AI ) they seek to kill ?
ESV	John	7	26	And here he is , ( AJ ) speaking openly , and they say nothing to him ! Can it be that ( AK ) the authorities really know that this is the Christ ?
ESV	John	7	27	But ( AL ) we know ( AM ) where this man comes from , and when the Christ appears , ( AN ) no one will know where he comes from. ”
ESV	John	7	28	So Jesus proclaimed , ( AO ) as he taught in the temple , ( AP ) “ You know me , and you know where I come from . But ( AQ ) I have not come of my own accord . ( AR ) He who sent me is true , ( AS ) and him you do not know .
ESV	John	7	29	( AT ) I know him , for I come ( AU ) from him , and ( AV ) he sent me. ”
ESV	John	7	30	( AW ) So they were seeking to arrest him , but ( AX ) no one laid a hand on him , ( AY ) because his hour had not yet come .
ESV	John	7	31	Yet ( AZ ) many of the people believed in him . They said , ( BA ) “ When the Christ appears , will he do more signs than this man has done ? ” Officers Sent to Arrest Jesus
ESV	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd ( BB ) muttering these things about him , and the chief priests and Pharisees sent ( BC ) officers to arrest him .
ESV	John	7	33	Jesus then said , ( BD ) “ I will be with you a little longer , and then ( BE ) I am going to him who sent me .
ESV	John	7	34	( BF ) You will seek me and you will not find me . Where I am you can not come. ”
ESV	John	7	35	The Jews said to one another , “ Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him ? ( BG ) Does he intend to go to ( BH ) the Dispersion among ( BI ) the Greeks and teach the Greeks ?
ESV	John	7	36	What does he mean by saying , ( BJ ) ‘ You will seek me and you will not find me , ’ and , ‘ Where I am you can not come ’ ? ” Rivers of Living Water
ESV	John	7	37	( BK ) On the last day of the feast , the great day , Jesus stood up and cried out , ( BL ) “ If anyone thirsts , let him ( BM ) come to me and drink .
ESV	John	7	38	Whoever believes in me , ( BN ) as [ f ] the Scripture has said , ( BO ) ‘ Out of his heart will flow rivers of ( BP ) living water. ’ ”
ESV	John	7	39	Now ( BQ ) this he said about the Spirit , ( BR ) whom those who believed in him were to receive , ( BS ) for as yet the Spirit had not been ( BT ) given , ( BU ) because Jesus was not yet glorified . Division Among the People
ESV	John	7	40	When they heard these words , ( BV ) some of the people said , “ This really is ( BW ) the Prophet. ”
ESV	John	7	41	Others said , “ This is ( BX ) the Christ. ” But some said , ( BY ) “ Is the Christ to come from Galilee ?
ESV	John	7	42	Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes ( BZ ) from the offspring of David , and comes ( CA ) from Bethlehem , the village ( CB ) where David was ? ”
ESV	John	7	43	So there was ( CC ) a division among the people over him .
ESV	John	7	44	( CD ) Some of them wanted to arrest him , but no one laid hands on him .
ESV	John	7	45	( CE ) The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees , who said to them , “ Why did you not bring him ? ”

ESV	John	8	6	This they said ( E ) to test him , ( F ) that they might have some charge to bring against him . Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground .
ESV	John	8	7	And as they continued to ask him , he stood up and said to them , ( G ) “ Let him who is without sin among you ( H ) be the first to throw a stone at her. ”
ESV	John	8	9	But when they heard it , they went away one by one , beginning with the older ones , and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him .
ESV	John	8	10	Jesus stood up and said to her , “ Woman , where are they ? Has no one condemned you ? ”
ESV	John	8	11	She said , “ No one , Lord. ” And Jesus said , ( I ) “ Neither do I condemn you ; go , and from now on ( J ) sin no more. ” ] ] I Am the Light of the World
ESV	John	8	12	( K ) Again Jesus spoke to them , saying , ( L ) “ I am the light of the world . Whoever ( M ) follows me will not ( N ) walk in darkness , but will have the light of life. ”
ESV	John	8	13	So the Pharisees said to him , ( O ) “ You are bearing witness about yourself ; your testimony is not true. ”
ESV	John	8	14	Jesus answered , “ Even if I do bear witness about myself , ( P ) my testimony is true , for I know ( Q ) where I came from and ( R ) where I am going , but ( S ) you do not know where I come from or where I am going .
ESV	John	8	15	( T ) You judge according to the flesh ; ( U ) I judge no one .
ESV	John	8	16	Yet even if I do judge , ( V ) my judgment is true , for ( W ) it is not I alone who judge , but I and the Father [ a ] who sent me .
ESV	John	8	17	( X ) In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true .
ESV	John	8	18	I am the one who bears witness about myself , and ( Y ) the Father who sent me bears witness about me. ”
ESV	John	8	19	They said to him therefore , “ Where is your Father ? ” Jesus answered , ( Z ) “ You know neither me nor my Father . ( AA ) If you knew me , you would know my Father also. ”
ESV	John	8	20	These words he spoke in ( AB ) the treasury , as he taught in the temple ; but ( AC ) no one arrested him , because ( AD ) his hour had not yet come .
ESV	John	8	21	So he said to them again , ( AE ) “ I am going away , and ( AF ) you will seek me , and ( AG ) you will die in your sin . Where I am going , you can not come. ”
ESV	John	8	22	So the Jews said , ( AH ) “ Will he kill himself , since he says , ‘ Where I am going , you can not come ’ ? ”
ESV	John	8	23	He said to them , ( AI ) “ You are from below ; I am from above . ( AJ ) You are of this world ; ( AK ) I am not of this world .
ESV	John	8	24	I told you that you ( AL ) would die in your sins , for ( AM ) unless you believe that ( AN ) I am he you will die in your sins. ”
ESV	John	8	25	So they said to him , ( AO ) “ Who are you ? ” Jesus said to them , “ Just what I have been telling you from the beginning .
ESV	John	8	26	I have much to say about you and much to judge , but ( AP ) he who sent me is true , and I declare ( AQ ) to the world ( AR ) what I have heard from him. ”
ESV	John	8	27	They did not understand that ( AS ) he had been speaking to them about the Father .
ESV	John	8	28	So Jesus said to them , “ When you have ( AT ) lifted up the Son of Man , ( AU ) then you will know that ( AV ) I am he , and that ( AW ) I do nothing on my own authority , but ( AX ) speak just as the Father taught me .
ESV	John	8	29	And ( AY ) he who sent me is with me . ( AZ ) He has not left me alone , for ( BA ) I always do the things that are pleasing to him. ”
ESV	John	8	30	As he was saying these things , ( BB ) many believed in him . The Truth Will Set You Free
ESV	John	8	31	So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him , ( BC ) “ If you abide in my word , you are truly my disciples ,
ESV	John	8	32	and you will ( BD ) know the truth , and the truth ( BE ) will set you free. ”
ESV	John	8	33	They answered him , ( BF ) “ We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone . How is it that you say , ‘ You will become free ’ ? ”
ESV	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , ( BG ) everyone who practices sin is a slave [ b ] to sin .
ESV	John	8	35	( BH ) The slave does not remain in the house forever ; ( BI ) the son remains forever .
ESV	John	8	36	So if the Son sets you free , you will be free indeed .
ESV	John	8	37	I know that you are offspring of Abraham ; yet ( BJ ) you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you .
ESV	John	8	38	( BK ) I speak of what I have seen with my Father , and you do what you have heard ( BL ) from your father. ” You Are of Your Father the Devil
ESV	John	8	39	They answered him , ( BM ) “ Abraham is our father. ” Jesus said to them , ( BN ) “ If you were Abraham 's children , you would be doing the works Abraham did ,
ESV	John	8	40	but now ( BO ) you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth ( BP ) that I heard from God . This is not what Abraham did .
ESV	John	8	41	You are doing the works your father did. ” They said to him , ( BQ ) “ We were not born of sexual immorality . We have ( BR ) one Father—even God. ”
ESV	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , ( BS ) “ If God were your Father , you would love me , for ( BT ) I came from God and ( BU ) I am here . ( BV ) I came not of my own accord , but ( BW ) he sent me .
ESV	John	8	43	( BX ) Why do you not understand what I say ? It is because you can not ( BY ) bear to hear my word .
ESV	John	8	44	( BZ ) You are of your father the devil , and your will is to do your father 's desires . ( CA ) He was a murderer from the beginning , and ( CB ) does not stand in the truth , because there is no truth in him . ( CC ) When he lies , he speaks out of his own character , for he is a liar and the father of lies .
ESV	John	8	45	But because I tell the truth , you do not believe me .
ESV	John	8	46	Which one of you convicts me of sin ? If I tell the truth , why do you not believe me ?
ESV	John	8	47	( CD ) Whoever is of God hears the words of God . ( CE ) The reason why you do not hear them is that ( CF ) you are not of God. ” Before Abraham Was , I Am
ESV	John	8	48	The Jews answered him , “ Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and ( CG ) have a demon ? ”
ESV	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I do not have a demon , but ( CH ) I honor my Father , and you dishonor me .
ESV	John	8	50	Yet ( CI ) I do not seek my own glory ; there is One who seeks it , and he is the judge .
ESV	John	8	51	Truly , truly , ( CJ ) I say to you , if anyone keeps my word , he will never ( CK ) see death. ”
ESV	John	8	52	The Jews said to him , “ Now we know that you have a demon ! ( CL ) Abraham died , as did the prophets , yet ( CM ) you say , ‘ If anyone keeps my word , he will never ( CN ) taste death. ’
ESV	John	8	53	( CO ) Are you greater than our father Abraham , who died ? And the prophets died ! Who do you make yourself out to be ? ”
ESV	John	8	54	Jesus answered , ( CP ) “ If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . ( CQ ) It is my Father who glorifies me , ( CR ) of whom you say , ‘ He is our God. ’ [ c ]
ESV	John	8	55	But ( CS ) you have not known him . ( CT ) I know him . If I were to say that I do not know him , I would be ( CU ) a liar ( CV ) like you , but I do know him and I keep his word .
ESV	John	8	56	( CW ) Your father Abraham ( CX ) rejoiced ( CY ) that he would see my day . ( CZ ) He saw it and was glad. ”
ESV	John	8	57	So the Jews said to him , “ You are not yet fifty years old , and have you seen Abraham ? ” [ d ]
ESV	John	8	58	Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , before Abraham was , ( DA ) I am. ”
ESV	John	8	59	So ( DB ) they picked up stones to throw at him , but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	John	9	9	Some said , “ It is he. ” Others said , “ No , but he is like him. ” He kept saying , “ I am the man. ”
ESV	John	9	2	And his disciples asked him , ( A ) “ Rabbi , ( B ) who sinned , ( C ) this man or ( D ) his parents , that he was born blind ? ”
ESV	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ It was not that this man sinned , or his parents , but ( E ) that the works of God might be displayed in him .
ESV	John	9	4	We must ( F ) work the works of him who sent me ( G ) while it is day ; night is coming , when no one can work .
ESV	John	9	5	As long as I am in the world , ( H ) I am the light of the world. ”
ESV	John	9	6	Having said these things , ( I ) he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva . ( J ) Then he anointed the man 's eyes with the mud
ESV	John	9	7	and said to him , “ Go , wash in ( K ) the pool of Siloam ” ( which means Sent ) . So he went and washed and ( L ) came back seeing .
ESV	John	9	8	The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying , ( M ) “ Is this not the man who used to sit and beg ? ”
ESV	John	9	10	So they said to him , “ Then how were your eyes opened ? ”
ESV	John	9	11	He answered , ( N ) “ The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me , ‘ Go to Siloam and wash. ’ So I went and washed and received my sight. ”
ESV	John	9	12	They said to him , “ Where is he ? ” He said , “ I do not know. ”
ESV	John	9	13	They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind .
ESV	John	9	14	( O ) Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes .
ESV	John	9	15	( P ) So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight . And he said to them , “ He put mud on my eyes , and I washed , and I see. ”
ESV	John	9	16	Some of the Pharisees said , “ This man is not ( Q ) from God , ( R ) for he does not keep the Sabbath. ” But others said , ( S ) “ How can a man who is a sinner do such signs ? ” And ( T ) there was a division among them .
ESV	John	9	17	So they said again to the blind man , “ What do you say about him , since he has opened your eyes ? ” He said , ( U ) “ He is a prophet. ”
ESV	John	9	18	( V ) The Jews [ a ] did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight , until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight
ESV	John	9	19	and asked them , “ Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? How then does he now see ? ”
ESV	John	9	20	His parents answered , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind .
ESV	John	9	21	But how he now sees we do not know , nor do we know who opened his eyes . Ask him ; he is of age . He will speak for himself. ”
ESV	John	9	22	( His parents said these things ( W ) because they feared the Jews , for ( X ) the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should ( Y ) confess Jesus [ b ] to be Christ , ( Z ) he was to be put out of the synagogue . )
ESV	John	9	23	Therefore his parents said , ( AA ) “ He is of age ; ask him. ”
ESV	John	9	24	So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him , ( AB ) “ Give glory to God . We know that ( AC ) this man is a sinner. ”
ESV	John	9	25	He answered , “ Whether he is a sinner I do not know . One thing I do know , that though I ( AD ) was blind , now I see. ”
ESV	John	9	26	They said to him , “ What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? ”
ESV	John	9	27	He answered them , ( AE ) “ I have told you already , and you would not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you also want to become his disciples ? ”
ESV	John	9	28	And they reviled him , saying , “ You are his disciple , but ( AF ) we are disciples of Moses .
ESV	John	9	29	We know that God has spoken to Moses , but as for this man , ( AG ) we do not know where he comes from. ”
ESV	John	9	30	The man answered , “ Why , this is ( AH ) an amazing thing ! ( AI ) You do not know where he comes from , and yet he opened my eyes .
ESV	John	9	31	We know that ( AJ ) God does not listen to sinners , but ( AK ) if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will , God listens to him .
ESV	John	9	32	Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind .
ESV	John	9	33	( AL ) If this man were not from God , he could do nothing. ”
ESV	John	9	34	They answered him , ( AM ) “ You were born in utter sin , and would you teach us ? ” And they ( AN ) cast him out .
ESV	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out , and having found him he said , “ Do you believe in ( AO ) the Son of Man ? ” [ c ]
ESV	John	9	36	He answered , ( AP ) “ And who is he , sir , that I may believe in him ? ”
ESV	John	9	37	Jesus said to him , “ You have seen him , and ( AQ ) it is he who is speaking to you. ”
ESV	John	9	38	He said , “ Lord , I believe , ” and he worshiped him .
ESV	John	9	39	Jesus said , ( AR ) “ For judgment I came into this world , ( AS ) that those who do not see may see , and ( AT ) those who see may become blind. ”
ESV	John	9	40	Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things , and said to him , ( AU ) “ Are we also blind ? ”

ESV	John	10	10	The thief comes only to steal and ( G ) kill and destroy . I came that they may have life and have it abundantly .
ESV	John	10	2	But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
ESV	John	10	3	To him the gatekeeper opens . The sheep hear his voice , and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
ESV	John	10	4	When he has brought out all his own , he goes before them , and the sheep follow him , for they know his voice .
ESV	John	10	5	( A ) A stranger they will not follow , but they will flee from him , for they do not know the voice of strangers. ”
ESV	John	10	6	This figure of speech Jesus ( B ) used with them , but they ( C ) did not understand what he was saying to them .
ESV	John	10	7	So Jesus again said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , ( D ) I am the door of the sheep .
ESV	John	10	8	All who came before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not listen to them .
ESV	John	10	9	I am the door . If anyone enters by me , ( E ) he will be saved and will go in and out and ( F ) find pasture .
ESV	John	10	11	( H ) I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd ( I ) lays down his life for the sheep .
ESV	John	10	12	He who is ( J ) a hired hand and not a shepherd , who does not own the sheep , sees the wolf coming and ( K ) leaves the sheep and flees , and the wolf snatches them and ( L ) scatters them .
ESV	John	10	13	He flees because ( M ) he is a hired hand and ( N ) cares nothing for the sheep .
ESV	John	10	14	( O ) I am the good shepherd . ( P ) I know my own and ( Q ) my own know me ,
ESV	John	10	15	( R ) just as the Father knows me and I know the Father ; and ( S ) I lay down my life for the sheep .
ESV	John	10	16	And ( T ) I have other sheep that are not of this fold . ( U ) I must bring them also , and ( V ) they will listen to my voice . So there will be ( W ) one flock , ( X ) one shepherd .
ESV	John	10	17	( Y ) For this reason the Father loves me , ( Z ) because ( AA ) I lay down my life that I may take it up again .
ESV	John	10	18	( AB ) No one takes it from me , but ( AC ) I lay it down ( AD ) of my own accord . I have authority to lay it down , and ( AE ) I have authority to take it up again . ( AF ) This charge I have received from my Father. ”
ESV	John	10	19	( AG ) There was again a division among the Jews because of these words .
ESV	John	10	20	Many of them said , ( AH ) “ He has a demon , and ( AI ) is insane ; why listen to him ? ”
ESV	John	10	21	Others said , “ These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon . ( AJ ) Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? ” I and the Father Are One
ESV	John	10	22	At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem . It was winter ,
ESV	John	10	23	and Jesus was walking in the temple , ( AK ) in the colonnade of Solomon .
ESV	John	10	24	So the Jews gathered around him and said to him , “ How long will you keep us in suspense ? If you are ( AL ) the Christ , ( AM ) tell us plainly. ”
ESV	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , “ I told you , and you do not believe . ( AN ) The works that I do ( AO ) in my Father 's name bear witness about me ,
ESV	John	10	26	but ( AP ) you do not believe because you are not among my sheep .
ESV	John	10	27	( AQ ) My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me .
ESV	John	10	28	( AR ) I give them eternal life , and ( AS ) they will never perish , and ( AT ) no one will snatch them out of my hand .
ESV	John	10	29	My Father , ( AU ) who has given them to me , [ a ] ( AV ) is greater than all , and no one is able to snatch them out of ( AW ) the Father 's hand .
ESV	John	10	30	( AX ) I and the Father are one. ”
ESV	John	10	31	( AY ) The Jews picked up stones again to stone him .
ESV	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , “ I have shown you many good works from the Father ; for which of them are you going to stone me ? ”
ESV	John	10	33	The Jews answered him , “ It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but ( AZ ) for blasphemy , because you , being a man , ( BA ) make yourself God. ”
ESV	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , “ Is it not written in ( BB ) your Law , ( BC ) ‘ I said , you are gods ’ ?
ESV	John	10	35	If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture can not be ( BD ) broken—
ESV	John	10	36	do you say of him whom ( BE ) the Father consecrated and ( BF ) sent into the world , ‘ You are blaspheming , ’ because ( BG ) I said , ‘ I am the Son of God ’ ?
ESV	John	10	37	( BH ) If I am not doing the works of my Father , then do not believe me ;
ESV	John	10	38	but if I do them , ( BI ) even though you do not believe me , believe the works , that you may know and understand that ( BJ ) the Father is in me and I am in the Father. ”
ESV	John	10	39	( BK ) Again they sought to arrest him , but he escaped from their hands .
ESV	John	10	40	He went away again across the Jordan to the place ( BL ) where John had been baptizing at first , and there he remained .
ESV	John	10	41	And many came to him . And they said , “ John did no sign , but ( BM ) everything that John said about this man was true. ”

ESV	John	11	11	After saying these things , he said to them , “ Our friend Lazarus ( O ) has fallen asleep , but I go to awaken him. ”
ESV	John	11	2	( B ) It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was ill.
ESV	John	11	3	So the sisters sent to him , saying , “ Lord , ( C ) he whom you love is ill. ”
ESV	John	11	4	But when Jesus heard it he said , ( D ) “ This illness does not lead to death . It is for ( E ) the glory of God , so that the Son of God may be glorified through it. ”
ESV	John	11	5	Now ( F ) Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
ESV	John	11	6	So , when he heard that Lazarus [ a ] was ill , ( G ) he stayed two days longer in the place where he was .
ESV	John	11	7	Then after this he said to the disciples , ( H ) “ Let us go to Judea again. ”
ESV	John	11	8	The disciples said to him , ( I ) “ Rabbi , ( J ) the Jews were just now seeking to stone you , and are you going there again ? ”
ESV	John	11	9	Jesus answered , ( K ) “ Are there not twelve hours in the day ? ( L ) If anyone walks in the day , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
ESV	John	11	10	But ( M ) if anyone walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light is not ( N ) in him. ”
ESV	John	11	12	The disciples said to him , “ Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he will recover. ”
ESV	John	11	13	Now Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep .
ESV	John	11	14	Then Jesus told them plainly , “ Lazarus has died ,
ESV	John	11	15	and for your sake I am glad that I was not there , so that you may believe . But let us go to him. ”
ESV	John	11	16	( P ) So Thomas , called the Twin , [ b ] said to his fellow disciples , “ Let us also go , ( Q ) that we may die with him. ” I Am the Resurrection and the Life
ESV	John	11	17	- John 11:16 Greek Didymus - John 11:18 Greek fifteen stadia ; a stadion was about
ESV	John	11	18	Bethany was near Jerusalem , about two miles [ c ] off ,
ESV	John	11	19	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary ( S ) to console them concerning their brother .
ESV	John	11	20	( T ) So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went and met him , but Mary remained seated in the house .
ESV	John	11	21	Martha said to ( U ) Jesus , “ Lord , ( V ) if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
ESV	John	11	22	But even now I know that whatever you ask from God , ( W ) God will give you. ”
ESV	John	11	23	Jesus said to her , “ Your brother will rise again. ”
ESV	John	11	24	( X ) Martha said to him , “ I know that he will rise again in ( Y ) the resurrection on the last day. ”
ESV	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , ( Z ) “ I am the resurrection and ( AA ) the life . [ d ] Whoever believes in me , ( AB ) though he die , ( AC ) yet shall he live ,
ESV	John	11	26	and everyone who lives and believes in me ( AD ) shall never die . Do you believe this ? ”
ESV	John	11	27	She said to him , “ Yes , Lord ; ( AE ) I believe that ( AF ) you are the Christ , the Son of God , ( AG ) who is coming into the world. ” Jesus Weeps
ESV	John	11	28	When she had said this , she went and called her sister Mary , saying in private , ( AH ) “ The Teacher is here and is calling for you. ”
ESV	John	11	29	And when she heard it , she rose quickly and went to him .
ESV	John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where Martha had met him .
ESV	John	11	31	When the Jews ( AI ) who were with her in the house , consoling her , saw Mary rise quickly and go out , they followed her , supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there .
ESV	John	11	32	Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him , she fell at his feet , saying to him , ( AJ ) “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
ESV	John	11	33	When Jesus saw her weeping , and the Jews who had come with her also weeping , he ( AK ) was deeply moved [ e ] in his spirit and ( AL ) greatly troubled .
ESV	John	11	34	And he said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They said to him , “ Lord , come and see. ”
ESV	John	11	35	( AM ) Jesus wept .
ESV	John	11	36	So the Jews said , “ See ( AN ) how he loved him ! ”
ESV	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ Could not he ( AO ) who opened the eyes of the blind man ( AP ) also have kept this man from dying ? ” Jesus Raises Lazarus

ESV	John	11	39	Jesus said , “ Take away the stone. ” Martha , the sister of the dead man , said to him , “ Lord , by this time there will be an odor , for ( AT ) he has been dead four days. ”
ESV	John	11	40	Jesus said to her , ( AU ) “ Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see ( AV ) the glory of God ? ”
ESV	John	11	41	So they took away the stone . And Jesus ( AW ) lifted up his eyes and said , “ Father , I thank you that you have heard me .
ESV	John	11	42	( AX ) I knew that you always hear me , but I said this ( AY ) on account of the people standing around , ( AZ ) that they may believe that you sent me. ”
ESV	John	11	43	When he had said these things , he cried out with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out. ”
ESV	John	11	44	( BA ) The man who had died came out , ( BB ) his hands and feet bound with linen strips , and ( BC ) his face wrapped with a cloth . Jesus said to them , “ Unbind him , and let him go. ” The Plot to Kill Jesus
ESV	John	11	45	( BD ) Many of the Jews therefore , ( BE ) who had come with Mary and ( BF ) had seen what he did , believed in him ,
ESV	John	11	46	but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
ESV	John	11	47	So the chief priests and the Pharisees ( BG ) gathered ( BH ) the council and said , ( BI ) “ What are we to do ? For this man performs many signs .
ESV	John	11	48	If we let him go on like this , everyone will believe in him , and ( BJ ) the Romans will come and take away both our ( BK ) place and our nation. ”
ESV	John	11	49	But one of them , ( BL ) Caiaphas , ( BM ) who was high priest that year , said to them , “ You know nothing at all .
ESV	John	11	50	Nor do you understand that ( BN ) it is better for you that one man should die for the people , not that the whole nation should perish. ”
ESV	John	11	51	He did not say this of his own accord , but ( BO ) being high priest that year ( BP ) he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation ,
ESV	John	11	52	and ( BQ ) not for the nation only , but also ( BR ) to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad .
ESV	John	11	53	So from that day on they ( BS ) made plans to put him to death .
ESV	John	11	54	Jesus therefore ( BT ) no longer walked openly among the Jews , but went from there to the region near the wilderness , to a town called Ephraim , and there he stayed with the disciples .
ESV	John	11	55	Now ( BU ) the Passover of the Jews was at hand , and ( BV ) many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover ( BW ) to purify themselves .
ESV	John	11	56	( BX ) They were looking for [ f ] Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple , “ What do you think ? That he will not come to the feast at all ? ”
ESV	John	11	57	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was , he should let them know , so that they might arrest him . Footnotes - John 11:6 Greek he ; also verse

ESV	John	12	12	The next day ( K ) the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem .
ESV	John	12	2	So they gave a dinner for him there . ( D ) Martha served , and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table .
ESV	John	12	3	( E ) Mary therefore took a pound [ a ] of expensive ointment made from pure nard , and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair . The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
ESV	John	12	4	But Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples ( he who was about to betray him ) , said ,
ESV	John	12	5	“ Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii [ b ] and ( F ) given to the poor ? ”
ESV	John	12	6	He said this , not because he cared about the poor , but because he was a thief , and ( G ) having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it .
ESV	John	12	7	Jesus said , “ Leave her alone , so that she may keep it [ c ] for the day of my burial .
ESV	John	12	8	For the poor you always have with you , but you do not always have me. ” The Plot to Kill Lazarus
ESV	John	12	9	When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus [ d ] was there , they came , not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus , ( H ) whom he had raised from the dead .
ESV	John	12	10	( I ) So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well ,
ESV	John	12	11	because ( J ) on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus . The Triumphal Entry
ESV	John	12	13	So they took branches of ( L ) palm trees and went out to meet him , crying out , ( M ) “ Hosanna ! Blessed is ( N ) he who comes in the name of the Lord , even ( O ) the King of Israel ! ”
ESV	John	12	14	And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it , just as it is written ,
ESV	John	12	15	( P ) “ Fear not , daughter of Zion ; behold , your king is coming , sitting on a donkey 's colt ! ”
ESV	John	12	16	( Q ) His disciples did not understand these things at first , but ( R ) when Jesus was glorified , then ( S ) they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him .
ESV	John	12	17	( T ) The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness .
ESV	John	12	18	The reason why the crowd went to meet him ( U ) was that they heard he had done this sign .
ESV	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to one another , ( V ) “ You see that you are gaining nothing . Look , ( W ) the world has gone after him. ” Some Greeks Seek Jesus
ESV	John	12	20	Now ( X ) among those who went up to worship at the feast were some ( Y ) Greeks .
ESV	John	12	21	So these came to ( Z ) Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and asked him , “ Sir , we wish to see Jesus. ”
ESV	John	12	22	Philip went and told ( AA ) Andrew ; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus .
ESV	John	12	23	And Jesus answered them , ( AB ) “ The hour has come ( AC ) for the Son of Man to be glorified .
ESV	John	12	24	Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AD ) unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it bears much fruit .
ESV	John	12	25	( AE ) Whoever loves his life loses it , and ( AF ) whoever ( AG ) hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life .
ESV	John	12	26	If anyone serves me , he must ( AH ) follow me ; and ( AI ) where I am , there will my servant be also . ( AJ ) If anyone serves me , ( AK ) the Father will honor him . The Son of Man Must Be Lifted Up
ESV	John	12	27	( AL ) “ Now is my soul troubled . And what shall I say ? ‘ Father , ( AM ) save me from ( AN ) this hour ’ ? But ( AO ) for this purpose I have come to ( AP ) this hour .
ESV	John	12	28	Father , glorify your name. ” Then ( AQ ) a voice came from heaven : “ I have glorified it , and I will glorify it again. ”
ESV	John	12	29	The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered . Others said , ( AR ) “ An angel has spoken to him. ”
ESV	John	12	30	Jesus answered , ( AS ) “ This voice has come for your sake , not mine .
ESV	John	12	31	( AT ) Now is the judgment of this world ; now will ( AU ) the ruler of this world ( AV ) be cast out .
ESV	John	12	32	And I , ( AW ) when I am lifted up from the earth , ( AX ) will draw ( AY ) all people to myself. ”
ESV	John	12	33	He said this ( AZ ) to show by what kind of death he was going to die .
ESV	John	12	34	So the crowd answered him , “ We have heard from the Law that ( BA ) the Christ remains forever . How can you say that ( BB ) the Son of Man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
ESV	John	12	35	So Jesus said to them , ( BC ) “ The light is among you ( BD ) for a little while longer . ( BE ) Walk while you have the light , lest darkness ( BF ) overtake you . ( BG ) The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going .
ESV	John	12	36	While you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become ( BH ) sons of light. ” The Unbelief of the People When Jesus had said these things , he departed and hid himself from them .
ESV	John	12	37	Though he had done so many signs before them , they still did not believe in him ,
ESV	John	12	38	( BI ) so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled : ( BJ ) “ Lord , who has believed what he heard from us , and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ”
ESV	John	12	39	Therefore they ( BK ) could not believe . For again Isaiah said ,
ESV	John	12	40	( BL ) “ He has blinded their eyes and ( BM ) hardened their heart , lest they see with their eyes , and understand with their heart , and turn , and I would heal them. ”
ESV	John	12	41	Isaiah said these things because ( BN ) he saw his glory and ( BO ) spoke of him .
ESV	John	12	42	Nevertheless , ( BP ) many even of the authorities believed in him , but ( BQ ) for fear of the Pharisees they did not ( BR ) confess it , so that they would not be ( BS ) put out of the synagogue ;
ESV	John	12	43	( BT ) for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God . Jesus Came to Save the World
ESV	John	12	44	And Jesus cried out and said , ( BU ) “ Whoever believes in me , believes not in me but ( BV ) in him who sent me .
ESV	John	12	45	And ( BW ) whoever ( BX ) sees me sees him who sent me .
ESV	John	12	46	( BY ) I have come into the world as light , so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness .
ESV	John	12	47	If anyone ( BZ ) hears my words and does not keep them , ( CA ) I do not judge him ; for ( CB ) I did not come to judge the world but to save the world .
ESV	John	12	48	( CC ) The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge ; ( CD ) the word that I have spoken will judge him ( CE ) on the last day .
ESV	John	12	49	For ( CF ) I have not spoken on my own authority , but the Father ( CG ) who sent me has himself given me ( CH ) a commandment—what to say and what to speak .
ESV	John	12	50	And I know that his commandment is eternal life . What I say , therefore , I say as the Father has told me. ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	John	13	13	( W ) You call me ( X ) Teacher and Lord , and you are right , for so I am .
ESV	John	13	2	During supper , when ( G ) the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ,
ESV	John	13	3	Jesus , knowing ( H ) that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that ( I ) he had come from God and ( J ) was going back to God ,
ESV	John	13	4	rose from supper . He laid aside his outer garments , and taking a towel , ( K ) tied it around his waist .
ESV	John	13	5	Then he ( L ) poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples ' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
ESV	John	13	6	He came to Simon Peter , who said to him , “ Lord , do you wash my feet ? ”
ESV	John	13	7	( M ) Jesus answered him , “ What I am doing ( N ) you do not understand now , but afterward you will understand. ”
ESV	John	13	8	( O ) Peter said to him , “ You shall never wash my feet. ” Jesus answered him , ( P ) “ If I do not wash you , you have no share with me. ”
ESV	John	13	9	Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , not my feet only but also my hands and my head ! ”
ESV	John	13	10	Jesus said to him , “ The one who has bathed does not need to wash , ( Q ) except for his feet , [ a ] but is completely clean . And ( R ) you [ b ] are clean , ( S ) but not every one of you. ”
ESV	John	13	11	( T ) For he knew who was to betray him ; that was why he said , “ Not all of you are clean. ”
ESV	John	13	12	When he had washed their feet and ( U ) put on his outer garments and resumed his place , he said to them , ( V ) “ Do you understand what I have done to you ?
ESV	John	13	14	If I then , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , ( Y ) you also ought to wash one another 's feet .
ESV	John	13	15	For I have given you an example , ( Z ) that you also should do just as I have done to you .
ESV	John	13	16	Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AA ) a servant [ c ] is not greater than his master , nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him .
ESV	John	13	17	If you know these things , ( AB ) blessed are you if you do them .
ESV	John	13	18	( AC ) I am not speaking of all of you ; I know ( AD ) whom I have chosen . But ( AE ) the Scripture will be fulfilled , [ d ] ( AF ) ‘ He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me. ’
ESV	John	13	19	( AG ) I am telling you this now , before it takes place , that when it does take place you may believe that I am he .
ESV	John	13	20	Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AH ) whoever receives the one I send receives me , and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me. ” One of You Will Betray Me
ESV	John	13	21	After saying these things , ( AI ) Jesus was troubled in his spirit , and testified , ( AJ ) “ Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AK ) one of you will betray me. ”
ESV	John	13	22	( AL ) The disciples looked at one another , uncertain of whom he spoke .
ESV	John	13	23	( AM ) One of his disciples , whom Jesus loved , was reclining at table ( AN ) at Jesus ' side , [ e ]
ESV	John	13	24	so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus [ f ] of whom he was speaking .
ESV	John	13	25	( AO ) So that disciple , ( AP ) leaning back against Jesus , said to him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
ESV	John	13	26	Jesus answered , ( AQ ) “ It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread ( AR ) when I have dipped it. ” So when he had dipped the morsel , ( AS ) he gave it to Judas , ( AT ) the son of Simon Iscariot .
ESV	John	13	27	Then after he had taken the morsel , ( AU ) Satan entered into him . Jesus said to him , ( AV ) “ What you are going to do , do quickly. ”
ESV	John	13	28	Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him .
ESV	John	13	29	Some thought that , ( AW ) because Judas had the moneybag , Jesus was telling him , “ Buy what we need ( AX ) for the feast , ” or that he should ( AY ) give something to the poor .
ESV	John	13	30	So , after receiving the morsel of bread , he immediately went out . ( AZ ) And it was night . A New Commandment
ESV	John	13	31	When he had gone out , Jesus said , ( BA ) “ Now is the Son of Man glorified , and ( BB ) God is glorified in him .
ESV	John	13	32	If God is glorified in him , ( BC ) God will also glorify him in himself , and ( BD ) glorify him at once .
ESV	John	13	33	Little children , ( BE ) yet a little while I am with you . You will seek me , and just ( BF ) as I said to the Jews , so now I also say to you , ‘ Where I am going you can not come. ’
ESV	John	13	34	( BG ) A new commandment ( BH ) I give to you , ( BI ) that you love one another : ( BJ ) just as I have loved you , you also are to love one another .
ESV	John	13	35	( BK ) By this all people will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another. ” Jesus Foretells Peter 's Denial
ESV	John	13	36	Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” ( BL ) Jesus answered him , “ Where I am going ( BM ) you can not follow me now , ( BN ) but you will follow afterward. ”
ESV	John	13	37	( BO ) Peter said to him , “ Lord , why can I not follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you. ”

ESV	John	16	6	But because I have said these things to you , ( J ) sorrow has filled your heart .

ESV	John	16	18	So they were saying , “ What does he mean by ‘ a little while ’ ? ( AI ) We do not know what he is talking about. ”
ESV	John	16	19	( AJ ) Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him , so he said to them , “ Is this what you are asking yourselves , what I meant by saying , ‘ A little while and you will not see me , and again a little while and you will see me ’ ?
ESV	John	16	20	Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AK ) you will weep and lament , but ( AL ) the world will rejoice . You will be sorrowful , but ( AM ) your sorrow will turn into joy .
ESV	John	16	21	( AN ) When a woman is giving birth , she has sorrow because her hour has come , but when she has delivered the baby , she no longer remembers the anguish , for joy that a human being has been born into the world .
ESV	John	16	22	( AO ) So also you have sorrow now , but ( AP ) I will see you again , and ( AQ ) your hearts will rejoice , and no one will take your joy from you .
ESV	John	16	23	( AR ) In that day you will ( AS ) ask nothing of me . Truly , truly , I say to you , ( AT ) whatever you ask of the Father in my name , ( AU ) he will give it to you .
ESV	John	16	24	Until now you have asked nothing in my name . ( AV ) Ask , and you will receive , ( AW ) that your joy may be full . I Have Overcome the World
ESV	John	16	25	“ I have said these things to you in figures of speech . ( AX ) The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father .
ESV	John	16	26	In that day you will ask in my name , and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf ;
ESV	John	16	27	( AY ) for the Father himself loves you , because ( AZ ) you have loved me and ( BA ) have believed that I came from God . [ a ]
ESV	John	16	28	( BB ) I came from the Father and have come into the world , and now ( BC ) I am leaving the world and going to the Father. ”
ESV	John	16	29	His disciples said , “ Ah , now you are speaking plainly and not ( BD ) using figurative speech !
ESV	John	16	30	Now we know that ( BE ) you know all things and do not need anyone to question you ; this is why we believe that ( BF ) you came from God. ”
ESV	John	16	31	Jesus answered them , “ Do you now believe ?
ESV	John	16	32	Behold , ( BG ) the hour is coming , indeed it has come , when ( BH ) you will be scattered , each to his own home , and ( BI ) will leave me alone . ( BJ ) Yet I am not alone , for the Father is with me .
ESV	John	16	33	I have said these things to you , that ( BK ) in me you may have peace . ( BL ) In the world you will have ( BM ) tribulation . But ( BN ) take heart ; ( BO ) I have overcome the world. ” Footnotes - John 16:27 Some manuscripts from the Father The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	John	18	2	Now Judas , who betrayed him , also knew ( C ) the place , for ( D ) Jesus often met there with his disciples .
ESV	John	18	3	( E ) So Judas , having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , went there with lanterns and torches and weapons .
ESV	John	18	4	Then Jesus , ( F ) knowing all that would happen to him , came forward and said to them , ( G ) “ Whom do you seek ? ”
ESV	John	18	5	They answered him , “ Jesus of Nazareth. ” Jesus said to them , “ I am he. ” [ a ] Judas , who betrayed him , was standing with them .
ESV	John	18	6	,
ESV	John	18	7	So he asked them again , ( I ) “ Whom do you seek ? ” And they said , “ Jesus of Nazareth. ”

ESV	John	18	9	( J ) This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken : “ Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one. ”
ESV	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , ( K ) having a sword , drew it and struck the high priest 's servant [ c ] and cut off his right ear . ( The servant 's name was Malchus . )

ESV	John	18	12	So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews [ d ] arrested Jesus and bound him .
ESV	John	18	13	First they ( M ) led him to ( N ) Annas , for he was the father-in-law of ( O ) Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
ESV	John	18	14	,
ESV	John	18	15	( Q ) Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple . Since that disciple was known to the high priest , he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest ,
ESV	John	18	16	( R ) but Peter stood outside at the door . So the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door , and brought Peter in .
ESV	John	18	17	( S ) The servant girl at the door said to Peter , “ You also are not one of this man 's disciples , are you ? ” He said , “ I am not. ”
ESV	John	18	19	( U ) The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching .
ESV	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , “ I have spoken ( V ) openly ( W ) to the world . I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple , where all Jews come together . ( X ) I have said nothing in secret .
ESV	John	18	21	Why do you ask me ? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them ; they know what I said. ”
ESV	John	18	22	When he had said these things , one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand , saying , ( Y ) “ Is that how you answer the high priest ? ”
ESV	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , “ If what I said is wrong , bear witness about the wrong ; but if what I said is right , why do you strike me ? ”
ESV	John	18	24	( Z ) Annas then sent him bound to ( AA ) Caiaphas the high priest . Peter Denies Jesus Again

ESV	John	18	28	( AF ) Then they led Jesus ( AG ) from the house of Caiaphas to ( AH ) the governor 's headquarters . [ f ] It was early morning . They themselves did not enter the governor 's headquarters , ( AI ) so that they would not be defiled , ( AJ ) but could eat the Passover .
ESV	John	18	29	( AK ) So Pilate went outside to them and said , “ What accusation do you bring against this man ? ”
ESV	John	18	30	They answered him , “ If this man were not doing evil , we would not have delivered him over to you. ”
ESV	John	18	31	,

ESV	John	18	33	( AO ) So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him , ( AP ) “ Are you the King of the Jews ? ”
ESV	John	18	34	Jesus answered , “ Do you say this of your own accord , or did others say it to you about me ? ”
ESV	John	18	35	Pilate answered , “ Am I a Jew ? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me . What have you done ? ”
ESV	John	18	36	,
ESV	John	18	37	Then Pilate said to him , “ So you are a king ? ” Jesus answered , ( AU ) “ You say that I am a king .

ESV	John	19	19	Pilate ( AB ) also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross . It read , “ Jesus of Nazareth , the King of the Jews. ”
ESV	John	19	2	( B ) And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe .
ESV	John	19	3	They came up to him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ” and struck him with their hands .
ESV	John	19	4	Pilate went out again and said to them , “ See , I am bringing him out to you that you may know that ( C ) I find no guilt in him. ”
ESV	John	19	5	So Jesus came out , wearing ( D ) the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said to them , ( E ) “ Behold the man ! ”
ESV	John	19	6	When the chief priests and the officers saw him , they cried out , “ Crucify him , crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them , ( F ) “ Take him yourselves and crucify him , for ( G ) I find no guilt in him. ”
ESV	John	19	7	The Jews [ a ] answered him , “ We have a law , and ( H ) according to that law he ought to die because ( I ) he has made himself the Son of God. ”
ESV	John	19	8	When Pilate heard this statement , ( J ) he was even more afraid .
ESV	John	19	9	( K ) He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus , ( L ) “ Where are you from ? ” But ( M ) Jesus gave him no answer .

ESV	John	19	14	,
ESV	John	19	15	They cried out , ( V ) “ Away with him , away with him , crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Shall I crucify your King ? ” The chief priests answered , “ We have no king but Caesar. ”
ESV	John	19	16	( W ) So he ( X ) delivered him over to them to be crucified . The Crucifixion So they took Jesus ,
ESV	John	19	17	,
ESV	John	19	18	( AA ) There they crucified him , and with him two others , one on either side , and Jesus between them .
ESV	John	19	20	- John 19:14 That is , about noon - John 19:23 Greek chiton , a long garment worn under the cloak next to the skin - John 19:39 Greek him - John 19:39 Greek one hundred litras ; a litra ( or Roman pound ) was equal to about
ESV	John	19	21	So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , “ Do not write , ‘ The King of the Jews , ’ but rather , ‘ This man said , I am King of the Jews. ’ ”
ESV	John	19	22	Pilate answered , ( AD ) “ What I have written I have written. ”
ESV	John	19	23	( AE ) When the soldiers had crucified Jesus , they took his garments and divided them into four parts , one part for each soldier ; also his tunic . [ d ] But the tunic was seamless , woven in one piece from top to bottom ,
ESV	John	19	24	so they said to one another , “ Let us not tear it , but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be. ” ( AF ) This was to fulfill the Scripture which says , ( AG ) “ They divided my garments among them , and for my clothing they cast lots. ” So the soldiers did these things ,
ESV	John	19	25	( AH ) but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
ESV	John	19	26	When Jesus saw his mother and ( AI ) the disciple whom he loved standing nearby , he said to his mother , ( AJ ) “ Woman , behold , your son ! ”
ESV	John	19	27	Then he said to the disciple , “ Behold , your mother ! ” And from that hour the disciple took her to ( AK ) his own home . The Death of Jesus
ESV	John	19	28	After this , Jesus , knowing that all was now ( AL ) finished , said ( ( AM ) to fulfill the Scripture ) , ( AN ) “ I thirst. ”
ESV	John	19	29	A jar full of sour wine stood there , ( AO ) so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth .
ESV	John	19	30	When Jesus had received the sour wine , he said , ( AP ) “ It is finished , ” and he bowed his head and ( AQ ) gave up his spirit . Jesus ' Side Is Pierced
ESV	John	19	31	,
ESV	John	19	32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first , and of the other ( AU ) who had been crucified with him .
ESV	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
ESV	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and at once there came out ( AV ) blood and water .
ESV	John	19	35	( AW ) He who saw it has borne witness— ( AX ) his testimony is true , and he knows that he is telling the truth— ( AY ) that you also may believe .
ESV	John	19	36	( AZ ) For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled : ( BA ) “ Not one of his bones ( BB ) will be broken. ”
ESV	John	19	37	And again another Scripture says , ( BC ) “ They will look on him whom they have pierced. ” Jesus Is Buried
ESV	John	19	38	- John 19:13 Or Hebrew ; also verses
ESV	John	19	39	( BF ) Nicodemus also , who earlier had come to Jesus [ e ] by night , came ( BG ) bringing a mixture of ( BH ) myrrh and aloes , about seventy-five pounds [ f ] in weight .
ESV	John	19	40	So they took the body of Jesus and ( BI ) bound it in ( BJ ) linen cloths with the spices , as is the burial custom of the Jews .
ESV	John	19	41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a ( BK ) garden , and ( BL ) in the garden a new tomb ( BM ) in which no one had yet been laid .
ESV	John	19	42	So because of the Jewish ( BN ) day of Preparation , ( BO ) since the tomb was close at hand , they laid Jesus there . Footnotes - John 19:7 Greek Ioudaioi probably refers here to Jewish religious leaders , and others under their influence , in that time ; also verses

ESV	John	20	20	When he had said this , ( AD ) he showed them his hands and his side . Then ( AE ) the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord .
ESV	John	20	2	So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple , ( C ) the one whom Jesus loved , and said to them , “ They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and ( D ) we do not know where they have laid him. ”
ESV	John	20	3	( E ) So Peter went out with the other disciple , and they were going toward the tomb .
ESV	John	20	4	Both of them were running together , but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first .
ESV	John	20	5	And stooping to look in , he saw ( F ) the linen cloths lying there , but he did not go in .
ESV	John	20	6	Then Simon Peter came , following him , and went into the tomb . He saw the linen cloths lying there ,
ESV	John	20	7	and ( G ) the face cloth , which had been on Jesus ' [ a ] head , not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself .
ESV	John	20	8	Then the other disciple , ( H ) who had reached the tomb first , also went in , and he saw and believed ;
ESV	John	20	9	for as yet ( I ) they did not understand the Scripture , ( J ) that he must rise from the dead .
ESV	John	20	10	Then the disciples went back to their homes . Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene
ESV	John	20	11	But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb , and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb .
ESV	John	20	12	And ( K ) she saw ( L ) two angels in white , sitting where the body of Jesus had lain , one at the head and one at the feet .
ESV	John	20	13	They said to her , ( M ) “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She said to them , ( N ) “ They have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have laid him. ”
ESV	John	20	14	Having said this , she turned around and ( O ) saw Jesus standing , ( P ) but she did not know that it was Jesus .
ESV	John	20	15	Jesus said to her , ( Q ) “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ( R ) Whom are you seeking ? ” Supposing him to be ( S ) the gardener , she said to him , “ Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have laid him , and I will take him away. ”
ESV	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , “ Mary. ” She turned and said to him in Aramaic , [ b ] ( T ) “ Rabboni ! ” ( which means Teacher ) .
ESV	John	20	17	Jesus said to her , “ Do not cling to me , for I have not yet ascended to the Father ; but go to ( U ) my brothers and say to them , ( V ) ‘ I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to ( W ) my God and your God. ’ ”
ESV	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene ( X ) went and announced to the disciples , “ I have seen the Lord ” —and that he had said these things to her . Jesus Appears to the Disciples
ESV	John	20	19	( Y ) On the evening ( Z ) of that day , the first day of the week , ( AA ) the doors being locked where the disciples were ( AB ) for fear of the Jews , [ c ] Jesus came and stood among them and said to them , ( AC ) “ Peace be with you. ”
ESV	John	20	21	Jesus said to them again , “ Peace be with you . As ( AF ) the Father has sent me , ( AG ) even so I am sending you. ”
ESV	John	20	22	And when he had said this , he ( AH ) breathed on them and said to them , ( AI ) “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
ESV	John	20	23	( AJ ) If you forgive the sins of any , they are forgiven them ; if you withhold forgiveness from any , it is withheld. ” Jesus and Thomas
ESV	John	20	24	Now ( AK ) Thomas , one of the twelve , called the Twin , [ d ] was not with them when Jesus came .
ESV	John	20	25	So the other disciples told him , “ We have seen the Lord. ” But he said to them , ( AL ) “ Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails , and place my finger into the mark of the nails , and place my hand into his side , I will never believe. ”
ESV	John	20	26	Eight days later , his disciples were inside again , and Thomas was with them . ( AM ) Although the doors were locked , Jesus came and stood among them and said , ( AN ) “ Peace be with you. ”
ESV	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas , ( AO ) “ Put your finger here , and see my hands ; and put out your hand , and place it in my side . Do not disbelieve , but believe. ”
ESV	John	20	28	Thomas answered him , ( AP ) “ My Lord and my God ! ”
ESV	John	20	29	Jesus said to him , “ Have you believed because you have seen me ? ( AQ ) Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed. ” The Purpose of This Book
ESV	John	20	30	( AR ) Now Jesus did many other signs ( AS ) in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book ;
ESV	John	20	31	( AT ) but these are written so that you may ( AU ) believe that Jesus is the Christ , ( AV ) the Son of God , and that by believing ( AW ) you may have life ( AX ) in his name .

ESV	John	21	2	Simon Peter , ( D ) Thomas ( called the Twin ) , Nathanael of ( E ) Cana in Galilee , ( F ) the sons of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples were together .
ESV	John	21	3	Simon Peter said to them , “ I am going fishing. ” They said to him , “ We will go with you. ” They went out and got into the boat , but ( G ) that night they caught nothing .
ESV	John	21	4	Just as day was breaking , Jesus stood on the shore ; yet the disciples ( H ) did not know that it was Jesus .
ESV	John	21	5	( I ) Jesus said to them , “ Children , do you have any fish ? ” They answered him , “ No. ”
ESV	John	21	6	( J ) He said to them , “ Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some. ” So they cast it , and now they were not able to haul it in , because of the quantity of fish .
ESV	John	21	7	That disciple ( K ) whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , ( L ) he put on his outer garment , for he was ( M ) stripped for work , and ( N ) threw himself into the sea .
ESV	John	21	8	The other disciples came in the boat , dragging the net full of fish , for they were not far from the land , but about a hundred yards [ a ] off .
ESV	John	21	9	When they got out on land , they saw a charcoal fire in place , with fish laid out on it , and bread .
ESV	John	21	10	Jesus said to them , “ Bring some of the fish that you have just caught. ”

ESV	John	21	15	When they had ( T ) finished breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , ( U ) “ Simon , ( V ) son of John , ( W ) do you love me more than these ? ” He said to him , “ Yes , Lord ; you know that I love you. ” He said to him , “ Feed ( X ) my lambs. ”
ESV	John	21	16	He said to him a second time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” He said to him , “ Yes , Lord ; you know that I love you. ” He said to him , ( Y ) “ Tend ( Z ) my sheep. ”
ESV	John	21	17	He said to him the third time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was grieved because he said to him ( AA ) the third time , “ Do you love me ? ” and he said to him , “ Lord , ( AB ) you know everything ; you know that I love you. ” Jesus said to him , “ Feed ( AC ) my sheep .

ESV	John	21	22	Jesus said to him , “ If it is my will that he remain ( AJ ) until ( AK ) I come , what is that to you ? ( AL ) You follow me ! ”
ESV	John	21	23	So the saying spread abroad among ( AM ) the brothers [ b ] that this disciple was not to die ; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die , but , “ If it is my will that he remain until I come , what is that to you ? ”
ESV	John	21	24	This is the disciple ( AN ) who is bearing witness about these things , and who has written these things , and ( AO ) we know ( AP ) that his testimony is true .

ESV	Romans	1	1	Paul , ( A ) a servant [ a ] of Christ Jesus , ( B ) called to be an apostle , ( C ) set apart for the gospel of God ,
ESV	Romans	1	2	which ( D ) he promised beforehand ( E ) through his prophets in the holy Scriptures ,
ESV	Romans	1	3	concerning his Son , ( F ) who was descended from David [ b ] ( G ) according to the flesh
ESV	Romans	1	4	and ( H ) was declared to be the Son of God ( I ) in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord ,
ESV	Romans	1	5	through whom ( J ) we have received grace and ( K ) apostleship ( L ) to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name ( M ) among all the nations ,
ESV	Romans	1	6	including you who are ( N ) called to belong to Jesus Christ ,
ESV	Romans	1	7	To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints : ( O ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Longing to Go to Rome
ESV	Romans	1	8	First , ( P ) I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , ( Q ) because your faith is proclaimed in all the world .
ESV	Romans	1	9	( R ) For God is my witness , ( S ) whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son , ( T ) that without ceasing I mention you
ESV	Romans	1	10	always in my prayers , asking that somehow ( U ) by God 's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you .
ESV	Romans	1	11	For ( V ) I long to see you , that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you—
ESV	Romans	1	12	that is , that we may be mutually encouraged ( W ) by each other 's faith , both yours and mine .
ESV	Romans	1	13	I do not want you to be unaware , brothers , [ c ] that ( X ) I have often intended to come to you ( but ( Y ) thus far have been prevented ) , in order that I may reap some ( Z ) harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles .
ESV	Romans	1	14	( AA ) I am under obligation both to Greeks and to ( AB ) barbarians , [ d ] both to the wise and to the foolish .
ESV	Romans	1	15	So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome . The Righteous Shall Live by Faith
ESV	Romans	1	16	For ( AC ) I am not ashamed of the gospel , for it is ( AD ) the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes , to the Jew ( AE ) first and also to ( AF ) the Greek .
ESV	Romans	1	17	For in it ( AG ) the righteousness of God is revealed ( AH ) from faith for faith , [ e ] ( AI ) as it is written , “ The righteous shall live by faith. ” [ f ] God 's Wrath on Unrighteousness
ESV	Romans	1	18	For ( AJ ) the wrath of God ( AK ) is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth .
ESV	Romans	1	19	For what can be ( AL ) known about God is plain to them , because God has shown it to them .
ESV	Romans	1	20	For his invisible attributes , namely , his eternal power and divine nature , ( AM ) have been clearly perceived , ever since the creation of the world , [ g ] in the things that have been made . So they are without excuse .
ESV	Romans	1	21	For although they knew God , they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him , but they ( AN ) became futile in their thinking , and their foolish hearts were darkened .
ESV	Romans	1	22	( AO ) Claiming to be wise , they became fools ,
ESV	Romans	1	23	and ( AP ) exchanged the glory of ( AQ ) the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things .
ESV	Romans	1	24	Therefore ( AR ) God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity , to ( AS ) the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves ,
ESV	Romans	1	25	because they exchanged the truth about God for ( AT ) a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , ( AU ) who is blessed forever ! Amen .
ESV	Romans	1	26	For this reason ( AV ) God gave them up to ( AW ) dishonorable passions . For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature ;
ESV	Romans	1	27	and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another , ( AX ) men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error .
ESV	Romans	1	28	And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God , ( AY ) God gave them up to ( AZ ) a debased mind to do ( BA ) what ought not to be done .
ESV	Romans	1	29	They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness , evil , covetousness , malice . They are full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , maliciousness . They are gossips ,
ESV	Romans	1	30	slanderers , haters of God , insolent , haughty , boastful , inventors of evil , disobedient to parents ,
ESV	Romans	1	31	foolish , faithless , heartless , ruthless .

ESV	Romans	2	2	We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things .
ESV	Romans	2	3	Do you suppose , O man—you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God ?
ESV	Romans	2	4	Or do you presume on ( C ) the riches of his kindness and ( D ) forbearance and ( E ) patience , ( F ) not knowing that God 's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance ?
ESV	Romans	2	5	But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are ( G ) storing up ( H ) wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God 's righteous judgment will be revealed .
ESV	Romans	2	6	( I ) He will render to each one according to his works :
ESV	Romans	2	7	to those who ( J ) by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality , he will give eternal life ;
ESV	Romans	2	8	but for those who are self-seeking [ a ] and ( K ) do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , there will be wrath and fury .
ESV	Romans	2	9	There will be tribulation and distress ( L ) for every human being who does evil , the Jew ( M ) first and also the Greek ,
ESV	Romans	2	10	but glory and honor and ( N ) peace for everyone who does good , ( O ) the Jew first and also the Greek .
ESV	Romans	2	11	For ( P ) God shows no partiality . God 's Judgment and the Law
ESV	Romans	2	12	For all who have sinned ( Q ) without the law will also perish without the law , and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law .
ESV	Romans	2	13	For ( R ) it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God , but the doers of the law who will be justified .
ESV	Romans	2	14	For when Gentiles , who do not have the law , ( S ) by nature do what the law requires , they are a law to themselves , even though they do not have the law .
ESV	Romans	2	15	They show that the work of the law is ( T ) written on their hearts , while their conscience also bears witness , and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them
ESV	Romans	2	16	( U ) on that day when , ( V ) according to my gospel , God judges ( W ) the secrets of men ( X ) by Christ Jesus .
ESV	Romans	2	17	But if you call yourself a Jew and ( Y ) rely on the law and boast in God
ESV	Romans	2	18	and know his will and approve what is excellent , because you are instructed from the law ;
ESV	Romans	2	19	and if you are sure that you yourself are ( Z ) a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
ESV	Romans	2	20	an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of children , having in the law ( AA ) the embodiment of ( AB ) knowledge and truth—
ESV	Romans	2	21	( AC ) you then who teach others , do you not teach yourself ? While you preach against stealing , do you steal ?
ESV	Romans	2	22	You who say that one must not commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you ( AD ) rob temples ?
ESV	Romans	2	23	You who ( AE ) boast in the law ( AF ) dishonor God by breaking the law .
ESV	Romans	2	24	For , ( AG ) as it is written , “ The name of God is blasphemed ( AH ) among the Gentiles because of you. ”
ESV	Romans	2	25	For circumcision indeed is of value ( AI ) if you obey the law , but if you break the law , your circumcision becomes uncircumcision .
ESV	Romans	2	26	So , if ( AJ ) a man who is uncircumcised keeps ( AK ) the precepts of the law , will not his uncircumcision be regarded [ b ] as circumcision ?
ESV	Romans	2	27	Then he who is physically [ c ] uncircumcised but keeps the law ( AL ) will condemn you who have ( AM ) the written code [ d ] and circumcision but break the law .
ESV	Romans	2	28	For ( AN ) no one is a Jew ( AO ) who is merely one outwardly , nor is circumcision outward and physical .
ESV	Romans	2	29	But a Jew is one ( AP ) inwardly , and ( AQ ) circumcision is a matter of the heart , by the Spirit , not by the letter . ( AR ) His praise is not from man but from God .

ESV	Romans	3	3	( C ) What if some were unfaithful ? ( D ) Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God ?
ESV	Romans	3	2	Much in every way . To begin with , ( A ) the Jews were entrusted with ( B ) the oracles of God .
ESV	Romans	3	4	By no means ! ( E ) Let God be true though ( F ) every one were a liar , as it is written ,
ESV	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? That God is unrighteous to inflict ( I ) wrath on us ? ( ( J ) I speak in a human way . )
ESV	Romans	3	6	By no means ! For then how could ( K ) God judge the world ?
ESV	Romans	3	7	But if through my lie God 's truth abounds to his glory , ( L ) why am I still being condemned as a sinner ?
ESV	Romans	3	8	And why not ( M ) do evil that good may come ? —as some people slanderously charge us with saying . Their condemnation is just . No One Is Righteous
ESV	Romans	3	9	What then ? Are we Jews [ a ] any better off ? [ b ] No , not at all . For we have already charged that all , both ( N ) Jews and ( O ) Greeks , are ( P ) under sin ,
ESV	Romans	3	10	as it is written : ( Q ) “ None is righteous , no , not one ;
ESV	Romans	3	11	no one understands ; no one seeks for God .
ESV	Romans	3	12	All have turned aside ; together they have become worthless ; no one does good , not even one. ”
ESV	Romans	3	13	( R ) “ Their throat is ( S ) an open grave ; they use their tongues to deceive. ” ( T ) “ The venom of asps is under their lips. ”
ESV	Romans	3	14	( U ) “ Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness. ”
ESV	Romans	3	15	( V ) “ Their feet are swift to shed blood ;
ESV	Romans	3	16	in their paths are ruin and misery ,
ESV	Romans	3	17	and ( W ) the way of peace they have not known. ”
ESV	Romans	3	18	( X ) “ There is no fear of God before their eyes. ”
ESV	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever ( Y ) the law says it speaks to those who are under the law , ( Z ) so that every mouth may be stopped , and ( AA ) the whole world may be held accountable to God .
ESV	Romans	3	20	For ( AB ) by works of the law no human being [ c ] will be justified in his sight , since ( AC ) through the law comes knowledge of sin . The Righteousness of God Through Faith
ESV	Romans	3	21	But now ( AD ) the righteousness of God ( AE ) has been manifested apart from the law , although ( AF ) the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—
ESV	Romans	3	22	the righteousness of God ( AG ) through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe . ( AH ) For there is no distinction :
ESV	Romans	3	23	for ( AI ) all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
ESV	Romans	3	24	( AJ ) and are justified ( AK ) by his grace as a gift , ( AL ) through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus ,
ESV	Romans	3	25	whom God ( AM ) put forward as ( AN ) a propitiation ( AO ) by his blood , to be received by faith . This was to show God 's righteousness , because in ( AP ) his divine forbearance he had passed over ( AQ ) former sins .
ESV	Romans	3	26	It was to show his righteousness at the present time , so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus .
ESV	Romans	3	27	( AR ) Then what becomes of our boasting ? It is excluded . By what kind of law ? By a law of works ? No , but by the law of faith .
ESV	Romans	3	28	For we hold that one is justified by faith ( AS ) apart from works of the law .
ESV	Romans	3	29	Or ( AT ) is God the God of Jews only ? Is he not the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , of Gentiles also ,
ESV	Romans	3	30	since ( AU ) God is one—who will justify the circumcised by faith and ( AV ) the uncircumcised through faith .
ESV	Romans	3	31	Do we then overthrow the law by this faith ? By no means ! On the contrary , we uphold the law . Footnotes - Romans 3:9 Greek Are we - Romans 3:9 Or at any disadvantage ? - Romans 3:20 Greek flesh The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Romans	4	4	Now ( D ) to the one who works , his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due .
ESV	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about , but ( B ) not before God .
ESV	Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say ? ( C ) “ Abraham believed God , and it was counted to him as righteousness. ”
ESV	Romans	4	5	And to the one who does not work but ( E ) believes in [ a ] him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is counted as righteousness ,
ESV	Romans	4	6	just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works :
ESV	Romans	4	7	( F ) “ Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven , and whose sins are covered ;
ESV	Romans	4	8	blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not ( G ) count his sin. ”
ESV	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing then only for ( H ) the circumcised , or also for the uncircumcised ? ( I ) For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness .
ESV	Romans	4	10	How then was it counted to him ? Was it before or after he had been circumcised ? It was not after , but before he was circumcised .
ESV	Romans	4	11	( J ) He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised . The purpose was ( K ) to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised , so that righteousness would be counted to them as well ,
ESV	Romans	4	12	and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised . The Promise Realized Through Faith
ESV	Romans	4	13	For ( L ) the promise to Abraham and his offspring ( M ) that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith .
ESV	Romans	4	14	( N ) For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs , faith is null and the promise is void .
ESV	Romans	4	15	For ( O ) the law brings wrath , but ( P ) where there is no law ( Q ) there is no transgression .
ESV	Romans	4	16	That is why it depends on faith , ( R ) in order that the promise may rest on grace and ( S ) be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham , ( T ) who is the father of us all ,
ESV	Romans	4	17	as it is written , ( U ) “ I have made you the father of many nations ” —in the presence of the God in whom he believed , ( V ) who gives life to the dead and calls into existence ( W ) the things that do not exist .
ESV	Romans	4	18	In hope he believed against hope , that he should become the father of many nations , as he had been told , ( X ) “ So shall your offspring be. ”
ESV	Romans	4	19	He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body , which was ( Y ) as good as dead ( ( Z ) since he was about a hundred years old ) , or when he considered ( AA ) the barrenness [ b ] of Sarah 's womb .
ESV	Romans	4	20	No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God , but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God ,
ESV	Romans	4	21	fully convinced that ( AB ) God was able to do what he had promised .
ESV	Romans	4	22	That is why his faith was “ counted to him as righteousness. ”
ESV	Romans	4	23	But ( AC ) the words “ it was counted to him ” were not written for his sake alone ,

ESV	Romans	5	5	and ( H ) hope does not put us to shame , because God 's love ( I ) has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us .
ESV	Romans	5	2	Through him we have also ( C ) obtained access by faith [ b ] into this grace ( D ) in which we stand , and ( E ) we [ c ] rejoice [ d ] in hope of the glory of God .
ESV	Romans	5	3	,
ESV	Romans	5	4	and endurance produces character , and character produces hope ,
ESV	Romans	5	6	For ( J ) while we were still weak , at the right time ( K ) Christ died for the ungodly .
ESV	Romans	5	7	For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—
ESV	Romans	5	8	but ( L ) God shows his love for us in that ( M ) while we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
ESV	Romans	5	9	Since , therefore , ( N ) we have now been justified by his blood , much more shall we be saved by him from ( O ) the wrath of God .
ESV	Romans	5	10	For if ( P ) while we were enemies ( Q ) we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , now that we are reconciled , shall we be saved by ( R ) his life .
ESV	Romans	5	11	- Romans 5:12 The Greek word anthropoi refers here to both men and women ; also twice in verse
ESV	Romans	5	12	Therefore , just as ( T ) sin came into the world through one man , and ( U ) death through sin , and ( V ) so death spread to all men [ e ] because ( W ) all sinned—
ESV	Romans	5	13	for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given , but ( X ) sin is not counted where there is no law .
ESV	Romans	5	14	Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over those whose sinning was not ( Y ) like the transgression of Adam , ( Z ) who was a type of ( AA ) the one who was to come .
ESV	Romans	5	15	But the free gift is not like the trespass . For if many died through one man 's trespass , much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for ( AB ) many .
ESV	Romans	5	16	And the free gift is not like the result of that one man 's sin . For ( AC ) the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation , but the free gift following many trespasses brought ( AD ) justification .
ESV	Romans	5	17	For if , because of one man 's trespass , death reigned through that one man , much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness ( AE ) reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ .

ESV	Romans	6	6	We know that ( K ) our old self [ a ] ( L ) was crucified with him in order that ( M ) the body of sin might be brought to nothing , so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin .
ESV	Romans	6	2	By no means ! How can ( B ) we who died to sin still live in it ?
ESV	Romans	6	3	Do you not know that all of us ( C ) who have been baptized ( D ) into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
ESV	Romans	6	4	We were ( E ) buried therefore with him by baptism into death , in order that , just as ( F ) Christ was raised from the dead by ( G ) the glory of the Father , we too might walk in ( H ) newness of life .
ESV	Romans	6	5	For ( I ) if we have been united with him in ( J ) a death like his , we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his .
ESV	Romans	6	7	For ( N ) one who has died ( O ) has been set free [ b ] from sin .
ESV	Romans	6	8	Now ( P ) if we have died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him .
ESV	Romans	6	9	We know that ( Q ) Christ , being raised from the dead , will never die again ; ( R ) death no longer has dominion over him .
ESV	Romans	6	10	For the death he died he died to sin , ( S ) once for all , but the life he lives he lives to God .
ESV	Romans	6	11	So you also must consider yourselves ( T ) dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus .
ESV	Romans	6	12	Let not ( U ) sin therefore reign in your mortal body , to make you obey its passions .
ESV	Romans	6	13	( V ) Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness , but ( W ) present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life , and your members to God as instruments for righteousness .

ESV	Romans	7	4	- Romans 7:2 Greek law concerning the husband - Romans 7:6 Greek of the letter The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	Romans	7	5	For while we were living in the flesh , our sinful passions , aroused by the law , were at work ( G ) in our members ( H ) to bear fruit for death .
ESV	Romans	7	6	But now we are released from the law , having died to that which held us captive , so that we serve in the ( I ) new way of ( J ) the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code . [ c ] The Law and Sin
ESV	Romans	7	8	But sin , ( M ) seizing an opportunity through the commandment , produced in me all kinds of covetousness . ( N ) For apart from the law , sin lies dead .
ESV	Romans	7	9	I was once alive apart from the law , but when the commandment came , sin came alive and I died .
ESV	Romans	7	10	The very commandment ( O ) that promised life proved to be death to me .
ESV	Romans	7	11	For sin , ( P ) seizing an opportunity through the commandment , ( Q ) deceived me and through it killed me .
ESV	Romans	7	12	So ( R ) the law is holy , and the commandment is holy and righteous and good .
ESV	Romans	7	13	Did that which is good , then , bring death to me ? By no means ! It was sin , producing death in me through what is good , in order that sin might be shown to be sin , and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure .
ESV	Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual , but I am of the flesh , ( S ) sold under sin .
ESV	Romans	7	15	For I do not understand my own actions . For ( T ) I do not do what I want , but I do the very thing I hate .
ESV	Romans	7	16	Now if I do what I do not want , I agree with ( U ) the law , that it is good .
ESV	Romans	7	17	So now ( V ) it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells within me .
ESV	Romans	7	18	For I know that nothing good dwells ( W ) in me , that is , in my flesh . For I have the desire to do what is right , but not the ability to carry it out .
ESV	Romans	7	19	( X ) For I do not do the good I want , but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing .
ESV	Romans	7	20	Now if I do what I do not want , ( Y ) it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells within me .
ESV	Romans	7	21	So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right , evil lies close at hand .
ESV	Romans	7	22	For ( Z ) I delight in the law of God , ( AA ) in my inner being ,
ESV	Romans	7	23	but I see in my members ( AB ) another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members .
ESV	Romans	7	24	Wretched man that I am ! Who will deliver me from ( AC ) this body of death ?
ESV	Romans	7	25	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , I myself serve the law of God with my mind , but with my flesh I serve the law of sin . Footnotes - Romans 7:1 Or brothers and sisters ; also verse

ESV	Romans	8	8	Those who are in the flesh can not please God .
ESV	Romans	8	2	For the law of ( A ) the Spirit of life ( B ) has set you [ b ] free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death .
ESV	Romans	8	3	For ( C ) God has done what the law , ( D ) weakened by the flesh , ( E ) could not do . ( F ) By sending his own Son ( G ) in the likeness of sinful flesh and ( H ) for sin , [ c ] he condemned sin in the flesh ,
ESV	Romans	8	4	in order that ( I ) the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us , ( J ) who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
ESV	Romans	8	5	For ( K ) those who live according to the flesh set their minds on ( L ) the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on ( M ) the things of the Spirit .
ESV	Romans	8	6	For to set ( N ) the mind on the flesh is death , but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace .
ESV	Romans	8	7	For the mind that is set on the flesh is ( O ) hostile to God , for it does not submit to God 's law ; ( P ) indeed , it can not .
ESV	Romans	8	9	You , however , are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if in fact ( Q ) the Spirit of God dwells in you . ( R ) Anyone who does not have ( S ) the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him .
ESV	Romans	8	10	But if Christ is in you , although the body is dead because of sin , the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
ESV	Romans	8	11	If the Spirit of ( T ) him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised Christ Jesus [ d ] from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies ( U ) through his Spirit who dwells in you . Heirs with Christ
ESV	Romans	8	12	So then , brothers , [ e ] we are debtors , ( V ) not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh .
ESV	Romans	8	13	For if you live according to the flesh you will die , but if by the Spirit you ( W ) put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
ESV	Romans	8	14	For all who are ( X ) led by the Spirit of God are ( Y ) sons [ f ] of God .
ESV	Romans	8	15	For ( Z ) you did not receive ( AA ) the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear , but you have received the Spirit of ( AB ) adoption as sons , by whom we cry , ( AC ) “ Abba ! Father ! ”
ESV	Romans	8	16	( AD ) The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God ,
ESV	Romans	8	17	and if children , then ( AE ) heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ , ( AF ) provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him . Future Glory
ESV	Romans	8	18	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time ( AG ) are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us .
ESV	Romans	8	19	For the creation waits with eager longing for ( AH ) the revealing of the sons of God .
ESV	Romans	8	20	For the creation ( AI ) was subjected to futility , not willingly , but ( AJ ) because of him who subjected it , in hope
ESV	Romans	8	21	that ( AK ) the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God .
ESV	Romans	8	22	For we know that ( AL ) the whole creation ( AM ) has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now .
ESV	Romans	8	23	And not only the creation , but we ourselves , who have ( AN ) the firstfruits of the Spirit , ( AO ) groan inwardly as ( AP ) we wait eagerly for adoption as sons , ( AQ ) the redemption of our bodies .
ESV	Romans	8	24	For ( AR ) in this hope we were saved . Now ( AS ) hope that is seen is not hope . For who hopes for what he sees ?
ESV	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not see , we ( AT ) wait for it with patience .
ESV	Romans	8	26	Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness . For ( AU ) we do not know what to pray for as we ought , but ( AV ) the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words .
ESV	Romans	8	27	And ( AW ) he who searches hearts knows what is ( AX ) the mind of the Spirit , because [ g ] the Spirit ( AY ) intercedes for the saints ( AZ ) according to the will of God .
ESV	Romans	8	28	And we know that for those who love God all things work together ( BA ) for good , [ h ] for ( BB ) those who are called according to his purpose .
ESV	Romans	8	29	- Romans 8:14 See discussion on “ sons ” in the Preface - Romans 8:27 Or that - Romans 8:28 Some manuscripts God works all things together for good , or God works in all things for the good - Romans 8:31 Or who is - Romans 8:34 Or Is it Christ Jesus who died… for us ?

ESV	Romans	8	30	And those whom he predestined he also called , and those whom he called he also ( BG ) justified , and those whom he justified he also ( BH ) glorified . God 's Everlasting Love
ESV	Romans	8	31	What then shall we say to these things ? ( BI ) If God is for us , who can be [ i ] against us ?
ESV	Romans	8	32	( BJ ) He who did not spare his own Son but ( BK ) gave him up for us all , how will he not also with him graciously give us all things ?
ESV	Romans	8	33	Who shall bring any charge against God 's elect ? ( BL ) It is God who justifies .
ESV	Romans	8	34	( BM ) Who is to condemn ? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that , who was raised— ( BN ) who is at the right hand of God , ( BO ) who indeed is interceding for us . [ j ]
ESV	Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ?
ESV	Romans	8	36	As it is written , ( BP ) “ For your sake ( BQ ) we are being killed all the day long ; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. ”
ESV	Romans	8	37	No , in all these things we are more than ( BR ) conquerors through ( BS ) him who loved us .
ESV	Romans	8	38	For I am sure that neither death nor life , nor angels nor rulers , nor things present nor things to come , nor powers ,
ESV	Romans	8	39	nor height nor depth , nor anything else in all creation , will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord .

ESV	Romans	9	9	For this is what the promise said : ( R ) “ About this time next year I will return , and Sarah shall have a son. ”
ESV	Romans	9	2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart .
ESV	Romans	9	3	For ( B ) I could wish that I myself were ( C ) accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers , [ a ] my kinsmen ( D ) according to the flesh .
ESV	Romans	9	4	They are ( E ) Israelites , and to them belong ( F ) the adoption , ( G ) the glory , ( H ) the covenants , ( I ) the giving of the law , ( J ) the worship , and ( K ) the promises .
ESV	Romans	9	5	To them belong ( L ) the patriarchs , and from their race , according to the flesh , is the Christ , ( M ) who is God over all , ( N ) blessed forever . Amen .
ESV	Romans	9	6	But it is not as though the word of God has failed . For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel ,
ESV	Romans	9	7	and not all are children of Abraham ( O ) because they are his offspring , but ( P ) “ Through Isaac shall your offspring be named. ”
ESV	Romans	9	8	This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God , but ( Q ) the children of the promise are counted as offspring .
ESV	Romans	9	10	And not only so , but ( S ) also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man , our forefather Isaac ,
ESV	Romans	9	11	though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God 's purpose of election might continue , not because of works but because of ( T ) him who calls—
ESV	Romans	9	12	she was told , ( U ) “ The older will serve the younger. ”
ESV	Romans	9	13	As it is written , ( V ) “ Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated. ”
ESV	Romans	9	14	What shall we say then ? ( W ) Is there injustice on God 's part ? By no means !
ESV	Romans	9	15	For he says to Moses , ( X ) “ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. ”
ESV	Romans	9	16	So then it depends not on human will or exertion , [ b ] but on God , who has mercy .
ESV	Romans	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , ( Y ) “ For this very purpose I have raised you up , that I might show my power in you , and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth. ”
ESV	Romans	9	18	So then he has mercy on whomever he wills , and he hardens whomever he wills .
ESV	Romans	9	19	You will say to me then , “ Why does he still find fault ? For ( Z ) who can resist his will ? ”
ESV	Romans	9	20	But who are you , O man , ( AA ) to answer back to God ? ( AB ) Will what is molded say to its molder , “ Why have you made me like this ? ”
ESV	Romans	9	21	( AC ) Has the potter no right over the clay , to make out of the same lump ( AD ) one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use ?
ESV	Romans	9	22	What if God , desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power , has endured with much patience ( AE ) vessels of wrath ( AF ) prepared for destruction ,
ESV	Romans	9	23	in order to make known ( AG ) the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy , which he ( AH ) has prepared beforehand for glory—
ESV	Romans	9	24	even us whom he ( AI ) has called , ( AJ ) not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles ?
ESV	Romans	9	25	As indeed he says in Hosea , ( AK ) “ Those who were not my people I will call ‘ my people , ’ and her who was not beloved I will call ‘ beloved. ’ ”
ESV	Romans	9	26	( AL ) “ And in the very place where it was said to them , ‘ You are not my people , ’ there they will be called ( AM ) ‘ sons of the living God. ’ ”
ESV	Romans	9	27	And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel : ( AN ) “ Though the number of the sons of Israel [ c ] be as the sand of the sea , ( AO ) only a remnant of them will be saved ,
ESV	Romans	9	28	for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay. ”
ESV	Romans	9	29	And as Isaiah predicted , ( AP ) ( AQ ) “ If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring , ( AR ) we would have been like Sodom and become like Gomorrah. ” Israel 's Unbelief
ESV	Romans	9	30	What shall we say , then ? ( AS ) That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it , that is , ( AT ) a righteousness that is by faith ;
ESV	Romans	9	31	but that Israel ( AU ) who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness [ d ] ( AV ) did not succeed in reaching that law .
ESV	Romans	9	32	Why ? Because they did not pursue it by faith , but as if it were based on works . They have stumbled over the ( AW ) stumbling stone ,
ESV	Romans	9	33	as it is written , ( AX ) “ Behold , I am laying in Zion ( AY ) a stone of stumbling , and a rock of offense ; ( AZ ) and whoever believes in him will not be ( BA ) put to shame. ” Footnotes - Romans 9:3 Or brothers and sisters - Romans 9:16 Greek not of him who wills or runs - Romans 9:27 Or children of Israel - Romans 9:31 Greek a law of righteousness The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Romans	10	10	For with the heart one believes and is justified , and with the mouth one confesses and is saved .
ESV	Romans	10	2	For I bear them witness that ( A ) they have a zeal for God , ( B ) but not according to knowledge .
ESV	Romans	10	3	For , being ignorant of ( C ) the righteousness of God , and seeking to establish their own , they did not submit to God 's righteousness .
ESV	Romans	10	4	For ( D ) Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes . [ b ] The Message of Salvation to All
ESV	Romans	10	5	For ( E ) Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law , that ( F ) the person who does the commandments shall live by them .
ESV	Romans	10	6	But ( G ) the righteousness based on faith says , ( H ) “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will ascend into heaven ? ’ ” ( that is , to bring Christ down )
ESV	Romans	10	7	“ or ‘ Who will descend into the ( I ) abyss ? ’ ” ( that is , ( J ) to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
ESV	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? ( K ) “ The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” ( that is , the word of faith that we proclaim ) ;
ESV	Romans	10	9	because , if ( L ) you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and ( M ) believe in your heart ( N ) that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
ESV	Romans	10	11	For the Scripture says , ( O ) “ Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame. ”
ESV	Romans	10	12	( P ) For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; ( Q ) for the same Lord is Lord of all , ( R ) bestowing his riches on all who call on him .
ESV	Romans	10	13	For ( S ) “ everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. ”
ESV	Romans	10	14	How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? And how are they to believe in him ( T ) of whom they have never heard ? [ c ] And how are they to hear ( U ) without someone preaching ?
ESV	Romans	10	15	And how are they to preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , ( V ) “ How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news ! ”
ESV	Romans	10	16	But ( W ) they have not all obeyed the gospel . For Isaiah says , ( X ) “ Lord , who has believed what he has heard from us ? ”
ESV	Romans	10	17	So ( Y ) faith comes from hearing , and hearing through the word of Christ .
ESV	Romans	10	18	But I ask , have they not heard ? Indeed they have , for
ESV	Romans	10	19	But I ask , did Israel not understand ? First Moses says , ( AB ) “ I will ( AC ) make you jealous of those who are not a nation ; with a ( AD ) foolish nation I will make you angry. ”
ESV	Romans	10	20	Then Isaiah is so bold as to say , ( AE ) “ I have been found by those who did not seek me ; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me. ”
ESV	Romans	10	21	But of Israel he says , ( AF ) “ All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people. ” Footnotes - Romans 10:1 Or Brothers and sisters - Romans 10:4 Or end of the law , that everyone who believes may be justified - Romans 10:14 Or him whom they have never heard The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Romans	11	11	So I ask , did they stumble in order that they might fall ? By no means ! Rather , through their trespass ( N ) salvation has come to the Gentiles , so as to make Israel jealous .
ESV	Romans	11	2	( C ) God has not rejected his people whom he ( D ) foreknew . Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah , how he appeals to God against Israel ?
ESV	Romans	11	3	( E ) “ Lord , they have killed your prophets , they have demolished your altars , and I alone am left , and they seek my life. ”
ESV	Romans	11	4	But what is God 's reply to him ? ( F ) “ I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. ”
ESV	Romans	11	5	So too at the present time there is ( G ) a remnant , chosen by grace .
ESV	Romans	11	6	( H ) But if it is by grace , it is no longer on the basis of works ; otherwise grace would no longer be grace .
ESV	Romans	11	7	What then ? ( I ) Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking . The elect obtained it , but the rest ( J ) were hardened ,
ESV	Romans	11	8	as it is written , ( K ) “ God gave them a spirit of stupor , ( L ) eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear , down to this very day. ”
ESV	Romans	11	9	And David says , ( M ) “ Let their table become a snare and a trap , a stumbling block and a retribution for them ;
ESV	Romans	11	10	let their eyes be darkened so that they can not see , and bend their backs forever. ” Gentiles Grafted In
ESV	Romans	11	12	Now if their trespass means riches for the world , and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles , how much more will their full inclusion [ b ] mean !
ESV	Romans	11	13	Now I am speaking to you Gentiles . Inasmuch then as ( O ) I am an apostle to the Gentiles , I magnify my ministry
ESV	Romans	11	14	in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous , and ( P ) thus save some of them .
ESV	Romans	11	15	For if their rejection means ( Q ) the reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead ?
ESV	Romans	11	16	( R ) If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy , so is the whole lump , and if the root is holy , so are the branches .
ESV	Romans	11	17	But if ( S ) some of the branches were broken off , and you , ( T ) although a wild olive shoot , were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root [ c ] of the olive tree ,
ESV	Romans	11	18	do not be arrogant toward the branches . If you are , remember it is not you who support the root , but the root that supports you .
ESV	Romans	11	19	Then you will say , “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. ”
ESV	Romans	11	20	That is true . They were broken off because of their unbelief , but you ( U ) stand fast through faith . So ( V ) do not become proud , but ( W ) fear .
ESV	Romans	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches , neither will he spare you .
ESV	Romans	11	22	Note then the kindness and the severity of God : severity toward those who have fallen , but God 's kindness to you , ( X ) provided you continue in his kindness . Otherwise ( Y ) you too will be cut off .
ESV	Romans	11	23	And ( Z ) even they , if they do not continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God has the power to graft them in again .
ESV	Romans	11	24	For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and grafted , contrary to nature , into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these , the natural branches , be grafted back into their own olive tree . The Mystery of Israel 's Salvation
ESV	Romans	11	25	( AA ) Lest you be wise in your own sight , I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery , brothers : [ d ] ( AB ) a partial hardening has come upon Israel , ( AC ) until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in .
ESV	Romans	11	26	And in this way all Israel will be saved , as it is written , ( AD ) “ The Deliverer will come ( AE ) from Zion , he will banish ungodliness from Jacob ” ;
ESV	Romans	11	27	“ and this will be my ( AF ) covenant with them ( AG ) when I take away their sins. ”
ESV	Romans	11	28	As regards the gospel , they are enemies for your sake . But as regards election , they are ( AH ) beloved for the sake of their forefathers .
ESV	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and ( AI ) the calling of God are irrevocable .
ESV	Romans	11	30	For just as ( AJ ) you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience ,
ESV	Romans	11	31	so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now [ e ] receive mercy .
ESV	Romans	11	32	For God ( AK ) has consigned all to disobedience , that he may have mercy on all .
ESV	Romans	11	33	Oh , the depth of the riches and ( AL ) wisdom and knowledge of God ! ( AM ) How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways !
ESV	Romans	11	34	“ For ( AN ) who has known the mind of the Lord , or ( AO ) who has been his counselor ? ”
ESV	Romans	11	35	“ Or ( AP ) who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid ? ”
ESV	Romans	11	36	For ( AQ ) from him and through him and to him are all things . ( AR ) To him be glory forever . Amen .

ESV	Romans	13	4	for ( D ) he is God 's servant for your good . But if you do wrong , be afraid , for he does not bear the sword in vain . For he is the servant of God , ( E ) an avenger who carries out God 's wrath on the wrongdoer .
ESV	Romans	13	5	Therefore one must be in subjection , not only to avoid God 's wrath but also ( F ) for the sake of conscience .
ESV	Romans	13	6	For because of this you also pay taxes , for the authorities are ministers of God , attending to this very thing .
ESV	Romans	13	7	( G ) Pay to all what is owed to them : taxes to whom taxes are owed , revenue to whom revenue is owed , respect to whom respect is owed , honor to whom honor is owed . Fulfilling the Law Through Love
ESV	Romans	13	8	( H ) Owe no one anything , except to love each other , for ( I ) the one who loves another has fulfilled the law .
ESV	Romans	13	9	For the commandments , ( J ) “ You shall not commit adultery , You shall not murder , You shall not steal , You shall not covet , ” and any other commandment , are summed up in this word : ( K ) “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”
ESV	Romans	13	10	Love does no wrong to a neighbor ; therefore ( L ) love is the fulfilling of the law .
ESV	Romans	13	11	Besides this you know the time , that the hour has come for you ( M ) to wake from sleep . ( N ) For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed .
ESV	Romans	13	12	( O ) The night is far gone ; the day is at hand . So then let us ( P ) cast off ( Q ) the works of darkness and ( R ) put on the armor of light .
ESV	Romans	13	14	But ( V ) put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh , ( W ) to gratify its desires . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Romans	14	14	I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus ( R ) that nothing is unclean in itself , ( S ) but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean .
ESV	Romans	14	2	( B ) One person believes he may eat anything , while the weak person eats only vegetables .
ESV	Romans	14	3	Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains , and ( C ) let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats , for God has welcomed him .
ESV	Romans	14	4	( D ) Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another ? It is before his own master [ a ] that he stands or falls . And he will be upheld , for the Lord is able to make him stand .
ESV	Romans	14	5	( E ) One person esteems one day as better than another , while another esteems all days alike . ( F ) Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind .
ESV	Romans	14	6	The one who observes the day , observes it in honor of the Lord . The one who eats , eats in honor of the Lord , since ( G ) he gives thanks to God , while the one who abstains , abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God .
ESV	Romans	14	7	For ( H ) none of us lives to himself , and none of us dies to himself .
ESV	Romans	14	8	For if we live , we live to the Lord , and if we die , we die to the Lord . So then , ( I ) whether we live or whether we die , we are the Lord 's .
ESV	Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ ( J ) died and lived again , that he might be Lord both ( K ) of the dead and of the living .
ESV	Romans	14	10	Why do you pass judgment on your brother ? Or you , why do you despise your brother ? For ( L ) we will all stand before ( M ) the judgment seat of God ;
ESV	Romans	14	11	for it is written , ( N ) “ As I live , says the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess [ b ] to God. ”
ESV	Romans	14	12	So then ( O ) each of us will give an account of himself to God . Do Not Cause Another to Stumble
ESV	Romans	14	13	( P ) Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer , but rather decide ( Q ) never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother .
ESV	Romans	14	15	For if your brother is grieved by what you eat , ( T ) you are no longer walking in love . ( U ) By what you eat , do not destroy the one for whom Christ died .
ESV	Romans	14	16	( V ) So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil .
ESV	Romans	14	17	( W ) For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but ( X ) of righteousness and ( Y ) peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
ESV	Romans	14	18	Whoever thus serves Christ is ( Z ) acceptable to God and approved by men .
ESV	Romans	14	19	So then let us ( AA ) pursue what makes for peace and for ( AB ) mutual upbuilding .
ESV	Romans	14	20	( AC ) Do not , for the sake of food , destroy the work of God . ( AD ) Everything is indeed clean , but ( AE ) it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats .
ESV	Romans	14	21	( AF ) It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble . [ c ]
ESV	Romans	14	22	The faith that you have , keep between yourself and God . ( AG ) Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves .
ESV	Romans	14	23	But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats , because the eating is not from faith . For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin .

ESV	Romans	15	15	But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder , ( W ) because of the grace given me by God
ESV	Romans	15	2	( C ) Let each of us please his neighbor for his good , to build him up .
ESV	Romans	15	3	For ( D ) Christ did not please himself , but as it is written , ( E ) “ The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me. ”
ESV	Romans	15	4	For ( F ) whatever was written in former days was written for our ( G ) instruction , that through endurance and through ( H ) the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope .
ESV	Romans	15	5	May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you ( I ) to live in such harmony with one another , in accord with Christ Jesus ,
ESV	Romans	15	6	that together you may with one voice glorify ( J ) the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
ESV	Romans	15	7	Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you , for the glory of God . Christ the Hope of Jews and Gentiles
ESV	Romans	15	8	For I tell you that Christ ( K ) became a servant to the circumcised to show God 's truthfulness , in order ( L ) to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs ,
ESV	Romans	15	9	and in order ( M ) that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy . As it is written , ( N ) “ Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles , and sing to your name. ”
ESV	Romans	15	10	And again it is said , ( O ) “ Rejoice , O Gentiles , with his people. ”
ESV	Romans	15	11	And again , ( P ) “ Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles , and let all the peoples extol him. ”
ESV	Romans	15	12	And again Isaiah says , ( Q ) ( R ) “ The root of Jesse will come , even he who arises to rule the Gentiles ; ( S ) in him will the Gentiles hope. ”
ESV	Romans	15	13	May the God of hope fill you with all ( T ) joy and peace in believing , so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope . Paul the Minister to the Gentiles
ESV	Romans	15	14	( U ) I myself am satisfied about you , my brothers , [ a ] that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with ( V ) all knowledge and able to instruct one another .
ESV	Romans	15	16	to be ( X ) a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles ( Y ) in the priestly service of the gospel of God , so that ( Z ) the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
ESV	Romans	15	17	In Christ Jesus , then , I have ( AA ) reason to be proud of ( AB ) my work for God .
ESV	Romans	15	18	For I will not venture to speak of anything except ( AC ) what Christ has accomplished through me ( AD ) to bring the Gentiles to obedience—by word and deed ,
ESV	Romans	15	19	( AE ) by the power of signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God—so that ( AF ) from Jerusalem and all the way around ( AG ) to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ ;
ESV	Romans	15	20	and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel , not where Christ has already been named , ( AH ) lest I build on someone else 's foundation ,
ESV	Romans	15	21	but as it is written , ( AI ) “ Those who have never been told of him will see , and those who have never heard will understand. ” Paul 's Plan to Visit Rome
ESV	Romans	15	22	This is the reason why ( AJ ) I have so often been hindered from coming to you .
ESV	Romans	15	23	But now , since I no longer have any room for work in these regions , and ( AK ) since I have longed for many years to come to you ,
ESV	Romans	15	24	I hope to see you in passing as I go ( AL ) to Spain , and ( AM ) to be helped on my journey there by you , once I have enjoyed your company for a while .
ESV	Romans	15	25	At present , however , ( AN ) I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the saints .
ESV	Romans	15	26	For ( AO ) Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem .
ESV	Romans	15	27	For they were pleased to do it , and indeed ( AP ) they owe it to them . For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings , they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings .
ESV	Romans	15	28	When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected , [ b ] I will leave ( AQ ) for Spain by way of you .
ESV	Romans	15	29	I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing [ c ] of Christ .

ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	1	Corinthians 1:30 Greek And from him The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To the church of God that is in Corinth , to those ( C ) sanctified in Christ Jesus , ( D ) called to be saints together with all those who in every place ( E ) call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , both their Lord and ours :
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	3	( F ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Thanksgiving
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I ( G ) give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	5	that in every way ( H ) you were enriched in him in all ( I ) speech and all knowledge—
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	6	even as ( J ) the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you—
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that you are not lacking in any gift , as you ( K ) wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	8	( L ) who will sustain you to the end , ( M ) guiltless ( N ) in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	9	( O ) God is faithful , by whom you were called into the ( P ) fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . Divisions in the Church
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	10	I appeal to you , brothers , [ a ] by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you agree , and that there be no ( Q ) divisions among you , but that you be united ( R ) in the same mind and the same judgment .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	11	,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	12	What I mean is that ( T ) each one of you says , “ I follow Paul , ” or “ I follow ( U ) Apollos , ” or “ I follow ( V ) Cephas , ” or “ I follow Christ. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	13	( W ) Is Christ divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Or were you ( X ) baptized in the name of Paul ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you except ( Y ) Crispus and ( Z ) Gaius ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	15	so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	16	( I did baptize also ( AA ) the household of Stephanas . Beyond that , I do not know whether I baptized anyone else . )
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel , and ( AB ) not with words of eloquent wisdom , lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power . Christ the Wisdom and Power of God
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross is ( AC ) folly to ( AD ) those who are perishing , but to us ( AE ) who are being saved it is ( AF ) the power of God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written , ( AG ) “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	20	( AH ) Where is the one who is wise ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the debater of this age ? ( AI ) Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For since , in the wisdom of God , the world did not know God through wisdom , it pleased God through the folly of what we preach [ b ] to save those who believe .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For ( AJ ) Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we preach Christ ( AK ) crucified , a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ ( AL ) the power of God and ( AM ) the wisdom of God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	26	-
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But ( AO ) God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise ; ( AP ) God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong ;
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	28	God chose what is low and despised in the world , even ( AQ ) things that are not , to ( AR ) bring to nothing things that are ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	29	so ( AS ) that no human being [ d ] might boast in the presence of God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	30	And because of him [ e ] you are in Christ Jesus , who became to us ( AT ) wisdom from God , ( AU ) righteousness and ( AV ) sanctification and ( AW ) redemption ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	1	31	so that , as it is written , ( AX ) “ Let the one who boasts , boast in the Lord. ” Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I decided to know nothing among you except ( C ) Jesus Christ and him crucified .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	3	And ( D ) I was with you ( E ) in weakness and in fear and much trembling ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	4	and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom , but in demonstration of ( F ) the Spirit and of power ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	5	so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men [ c ] but ( G ) in the power of God . Wisdom from the Spirit
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Yet among ( H ) the mature we do impart wisdom , although it is not ( I ) a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age , ( J ) who are doomed to pass away .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	7	But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God , ( K ) which God decreed before the ages for our glory .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	8	None of ( L ) the rulers of this age understood this , for ( M ) if they had , they would not have crucified ( N ) the Lord of glory .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But , as it is written , ( O ) “ What no eye has seen , nor ear heard , nor the heart of man imagined , what God has ( P ) prepared ( Q ) for those who love him ” —
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	10	these things ( R ) God has revealed to us through the Spirit . For the Spirit searches everything , even ( S ) the depths of God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For who knows a person 's thoughts ( T ) except the spirit of that person , which is in him ? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now ( U ) we have received not ( V ) the spirit of the world , but the Spirit who is from God , that we might understand the things freely given us by God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	13	And we impart this ( W ) in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit , ( X ) interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual . [ d ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	14	The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God , for they are ( Y ) folly to him , and ( Z ) he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	15	The ( AA ) spiritual person judges all things , but is himself to be judged by no one .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	2	16	( AB ) “ For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him ? ” But ( AC ) we have the mind of Christ . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians 3:16 The Greek for you is plural in verses
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	3	for you are still of the flesh . For while there is ( F ) jealousy and strife among you , are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	2	( D ) I fed you with milk , not solid food , for ( E ) you were not ready for it . And even now you are not yet ready ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For ( G ) when one says , “ I follow Paul , ” and another , “ I follow Apollos , ” ( H ) are you not being merely human ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	5	What then is Apollos ? What is Paul ? ( I ) Servants through whom you believed , ( J ) as the Lord assigned to each .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	6	( K ) I planted , ( L ) Apollos watered , ( M ) but God gave the growth .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So ( N ) neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything , but only God who gives the growth .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	8	He who plants and he who waters are one , and each ( O ) will receive his wages according to his labor .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are ( P ) God 's fellow workers . You are God 's field , ( Q ) God 's building .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	10	( R ) According to the grace of God given to me , like a skilled [ b ] master builder I laid a ( S ) foundation , and ( T ) someone else is building upon it . Let each one take care how he builds upon it .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no one can lay a ( U ) foundation other ( V ) than that which is laid , ( W ) which is Jesus Christ .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw—
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	13	( X ) each one 's work will become manifest , for the Day will disclose it , because it will be revealed ( Y ) by fire , and ( Z ) the fire will test what sort of work each one has done .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives , ( AA ) he will receive a reward .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If anyone 's work is burned up , he will suffer loss , though he himself will be saved , ( AB ) but only as through fire .

ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	18	( AE ) Let no one deceive himself . ( AF ) If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age , let him become a fool that he may become wise .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For ( AG ) the wisdom of this world is folly with God . For it is written , ( AH ) “ He catches the wise in their craftiness , ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , ( AI ) “ The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are futile. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So ( AJ ) let no one boast in men . For ( AK ) all things are yours ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours ,

ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	4	( B ) For I am not aware of anything against myself , ( C ) but I am not thereby acquitted . It is the Lord who judges me .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Moreover , it is required of stewards that they be found faithful .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court . In fact , I do not even judge myself .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	5	Therefore ( D ) do not pronounce judgment before the time , ( E ) before the Lord comes , ( F ) who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart . ( G ) Then each one will receive his commendation from God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	6	I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit , brothers , [ a ] that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written , that none of you may ( H ) be puffed up in favor of one against another .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who sees anything different in you ? ( I ) What do you have that you did not receive ? If then you received it , why do you boast as if you did not receive it ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	8	Already you have all you want ! Already you have become rich ! Without us you have become kings ! And would that you did reign , so that we might share the rule with you !
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all , ( J ) like men sentenced to death , because we ( K ) have become a spectacle to the world , to angels , and to men .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	10	( L ) We are fools for Christ 's sake , but ( M ) you are wise in Christ . ( N ) We are weak , but you are strong . You are held in honor , but we in disrepute .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	11	To the present hour ( O ) we hunger and thirst , we are poorly dressed and ( P ) buffeted and ( Q ) homeless ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	12	and we ( R ) labor , working with our own hands . ( S ) When reviled , we bless ; ( T ) when persecuted , we endure ;
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	13	when slandered , we entreat . ( U ) We have become , and are still , like the scum of the world , ( V ) the refuse of all things .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I do not write these things ( W ) to make you ashamed , but to admonish you ( X ) as my beloved children .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For ( Y ) though you have countless [ b ] guides in Christ , you do not have many fathers . For ( Z ) I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	16	I urge you , then , ( AA ) be imitators of me .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	17	That is why ( AB ) I sent [ c ] you Timothy , ( AC ) my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , to remind you of my ways in Christ , [ d ] ( AD ) as I teach them everywhere in every church .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Some are ( AE ) arrogant , ( AF ) as though I were not coming to you .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But ( AG ) I will come to you soon , if the Lord wills , and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For ( AH ) the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	4	21	What do you wish ? ( AI ) Shall I come to you with a rod , or with love in a spirit of gentleness ? Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	5	you are ( G ) to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , so ( H ) that his spirit may be saved ( I ) in the day of the Lord . [ a ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And ( C ) you are arrogant ! Ought you ( D ) not rather to mourn ? Let him who has done this be removed from among you .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	3	For though ( E ) absent in body , I am present in spirit ; and as if present , I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	4	When you are assembled ( F ) in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present , with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	6	( J ) Your boasting is not good . Do you not know that ( K ) a little leaven leavens the whole lump ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump , as you really are unleavened . For Christ , our Passover lamb , has been sacrificed .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	8	Let us therefore celebrate the festival , ( L ) not with the old leaven , ( M ) the leaven of malice and evil , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in my letter ( N ) not to associate with sexually immoral people—
ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	10	( O ) not at all meaning ( P ) the sexually immoral of this world , or the greedy and swindlers , or idolaters , ( Q ) since then you would need to go out of the world .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone ( R ) who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed , or is an idolater , reviler , drunkard , or swindler—not even to eat with such a one .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do with judging ( S ) outsiders ? ( T ) Is it not those inside the church [ b ] whom you are to judge ?

ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	6	but brother goes to law against brother , and that before unbelievers ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Or do you not know that ( B ) the saints will judge the world ? And if the world is to be judged by you , are you incompetent to try trivial cases ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Do you not know that we are to judge angels ? How much more , then , matters pertaining to this life !
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	4	So if you have such cases , ( C ) why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	5	( D ) I say this to your shame . Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	7	To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you . ( E ) Why not rather suffer wrong ? Why not rather be defrauded ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	8	But you yourselves wrong and defraud—even ( F ) your own brothers ! [ a ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Or do you not know that the unrighteous [ b ] will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived : ( G ) neither the sexually immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor men who practice homosexuality , [ c ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves , nor the greedy , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And ( H ) such were some of you . But ( I ) you were washed , ( J ) you were sanctified , ( K ) you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God . Flee Sexual Immorality
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	12	( L ) “ All things are lawful for me , ” but not all things are helpful . “ All things are lawful for me , ” but I will not be dominated by anything .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	13	( M ) “ Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food ” —and God will destroy both one ( N ) and the other . The body is not meant for sexual immorality , but ( O ) for the Lord , and ( P ) the Lord for the body .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	14	And ( Q ) God raised the Lord and ( R ) will also raise us up ( S ) by his power .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Do you not know that ( T ) your bodies are members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute ? Never !
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	16	Or do you not know that he who is joined [ d ] to a prostitute becomes one body with her ? For , as it is written , ( U ) “ The two will become one flesh. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	17	-
ESV	1%20Corinthians	6	18	( W ) Flee from sexual immorality . Every other sin [ e ] a person commits is outside the body , but the sexually immoral person ( X ) sins against his own body .

ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	7	( F ) I wish that all were ( G ) as I myself am . But ( H ) each has his own gift from God , ( I ) one of one kind and one of another .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But because of the temptation to sexual immorality , each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	3	( B ) The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights , and likewise the wife to her husband .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	4	For the wife does not have authority over her own body , but the husband does . Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	5	( C ) Do not deprive one another , except perhaps by agreement for a limited time , that you may devote yourselves to prayer ; but then come together again , ( D ) so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	6	Now as a concession , ( E ) not a command , I say this . [ a ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	8	To the unmarried and the widows I say that ( J ) it is good for them to remain single , ( K ) as I am .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they can not exercise self-control , ( L ) they should marry . For it is better to marry than to burn with passion .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	10	To the married ( M ) I give this charge ( not I , but the Lord ) : ( N ) the wife should not separate from her husband
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	11	( but if she does , ( O ) she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and ( P ) the husband should not divorce his wife .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	12	To the rest I say ( I , not the Lord ) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever , and she consents to live with him , he should not divorce her .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	13	If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever , and he consents to live with her , she should not divorce him .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife , and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband . ( Q ) Otherwise your children would be unclean , but as it is , they are holy .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbelieving partner separates , let it be so . In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved . God has called you [ b ] ( R ) to peace .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know , wife , ( S ) whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ? Live as You Are Called
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Only let each person lead the life [ c ] ( T ) that the Lord has assigned to him , and to which God has called him . ( U ) This is my rule in ( V ) all the churches .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised ? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision . Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised ? ( W ) Let him not seek circumcision .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	19	( X ) For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision , but ( Y ) keeping the commandments of God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	20	( Z ) Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you a bondservant [ d ] when called ? Do not be concerned about it . ( But if you can gain your freedom , avail yourself of the opportunity . )

ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	24	So , brothers , [ e ] ( AE ) in whatever condition each was called , there let him remain with God . The Unmarried and the Widowed
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning [ f ] the betrothed , [ g ] ( AF ) I have no command from the Lord , but I give my judgment as ( AG ) one who by the Lord 's mercy is ( AH ) trustworthy .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I think that in view of the present [ h ] distress ( AI ) it is good for a person to remain as he is .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be free . Are you free from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you do marry , you have not sinned , and if a betrothed woman [ i ] marries , she has not sinned . Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles , and I would spare you that .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	29	-
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and those who mourn as though they were not mourning , and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing , and those who buy ( AK ) as though they had no goods ,

ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	32	I want you to be ( AM ) free from anxieties . ( AN ) The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord , how to please the Lord .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But the married man is anxious about worldly things , how to please his wife ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	34	-
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I say this for your own benefit , ( AO ) not to lay any restraint upon you , but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	36	If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed , [ j ] if his [ k ] passions are strong , and it has to be , let him do as he wishes : let them marry—it is no sin .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	37	,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	38	-
ESV	1%20Corinthians	7	39	( AQ ) A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to be married to whom she wishes , only ( AR ) in the Lord .

ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	8	( Q ) Food will not commend us to God . We are no worse off if we do not eat , and no better off if we do .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	2	( E ) If anyone imagines that he knows something , ( F ) he does not yet know as he ought to know .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if anyone loves God , ( G ) he is known by God . [ b ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	4	Therefore , as to the eating of food offered to idols , we know that ( H ) “ an idol has no real existence , ” and that ( I ) “ there is no God but one. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For although there may be ( J ) so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “ gods ” and many “ lords ” —
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	6	yet ( K ) for us there is one God , the Father , ( L ) from whom are all things and for whom we exist , and ( M ) one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things and ( N ) through whom we exist .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	7	However , not all possess this knowledge . But some , ( O ) through former association with idols , eat food as really offered to an idol , and ( P ) their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But take care ( R ) that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block ( S ) to the weak .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating [ c ] in an idol 's temple , will he not be encouraged , [ d ] if his conscience is weak , to eat food offered to idols ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	11	And so by your knowledge this weak person is ( T ) destroyed , the brother for whom Christ died .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	12	Thus , sinning against your brothers [ e ] and ( U ) wounding their conscience when it is weak , ( V ) you sin against Christ .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Therefore , ( W ) if food makes my brother stumble , I will never eat meat , lest I make my brother stumble . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians 9:27 Greek I pummel my body and make it a slave The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the Law of Moses , ( L ) “ You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain. ” Is it for oxen that God is concerned ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If to others I am not an apostle , at least I am to you , for you are ( E ) the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	3	This is my defense to those who would examine me .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	4	( F ) Do we not have the right to eat and drink ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	5	( G ) Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife , [ a ] as do the other apostles and ( H ) the brothers of the Lord and ( I ) Cephas ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	7	( J ) Who serves as a soldier at his own expense ? ( K ) Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit ? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	8	Do I say these things on human authority ? Does not the Law say the same ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Does he not certainly speak for our sake ? It was written ( M ) for our sake , because ( N ) the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	11	( O ) If we have sown spiritual things among you , is it too much if we reap material things from you ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others share this rightful claim on you , do not we even more ? Nevertheless , ( P ) we have not made use of this right , but we endure anything ( Q ) rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Do you not know that ( R ) those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple , and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	14	In the same way , the Lord commanded that ( S ) those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But ( T ) I have made no use of any of these rights , nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision . For I would rather die than have anyone ( U ) deprive me of my ground for boasting .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the gospel , that gives me no ground for boasting . For ( V ) necessity is laid upon me . Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel !
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this of my own will , I have a reward , but if not of my own will , I am still entrusted with ( W ) a stewardship .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What then is my reward ? That in my preaching ( X ) I may present the gospel free of charge , so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For ( Y ) though I am free from all , ( Z ) I have made myself a servant to all , that I might ( AA ) win more of them .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	20	( AB ) To the Jews I became as a Jew , in order to win Jews . To those under the law I became as one under the law ( though not being myself under the law ) that I might win those under the law .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To ( AC ) those outside the law I became ( AD ) as one outside the law ( not being outside the law of God but ( AE ) under the law of Christ ) that I might win those outside the law .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	22	( AF ) To the weak I became weak , that I might win the weak . ( AG ) I have become all things to all people , that ( AH ) by all means I might save some .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do it all for the sake of the gospel , ( AI ) that I may share with them in its blessings .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Do you not know that in a race all the runners run , but only one receives ( AJ ) the prize ? So ( AK ) run that you may obtain it .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	25	Every ( AL ) athlete exercises self-control in all things . They do it to receive a perishable wreath , but we ( AM ) an imperishable .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	26	So I do not run aimlessly ; I ( AN ) do not box as one ( AO ) beating the air .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	9	27	But I discipline my body and ( AP ) keep it under control , [ b ] lest after preaching to others ( AQ ) I myself should be ( AR ) disqualified . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	2	and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	3	and ( C ) all ate the same ( D ) spiritual food ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and ( E ) all drank the same spiritual drink . For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them , and the Rock was Christ .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	5	Nevertheless , with most of them God was not pleased , for ( F ) they were overthrown [ b ] in the wilderness .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things took place as examples for us , that we might not desire evil as ( G ) they did .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	7	( H ) Do not be idolaters ( I ) as some of them were ; as it is written , ( J ) “ The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	8	( K ) We must not indulge in sexual immorality ( L ) as some of them did , and ( M ) twenty-three thousand fell in a single day .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	9	We must not put Christ [ c ] to the test , ( N ) as some of them did and ( O ) were destroyed by serpents ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now these things happened to them as an example , but ( S ) they were written down for our instruction , ( T ) on whom the end of the ages has come .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Therefore ( U ) let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man . ( V ) God is faithful , and ( W ) he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability , but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape , that you may be able to endure it .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Therefore , my beloved , ( X ) flee from idolatry .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak ( Y ) as to sensible people ; judge for yourselves what I say .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	16	( Z ) The cup of blessing that we bless , is it not a participation in the blood of Christ ? ( AA ) The bread that we break , is it not a participation in the body of Christ ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	17	Because there is one bread , we who are many are ( AB ) one body , for we all partake of the one bread .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Consider ( AC ) the people of Israel : [ d ] ( AD ) are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What do I imply then ? That food offered to idols is anything , or that ( AE ) an idol is anything ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	20	No , I imply that what pagans sacrifice ( AF ) they offer to demons and not to God . I do not want you to be participants with demons .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	21	( AG ) You can not drink the cup of the Lord and ( AH ) the cup of demons . You can not partake of the table of the Lord and ( AI ) the table of demons .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	22	( AJ ) Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? ( AK ) Are we stronger than he ? Do All to the Glory of God
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	23	( AL ) “ All things are lawful , ” but not all things are helpful . “ All things are lawful , ” but not all things build up .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	24	( AM ) Let no one seek his own good , but the good of his neighbor .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	25	( AN ) Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	26	For ( AO ) “ the earth is the Lord 's , and the fullness thereof. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go , ( AP ) eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if someone says to you , “ This has been offered in sacrifice , ” then do not eat it , for the sake of the one who informed you , and for the sake of conscience—
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	29	I do not mean ( AQ ) your conscience , but his . For ( AR ) why should my liberty be determined by someone else 's conscience ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	30	If I partake with thankfulness , why am I denounced because of that ( AS ) for which I give thanks ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	31	So , whether you eat or drink , or ( AT ) whatever you do , do all to the glory of God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	10	32	( AU ) Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to ( AV ) the church of God ,

ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	5	but every wife [ c ] who prays or ( H ) prophesies ( I ) with her head uncovered dishonors her head , since it is the same ( J ) as if her head were shaven .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if a wife will not cover her head , then she should cut her hair short . But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head , let her cover her head .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For a man ought not to cover his head , since ( K ) he is the image and glory of God , but ( L ) woman is the glory of man .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For ( M ) man was not made from woman , but woman from man .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	9	Neither was man created for woman , but ( N ) woman for man .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	10	That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels . [ d ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	12	for as woman was made from man , so man is now born of woman . And ( P ) all things are from God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Judge for yourselves : is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	15	but if a woman has long hair , it is her glory ? For her hair is given to her for a covering .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	16	( Q ) If anyone is inclined to be contentious , we have no such practice , nor do ( R ) the churches of God . The Lord 's Supper
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	17	But in the following instructions I do not commend you , because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For , in the first place , when you come together as a church , ( S ) I hear that there are divisions among you . And I believe it in part , [ e ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	19	for ( T ) there must be factions among you in order ( U ) that those who are genuine among you may be recognized .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	20	) -
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	21	For in eating , each one goes ahead with his own meal . One goes hungry , ( V ) another gets drunk .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	22	What ! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in ? Or do you despise ( W ) the church of God and ( X ) humiliate those who have nothing ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I commend you in this ? No , I will not .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For ( Y ) I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you , that ( Z ) the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and said , “ This is my body , which is for [ f ] you . Do this in remembrance of me. ” [ g ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	25	-
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim the Lord 's death ( AA ) until he comes .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	27	( AB ) Whoever , therefore , eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord ( AC ) in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning ( AD ) the body and blood of the Lord .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	28	( AE ) Let a person examine himself , then , and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	30	That is why many of you are weak and ill , and some ( AF ) have died . [ h ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	31	( AG ) But if we judged [ i ] ourselves truly , we would not be judged .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged by the Lord , ( AH ) we are disciplined [ j ] so that we may not be ( AI ) condemned along with the world .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So then , my brothers , [ k ] when you come together to eat , wait for [ l ] one another—
ESV	1%20Corinthians	11	34	( AJ ) if anyone is hungry , ( AK ) let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment . About the other things ( AL ) I will give directions ( AM ) when I come . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians 12:20 Or members ; also verse
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For just as ( Y ) the body is one and has many members , and all the members of the body , though many , are one body , ( Z ) so it is with Christ .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You know that ( B ) when you were pagans ( C ) you were led astray to ( D ) mute idols , however you were led .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I want you to understand that ( E ) no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “ Jesus is ( F ) accursed ! ” and ( G ) no one can say “ Jesus is Lord ” except in the Holy Spirit .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now ( H ) there are varieties of gifts , but ( I ) the same Spirit ;
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	5	and ( J ) there are varieties of service , but ( K ) the same Lord ;
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	6	and there are varieties of activities , but it is ( L ) the same God who empowers them all in everyone .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	7	( M ) To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of ( N ) wisdom , and to another the utterance of ( O ) knowledge according to the same Spirit ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	9	to another ( P ) faith by the same Spirit , to another ( Q ) gifts of healing by the one Spirit ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	10	to another ( R ) the working of miracles , to another ( S ) prophecy , to another ( T ) the ability to distinguish between spirits , to another ( U ) various kinds of tongues , to another ( V ) the interpretation of tongues .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	11	All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit , ( W ) who apportions to each one individually ( X ) as he wills . One Body with Many Members
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For ( AA ) in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body— ( AB ) Jews or Greeks , slaves [ d ] or free—and ( AC ) all were made to drink of one Spirit .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For the body does not consist of one member but of many .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot should say , “ Because I am not a hand , I do not belong to the body , ” that would not make it any less a part of the body .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear should say , “ Because I am not an eye , I do not belong to the body , ” that would not make it any less a part of the body .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where would be the sense of hearing ? If the whole body were an ear , where would be the sense of smell ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But as it is , ( AD ) God arranged the members in the body , each one of them , ( AE ) as he chose .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	19	If all were a single member , where would the body be ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	20	As it is , there are many parts , [ e ] yet one body .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	21	The eye can not say to the hand , “ I have no need of you , ” nor again the head to the feet , “ I have no need of you. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	22	The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	23	and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor , and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	24	which our more presentable parts do not require . But God has so composed the body , giving greater honor to the part that lacked it ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	25	that there may be no division in the body , but that the members may have the same care for one another .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	26	If one member suffers , all suffer together ; if one member is honored , ( AF ) all rejoice together .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now ( AG ) you are the body of Christ and individually ( AH ) members of it .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And ( AI ) God has appointed in the church first ( AJ ) apostles , second ( AK ) prophets , third teachers , then ( AL ) miracles , then ( AM ) gifts of healing , ( AN ) helping , ( AO ) administrating , and ( AP ) various kinds of tongues .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Do all work miracles ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Do all possess gifts of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?

ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians 13:5 Greek irritable and does not count up wrongdoing The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	13	So now faith , hope , and love abide , these three ; but the greatest of these is love . Footnotes -
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And if I have ( A ) prophetic powers , and understand all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have all faith , ( B ) so as to remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	3	( C ) If I give away all I have , and ( D ) if I deliver up my body to be burned , [ a ] but have not love , I gain nothing .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	4	( E ) Love is patient and ( F ) kind ; love ( G ) does not envy or boast ; it ( H ) is not arrogant
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	5	or rude . It ( I ) does not insist on its own way ; it ( J ) is not irritable or resentful ; [ b ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	6	it ( K ) does not rejoice at wrongdoing , but ( L ) rejoices with the truth .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	7	( M ) Love bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , ( N ) endures all things .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never ends . As for prophecies , they will pass away ; as for tongues , they will cease ; as for knowledge , it will pass away .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For ( O ) we know in part and we prophesy in part ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	10	but ( P ) when the perfect comes , the partial will pass away .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I spoke like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . When I became a man , I gave up childish ways .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For ( Q ) now we see in a mirror dimly , but ( R ) then face to face . Now I know in part ; then I shall know fully , even as ( S ) I have been fully known .

ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians 14:22 Greek lacks a sign The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For ( E ) one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God ; for no one understands him , but he utters mysteries in the Spirit .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	3	On the other hand , the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	4	The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself , but the one who prophesies builds up the church .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	5	Now I want you all to speak in tongues , but ( F ) even more to prophesy . The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues , unless someone interprets , so that the church may be built up .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	6	Now , brothers , [ a ] if I come to you speaking in tongues , how will I benefit you unless I bring you some ( G ) revelation or knowledge or prophecy or ( H ) teaching ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	7	If even lifeless instruments , such as the flute or the harp , do not give distinct notes , how will anyone know what is played ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	8	And ( I ) if the bugle gives an indistinct sound , who will get ready for battle ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So with yourselves , if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible , how will anyone know what is said ? For you will be ( J ) speaking into the air .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are doubtless many different languages in the world , and none is without meaning ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	11	but if I do not know the meaning of the language , I will be ( K ) a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	12	So with yourselves , since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit , strive to excel in building up the church .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore , one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What am I to do ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will pray with my mind also ; ( L ) I will sing praise with my spirit , but I will ( M ) sing with my mind also .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise , if you give thanks with your spirit , how can anyone in the position of an outsider [ b ] say ( N ) “ Amen ” to ( O ) your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For you may be giving thanks well enough , but the other person is not being built up .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	19	Nevertheless , in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others , than ten thousand words in a tongue .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	20	,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	21	( S ) In the Law it is written , ( T ) “ By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people , and even then they will not listen to me , says the Lord. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers , while prophecy is a sign [ c ] not for unbelievers but for believers .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	23	If , therefore , the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues , and outsiders or unbelievers enter , ( U ) will they not say that you are out of your minds ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy , and an unbeliever or outsider enters , he is convicted by all , he is called to account by all ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	25	( V ) the secrets of his heart are disclosed , and so , ( W ) falling on his face , he will worship God and ( X ) declare that God is really among you . Orderly Worship
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	26	,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If any speak in ( AE ) a tongue , let there be only two or at most three , and each in turn , and let someone interpret .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no one to interpret , let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Let two or three prophets speak , and let the others ( AF ) weigh what is said .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	30	If a revelation is made to another sitting there , ( AG ) let the first be silent .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For you can all prophesy one by one , so that all may learn and all be encouraged ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	32	and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	33	For God is not a God of ( AH ) confusion but of peace . As in ( AI ) all the churches of the saints ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	34	( AJ ) the women should keep silent in the churches . For they are not permitted to speak , but ( AK ) should be in submission , as ( AL ) the Law also says .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	35	If there is anything they desire to learn , let them ask their husbands at home . For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Or was it from you that the word of God came ? Or are you the only ones it has reached ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	37	( AM ) If anyone thinks that he is a prophet , or spiritual , he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	14	38	If anyone does not recognize this , he is not recognized .

ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians 15:49 Some manuscripts let us The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	15	We are even found to be misrepresenting God , because we testified about God that ( V ) he raised Christ , whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	2	and by which ( C ) you are being saved , if you ( D ) hold fast to the word I preached to you— ( E ) unless you believed in vain .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For ( F ) I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received : that Christ died ( G ) for our sins ( H ) in accordance with the Scriptures ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried , that he was raised ( I ) on the third day ( J ) in accordance with the Scriptures ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that ( K ) he appeared to Cephas , then ( L ) to the twelve .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	6	,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	7	Then he appeared to ( M ) James , then ( N ) to all the apostles .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	8	Last of all , as to one untimely born , ( O ) he appeared also to me .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For ( P ) I am the least of the apostles , unworthy to be called an apostle , because ( Q ) I persecuted the church of God .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace toward me was not in vain . On the contrary , ( R ) I worked harder than any of them , ( S ) though it was not I , but the grace of God that is with me .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Whether then it was I or they , so we preach and so you believed . The Resurrection of the Dead
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead , ( T ) how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , ( U ) then not even Christ has been raised .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead are not raised , not even Christ has been raised .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith is futile and ( W ) you are still in your sins .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then those also who ( X ) have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If in Christ we have hope [ b ] in this life only , ( Y ) we are of all people most to be pitied .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But in fact ( Z ) Christ has been raised from the dead , ( AA ) the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For as ( AB ) by a man came death , ( AC ) by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For ( AD ) as in Adam all die , so also in Christ shall all be made alive .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own order : Christ the firstfruits , then ( AE ) at his coming ( AF ) those who belong to Christ .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then comes the end , when he delivers ( AG ) the kingdom to God the Father after destroying ( AH ) every rule and every authority and power .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign ( AI ) until he has put all his enemies under his feet .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be ( AJ ) destroyed is death .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For ( AK ) “ God [ c ] has put all things in subjection under his feet. ” But when it says , “ all things are put in subjection , ” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	28	When ( AL ) all things are subjected to him , then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him , that ( AM ) God may be all in all .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise , what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why are people baptized on their behalf ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	30	Why are we ( AN ) in danger every hour ?
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	31	,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	32	What do I gain if , humanly speaking , ( AQ ) I fought with beasts at Ephesus ? If the dead are not raised , ( AR ) “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	33	( AS ) Do not be deceived : ( AT ) “ Bad company ruins good morals. ” [ d ]
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	34	( AU ) Wake up from your drunken stupor , as is right , and do not go on sinning . For ( AV ) some have no knowledge of God . ( AW ) I say this to your shame . The Resurrection Body
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone will ask , ( AX ) “ How are the dead raised ? With what kind of body do they come ? ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	36	You foolish person ! ( AY ) What you sow does not come to life unless it dies .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And what you sow is not the body that is to be , but a bare kernel , perhaps of wheat or of some other grain .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body as he has chosen , and to each kind of seed its own body .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	39	For not all flesh is the same , but there is one kind for humans , another for animals , another for birds , and another for fish .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies , but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind , and the glory of the earthly is of another .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for star differs from star in glory .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	42	( AZ ) So is it with the resurrection of the dead . What is sown is perishable ; what is raised is imperishable .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonor ; ( BA ) it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	45	Thus it is written , ( BB ) “ The first man Adam became a living being ” ; [ e ] ( BC ) the last Adam became a ( BD ) life-giving spirit .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	46	But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural , and then the spiritual .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	47	( BE ) The first man was from the earth , ( BF ) a man of dust ; ( BG ) the second man is from heaven .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As was the man of dust , so also are those who are of the dust , and as is the man of heaven , ( BH ) so also are those who are of heaven .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	49	Just ( BI ) as we have borne the image of the man of dust , ( BJ ) we shall [ f ] also bear the image of the man of heaven . Mystery and Victory
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	50	,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold ! I tell you a mystery . ( BM ) We shall not all sleep , ( BN ) but we shall all be changed ,
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For ( BO ) the trumpet will sound , and ( BP ) the dead will be raised imperishable , and we shall be changed .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this perishable body must put on the imperishable , and ( BQ ) this mortal body must put on immortality .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	54	When the perishable puts on the imperishable , and the mortal puts on immortality , then shall come to pass the saying that is written : ( BR ) “ Death is swallowed up in victory. ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	55	( BS ) “ O death , where is your victory ? O death , where is your sting ? ”
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin , and ( BT ) the power of sin is the law .
ESV	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God , ( BU ) who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .

ESV	1%20Corinthians	16	6	and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter , so that you may ( I ) help me on my journey , wherever I go .

ESV	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will stay in Ephesus until ( L ) Pentecost ,

ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , ( A ) an apostle of Christ Jesus ( B ) by the will of God , and ( C ) Timothy our brother , To the church of God that is at Corinth , ( D ) with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia :
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	3	( F ) Blessed be the ( G ) God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and ( H ) God of all comfort ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	4	( I ) who comforts us in all our affliction , so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For as we share abundantly in ( J ) Christ 's sufferings , so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too . [ a ]
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	6	( K ) If we are afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation ; and if we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	7	Our hope for you is unshaken , for we know that as you ( L ) share in our sufferings , you will also share in our comfort .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we do not want you to be unaware , brothers , [ b ] of ( M ) the affliction we experienced in Asia . For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	9	Indeed , we felt that we had received the sentence of death . But that was to make us ( N ) rely not on ourselves ( O ) but on God ( P ) who raises the dead .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	10	( Q ) He delivered us from such a deadly peril , and he will deliver us . ( R ) On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	11	( S ) You also must help us by prayer , so that many will give thanks on our behalf ( T ) for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many . Paul 's Change of Plans
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our boast is this , ( U ) the testimony of our conscience , that we behaved in the world with simplicity [ c ] and ( V ) godly sincerity , ( W ) not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God , and supremely so toward you .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you will fully understand—
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	14	just as you did ( X ) partially understand us—that ( Y ) on the day of our Lord Jesus ( Z ) you will boast of us as ( AA ) we will boast of you .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	15	Because I was sure of this , ( AB ) I wanted to come to you first , so that you might have ( AC ) a second ( AD ) experience of grace .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	16	I wanted to visit you ( AE ) on my way to Macedonia , and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this ? Do I make my plans ( AF ) according to the flesh , ready to say “ Yes , yes ” and “ No , no ” at the same time ?
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	18	As surely as ( AG ) God is faithful , ( AH ) our word to you has not been Yes and No .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For ( AI ) the Son of God , Jesus Christ , whom we proclaimed among you , ( AJ ) Silvanus and Timothy and I , was not Yes and No , but ( AK ) in him it is always Yes .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For ( AL ) all the promises of God find their Yes in him . That is why it is through him that we utter our ( AM ) Amen to God for his glory .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	21	And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ , and ( AN ) has anointed us ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	22	and who has also ( AO ) put his seal on us and ( AP ) given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee . [ d ]
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	23	But ( AQ ) I call God to witness against me—it was ( AR ) to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Not that we ( AS ) lord it over your faith , but we work with you for your joy , for you stand firm ( AT ) in your faith . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	2	For ( B ) if I cause you pain , who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained ?
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote as I did , so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice , ( C ) for I felt sure of all of you , that my joy would be the joy of you all .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For ( D ) I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears , not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you . Forgive the Sinner
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	5	Now ( E ) if anyone has caused pain , ( F ) he has caused it not to me , but ( G ) in some measure—not to put it too severely—to all of you .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	6	For such a one , ( H ) this punishment by the majority is enough ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	7	so ( I ) you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him , or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	8	So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For this is why I wrote , that I might ( J ) test you and know ( K ) whether you are obedient in everything .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	10	Anyone whom you forgive , I also forgive . Indeed , what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , has been for your sake in the presence of Christ ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	11	so that we would not be outwitted by Satan ; for ( L ) we are not ignorant of his designs . Triumph in Christ
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	12	When ( M ) I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ , even though ( N ) a door was opened for me in the Lord ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	13	my spirit ( O ) was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there . So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But ( P ) thanks be to God , who in Christ always ( Q ) leads us in triumphal procession , and through us spreads ( R ) the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are the aroma of Christ to God among ( S ) those who are being saved and among ( T ) those who are perishing ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	16	( U ) to one a fragrance from death to death , ( V ) to the other a fragrance from life to life . ( W ) Who is sufficient for these things ?
ESV	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not , like so many , peddlers of God 's word , but as men of sincerity , as commissioned by God , in the sight of God we speak in Christ . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	2	Corinthians 3:18 Greek from glory to glory The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	3	And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us , written not with ink but with the Spirit of ( E ) the living God , not on ( F ) tablets of stone but on ( G ) tablets of ( H ) human hearts . [ b ]
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	4	( I ) Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	5	( J ) Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us , but ( K ) our sufficiency is from God ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	6	who has made us sufficient to be ( L ) ministers of ( M ) a new covenant , not of ( N ) the letter but of the Spirit . For the letter kills , but ( O ) the Spirit gives life .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	7	Now if ( P ) the ministry of death , carved in letters on stone , came with such glory ( Q ) that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses ' face because of its glory , which was being brought to an end ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	8	will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory ?
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if there was glory in ( R ) the ministry of condemnation , ( S ) the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	10	Indeed , in this case , what once had glory has come to have no glory at all , because of the glory that surpasses it .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if what was being brought to an end came with glory , much more will what is permanent have glory .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Since we have such a hope , ( T ) we are very bold ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	13	not like Moses , ( U ) who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But ( V ) their minds were ( W ) hardened . For to this day , ( X ) when they read ( Y ) the old covenant , that same veil remains unlifted , because only through Christ is it taken away .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	15	Yes , to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But when ( Z ) one [ c ] turns to the Lord , ( AA ) the veil is removed .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord [ d ] is the Spirit , and where ( AB ) the Spirit of the Lord is , there is ( AC ) freedom .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	3	18	And we all , with unveiled face , ( AD ) beholding ( AE ) the glory of the Lord , [ e ] ( AF ) are being transformed into the same image ( AG ) from one degree of glory to another . [ f ] For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	4	In their case ( J ) the god of this world ( K ) has blinded the minds of the unbelievers , to keep them from seeing ( L ) the light of ( M ) the gospel of the glory of Christ , ( N ) who is the image of God .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	3	And even ( G ) if our gospel is veiled , ( H ) it is veiled to ( I ) those who are perishing .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For what ( O ) we proclaim is not ourselves , but Jesus Christ as Lord , with ( P ) ourselves as your servants [ c ] for Jesus ' sake .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God , who said , ( Q ) “ Let light shine out of darkness , ” ( R ) has shone in our hearts to give ( S ) the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ . Treasure in Jars of Clay
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in ( T ) jars of clay , ( U ) to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are ( V ) afflicted in every way , but not crushed ; perplexed , but not driven to despair ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	9	persecuted , but ( W ) not forsaken ; ( X ) struck down , but not destroyed ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	10	( Y ) always carrying in the body the death of Jesus , ( Z ) so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus ' sake , so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So ( AA ) death is at work in us , but life in you .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	13	Since we have ( AB ) the same spirit of faith according to what has been written , ( AC ) “ I believed , and so I spoke , ” we also believe , and so we also speak ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	14	knowing that ( AD ) he who raised the Lord Jesus ( AE ) will raise us also with Jesus and ( AF ) bring us with you into his presence .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	15	For ( AG ) it is all for your sake , so that as ( AH ) grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving , ( AI ) to the glory of God .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	16	So we do not lose heart . ( AJ ) Though our outer self [ d ] is wasting away , ( AK ) our inner self ( AL ) is being renewed day by day .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For ( AM ) this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	4	18	( AN ) as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen . For the things that are seen are transient , but the things that are unseen are eternal . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	2	Corinthians 5:19 Or God was in Christ , reconciling The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	5	He who has prepared us for this very thing is God , ( G ) who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	3	if indeed by putting it on [ a ] we may not be found naked .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For while we are still in this tent , we groan , being burdened—not that we would be unclothed , but that we would be further clothed , so that what is mortal ( F ) may be swallowed up by life .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So we are always of good courage . We know that ( H ) while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	7	for ( I ) we walk by faith , not ( J ) by sight .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	8	Yes , we are of good courage , and we ( K ) would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	9	So whether we are at home or away , we make it our aim to ( L ) please him .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For ( M ) we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , ( N ) so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body , whether good or evil . The Ministry of Reconciliation
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Therefore , knowing ( O ) the fear of the Lord , we persuade others . But ( P ) what we are is known to God , and I hope it is known also to your conscience .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	12	( Q ) We are not commending ourselves to you again but ( R ) giving you cause to boast about us , so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For if we ( S ) are beside ourselves , it is for God ; if we are in our right mind , it is for you .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ ( T ) controls us , because we have concluded this : that ( U ) one has died for all , therefore all have died ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	15	and he died for all , ( V ) that those who live might no longer live for themselves but ( W ) for him who for their sake died and was raised .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	16	From now on , therefore , ( X ) we regard no one according to the flesh . Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh , we regard him thus no longer .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore , if anyone is ( Y ) in Christ , he is ( Z ) a new creation . [ b ] ( AA ) The old has passed away ; behold , the new has come .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	18	All this is from God , ( AB ) who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us ( AC ) the ministry of reconciliation ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	19	that is , in Christ God was reconciling [ c ] the world to himself , ( AD ) not counting their trespasses against them , and entrusting to us ( AE ) the message of reconciliation .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	20	Therefore , ( AF ) we are ambassadors for Christ , ( AG ) God making his appeal through us . We implore you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	5	21	( AH ) For our sake he made him to be sin ( AI ) who knew no sin , so that in him we might become ( AJ ) the righteousness of God . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	6	( N ) by purity , ( O ) knowledge , patience , kindness , ( P ) the Holy Spirit , ( Q ) genuine love ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	3	We ( G ) put no obstacle in anyone 's way , so that no fault may be found with our ministry ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	4	but ( H ) as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way : ( I ) by great endurance , ( J ) in afflictions , ( K ) hardships , calamities ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	5	( L ) beatings , imprisonments , ( M ) riots , labors , sleepless nights , hunger ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	7	by ( R ) truthful speech , and ( S ) the power of God ; with ( T ) the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	8	through honor and dishonor , ( U ) through slander and praise . We are treated as impostors , and yet are true ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	9	as unknown , and ( V ) yet well known ; ( W ) as dying , and behold , we live ; ( X ) as punished , and yet not killed ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	10	( Y ) as sorrowful , yet always rejoicing ; ( Z ) as poor , yet making many rich ; ( AA ) as having nothing , ( AB ) yet possessing everything .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	11	We have spoken freely to you , [ a ] Corinthians ; ( AC ) our heart is wide open .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	12	You are not restricted by us , but ( AD ) you are restricted in your own affections .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	13	( AE ) In return ( I speak ( AF ) as to children ) widen your hearts also . The Temple of the Living God
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	14	( AG ) Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers . For ( AH ) what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness ? Or ( AI ) what fellowship has light with darkness ?
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	15	( AJ ) What accord has Christ with Belial ? [ b ] Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever ?
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	16	What agreement has the temple of God with idols ? For ( AK ) we are the temple of the living God ; as God said , ( AL ) “ I will make my dwelling among them and ( AM ) walk among them , and ( AN ) I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	17	Therefore ( AO ) go out from their midst , and be separate from them , says the Lord , and touch no unclean thing ; then I will welcome you ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	6	18	( AP ) and I will be a father to you , and you shall be sons and daughters to me , says the Lord Almighty. ” Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Corinthians 7:2 Greek lacks in your hearts The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	7	and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted by you , as he told us of your longing , your mourning , your zeal for me , so that I rejoiced still more .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not say this to condemn you , for I said before that ( D ) you are in our hearts , to die together and to live together .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	4	I am acting with ( E ) great boldness toward you ; ( F ) I have great pride in you ; ( G ) I am filled with comfort . In all our affliction , I am overflowing with joy .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For even ( H ) when we came into Macedonia , our bodies had no rest , but we were afflicted at every turn— ( I ) fighting without and fear within .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But ( J ) God , who comforts the downcast , ( K ) comforted us by the coming of Titus ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For ( L ) even if I made you grieve with my letter , I do not regret it—though ( M ) I did regret it , for I see that that letter grieved you , though only for a while .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	9	As it is , I rejoice , not because you were grieved , but ( N ) because you were grieved into repenting . For you felt a godly grief , so that you suffered no loss through us .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For ( O ) godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret , whereas ( P ) worldly grief produces death .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you , but also what eagerness to clear yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what longing , ( Q ) what zeal , what punishment ! At every point you have proved yourselves innocent in the matter .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So although I wrote to you , it was not for the sake of the one ( R ) who did the wrong , nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong , but in order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Therefore ( S ) we are comforted . And besides our own comfort , we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus , because his spirit ( T ) has been refreshed by you all .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For ( U ) whatever boasts I made to him about you , I was not put to shame . But just as everything we said to you ( V ) was true , so also our boasting before Titus has proved true .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his affection for you is even greater , as he remembers ( W ) the obedience of you all , how you received him with fear and trembling .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice , because I have complete ( X ) confidence in you . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	8	( K ) I say this not as a command , but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For they gave ( C ) according to their means , as I can testify , and beyond their means , of their own accord ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	4	begging us earnestly ( D ) for the favor [ b ] of taking part in ( E ) the relief of the saints—
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	5	and this , not as we expected , but they ( F ) gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	6	Accordingly , ( G ) we urged Titus that as he had started , so he should complete among you ( H ) this act of grace .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	7	But as ( I ) you excel in everything—in faith , in speech , in knowledge , in all earnestness , and in our love for you [ c ] — ( J ) see that you excel in this act of grace also .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ( L ) though he was rich , yet for your sake he became poor , so that you by his poverty might become rich .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	10	And in this matter ( M ) I give my judgment : ( N ) this benefits you , who ( O ) a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	11	So now finish doing it as well , so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the readiness is there , it is acceptable ( P ) according to what a person has , not according to what he does not have .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened , but that as a matter of fairness

ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But ( S ) thanks be to God , ( T ) who put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care I have for you .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For ( U ) he not only accepted our appeal , but being himself very earnest he is going [ d ] to you of his own accord .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	18	With him we are sending [ e ] ( V ) the brother who is famous among ( W ) all the churches for his preaching of the gospel .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	8	19	And not only that , but he has been ( X ) appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this act of ( Y ) grace that is being ministered by us , ( Z ) for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will .

ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	9	As it is written , ( O ) “ He has distributed freely , he has given to the poor ; his righteousness endures forever. ”
ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But ( E ) I am sending [ a ] the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter , so that you may be ready , ( F ) as I said you would be .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	4	Otherwise , if some Macedonians ( G ) come with me and find that you are not ready , we would be humiliated—to say nothing of you—for being so confident .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	5	So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the ( H ) gift [ b ] you have promised , so that it may be ready ( I ) as a willing gift , ( J ) not as an exaction . [ c ] The Cheerful Giver
ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	6	The point is this : ( K ) whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and whoever sows bountifully [ d ] will also reap bountifully .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each one must give as he has decided in his heart , ( L ) not reluctantly or under compulsion , for ( M ) God loves a cheerful giver .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And ( N ) God is able to make all grace abound to you , so that having all sufficiency [ e ] in all things at all times , you may abound in every good work .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	10	He who supplies ( P ) seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and ( Q ) increase the harvest of your righteousness .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	11	( R ) You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way , which ( S ) through us will produce thanksgiving to God .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	12	For the ministry of this service is not only supplying ( T ) the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	9	13	By their approval of this service , ( U ) they [ f ] will glorify God because of your submission that comes from your ( V ) confession of the gospel of Christ , and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others ,

ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	2	I beg of you ( C ) that when I am present I may not have to show ( D ) boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of walking according to the flesh .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	10	For they say , “ His letters are weighty and strong , but ( R ) his bodily presence is weak , and ( S ) his speech of no account. ”
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh , we are not waging war according to the flesh .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	4	For the ( E ) weapons of ( F ) our warfare are not of the flesh but have ( G ) divine power ( H ) to destroy strongholds .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	5	We destroy arguments and ( I ) every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God , and take every thought captive to ( J ) obey Christ ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	6	( K ) being ready to punish every disobedience , ( L ) when your obedience is complete .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	7	( M ) Look at what is before your eyes . ( N ) If anyone is confident that he is Christ 's , let him remind himself that just as ( O ) he is Christ 's , ( P ) so also are we .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For even if I boast a little too much of ( Q ) our authority , which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you , I will not be ashamed .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	9	I do not want to appear to be frightening you with my letters .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such a person understand that what we say by letter when absent , we do when present .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	12	Not that we dare to classify or ( T ) compare ourselves with some of those who ( U ) are commending themselves . But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another , they are ( V ) without understanding .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast ( W ) beyond limits , but will ( X ) boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to us , ( Y ) to reach even to you .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we are not overextending ourselves , as though we did not reach you . ( Z ) For we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	15	We do not boast beyond limit in the labors of others . But our hope is that ( AA ) as your faith increases , our area of influence among you may be ( AB ) greatly enlarged ,
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	16	so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you , without boasting of work already done in another 's area of influence .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	10	17	“ Let ( AC ) the one who boasts , boast in the Lord. ”

ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	11	And why ? ( V ) Because I do not love you ? ( W ) God knows I do !
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that ( D ) as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning , your thoughts ( E ) will be led astray from a ( F ) sincere and ( G ) pure devotion to Christ .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if someone comes and ( H ) proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed , or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received , or if you accept ( I ) a different gospel from the one you accepted , you put up with it readily enough .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	5	Indeed , I consider that ( J ) I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	6	( K ) Even if I am unskilled in speaking , ( L ) I am not so in knowledge ; indeed , in every way ( M ) we have made this plain to you in all things .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Or ( N ) did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted , because ( O ) I preached God 's gospel to you free of charge ?
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And when I was with you and was ( P ) in need , ( Q ) I did not burden anyone , for the brothers who came from Macedonia ( R ) supplied my need . So I refrained and will refrain ( S ) from burdening you in any way .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	10	( T ) As the truth of Christ is in me , this boasting of mine ( U ) will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	12	And what I am doing I will continue to do , ( X ) in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such men are ( Y ) false apostles , ( Z ) deceitful workmen , ( AA ) disguising themselves as apostles of Christ .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder , for even Satan disguises himself as ( AB ) an angel of light .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	15	So it is no surprise if his servants , also , disguise themselves as ( AC ) servants of righteousness . ( AD ) Their end will correspond to their deeds . Paul 's Sufferings as an Apostle
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I repeat , ( AE ) let no one think me foolish . But even if you do , accept me as a fool , so that I too may boast a little .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	17	What I am saying ( AF ) with this boastful confidence , ( AG ) I say not as the Lord would [ a ] but as a fool .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Since ( AH ) many boast according to the flesh , I too will boast .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For you gladly bear with fools , ( AI ) being wise yourselves !
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For you bear it if someone ( AJ ) makes slaves of you , or ( AK ) devours you , or takes advantage of you , or puts on airs , or ( AL ) strikes you in the face .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	21	To my shame , I must say , ( AM ) we were too weak for that ! But whatever anyone else dares to boast of—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast of that .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? ( AN ) So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they offspring of Abraham ? So am I .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they ( AO ) servants of Christ ? ( AP ) I am a better one—I am talking like a madman—with far greater labors , ( AQ ) far more imprisonments , ( AR ) with countless beatings , and ( AS ) often near death .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the ( AT ) forty lashes less one .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was ( AU ) beaten with rods . ( AV ) Once I was stoned . Three times I ( AW ) was shipwrecked ; a night and a day I was adrift at sea ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	26	on frequent journeys , in danger from rivers , danger from robbers , ( AX ) danger from my own people , ( AY ) danger from Gentiles , ( AZ ) danger in the city , danger in the wilderness , danger at sea , danger from false brothers ;
ESV	2%20Corinthians	11	27	( BA ) in toil and hardship , through many a sleepless night , ( BB ) in hunger and thirst , often without food , [ b ] in cold and exposure .

ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	12	( W ) The signs of a true apostle were performed among you ( X ) with utmost patience , with signs and wonders and mighty works .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I know that this man was caught up into ( F ) paradise—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know , ( G ) God knows—
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	4	and he heard things that can not be told , which man may not utter .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	5	On behalf of this man I will boast , but on my own behalf I will not boast , ( H ) except of my weaknesses—
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	6	though if I should wish to boast , ( I ) I would not be a fool , for I would be speaking the truth ; but I refrain from it , so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	7	So ( J ) to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations , [ a ] ( K ) a thorn was given me in the flesh , ( L ) a messenger of Satan to harass me , to keep me from becoming conceited .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	8	( M ) Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this , that it should leave me .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	9	But he said to me , ( N ) “ My grace is sufficient for you , for ( O ) my power is made perfect in weakness. ” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses , so that ( P ) the power of Christ may rest upon me .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	10	( Q ) For the sake of Christ , then , ( R ) I am content with weaknesses , insults , hardships , persecutions , and calamities . For ( S ) when I am weak , then I am strong . Concern for the Corinthian Church
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	11	( T ) I have been a fool ! You forced me to it , for I ought to have been commended by you . For I was ( U ) not at all inferior to these super-apostles , ( V ) even though I am nothing .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches , except that ( Y ) I myself did not burden you ? Forgive me this wrong !
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Here ( Z ) for the third time I am ready to come to you . And I will not be a burden , for ( AA ) I seek not what is yours but you . For ( AB ) children are not obligated to save up for their parents , but ( AC ) parents for their children .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	15	( AD ) I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls . If ( AE ) I love you more , am I to be loved less ?
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But granting that ( AF ) I myself did not burden you , I was crafty , you say , and got the better of you by deceit .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I take advantage of you ( AG ) through any of those whom I sent to you ?
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	18	( AH ) I urged Titus to go , and sent ( AI ) the brother with him . Did Titus take advantage of you ? Did we not act in the same spirit ? Did we not take the same steps ?
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you ? It is ( AJ ) in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ , and ( AK ) all for your upbuilding , beloved .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I fear that perhaps ( AL ) when I come I may find you not as I wish , and that you may find me not as you wish—that perhaps there may be quarreling , jealousy , anger , hostility , slander , gossip , conceit , and disorder .
ESV	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you , and I may have to mourn over many of those ( AM ) who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity , ( AN ) sexual immorality , and sensuality that they have practiced . Footnotes -

ESV	Galatians	3	8	And the Scripture , foreseeing that ( L ) God would justify [ c ] the Gentiles by faith , preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham , saying , ( M ) “ In you shall all the nations be blessed. ”
ESV	Galatians	3	9	So then , those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham , the man of faith . The Righteous Shall Live by Faith
ESV	Galatians	3	10	For all who rely on works of the law are ( N ) under a curse ; for it is written , ( O ) “ Cursed be everyone who does not ( P ) abide by all things written in the Book of the Law , and do them. ”
ESV	Galatians	3	11	,
ESV	Galatians	3	12	But the law is not of faith , rather ( S ) “ The one who does them shall live by them. ”
ESV	Galatians	3	13	Christ ( T ) redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written , ( U ) “ Cursed is everyone who is hanged ( V ) on a tree ” —
ESV	Galatians	3	14	so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might ( W ) come to the Gentiles , so that ( X ) we might receive ( Y ) the promised Spirit [ e ] through faith . The Law and the Promise
ESV	Galatians	3	15	( Z ) To give a human example , brothers : [ f ] ( AA ) even with a man-made covenant , no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified .
ESV	Galatians	3	16	Now ( AB ) the promises were made ( AC ) to Abraham and to his offspring . It does not say , “ And to offsprings , ” referring to many , but referring to one , ( AD ) “ And to your offspring , ” who is Christ .
ESV	Galatians	3	17	This is what I mean : the law , which came ( AE )
ESV	Galatians	3	430	years afterward , does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God , so as ( AF ) to make the promise void .
ESV	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance comes by the law , it no longer comes by promise ; but ( AG ) God gave it to Abraham by a promise .
ESV	Galatians	3	19	Why then the law ? ( AH ) It was added because of transgressions , ( AI ) until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made , and it was ( AJ ) put in place through angels ( AK ) by an intermediary .
ESV	Galatians	3	20	Now ( AL ) an intermediary implies more than one , but ( AM ) God is one .
ESV	Galatians	3	21	Is the law then contrary to the promises of God ? Certainly not ! For ( AN ) if a law had been given that could give life , then righteousness would indeed be by the law .
ESV	Galatians	3	22	But the Scripture ( AO ) imprisoned everything under sin , so that ( AP ) the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given ( AQ ) to those who believe .
ESV	Galatians	3	23	Now before faith came , we were held captive under the law , ( AR ) imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed .

ESV	Galatians	4	12	Brothers , [ c ] ( R ) I entreat you , become as I am , for I also have become as you are . ( S ) You did me no wrong .
ESV	Galatians	4	13	You know it was ( T ) because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you ( U ) at first ,
ESV	Galatians	4	14	and though my condition was a trial to you , you did not scorn or despise me , but received me ( V ) as an angel of God , ( W ) as Christ Jesus .
ESV	Galatians	4	15	What then has become of your blessedness ? For I testify to you that , if possible , you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me .
ESV	Galatians	4	16	Have I then become your enemy by ( X ) telling you the truth ? [ d ]
ESV	Galatians	4	17	They make much of you , but for no good purpose . They want to shut you out , that you may make much of them .
ESV	Galatians	4	18	It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose , and ( Y ) not only when I am present with you ,
ESV	Galatians	4	19	( Z ) my little children , ( AA ) for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ ( AB ) is formed in you !
ESV	Galatians	4	20	I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone , for I am perplexed about you . Example of Hagar and Sarah
ESV	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , you who desire to be under the law , do you not listen to the law ?
ESV	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , ( AC ) one by a slave woman and ( AD ) one by a free woman .
ESV	Galatians	4	23	But ( AE ) the son of the slave was born according to the flesh , while ( AF ) the son of the free woman was born through promise .
ESV	Galatians	4	24	Now this may be interpreted allegorically : these women are two ( AG ) covenants . ( AH ) One is from Mount Sinai , bearing children for slavery ; she is Hagar .
ESV	Galatians	4	25	Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia ; [ e ] she corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery with her children .
ESV	Galatians	4	26	But ( AI ) the Jerusalem above is free , and she is our mother .
ESV	Galatians	4	27	For it is written , ( AJ ) “ Rejoice , O barren one who does not bear ; break forth and cry aloud , you who are not in labor ! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband. ”
ESV	Galatians	4	28	,
ESV	Galatians	4	29	But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh ( AM ) persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , ( AN ) so also it is now .
ESV	Galatians	4	30	But what does the Scripture say ? ( AO ) “ Cast out the slave woman and her son , for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman. ”

ESV	Galatians	5	2	Look : I , Paul , say to you that ( F ) if you accept circumcision , ( G ) Christ will be of no advantage to you .
ESV	Galatians	5	3	I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that ( H ) he is obligated to keep the whole law .
ESV	Galatians	5	4	You are ( I ) severed from Christ , ( J ) you who would be justified [ a ] by the law ; ( K ) you have fallen away from grace .
ESV	Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus ( M ) neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything , but ( N ) only faith working through love .
ESV	Galatians	5	7	( O ) You were running well . Who hindered you from obeying ( P ) the truth ?
ESV	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion is not from ( Q ) him who calls you .

ESV	Galatians	5	16	But I say , ( AD ) walk by the Spirit , and you will not gratify ( AE ) the desires of the flesh .
ESV	Galatians	5	17	For ( AF ) the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit , and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh , for these are opposed to each other , ( AG ) to keep you from doing the things you want to do .
ESV	Galatians	5	18	But if you are ( AH ) led by the Spirit , ( AI ) you are not under the law .
ESV	Galatians	5	19	Now ( AJ ) the works of the flesh are evident : sexual immorality , impurity , sensuality ,

ESV	Galatians	6	3	For ( G ) if anyone thinks he is something , ( H ) when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
ESV	Galatians	6	4	But let each one ( I ) test his own work , and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor .
ESV	Galatians	6	5	For ( J ) each will have to bear his own load .
ESV	Galatians	6	7	( L ) Do not be deceived : God is not mocked , for ( M ) whatever one sows , that will he also reap .
ESV	Galatians	6	8	For ( N ) the one who sows to his own flesh ( O ) will from the flesh reap corruption , but ( P ) the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .

ESV	Galatians	6	11	See with what large letters I am writing to you ( V ) with my own hand .
ESV	Galatians	6	12	( W ) It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh ( X ) who would force you to be circumcised , and only ( Y ) in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
ESV	Galatians	6	13	For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law , but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh .
ESV	Galatians	6	14	But far be it from me to boast ( Z ) except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by which [ b ] the world ( AA ) has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
ESV	Galatians	6	15	For ( AB ) neither circumcision counts for anything , nor uncircumcision , but ( AC ) a new creation .

ESV	Ephesians	5	5	For you may be sure of this , that ( L ) everyone who is sexually immoral or impure , or who is covetous ( ( M ) that is , an idolater ) , has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God .
ESV	Ephesians	5	2	And ( B ) walk in love , ( C ) as Christ loved us and ( D ) gave himself up for us , a ( E ) fragrant ( F ) offering and sacrifice to God .
ESV	Ephesians	5	3	But ( G ) sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness ( H ) must not even be named among you , as is proper among saints .
ESV	Ephesians	5	4	Let there be ( I ) no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking , ( J ) which are out of place , but instead ( K ) let there be thanksgiving .
ESV	Ephesians	5	6	( N ) Let no one ( O ) deceive you with empty words , for because of these things ( P ) the wrath of God comes upon ( Q ) the sons of disobedience .
ESV	Ephesians	5	7	Therefore ( R ) do not become partners with them ;
ESV	Ephesians	5	8	for ( S ) at one time you were ( T ) darkness , but now you are light in the Lord . ( U ) Walk as children of light
ESV	Ephesians	5	9	( for ( V ) the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true ) ,
ESV	Ephesians	5	10	and ( W ) try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord .
ESV	Ephesians	5	11	( X ) Take no part in the ( Y ) unfruitful ( Z ) works of darkness , but instead ( AA ) expose them .
ESV	Ephesians	5	12	For ( AB ) it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret .
ESV	Ephesians	5	13	But when ( AC ) anything is exposed by the light , it becomes visible ,
ESV	Ephesians	5	14	for anything that becomes visible is light . Therefore it says ,
ESV	Ephesians	5	15	( AG ) Look carefully then how you walk , not as unwise but as wise ,
ESV	Ephesians	5	16	( AH ) making the best use of the time , because ( AI ) the days are evil .
ESV	Ephesians	5	17	Therefore do not be foolish , but understand what ( AJ ) the will of the Lord is .
ESV	Ephesians	5	18	And ( AK ) do not get drunk with wine , for that is ( AL ) debauchery , but ( AM ) be filled with the Spirit ,
ESV	Ephesians	5	19	addressing one another in ( AN ) psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart ,
ESV	Ephesians	5	20	( AO ) giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father ( AP ) in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
ESV	Ephesians	5	21	( AQ ) submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ . Wives and Husbands
ESV	Ephesians	5	22	( AR ) Wives , ( AS ) submit to your own husbands , ( AT ) as to the Lord .
ESV	Ephesians	5	23	For ( AU ) the husband is the head of the wife even as ( AV ) Christ is the head of the church , his body , and is ( AW ) himself its Savior .
ESV	Ephesians	5	24	Now as the church submits to Christ , so also wives should submit ( AX ) in everything to their husbands .
ESV	Ephesians	5	25	( AY ) Husbands , love your wives , as Christ loved the church and ( AZ ) gave himself up for her ,
ESV	Ephesians	5	26	that he might sanctify her , having cleansed her by ( BA ) the washing of water ( BB ) with the word ,
ESV	Ephesians	5	27	so ( BC ) that he might present the church to himself in splendor , ( BD ) without spot or wrinkle or any such thing , that she might be holy and without blemish . [ a ]
ESV	Ephesians	5	28	In the same way ( BE ) husbands should love their wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself .
ESV	Ephesians	5	29	For no one ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , just as Christ does the church ,
ESV	Ephesians	5	30	because ( BF ) we are members of his body .
ESV	Ephesians	5	31	( BG ) “ Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife , and ( BH ) the two shall become one flesh. ”
ESV	Ephesians	5	32	This mystery is profound , and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church .

ESV	Ephesians	6	11	( O ) Put on ( P ) the whole armor of God , that you may be able to stand against ( Q ) the schemes of the devil .
ESV	Ephesians	6	12	For ( R ) we do not wrestle against flesh and blood , but against ( S ) the rulers , against the authorities , against ( T ) the cosmic powers over ( U ) this present darkness , against ( V ) the spiritual forces of evil ( W ) in the heavenly places .
ESV	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore ( X ) take up the whole armor of God , that you may be able to withstand in ( Y ) the evil day , and having done all , to stand firm .
ESV	Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore , ( Z ) having fastened on the belt of truth , and ( AA ) having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,

ESV	Ephesians	6	20	for which I ( AP ) am an ambassador ( AQ ) in chains , that I may declare it boldly , as I ought to speak . Final Greetings

ESV	Philippians	1	3	( E ) I thank my God ( F ) in all my remembrance of you ,
ESV	Philippians	1	4	always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy ,
ESV	Philippians	1	5	( G ) because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now .
ESV	Philippians	1	6	And I am sure of this , that he who began ( H ) a good work in you ( I ) will bring it to completion at ( J ) the day of Jesus Christ .
ESV	Philippians	1	7	It is right for me to feel this way about you all , because I hold you ( K ) in my heart , for you are all ( L ) partakers with me of grace , [ d ] both ( M ) in my imprisonment and in ( N ) the defense and confirmation of the gospel .
ESV	Philippians	1	8	For ( O ) God is my witness , ( P ) how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus .
ESV	Philippians	1	9	And it is my prayer that ( Q ) your love may abound more and more , ( R ) with knowledge and all discernment ,
ESV	Philippians	1	10	so that you may approve what is excellent , ( S ) and so be pure and blameless ( T ) for the day of Christ ,
ESV	Philippians	1	11	filled ( U ) with the fruit of righteousness that comes ( V ) through Jesus Christ , ( W ) to the glory and praise of God . The Advance of the Gospel
ESV	Philippians	1	12	I want you to know , brothers , [ e ] that what has happened to me has really ( X ) served to advance the gospel ,
ESV	Philippians	1	13	so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard [ f ] and ( Y ) to all the rest that ( Z ) my imprisonment is for Christ .

ESV	Philippians	1	15	( AB ) Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry , but others from good will .
ESV	Philippians	1	16	The latter do it out of love , ( AC ) knowing that I am put here for ( AD ) the defense of the gospel .
ESV	Philippians	1	17	The former proclaim Christ ( AE ) out of selfish ambition , not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment .
ESV	Philippians	1	18	What then ? Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed , and in that I rejoice . To Live Is Christ Yes , and I will rejoice ,
ESV	Philippians	1	19	for I know that ( AF ) through your prayers and ( AG ) the help of ( AH ) the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance ,
ESV	Philippians	1	20	as it is my eager expectation and hope ( AI ) that I will not be at all ashamed , but that with full ( AJ ) courage now as always Christ ( AK ) will be honored in my body , ( AL ) whether by life or by death .
ESV	Philippians	1	21	For to me ( AM ) to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
ESV	Philippians	1	22	If I am to live in the flesh , that means fruitful labor for me . Yet which I shall choose I can not tell .
ESV	Philippians	1	23	( AN ) I am hard pressed between the two . My desire is ( AO ) to depart and ( AP ) be with Christ , for that is far better .
ESV	Philippians	1	24	But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account .
ESV	Philippians	1	25	( AQ ) Convinced of this , ( AR ) I know that I will remain and continue with you all , for your ( AS ) progress and ( AT ) joy in the faith ,
ESV	Philippians	1	26	so that in me ( AU ) you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus , because of my coming to you again .
ESV	Philippians	1	27	Only ( AV ) let your manner of life be ( AW ) worthy [ h ] of the gospel of Christ , so that whether I come and see you or am absent , I may hear of you ( AX ) that you are standing firm in one spirit , with ( AY ) one mind ( AZ ) striving side by side for the faith of the gospel ,
ESV	Philippians	1	28	and not frightened in anything by your opponents . This is ( BA ) a clear sign to them of their destruction , but ( BB ) of your salvation , and that from God .
ESV	Philippians	1	29	For ( BC ) it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also ( BD ) suffer for his sake ,

ESV	Philippians	2	11	and ( Y ) every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is ( Z ) Lord , to the glory of God the Father . Lights in the World
ESV	Philippians	2	12	Therefore , my beloved , ( AA ) as you have always ( AB ) obeyed , so now , not only as in my presence but much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling ,
ESV	Philippians	2	13	for ( AC ) it is God who works in you , both to will and to work for ( AD ) his good pleasure .
ESV	Philippians	2	14	Do all things ( AE ) without grumbling or ( AF ) disputing ,
ESV	Philippians	2	15	that you may be blameless and innocent , ( AG ) children of God ( AH ) without blemish ( AI ) in the midst of ( AJ ) a crooked and twisted generation , among whom you shine ( AK ) as lights in the world ,

ESV	Philippians	2	17	Even if I am to be ( AP ) poured out as a drink offering upon ( AQ ) the sacrificial offering of your faith , I am glad and rejoice with you all .
ESV	Philippians	2	18	Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me . Timothy and Epaphroditus
ESV	Philippians	2	19	I hope in the Lord Jesus ( AR ) to send Timothy to you soon , so that I too may be cheered by news of you .
ESV	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one ( AS ) like him , who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare .
ESV	Philippians	2	21	For they all ( AT ) seek their own interests , not those of Jesus Christ .
ESV	Philippians	2	22	But you know Timothy 's [ d ] ( AU ) proven worth , how ( AV ) as a son [ e ] with a father ( AW ) he has served with me in the gospel .
ESV	Philippians	2	23	I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me ,
ESV	Philippians	2	24	and ( AX ) I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also .
ESV	Philippians	2	25	I have thought it necessary to send to you ( AY ) Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and ( AZ ) fellow soldier , and your messenger and ( BA ) minister to my need ,
ESV	Philippians	2	26	for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill.
ESV	Philippians	2	27	Indeed he was ill , near to death . But God had mercy on him , and not only on him but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
ESV	Philippians	2	28	I am the more eager to send him , therefore , that you may rejoice at seeing him again , and that I may be less anxious .
ESV	Philippians	2	29	So ( BB ) receive him in the Lord with all joy , and ( BC ) honor such men ,

ESV	Philippians	3	8	Indeed , I count everything as loss because of ( T ) the surpassing worth of ( U ) knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . For his sake I ( V ) have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish , in order that I may gain Christ

ESV	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For ( G ) our appeal does not spring from ( H ) error or ( I ) impurity or ( J ) any attempt to deceive ,

ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	( A ) Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	( B ) We ought always to give thanks to God for you , brothers , [ a ] as is right , because your faith is growing abundantly , and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	Therefore ( C ) we ourselves boast about you ( D ) in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith ( E ) in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring . The Judgment at Christ 's Coming
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	This is ( F ) evidence of the righteous judgment of God , that you may be ( G ) considered worthy of the kingdom of God , for which you are also suffering—
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	since indeed God considers it ( H ) just ( I ) to repay with affliction those who afflict you ,
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	and to grant ( J ) relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us , when ( K ) the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven ( L ) with his mighty angels
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	( M ) in flaming fire , inflicting vengeance on those ( N ) who do not know God and on those who ( O ) do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	They will suffer the punishment of ( P ) eternal destruction , ( Q ) away from [ b ] the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might ,
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	( R ) when he comes on ( S ) that day ( T ) to be glorified in his saints , and to be marveled at among all who have believed , because our ( U ) testimony to you ( V ) was believed .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	To this end we ( W ) always pray for you , that our God may ( X ) make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every ( Y ) work of faith by his power ,
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	so that the name of our Lord Jesus ( Z ) may be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	( H ) Let no one deceive you in any way . For that day will not come , ( I ) unless the rebellion comes first , and ( J ) the man of lawlessness [ b ] is revealed , ( K ) the son of destruction , [ c ]
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship , so that he takes his seat in the temple of God , ( L ) proclaiming himself to be God .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things ?
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For ( M ) the mystery of lawlessness ( N ) is already at work . Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	And then ( O ) the lawless one will be revealed , whom the Lord Jesus ( P ) will kill with ( Q ) the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by ( R ) the appearance of his coming .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan ( S ) with all power and false signs and wonders ,
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	and with all wicked deception for ( T ) those who are perishing , because they refused to love the truth and so be saved .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	Therefore ( U ) God sends them a strong delusion , so that they may believe ( V ) what is false ,
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	in order that all may be condemned ( W ) who did not believe the truth but ( X ) had pleasure in unrighteousness . Stand Firm
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	,

ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	3	But ( E ) the Lord is faithful . He will establish you and ( F ) guard you against ( G ) the evil one . [ c ]
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	And ( H ) we have confidence in the Lord about you , that you are doing and will do the things that we command .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord ( I ) direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ . Warning Against Idleness
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	,
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For you yourselves know ( N ) how you ought to imitate us , because ( O ) we were not idle when we were with you ,
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	nor did we eat anyone 's bread without paying for it , but ( P ) with toil and labor we worked night and day , that we might not be a burden to any of you .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	It was ( Q ) not because we do not have that right , but to give you in ourselves ( R ) an example to imitate .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you , we would give you this command : ( S ) If anyone is not willing to work , let him not eat .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear that some among you ( T ) walk in idleness , not busy at work , but ( U ) busybodies .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living . [ d ]
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	-
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter , take note of that person , and ( W ) have nothing to do with him , that he may be ashamed .
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	( X ) Do not regard him as an enemy , but ( Y ) warn him as a brother . Benediction
ESV	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	Now may ( Z ) the Lord of peace himself ( AA ) give you peace at all times in every way . ( AB ) The Lord be with you all .

ESV	1%20Timothy	1	1	Timothy 1:17 Greek to the ages of ages The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , ( E ) my true child in the faith : ( F ) Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . Warning Against False Teachers
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	3	( G ) As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia , remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not ( H ) to teach any different doctrine ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	4	nor ( I ) to devote themselves to myths and endless ( J ) genealogies , which promote ( K ) speculations rather than the stewardship [ a ] from God that is by faith .
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	5	The aim of our charge is love ( L ) that issues from a pure heart and ( M ) a good conscience and ( N ) a sincere faith .
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	6	Certain persons , by ( O ) swerving from these , have wandered away into ( P ) vain discussion ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	7	desiring to be teachers of the law , ( Q ) without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions .
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	8	Now we know that ( R ) the law is good , if one uses it lawfully ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	9	understanding this , that the ( S ) law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for those who strike their fathers and mothers , for murderers ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	10	the sexually immoral , men who practice homosexuality , enslavers , [ b ] liars , perjurers , and whatever else is contrary to ( T ) sound [ c ] doctrine ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	11	in accordance with ( U ) the gospel of the glory of ( V ) the blessed God ( W ) with which I have been entrusted . Christ Jesus Came to Save Sinners
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	12	I thank him ( X ) who has given me strength , Christ Jesus our Lord , because he judged me faithful , ( Y ) appointing me to his service ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	13	though formerly I was a blasphemer , ( Z ) persecutor , and insolent opponent . But ( AA ) I received mercy ( AB ) because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	14	and ( AC ) the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the ( AD ) faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	15	The saying is ( AE ) trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance , that Christ Jesus ( AF ) came into the world to save sinners , ( AG ) of whom I am the foremost .
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	16	But I received mercy for this reason , that in me , as the foremost , Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life .
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	17	To ( AH ) the King of the ages , ( AI ) immortal , ( AJ ) invisible , ( AK ) the only God , ( AL ) be honor and glory forever and ever . [ d ] Amen .
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	18	This charge ( AM ) I entrust to you , Timothy , my child , in accordance with ( AN ) the prophecies previously made about you , that by them you may ( AO ) wage the good warfare ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	19	( AP ) holding faith and a good conscience . By rejecting this , some have ( AQ ) made shipwreck of their faith ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	1	20	among whom are ( AR ) Hymenaeus and ( AS ) Alexander , whom I ( AT ) have handed over to Satan that they may learn not to ( AU ) blaspheme . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Timothy	2	2	( A ) for kings and all who are in high positions , that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life , godly and ( B ) dignified in every way .
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	3	This is good , and ( C ) it is pleasing in the sight of ( D ) God our Savior ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	4	The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	5	For ( H ) there is one God , and there is one mediator between God and men , the man [ a ] Christ Jesus ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	6	( I ) who gave himself as a ransom for all , which is ( J ) the testimony given ( K ) at the proper time .
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	7	( L ) For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( ( M ) I am telling the truth , I am not lying ) , ( N ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	8	I desire then that ( O ) in every place the men should pray , ( P ) lifting ( Q ) holy hands without anger or quarreling ;
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	9	likewise also ( R ) that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel , with modesty and self-control , not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	10	( S ) but with what is proper for women who profess godliness—with good works .
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	11	Let a woman learn quietly ( T ) with all submissiveness .
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	12	( U ) I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man ; rather , she is to remain quiet .
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	13	( V ) For Adam was formed first , ( W ) then Eve ;
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	14	and Adam was not deceived , but ( X ) the woman was deceived and became a transgressor .
ESV	1%20Timothy	2	15	Yet she will be saved through ( Y ) childbearing—if they continue in ( Z ) faith and love and holiness , with self-control . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Timothy	3	3	not a drunkard , not violent but ( H ) gentle , not quarrelsome , ( I ) not a lover of money .
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	2	Therefore ( C ) an overseer [ a ] must be above reproach , ( D ) the husband of one wife , [ b ] ( E ) sober-minded , self-controlled , respectable , ( F ) hospitable , ( G ) able to teach ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	4	He must manage his own household well , with all dignity ( J ) keeping his children submissive ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	5	for if someone does not know how to manage his own household , how will he care for ( K ) God 's church ?
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	6	He must not be a recent convert , or he may ( L ) become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil .
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	7	Moreover , he must be well thought of by ( M ) outsiders , so that he may not fall into disgrace , into ( N ) a snare of the devil . Qualifications for Deacons
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	8	( O ) Deacons likewise must be dignified , not double-tongued , [ c ] ( P ) not addicted to much wine , ( Q ) not greedy for dishonest gain .
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	9	They must ( R ) hold the mystery of the faith with ( S ) a clear conscience .
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	10	And ( T ) let them also be tested first ; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless .
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	11	( U ) Their wives likewise [ d ] must be dignified , not slanderers , but sober-minded , ( V ) faithful in all things .
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	12	-
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	13	For ( Y ) those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus . The Mystery of Godliness
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	14	I hope to come to you soon , but I am writing these things to you so that ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	15	if I delay , you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God , which is the church of the living God , a pillar and buttress of the truth .
ESV	1%20Timothy	3	16	Great indeed , we confess , is the mystery of godliness : ( Z ) He [ e ] was manifested in the flesh , vindicated [ f ] by the Spirit , [ g ] ( AA ) seen by angels , ( AB ) proclaimed among the nations , ( AC ) believed on in the world , ( AD ) taken up in glory . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Timothy	4	2	through the insincerity of ( D ) liars whose consciences are seared ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	3	( E ) who forbid marriage and ( F ) require abstinence from foods ( G ) that God created ( H ) to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth .
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	5	for it is made holy ( L ) by the word of God and prayer . A Good Servant of Christ Jesus
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	6	( M ) If you put these things before the brothers , [ a ] you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have ( N ) followed .
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	7	Have nothing to do with irreverent , ( O ) silly myths . Rather ( P ) train yourself for godliness ;
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	8	for while ( Q ) bodily training is of some value , godliness ( R ) is of value in every way , as ( S ) it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come .
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	9	The saying is ( T ) trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance .
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	10	For to this end we toil and strive , [ b ] because we have our hope set on the living God , ( U ) who is the Savior of all people , especially of those who believe .
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	11	Command and teach ( V ) these things .
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	12	( W ) Let no one despise you for your youth , but set the believers ( X ) an example in speech , in conduct , in love , in faith , in purity .
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	13	Until I come , devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture , to exhortation , to teaching .
ESV	1%20Timothy	4	14	( Y ) Do not neglect the gift you have , which was given you ( Z ) by prophecy when the council of elders ( AA ) laid their hands on you .

ESV	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy 5:9 Or a woman of one man The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	5	She ( F ) who is truly a widow , left all alone , has set her hope on God and ( G ) continues in supplications and prayers night and day ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	2	older women as mothers , younger women as sisters , in all purity .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	3	Honor widows ( C ) who are truly widows .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , let them first learn ( D ) to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents , for ( E ) this is pleasing in the sight of God .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	6	but ( H ) she who is self-indulgent is ( I ) dead even while she lives .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	7	( J ) Command these things as well , so that they may be without reproach .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	8	But if anyone does not provide for his relatives , and especially for ( K ) members of his household , he has ( L ) denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	9	Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age , having been ( M ) the wife of one husband , [ a ]
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	10	and having a reputation for good works : if she has brought up children , has ( N ) shown hospitality , ( O ) has washed the feet of the saints , has ( P ) cared for the afflicted , and has ( Q ) devoted herself to every good work .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	11	But refuse to enroll younger widows , for when ( R ) their passions draw them away from Christ , they desire to marry
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	12	and so incur condemnation for having abandoned their former faith .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	13	Besides that , they learn to be idlers , going about from house to house , and not only idlers , but also ( S ) gossips and ( T ) busybodies , saying what they should not .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	14	So I would have ( U ) younger widows marry , bear children , ( V ) manage their households , and ( W ) give the adversary no occasion for slander .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	15	( X ) For some have already strayed after Satan .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any believing woman has relatives who are widows , let her care for them . Let the church not be burdened , so that it may care for those ( Y ) who are truly widows .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	17	Let the elders ( Z ) who rule well be considered worthy of ( AA ) double honor , especially those who labor in preaching and teaching .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	18	For the Scripture says , ( AB ) “ You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain , ” and , ( AC ) “ The laborer deserves his wages. ”
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	19	Do not admit a charge against an elder except ( AD ) on the evidence of two or three witnesses .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	20	As for those who persist in sin , ( AE ) rebuke them in the presence of all , ( AF ) so that the rest may stand in fear .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	21	In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels ( AG ) I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging , ( AH ) doing nothing from partiality .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	22	( AI ) Do not be hasty in the ( AJ ) laying on of hands , nor ( AK ) take part in the sins of others ; keep yourself pure .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	23	( No longer drink only water , but ( AL ) use a little wine ( AM ) for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments . )
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	24	The sins of some people are conspicuous , going before them to judgment , but the sins of others appear later .
ESV	1%20Timothy	5	25	So also good works are conspicuous , and ( AN ) even those that are not can not remain hidden . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy 6:21 The Greek for you is plural The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	6	But ( N ) godliness ( O ) with contentment is great gain ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	2	Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are ( C ) brothers ; rather they must serve all the better since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved . False Teachers and True Contentment ( D ) Teach and urge these things .
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	3	If anyone ( E ) teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with ( F ) the sound [ b ] words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching ( G ) that accords with godliness ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	4	( H ) he is puffed up with conceit and ( I ) understands nothing . He has an unhealthy craving for ( J ) controversy and for ( K ) quarrels about words , which produce envy , dissension , slander , evil suspicions ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	5	and constant friction among people ( L ) who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth , ( M ) imagining that godliness is a means of gain .
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	7	for ( P ) we brought nothing into the world , and [ c ] we can not take anything out of the world .
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	8	But ( Q ) if we have food and clothing , with these we will be content .
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	9	But ( R ) those who desire to be rich fall into temptation , ( S ) into a snare , into many senseless and harmful desires that ( T ) plunge people into ruin and destruction .
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is a root of ( U ) all kinds of evils . It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs . Fight the Good Fight of Faith
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	11	But as for you , ( V ) O man of God , ( W ) flee these things . ( X ) Pursue righteousness , godliness , faith , love , steadfastness , gentleness .
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	12	( Y ) Fight the good fight of the faith . ( Z ) Take hold of the eternal life ( AA ) to which you were called and about which you made ( AB ) the good confession in the presence of many witnesses .
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	13	( AC ) I charge you in the presence of God , who gives life to all things , and of Christ Jesus , ( AD ) who in his testimony before [ d ] Pontius Pilate made ( AE ) the good confession ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	14	to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until ( AF ) the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	15	which he will display ( AG ) at the proper time—he who is ( AH ) the blessed and only Sovereign , ( AI ) the King of kings and Lord of lords ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	16	( AJ ) who alone has immortality , ( AK ) who dwells in ( AL ) unapproachable light , ( AM ) whom no one has ever seen or can see . To him be honor and eternal dominion . Amen .
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	17	As for the rich in ( AN ) this present age , charge them ( AO ) not to be haughty , nor ( AP ) to set their hopes on ( AQ ) the uncertainty of riches , but on God , ( AR ) who richly provides us with everything to enjoy .
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	18	They are to do good , ( AS ) to be rich in good works , to be generous and ( AT ) ready to share ,
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	19	thus ( AU ) storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future , so that they may ( AV ) take hold of ( AW ) that which is truly life .
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	20	O Timothy , guard the deposit entrusted to you . ( AX ) Avoid the ( AY ) irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called “ knowledge , ”
ESV	1%20Timothy	6	21	for by professing it some have swerved from the faith . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Timothy	1	2	Timothy 1:13 Or healthy The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , ( A ) an apostle of Christ Jesus ( B ) by the will of God according to ( C ) the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	3	( F ) I thank God ( G ) whom I serve , as did my ancestors , ( H ) with a clear conscience , as I remember you ( I ) constantly in my prayers night and day .
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	4	( J ) As I remember your tears , ( K ) I long to see you , that I may be filled with joy .
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	5	I am reminded of ( L ) your sincere faith , a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and ( M ) your mother Eunice and now , I am sure , dwells in you as well .
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	6	For this reason I remind you ( N ) to fan into flame the gift of God , which is in you through the laying on of my hands ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	7	for God gave us ( O ) a spirit not of fear but ( P ) of power and love and self-control .
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	8	Therefore ( Q ) do not be ashamed of ( R ) the testimony about our Lord , nor of ( S ) me his prisoner , but ( T ) share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	9	( U ) who saved us and ( V ) called us to [ a ] a holy calling , ( W ) not because of our works but because of ( X ) his own purpose and grace , which he gave us in Christ Jesus ( Y ) before the ages began , [ b ]
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	10	and which now has ( Z ) been manifested through ( AA ) the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus , ( AB ) who abolished death and ( AC ) brought life and ( AD ) immortality to light through the gospel ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	11	( AE ) for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	12	( AF ) which is why I suffer as I do . But ( AG ) I am not ashamed , for ( AH ) I know whom I have believed , and I am convinced that he is able to guard until ( AI ) that day ( AJ ) what has been entrusted to me . [ c ]
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	13	( AK ) Follow ( AL ) the pattern of ( AM ) the sound [ d ] words ( AN ) that you have heard from me , in ( AO ) the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	14	By the Holy Spirit ( AP ) who dwells within us , guard ( AQ ) the good deposit entrusted to you .
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	15	You are aware that ( AR ) all who are in Asia turned away from me , among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes .
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	16	May the Lord grant mercy to ( AS ) the household of Onesiphorus , for he often ( AT ) refreshed me and was not ashamed of ( AU ) my chains ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	17	but when he arrived in Rome ( AV ) he searched for me earnestly and found me—
ESV	2%20Timothy	1	18	may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on ( AW ) that day ! —and you well know all the service he ( AX ) rendered at Ephesus . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Timothy	2	2	Timothy 2:24 For the contextual rendering of the Greek word doulos , see Preface The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	3	( F ) Share in suffering as ( G ) a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	4	No soldier ( H ) gets entangled in civilian pursuits , since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	5	( I ) An athlete is not ( J ) crowned unless he competes according to the rules .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	6	It is ( K ) the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	7	Think over what I say , for the Lord will give you understanding in everything .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ , ( L ) risen from the dead , the ( M ) offspring of David , ( N ) as preached in my gospel ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	9	( O ) for which I am suffering , ( P ) bound with chains as a criminal . But ( Q ) the word of God is not bound !
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	10	Therefore ( R ) I endure everything for the sake of the elect , that they also may obtain ( S ) the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with ( T ) eternal glory .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	11	The saying is ( U ) trustworthy , for : ( V ) If we have died with him , we will also ( W ) live with him ;
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	12	( X ) if we endure , we will also reign with him ; ( Y ) if we deny him , he also will deny us ;
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	13	( Z ) if we are faithless , ( AA ) he remains faithful— for ( AB ) he can not deny himself . A Worker Approved by God
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	14	Remind them of these things , and ( AC ) charge them before God [ b ] ( AD ) not to quarrel about words , ( AE ) which does no good , but only ruins the hearers .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	15	Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved , [ c ] a worker ( AF ) who has no need to be ashamed , rightly handling the word of truth .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	16	But ( AG ) avoid ( AH ) irreverent babble , for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	17	and their talk will spread like gangrene . Among them are ( AI ) Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	18	who have swerved from the truth , ( AJ ) saying that the resurrection has already happened . They are upsetting the faith of some .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	19	But God 's firm foundation stands , bearing this seal : ( AK ) “ The Lord knows those who are his , ” and , “ Let everyone ( AL ) who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity. ”
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	20	Now in ( AM ) a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay , ( AN ) some for honorable use , some for dishonorable .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	21	Therefore , ( AO ) if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable , [ d ] he will be a vessel for honorable use , set apart as holy , useful to the master of the house , ( AP ) ready for every good work .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	22	So ( AQ ) flee ( AR ) youthful passions and pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace , along with ( AS ) those who call on the Lord ( AT ) from a pure heart .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	23	Have nothing to do with foolish , ignorant ( AU ) controversies ; you know that they breed quarrels .
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	24	And ( AV ) the Lord 's servant [ e ] must not be quarrelsome but ( AW ) kind to everyone , ( AX ) able to teach , patiently enduring evil ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	25	correcting his opponents ( AY ) with gentleness . God ( AZ ) may perhaps grant them repentance ( BA ) leading to a knowledge of the truth ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	2	26	and they may come to their senses and escape from ( BB ) the snare of the devil , after being captured by him to do his will . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Timothy	3	2	Timothy 3:17 That is , a messenger of God ( the phrase echoes a common Old Testament expression ) The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	3	( G ) heartless , unappeasable , slanderous , without self-control , brutal , ( H ) not loving good ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	4	treacherous , reckless , ( I ) swollen with conceit , ( J ) lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	5	having the appearance of godliness , but ( K ) denying its power . ( L ) Avoid such people .
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	6	For among them are ( M ) those who creep into households and capture weak women , burdened with sins and led astray by various passions ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	7	always learning and never able to ( N ) arrive at a knowledge of the truth .
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	8	Just as ( O ) Jannes and Jambres ( P ) opposed Moses , so these men also oppose the truth , ( Q ) men corrupted in mind and ( R ) disqualified regarding the faith .
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they will not get very far , for their folly will be plain to all , ( S ) as was that of those two men . All Scripture Is Breathed Out by God
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	10	( T ) You , however , have followed my teaching , my conduct , my aim in life , my faith , my patience , my love , my steadfastness ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	11	my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me ( U ) at Antioch , ( V ) at Iconium , and ( W ) at Lystra—which persecutions I endured ; yet ( X ) from them all ( Y ) the Lord rescued me .
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	12	Indeed , all who desire to ( Z ) live a godly life in Christ Jesus ( AA ) will be persecuted ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	13	while ( AB ) evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse , deceiving and ( AC ) being deceived .
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	14	But as for you , ( AD ) continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed , knowing from whom [ a ] you learned it
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	15	and how ( AE ) from childhood you have been acquainted with ( AF ) the sacred writings , ( AG ) which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	16	( AH ) All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for training in righteousness ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	3	17	that ( AI ) the man of God [ b ] may be complete , ( AJ ) equipped ( AK ) for every good work . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Timothy	4	2	Timothy 4:22 The Greek for you is plural The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	4	and ( H ) will turn away from listening to the truth and ( I ) wander off into myths .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	3	( F ) For the time is coming when people will not endure ( G ) sound [ a ] teaching , but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions ,
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	5	As for you , ( J ) always be sober-minded , ( K ) endure suffering , do the work of ( L ) an evangelist , ( M ) fulfill your ministry .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	6	For ( N ) I am already being poured out as a drink offering , and the time of my ( O ) departure has come .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	7	( P ) I have fought the good fight , ( Q ) I have finished the race , I have kept the faith .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	8	Henceforth there is ( R ) laid up for me ( S ) the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , ( T ) the righteous judge , will award to me on ( U ) that day , and not only to me but also to all ( V ) who have loved his appearing . Personal Instructions
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	9	( W ) Do your best to come to me soon .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	10	For ( X ) Demas , ( Y ) in love with ( Z ) this present world , ( AA ) has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , [ b ] ( AB ) Titus to Dalmatia .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	11	( AC ) Luke alone is with me . Get ( AD ) Mark and bring him with you , for he is very useful to me for ministry .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	12	( AE ) Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	13	When you come , bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas , also the books , and above all the parchments .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	14	( AF ) Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm ; ( AG ) the Lord will repay him according to his deeds .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	15	Beware of him yourself , for he strongly opposed our message .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	16	At my first defense no one came to stand by me , but all deserted me . ( AH ) May it not be charged against them !
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	17	But ( AI ) the Lord stood by me and ( AJ ) strengthened me , so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and ( AK ) all the Gentiles might hear it . So ( AL ) I was rescued ( AM ) from the lion 's mouth .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom . ( AN ) To him be the glory forever and ever . Amen . Final Greetings
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	19	Greet ( AO ) Prisca and Aquila , and ( AP ) the household of Onesiphorus .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	20	Erastus remained at Corinth , and I left ( AQ ) Trophimus , who was ill , at Miletus .
ESV	2%20Timothy	4	21	( AR ) Do your best to come before winter . Eubulus sends greetings to you , as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers . [ c ]

ESV	Titus	1	1	Paul , a servant [ a ] of God and ( A ) an apostle of Jesus Christ , for the sake of the faith of God 's elect and ( B ) their knowledge of the truth , ( C ) which accords with godliness ,
ESV	Titus	1	2	( D ) in hope of eternal life , which God , ( E ) who never lies , ( F ) promised ( G ) before the ages began [ b ]
ESV	Titus	1	3	and ( H ) at the proper time manifested in his word [ c ] ( I ) through the preaching ( J ) with which I have been entrusted ( K ) by the command of God our Savior ;
ESV	Titus	1	4	To Titus , ( L ) my true child in ( M ) a common faith : ( N ) Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior . Qualifications for Elders
ESV	Titus	1	5	( O ) This is why I left you in Crete , so that you might put what remained into order , and ( P ) appoint elders in every town as I directed you—
ESV	Titus	1	6	( Q ) if anyone is above reproach , the husband of one wife , [ d ] and his children are believers [ e ] and not open to the charge of ( R ) debauchery or insubordination .
ESV	Titus	1	7	For an overseer , [ f ] ( S ) as God 's steward , must be above reproach . He must not ( T ) be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent ( U ) or greedy for gain ,
ESV	Titus	1	8	but hospitable , a lover of good , self-controlled , upright , holy , ( V ) and disciplined .
ESV	Titus	1	9	He must ( W ) hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught , so that he may be able to give instruction in ( X ) sound [ g ] doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it .
ESV	Titus	1	10	For there are many who are insubordinate , ( Y ) empty talkers and deceivers , especially those of ( Z ) the circumcision party . [ h ]
ESV	Titus	1	11	They must be silenced , since ( AA ) they are upsetting whole families by teaching ( AB ) for shameful gain what they ought not to teach .
ESV	Titus	1	12	( AC ) One of the Cretans , [ i ] a prophet of their own , said , “ Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , lazy gluttons. ” [ j ]

ESV	Titus	1	14	( AG ) not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and ( AH ) the commands of people ( AI ) who turn away from the truth .
ESV	Titus	1	15	( AJ ) To the pure , all things are pure , but to the defiled and ( AK ) unbelieving , nothing is pure ; but both ( AL ) their minds and their consciences are defiled .
ESV	Titus	1	16	( AM ) They profess to know God , but they ( AN ) deny him by their works . They are detestable , disobedient , ( AO ) unfit for any good work .

ESV	Titus	2	2	Older men are to be sober-minded , dignified , self-controlled , ( B ) sound in faith , in love , and in steadfastness .
ESV	Titus	2	3	( C ) Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior , ( D ) not slanderers ( E ) or slaves to much wine . They are to teach what is good ,
ESV	Titus	2	4	and so train the young women to love their husbands and children ,
ESV	Titus	2	5	to be self-controlled , ( F ) pure , ( G ) working at home , kind , and ( H ) submissive to their own husbands , ( I ) that the word of God may not be reviled .
ESV	Titus	2	6	Likewise , urge ( J ) the younger men to be self-controlled .
ESV	Titus	2	7	Show yourself in all respects to be ( K ) a model of good works , and in your teaching ( L ) show integrity , ( M ) dignity ,
ESV	Titus	2	8	and ( N ) sound speech that can not be condemned , ( O ) so that an opponent may be put to shame , having nothing evil to say about us .
ESV	Titus	2	9	( P ) Bondservants [ b ] are to be submissive to their own masters ( Q ) in everything ; they are to be well-pleasing , not argumentative ,
ESV	Titus	2	10	not pilfering , ( R ) but showing all good faith , ( S ) so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior .
ESV	Titus	2	11	For ( T ) the grace of God ( U ) has appeared , bringing salvation ( V ) for all people ,
ESV	Titus	2	12	training us to renounce ungodliness and ( W ) worldly passions , and ( X ) to live self-controlled , upright , and godly lives in ( Y ) the present age ,
ESV	Titus	2	13	( Z ) waiting for our blessed ( AA ) hope , the ( AB ) appearing of the glory of our great ( AC ) God and Savior Jesus Christ ,
ESV	Titus	2	14	( AD ) who gave himself for us to ( AE ) redeem us from all lawlessness and ( AF ) to purify for himself ( AG ) a people for his own possession who are ( AH ) zealous for good works .
ESV	Titus	2	15	Declare these things ; exhort and ( AI ) rebuke with all authority . ( AJ ) Let no one disregard you . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Titus	3	3	For ( F ) we ourselves were once foolish , disobedient , led astray , slaves to various passions and pleasures , passing our days in malice and envy , hated by others and hating one another .
ESV	Titus	3	2	( C ) to speak evil of no one , ( D ) to avoid quarreling , to be gentle , and ( E ) to show perfect courtesy toward all people .
ESV	Titus	3	4	But when ( G ) the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared ,
ESV	Titus	3	5	he saved us , ( H ) not because of works done by us in righteousness , but ( I ) according to his own mercy , by ( J ) the washing of regeneration and ( K ) renewal of the Holy Spirit ,
ESV	Titus	3	6	whom he ( L ) poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
ESV	Titus	3	7	so that ( M ) being justified by his grace we might become ( N ) heirs ( O ) according to the hope of eternal life .
ESV	Titus	3	8	The saying is ( P ) trustworthy , and I want you to insist on these things , so that those who have believed in God may be careful ( Q ) to devote themselves to good works . These things are excellent and profitable for people .
ESV	Titus	3	9	But ( R ) avoid foolish ( S ) controversies , ( T ) genealogies , dissensions , and quarrels about the law , for ( U ) they are unprofitable and worthless .
ESV	Titus	3	10	As for a person who stirs up division , ( V ) after warning him once and then twice , ( W ) have nothing more to do with him ,
ESV	Titus	3	11	knowing that such a person is warped and sinful ; he is self-condemned . Final Instructions and Greetings
ESV	Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas or ( X ) Tychicus to you , do your best to come to me ( Y ) at Nicopolis , for I have decided to spend the winter there .
ESV	Titus	3	13	Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and ( Z ) Apollos on their way ; see that they lack nothing .
ESV	Titus	3	14	And let our people learn ( AA ) to devote themselves to good works , so as to help cases of urgent need , and not ( AB ) be unfruitful .
ESV	Titus	3	15	All who are with me send greetings to you . Greet those who love us in the faith . ( AC ) Grace be with you all . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Philemon	1	4	( G ) I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers ,

ESV	Philemon	1	6	and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full ( J ) knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ . [ a ]
ESV	Philemon	1	7	For I have derived much joy and ( K ) comfort from your love , my brother , because the hearts of the saints ( L ) have been refreshed through you . Paul 's Plea for Onesimus
ESV	Philemon	1	8	Accordingly , ( M ) though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do ( N ) what is required ,
ESV	Philemon	1	9	yet for love 's sake I prefer to appeal to you—I , Paul , an old man and now ( O ) a prisoner also for Christ Jesus—

ESV	Philemon	1	13	I would have been glad to keep him with me , in order that he might serve me ( S ) on your behalf ( T ) during my imprisonment for the gospel ,
ESV	Philemon	1	14	but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be ( U ) by compulsion but of your own accord .
ESV	Philemon	1	15	For this perhaps is why ( V ) he was parted from you for a while , that you might have him back forever ,
ESV	Philemon	1	16	( W ) no longer as a bondservant [ c ] but more than a bondservant , as ( X ) a beloved brother—especially to me , but how much more to you , ( Y ) both in the flesh and in the Lord .
ESV	Philemon	1	17	So if you consider me ( Z ) your partner , receive him as you would receive me .
ESV	Philemon	1	18	If he has wronged you at all , or owes you anything , charge that to my account .

ESV	Hebrews	1	1	Long ago , at many times and ( A ) in many ways , God spoke to our fathers by the prophets ,
ESV	Hebrews	1	2	but ( B ) in these last days ( C ) he has spoken to us by ( D ) his Son , whom he appointed ( E ) the heir of all things , ( F ) through whom also he created ( G ) the world .
ESV	Hebrews	1	3	He is the radiance of the glory of God and ( H ) the exact imprint of his nature , and he upholds the universe by the word of his power . ( I ) After making purification for sins , ( J ) he sat down ( K ) at the right hand of the Majesty on high ,
ESV	Hebrews	1	4	having become as much superior to angels as the name ( L ) he has inherited is more excellent than theirs .
ESV	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did God ever say , ( M ) “ You are my Son , today I have begotten you ” ? Or again , ( N ) “ I will be to him a father , and he shall be to me a son ” ?
ESV	Hebrews	1	6	And again , when he brings ( O ) the firstborn into the world , he says , ( P ) “ Let all God 's angels worship him. ”
ESV	Hebrews	1	7	Of the angels he says , ( Q ) “ He makes his angels winds , and his ministers a flame of fire. ”
ESV	Hebrews	1	8	But of the Son he says , ( R ) “ Your throne , O God , is forever and ever , the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom .
ESV	Hebrews	1	9	You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness ; therefore God , your God , ( S ) has anointed you with ( T ) the oil of gladness beyond your companions. ”
ESV	Hebrews	1	10	And , ( U ) “ You , Lord , laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning , and the heavens are the work of your hands ;
ESV	Hebrews	1	11	they will perish , but you remain ; they will all wear out like a garment ,
ESV	Hebrews	1	12	like a robe you will roll them up , like a garment they will be changed . [ a ] But you are ( V ) the same , and your years will have no end. ”
ESV	Hebrews	1	13	And to which of the angels has he ever said ,
ESV	Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits ( Y ) sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to ( Z ) inherit salvation ? Footnotes - Hebrews 1:12 Some manuscripts omit like a garment The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Hebrews	2	5	For it was not to angels that God subjected the world ( M ) to come , of which we are speaking .
ESV	Hebrews	2	6	It has been testified somewhere , ( N ) “ What is man , that you are mindful of him , or the son of man , that you care for him ?
ESV	Hebrews	2	7	You made him for a little while lower than the angels ; you have crowned him with glory and honor , [ a ]
ESV	Hebrews	2	8	putting everything in subjection under his feet. ” Now in putting everything in subjection to him , he left nothing outside his control . At present , ( O ) we do not yet see everything in subjection to him .
ESV	Hebrews	2	9	But we see him ( P ) who for a little while was made lower than the angels , namely Jesus , ( Q ) crowned with glory and honor ( R ) because of the suffering of death , so that by the grace of God he might ( S ) taste death ( T ) for everyone .
ESV	Hebrews	2	10	For it ( U ) was fitting that he , ( V ) for whom and by whom all things exist , in bringing many sons ( W ) to glory , should make the ( X ) founder of their salvation ( Y ) perfect through suffering .
ESV	Hebrews	2	11	For ( Z ) he who sanctifies and ( AA ) those who are sanctified ( AB ) all have one source . [ b ] That is why he is not ashamed to call them ( AC ) brothers , [ c ]

ESV	Hebrews	2	13	And again , ( AF ) “ I will put my trust in him. ” And again ,
ESV	Hebrews	2	14	Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood , he himself likewise ( AI ) partook of the same things , that ( AJ ) through death he might ( AK ) destroy ( AL ) the one who has the power of death , that is , the devil ,
ESV	Hebrews	2	15	and deliver all those who ( AM ) through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery .
ESV	Hebrews	2	16	For surely it is not angels that he helps , but he ( AN ) helps the offspring of Abraham .
ESV	Hebrews	2	17	Therefore he had ( AO ) to be made like his brothers in every respect , ( AP ) so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest ( AQ ) in the service of God , to make propitiation for the sins of the people .
ESV	Hebrews	2	18	For because he himself has suffered ( AR ) when tempted , he is able to help those who are being tempted .

ESV	Hebrews	3	9	where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for ( L ) forty years .

ESV	Hebrews	4	4	For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way : ( D ) “ And God rested on the seventh day from all his works. ”
ESV	Hebrews	4	2	For good news came to us just as to them , but the message they heard did not benefit them , because ( B ) they were not united by faith with those who listened . [ a ]
ESV	Hebrews	4	3	For we who have believed enter that rest , as he has said , ( C ) “ As I swore in my wrath , ‘ They shall not enter my rest , ’ ” although his works were finished from the foundation of the world .
ESV	Hebrews	4	5	And again in this passage he said , ( E ) “ They shall not enter my rest. ”
ESV	Hebrews	4	6	Since therefore it remains for some to enter it , and those who formerly received the good news ( F ) failed to enter because of disobedience ,
ESV	Hebrews	4	7	again he appoints a certain day , “ Today , ” saying through David so long afterward , in the words already quoted , ( G ) “ Today , if you hear his voice , do not harden your hearts. ”
ESV	Hebrews	4	8	For if Joshua had given them rest , God [ b ] would not have spoken of another day later on .
ESV	Hebrews	4	9	So then , there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God ,
ESV	Hebrews	4	10	for whoever has entered God 's rest has also ( H ) rested from his works as God did from his .
ESV	Hebrews	4	11	Let us therefore strive to enter that rest , so ( I ) that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience .
ESV	Hebrews	4	12	For ( J ) the word of God is living and ( K ) active , ( L ) sharper than any ( M ) two-edged sword , piercing to the division of soul and of spirit , of joints and of marrow , and ( N ) discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart .
ESV	Hebrews	4	13	And ( O ) no creature is hidden from his sight , but all are ( P ) naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account . Jesus the Great High Priest
ESV	Hebrews	4	14	Since then we have ( Q ) a great high priest ( R ) who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , ( S ) let us hold fast our confession .
ESV	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have a high priest ( T ) who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses , but one who in every respect has been ( U ) tempted as we are , ( V ) yet without sin .
ESV	Hebrews	4	16	( W ) Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need .

ESV	Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ ( I ) did not exalt himself to be made a high priest , but was appointed by him who said to him , ( J ) “ You are my Son , today I have begotten you ” ;
ESV	Hebrews	5	2	( D ) He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward , since he himself ( E ) is beset with weakness .
ESV	Hebrews	5	3	Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins ( F ) just as he does for those of the people .
ESV	Hebrews	5	4	And ( G ) no one takes this honor for himself , but only when called by God , ( H ) just as Aaron was .
ESV	Hebrews	5	6	as he says also in another place , ( K ) “ You are a priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek. ”
ESV	Hebrews	5	7	In the days of his flesh , ( L ) Jesus [ a ] offered up prayers and supplications , ( M ) with loud cries and tears , to him ( N ) who was able to save him from death , and ( O ) he was heard because of his reverence .
ESV	Hebrews	5	8	Although ( P ) he was a son , ( Q ) he learned obedience through what he suffered .
ESV	Hebrews	5	9	And ( R ) being made perfect , he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him ,
ESV	Hebrews	5	10	being designated by God a high priest ( S ) after the order of Melchizedek . Warning Against Apostasy
ESV	Hebrews	5	11	About this we have much to say , and it is ( T ) hard to explain , since you have become dull of hearing .
ESV	Hebrews	5	12	For though by this time you ought to be teachers , you need someone to teach you again ( U ) the basic principles of the oracles of God . You need ( V ) milk , not solid food ,
ESV	Hebrews	5	13	for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness , since he is ( W ) a child .

ESV	Hebrews	6	6	and ( M ) then have fallen away , to restore them again to repentance , since ( N ) they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt .
ESV	Hebrews	6	2	and of ( D ) instruction about washings , [ a ] ( E ) the laying on of hands , ( F ) the resurrection of the dead , and ( G ) eternal judgment .
ESV	Hebrews	6	3	And this we will do ( H ) if God permits .
ESV	Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible , in the case of those ( I ) who have once been enlightened , who have tasted ( J ) the heavenly gift , and ( K ) have shared in the Holy Spirit ,
ESV	Hebrews	6	5	and ( L ) have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come ,
ESV	Hebrews	6	7	For ( O ) land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it , and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated , receives a blessing from God .
ESV	Hebrews	6	8	But ( P ) if it bears thorns and thistles , it is worthless and near to being cursed , ( Q ) and its end is to be burned .
ESV	Hebrews	6	9	Though we speak in this way , yet in your case , beloved , we feel sure of better things—things that belong to salvation .
ESV	Hebrews	6	10	For ( R ) God is not unjust so as to overlook ( S ) your work and the love that you have shown for his name in ( T ) serving the saints , as you still do .
ESV	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance ( U ) of hope until the end ,
ESV	Hebrews	6	12	so that you may not be sluggish , but ( V ) imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises . The Certainty of God 's Promise
ESV	Hebrews	6	13	For when God made a promise to Abraham , since he had no one greater by whom to swear , ( W ) he swore by himself ,
ESV	Hebrews	6	14	saying , ( X ) “ Surely I will bless you and multiply you. ”
ESV	Hebrews	6	15	And thus Abraham , [ b ] ( Y ) having patiently waited , obtained the promise .
ESV	Hebrews	6	16	For people swear by something greater than themselves , and in all their disputes ( Z ) an oath is final for confirmation .
ESV	Hebrews	6	17	So when God desired to show more convincingly to ( AA ) the heirs of the promise ( AB ) the unchangeable character of his purpose , ( AC ) he guaranteed it with an oath ,
ESV	Hebrews	6	18	so that by two unchangeable things , in which ( AD ) it is impossible for God to lie , we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope ( AE ) set before us .
ESV	Hebrews	6	19	We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul , a hope that enters into ( AF ) the inner place behind the curtain ,
ESV	Hebrews	6	20	where Jesus has gone ( AG ) as a forerunner on our behalf , ( AH ) having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek .

ESV	Hebrews	7	7	It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior .
ESV	Hebrews	7	2	and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything . He is first , by translation of his name , king of righteousness , and then he is also king of Salem , that is , king of peace .
ESV	Hebrews	7	3	He is without father or mother ( D ) or genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever .
ESV	Hebrews	7	4	See how great this man was to whom Abraham ( E ) the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils !
ESV	Hebrews	7	5	And ( F ) those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people , that is , from their brothers , [ a ] though these also are descended from Abraham .
ESV	Hebrews	7	6	But this man ( G ) who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed ( H ) him who had the promises .
ESV	Hebrews	7	8	In the one case tithes are received by mortal men , but in the other case , by one ( I ) of whom it is testified that ( J ) he lives .
ESV	Hebrews	7	9	One might even say that Levi himself , who receives tithes , paid tithes through Abraham ,
ESV	Hebrews	7	10	for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him . Jesus Compared to Melchizedek
ESV	Hebrews	7	11	( K ) Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood ( for under it the people received the law ) , what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek , rather than one named after the order of Aaron ?
ESV	Hebrews	7	12	For when there is a change in the priesthood , there is necessarily a change in the law as well .
ESV	Hebrews	7	13	For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe , from which no one has ever served at the altar .
ESV	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord was descended ( L ) from Judah , and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests .
ESV	Hebrews	7	15	This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek ,
ESV	Hebrews	7	16	who has become a priest , not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent , but by the power of an indestructible life .
ESV	Hebrews	7	17	For it is witnessed of him , ( M ) “ You are a priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek. ”
ESV	Hebrews	7	18	For on the one hand , a former commandment is set aside ( N ) because of its weakness and uselessness
ESV	Hebrews	7	19	( for ( O ) the law made nothing perfect ) ; but on the other hand , ( P ) a better hope is introduced , through which ( Q ) we draw near to God .
ESV	Hebrews	7	20	And it was not without an oath . For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath ,
ESV	Hebrews	7	21	but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him : ( R ) “ The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind , ‘ You are a priest forever. ’ ”
ESV	Hebrews	7	22	This makes Jesus the guarantor of ( S ) a better covenant .
ESV	Hebrews	7	23	The former priests were many in number , because they were prevented by death from continuing in office ,
ESV	Hebrews	7	24	but he holds his priesthood permanently , because he continues ( T ) forever .
ESV	Hebrews	7	25	Consequently , he is able to save to the uttermost [ b ] ( U ) those who draw near to God ( V ) through him , since he always lives ( W ) to make intercession for them .
ESV	Hebrews	7	26	For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest , ( X ) holy , innocent , unstained , ( Y ) separated from sinners , and ( Z ) exalted above the heavens .
ESV	Hebrews	7	27	He has no need , like those high priests , to offer sacrifices daily , ( AA ) first for his own sins and then for those of the people , since he did this ( AB ) once for all when he offered up himself .
ESV	Hebrews	7	28	For the law appoints men ( AC ) in their weakness as high priests , but the word of the oath , which came later than the law , appoints a Son who has been made ( AD ) perfect forever .

ESV	Hebrews	9	18	Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated ( AP ) without blood .
ESV	Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people , he took ( AQ ) the blood of calves and goats , ( AR ) with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,

ESV	Hebrews	9	23	Thus it was necessary for ( AV ) the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites , but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
ESV	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ has entered , not into holy places ( AW ) made with hands , which are copies of the true things , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God ( AX ) on our behalf .
ESV	Hebrews	9	25	Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly , as ( AY ) the high priest enters ( AZ ) the holy places every year with blood not his own ,
ESV	Hebrews	9	26	for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world . But as it is , ( BA ) he has appeared ( BB ) once for all ( BC ) at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .

ESV	Hebrews	10	10	And by that will ( K ) we have been sanctified through the offering of ( L ) the body of Jesus Christ ( M ) once for all .
ESV	Hebrews	10	2	Otherwise , would they not have ceased to be offered , since the worshipers , having once been cleansed , would no longer have any consciousness of sins ?
ESV	Hebrews	10	3	But ( D ) in these sacrifices ( E ) there is a reminder of sins every year .
ESV	Hebrews	10	4	For ( F ) it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
ESV	Hebrews	10	5	Consequently , ( G ) when Christ [ a ] came into the world , he said , ( H ) “ Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired , but a body have you prepared for me ;
ESV	Hebrews	10	6	in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure .
ESV	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , ‘ Behold , I have come to do your will , O God , as it is written of me in the scroll of the book. ’ ”
ESV	Hebrews	10	8	When he said above , “ You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in ( I ) sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings ” ( these are offered according to the law ) ,
ESV	Hebrews	10	9	then he added , ( J ) “ Behold , I have come to do your will. ” He does away with the first in order to establish the second .
ESV	Hebrews	10	11	And every priest stands ( N ) daily at his service , ( O ) offering repeatedly the same sacrifices , ( P ) which can never take away sins .
ESV	Hebrews	10	12	But when Christ [ b ] had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins , he ( Q ) sat down at the right hand of God ,
ESV	Hebrews	10	13	waiting from that time ( R ) until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet .
ESV	Hebrews	10	14	For by a single offering ( S ) he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified .
ESV	Hebrews	10	15	And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us ; for after saying ,
ESV	Hebrews	10	16	( T ) “ This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , declares the Lord : I will put my laws on their hearts , and write them on their minds , ”
ESV	Hebrews	10	17	then he adds , ( U ) “ I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more. ”
ESV	Hebrews	10	18	Where there is forgiveness of these , there is no longer any offering for sin . The Full Assurance of Faith
ESV	Hebrews	10	19	( V ) Therefore , brothers , [ c ] since we have confidence to enter ( W ) the holy places by the blood of Jesus ,
ESV	Hebrews	10	20	by ( X ) the new and living way that he opened for us through ( Y ) the curtain , that is , through his flesh ,
ESV	Hebrews	10	21	and since we have ( Z ) a great priest over the house of God ,
ESV	Hebrews	10	22	let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , with our hearts ( AA ) sprinkled clean ( AB ) from an evil conscience and our bodies ( AC ) washed with pure water .
ESV	Hebrews	10	23	( AD ) Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering , for ( AE ) he who promised is faithful .
ESV	Hebrews	10	24	And ( AF ) let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works ,
ESV	Hebrews	10	25	( AG ) not neglecting to meet together , as is the habit of some , but encouraging one another , and ( AH ) all the more as you see ( AI ) the Day drawing near .
ESV	Hebrews	10	26	For ( AJ ) if we go on sinning deliberately ( AK ) after receiving the knowledge of the truth , ( AL ) there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins ,
ESV	Hebrews	10	27	( AM ) but a fearful expectation of judgment , and ( AN ) a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries .
ESV	Hebrews	10	28	( AO ) Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy ( AP ) on the evidence of two or three witnesses .
ESV	Hebrews	10	29	How much worse punishment , do you think , will be deserved by the one ( AQ ) who has trampled underfoot the Son of God , and has profaned ( AR ) the blood of the covenant ( AS ) by which he was sanctified , and has ( AT ) outraged the Spirit of grace ?
ESV	Hebrews	10	30	For we know him who said , ( AU ) “ Vengeance is mine ; I will repay. ” And again , ( AV ) “ The Lord will judge his people. ”
ESV	Hebrews	10	31	( AW ) It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
ESV	Hebrews	10	32	But recall the former days when , after ( AX ) you were enlightened , you endured ( AY ) a hard struggle with sufferings ,
ESV	Hebrews	10	33	sometimes being ( AZ ) publicly exposed to reproach and affliction , and sometimes being partners with those so treated .
ESV	Hebrews	10	34	For ( BA ) you had compassion on those in prison , and ( BB ) you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property , since you knew that you yourselves had ( BC ) a better possession and an abiding one .
ESV	Hebrews	10	35	Therefore do not throw away your confidence , which has ( BD ) a great reward .
ESV	Hebrews	10	36	For ( BE ) you have need of endurance , so that ( BF ) when you have done the will of God you may ( BG ) receive what is promised .
ESV	Hebrews	10	37	For , ( BH ) “ Yet a little while , and ( BI ) the coming one will come and will not delay ;
ESV	Hebrews	10	38	( BJ ) but my righteous one shall live by faith , and if he shrinks back , my soul has no pleasure in him. ”

ESV	Hebrews	11	11	By faith ( V ) Sarah herself received power to conceive , even when she was past the age , since she considered ( W ) him faithful who had promised .
ESV	Hebrews	11	2	For by it the people of old received their commendation .
ESV	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the universe was created by ( B ) the word of God , so that what is seen was not made out of ( C ) things that are visible .
ESV	Hebrews	11	4	By faith ( D ) Abel offered to God ( E ) a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain , through which he was commended as righteous , God commending him by accepting his gifts . And ( F ) through his faith , though he died , he ( G ) still speaks .
ESV	Hebrews	11	5	By faith ( H ) Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death , and he was not found , because God had taken him . Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God .
ESV	Hebrews	11	6	And without faith it is impossible to please him , for whoever would draw near to God ( I ) must believe that he exists and ( J ) that he rewards those who seek him .
ESV	Hebrews	11	7	By faith ( K ) Noah , being warned by God concerning ( L ) events as yet unseen , in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household . By this he condemned the world and became an heir of ( M ) the righteousness that comes by faith .

ESV	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he went to live in ( P ) the land of promise , as in a foreign land , ( Q ) living in tents ( R ) with Isaac and Jacob , heirs with him of the same promise .
ESV	Hebrews	11	10	For he was looking forward to ( S ) the city that has ( T ) foundations , ( U ) whose designer and builder is God .
ESV	Hebrews	11	12	Therefore from one man , and ( X ) him as good as dead , were born descendants ( Y ) as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore .
ESV	Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith , ( Z ) not having received the things promised , but ( AA ) having seen them and greeted them from afar , and ( AB ) having acknowledged that they were ( AC ) strangers and exiles on the earth .
ESV	Hebrews	11	14	For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland .
ESV	Hebrews	11	15	If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out , ( AD ) they would have had opportunity to return .
ESV	Hebrews	11	16	But as it is , they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed ( AE ) to be called their God , for ( AF ) he has prepared for them a city .
ESV	Hebrews	11	17	By faith ( AG ) Abraham , when he was tested , offered up Isaac , and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son ,
ESV	Hebrews	11	18	of whom it was said , ( AH ) “ Through Isaac shall your offspring be named. ”

ESV	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , when he was grown up , ( AP ) refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter ,
ESV	Hebrews	11	25	( AQ ) choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy ( AR ) the fleeting pleasures of sin .
ESV	Hebrews	11	26	( AS ) He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt , for he was looking to ( AT ) the reward .
ESV	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he ( AU ) left Egypt , ( AV ) not being afraid of the anger of the king , for he endured ( AW ) as seeing him who is invisible .
ESV	Hebrews	11	28	By faith ( AX ) he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood , so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them .
ESV	Hebrews	11	29	By faith ( AY ) the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land , but the Egyptians , when they attempted to do the same , were drowned .

ESV	Hebrews	11	31	By faith ( BA ) Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient , because she ( BB ) had given a friendly welcome to the spies .
ESV	Hebrews	11	32	And what more shall I say ? For time would fail me to tell of ( BC ) Gideon , ( BD ) Barak , ( BE ) Samson , ( BF ) Jephthah , of ( BG ) David and ( BH ) Samuel and the prophets—
ESV	Hebrews	11	33	who through faith conquered kingdoms , enforced justice , obtained promises , ( BI ) stopped the mouths of lions ,
ESV	Hebrews	11	34	( BJ ) quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , were made strong out of weakness , ( BK ) became mighty in war , ( BL ) put foreign armies to flight .

ESV	Hebrews	11	38	of whom the world was not worthy— ( BR ) wandering about in deserts and mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
ESV	Hebrews	11	39	And all these , ( BS ) though commended through their faith , ( BT ) did not receive what was promised ,

ESV	Hebrews	12	12	Therefore ( T ) lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees ,
ESV	Hebrews	12	2	looking to Jesus , the founder and perfecter of our faith , ( E ) who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising ( F ) the shame , and ( G ) is seated at the right hand of the throne of God . Do Not Grow Weary
ESV	Hebrews	12	3	( H ) Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself , so that you may not grow weary or ( I ) fainthearted .
ESV	Hebrews	12	4	In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood .
ESV	Hebrews	12	5	And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons ? ( J ) “ My son , ( K ) do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord , nor be weary when reproved by him .
ESV	Hebrews	12	6	For ( L ) the Lord disciplines the one he loves , and chastises every son whom he receives. ”
ESV	Hebrews	12	7	It is for discipline that you have to endure . ( M ) God is treating you as sons . For what son is there whom his father does not discipline ?
ESV	Hebrews	12	8	If you are left without discipline , ( N ) in which all have participated , then you are illegitimate children and not sons .
ESV	Hebrews	12	9	Besides this , we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them . Shall we not much more be subject to ( O ) the Father of spirits ( P ) and live ?
ESV	Hebrews	12	10	For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them , but he disciplines us for our good , ( Q ) that we may share his holiness .
ESV	Hebrews	12	11	( R ) For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant , but later it yields ( S ) the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it .
ESV	Hebrews	12	13	and ( U ) make straight paths for your feet , so that what is lame may not be put out of joint ( V ) but rather be healed .
ESV	Hebrews	12	14	( W ) Strive for peace with everyone , and for the ( X ) holiness ( Y ) without which no one will see the Lord .
ESV	Hebrews	12	15	See to it that no one ( Z ) fails to obtain the grace of God ; that no ( AA ) “ root of bitterness ” springs up and causes trouble , and by it many become defiled ;
ESV	Hebrews	12	16	that no one is ( AB ) sexually immoral or unholy like Esau , who sold his birthright for a single meal .
ESV	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that ( AC ) afterward , when he desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no chance to repent , though he sought it with tears . A Kingdom That Can not Be Shaken
ESV	Hebrews	12	18	For you have not come to ( AD ) what may be touched , a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest
ESV	Hebrews	12	19	and ( AE ) the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words ( AF ) made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them .
ESV	Hebrews	12	20	For they could not endure the order that was given , ( AG ) “ If even a beast touches the mountain , it shall be stoned. ”
ESV	Hebrews	12	21	Indeed , ( AH ) so terrifying was the sight that Moses said , “ I tremble with fear. ”
ESV	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to ( AI ) Mount Zion and to the city of the living God , ( AJ ) the heavenly Jerusalem , and to ( AK ) innumerable angels in festal gathering ,
ESV	Hebrews	12	23	and to ( AL ) the assembly [ a ] of the firstborn who are ( AM ) enrolled in heaven , and to ( AN ) God , the judge of all , and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect ,
ESV	Hebrews	12	24	and to Jesus , ( AO ) the mediator of a new covenant , and to ( AP ) the sprinkled blood ( AQ ) that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel .
ESV	Hebrews	12	25	See that you do not refuse him who is speaking . For ( AR ) if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth , much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven .
ESV	Hebrews	12	26	At that time ( AS ) his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised , ( AT ) “ Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens. ”
ESV	Hebrews	12	27	This phrase , “ Yet once more , ” indicates ( AU ) the removal of things that are shaken—that is , things that have been made—in order that the things that can not be shaken may remain .
ESV	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore let us be grateful for receiving ( AV ) a kingdom that can not be shaken , and thus ( AW ) let us offer to God acceptable worship , with reverence and awe ,

ESV	Hebrews	13	2	( B ) Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers , for thereby ( C ) some have entertained angels unawares .
ESV	Hebrews	13	3	( D ) Remember those who are in prison , as though in prison with them , and those who are mistreated , since you also are in the body .
ESV	Hebrews	13	4	( E ) Let marriage be held in honor among all , and let the marriage bed be undefiled , for God will judge ( F ) the sexually immoral and adulterous .
ESV	Hebrews	13	5	Keep your life ( G ) free from love of money , and ( H ) be content with what you have , for he has said , ( I ) “ I will never leave you nor forsake you. ”
ESV	Hebrews	13	6	So we can confidently say ,
ESV	Hebrews	13	7	Remember ( L ) your leaders , those who spoke to you the word of God . Consider the outcome of their way of life , and ( M ) imitate their faith .
ESV	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is ( N ) the same yesterday and today and forever .
ESV	Hebrews	13	9	Do not be ( O ) led away by diverse and strange teachings , for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace , ( P ) not by foods , which have not benefited those devoted to them .
ESV	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar ( Q ) from which those who serve the tent [ a ] have no right to eat .
ESV	Hebrews	13	11	For ( R ) the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned ( S ) outside the camp .
ESV	Hebrews	13	12	So Jesus also ( T ) suffered ( U ) outside the gate in order to sanctify the people ( V ) through his own blood .
ESV	Hebrews	13	14	For ( X ) here we have no lasting city , but we seek the city that is to come .
ESV	Hebrews	13	15	( Y ) Through him then let us continually offer up ( Z ) a sacrifice of praise to God , that is , ( AA ) the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name .
ESV	Hebrews	13	16	Do not neglect to do good and ( AB ) to share what you have , for such ( AC ) sacrifices are pleasing to God .
ESV	Hebrews	13	17	Obey ( AD ) your leaders and submit to them , ( AE ) for they are keeping watch over your souls , as those who will have to ( AF ) give an account . ( AG ) Let them do this with joy and not with groaning , for that would be of no advantage to you .
ESV	Hebrews	13	18	( AH ) Pray for us , for we are sure that we have a clear conscience , desiring to act honorably in all things .
ESV	Hebrews	13	19	I urge you the more earnestly to do this in order ( AI ) that I may be restored to you the sooner . Benediction
ESV	Hebrews	13	20	Now ( AJ ) may the God of peace ( AK ) who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , ( AL ) the great shepherd of the sheep , by ( AM ) the blood of the eternal covenant ,
ESV	Hebrews	13	21	( AN ) equip you with everything good that you may do his will , ( AO ) working in us [ b ] that which is pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , ( AP ) to whom be glory forever and ever . Amen . Final Greetings
ESV	Hebrews	13	22	I appeal to you , brothers , [ c ] bear with my word of exhortation , for ( AQ ) I have written to you briefly .
ESV	Hebrews	13	23	You should know that ( AR ) our brother Timothy has been released , with whom I shall see you if he comes soon .

ESV	James	1	1	( A ) James , a servant [ a ] of God and ( B ) of the Lord Jesus Christ , To ( C ) the twelve tribes in ( D ) the Dispersion : Greetings . Testing of Your Faith
ESV	James	1	2	( E ) Count it all joy , my brothers , [ b ] when you meet trials ( F ) of various kinds ,
ESV	James	1	3	for you know that ( G ) the testing of your faith ( H ) produces steadfastness .
ESV	James	1	4	And let steadfastness have its full effect , that you may be ( I ) perfect and complete , lacking in nothing .
ESV	James	1	5	( J ) If any of you lacks wisdom , ( K ) let him ask God , ( L ) who gives generously to all without reproach , and it will be given him .
ESV	James	1	6	But ( M ) let him ask in faith , ( N ) with no doubting , for the one who doubts is like ( O ) a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind .
ESV	James	1	7	For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord ;
ESV	James	1	8	( P ) he is a double-minded man , ( Q ) unstable in all his ways .
ESV	James	1	9	Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation ,
ESV	James	1	10	and ( R ) the rich in his humiliation , because ( S ) like a flower of the grass [ c ] he will pass away .
ESV	James	1	11	For the sun rises with its scorching heat and ( T ) withers the grass ; its flower falls , and its beauty perishes . So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits .
ESV	James	1	12	( U ) Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial , for when he has stood the test he will receive ( V ) the crown of life , ( W ) which God has promised to those who love him .
ESV	James	1	13	Let no one say when he is tempted , “ I am being tempted by God , ” for God can not be tempted with evil , and he himself tempts no one .
ESV	James	1	14	But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire .
ESV	James	1	15	Then desire ( X ) when it has conceived gives birth to sin , and ( Y ) sin when it is fully grown brings forth death .
ESV	James	1	16	,
ESV	James	1	17	( Z ) Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from ( AA ) the Father of lights , ( AB ) with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change . [ d ]

ESV	James	1	21	Therefore ( AK ) put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with ( AL ) meekness the implanted word , ( AM ) which is able to save your souls .
ESV	James	1	22	But be ( AN ) doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving yourselves .
ESV	James	1	23	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror .
ESV	James	1	24	For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like .
ESV	James	1	25	But the one who looks into the perfect law , ( AO ) the law of liberty , and perseveres , being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts , ( AP ) he will be blessed in his doing .
ESV	James	1	26	If anyone thinks he is religious ( AQ ) and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart , this person 's ( AR ) religion is worthless .
ESV	James	1	27	Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this : ( AS ) to visit ( AT ) orphans and widows in their affliction , and ( AU ) to keep oneself ( AV ) unstained from the world .

ESV	James	2	3	and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say , “ You sit here in a good place , ” ( C ) while you say to the poor man , “ You stand over there , ” or , “ Sit down at my feet , ”
ESV	James	2	4	have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become ( D ) judges with evil thoughts ?
ESV	James	2	5	,

ESV	James	2	8	If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture , ( M ) “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” you are doing well .

ESV	James	2	11	For he who said , ( P ) “ Do not commit adultery , ” also said , ( Q ) “ Do not murder. ” If you do not commit adultery but do murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
ESV	James	2	12	So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under ( R ) the law of liberty .

ESV	James	2	17	So also faith by itself , if it does not have works , is dead .
ESV	James	2	18	But someone will say , “ You have faith and I have works. ” Show me your faith ( W ) apart from your works , and I will show you my faith ( X ) by my works .
ESV	James	2	19	( Y ) You believe that God is one ; you do well . Even ( Z ) the demons believe—and shudder !
ESV	James	2	20	Do you want to be shown , you foolish person , that faith apart from works is useless ?
ESV	James	2	21	( AA ) Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar ?
ESV	James	2	22	You see that ( AB ) faith was active along with his works , and faith was completed ( AC ) by his works ;

ESV	James	4	11	( P ) Do not speak evil against one another , brothers . [ d ] The one who speaks against a brother or ( Q ) judges his brother , speaks evil against the law and judges the law . But if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law but a judge .
ESV	James	4	12	There is only ( R ) one lawgiver and ( S ) judge , he who is able to save and ( T ) to destroy . But ( U ) who are you to judge your neighbor ? Boasting About Tomorrow

ESV	James	4	14	yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring . What is your life ? For ( W ) you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes .
ESV	James	4	15	Instead you ought to say , ( X ) “ If the Lord wills , we will live and do this or that. ”

ESV	James	5	5	( J ) You have lived on the earth in luxury and ( K ) in self-indulgence . You have fattened your hearts in ( L ) a day of slaughter .
ESV	James	5	2	( C ) Your riches have rotted and ( D ) your garments are moth-eaten .
ESV	James	5	3	Your gold and silver have corroded , and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire . ( E ) You have laid up treasure ( F ) in the last days .
ESV	James	5	4	Behold , ( G ) the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields , which you kept back by fraud , are crying out against you , and ( H ) the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of ( I ) the Lord of hosts .
ESV	James	5	6	You have condemned and ( M ) murdered ( N ) the righteous person . He does not resist you . Patience in Suffering
ESV	James	5	7	Be patient , therefore , brothers , [ a ] until the coming of the Lord . See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient about it , until it receives ( O ) the early and the late rains .
ESV	James	5	8	You also , be patient . ( P ) Establish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord ( Q ) is at hand .
ESV	James	5	9	Do not grumble against one another , brothers , ( R ) so that you may not be judged ; behold , ( S ) the Judge is standing ( T ) at the door .
ESV	James	5	10	As an example of suffering and patience , brothers , take ( U ) the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
ESV	James	5	11	Behold , we consider those blessed who remained steadfast . You have heard of ( V ) the steadfastness of Job , and you have seen ( W ) the purpose of the Lord , how ( X ) the Lord is compassionate and merciful .
ESV	James	5	12	But above all , my brothers , ( Y ) do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath , but let your “ yes ” be yes and your “ no ” be no , so that you may not fall under condemnation . The Prayer of Faith
ESV	James	5	13	Is anyone among you suffering ? Let him pray . Is anyone cheerful ? Let him ( Z ) sing praise .
ESV	James	5	14	Is anyone among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of the church , and let them pray over him , ( AA ) anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord .
ESV	James	5	15	And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up . And ( AB ) if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
ESV	James	5	16	Therefore , ( AC ) confess your sins to one another and pray for one another , ( AD ) that you may be healed . ( AE ) The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working . [ b ]
ESV	James	5	17	Elijah was a man ( AF ) with a nature like ours , and ( AG ) he prayed fervently that it might not rain , and for ( AH ) three years and six months it did not rain on the earth .
ESV	James	5	18	( AI ) Then he prayed again , and heaven gave rain , and the earth bore its fruit .
ESV	James	5	19	My brothers , ( AJ ) if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone ( AK ) brings him back ,

ESV	1%20Peter	1	2	according to ( B ) the foreknowledge of God the Father , ( C ) in the sanctification of the Spirit , for obedience to Jesus Christ and ( D ) for sprinkling with his blood : May ( E ) grace and ( F ) peace be multiplied to you . Born Again to a Living Hope
ESV	1%20Peter	1	3	( G ) Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! ( H ) According to his great mercy , ( I ) he has caused us to be born again to a living hope ( J ) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
ESV	1%20Peter	1	4	to ( K ) an inheritance that is imperishable , undefiled , and ( L ) unfading , ( M ) kept in heaven for you ,
ESV	1%20Peter	1	5	who by God 's power are being guarded ( N ) through faith for a salvation ( O ) ready to be revealed in the last time .
ESV	1%20Peter	1	6	In this you rejoice , though now for a little while , if necessary , you have been grieved by ( P ) various trials ,
ESV	1%20Peter	1	7	so that ( Q ) the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes ( R ) though it is tested by ( S ) fire—may be found to result in ( T ) praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
ESV	1%20Peter	1	8	( U ) Though you have not seen him , you love him . ( V ) Though you do not now see him , you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory ,
ESV	1%20Peter	1	9	obtaining ( W ) the outcome of your faith , the salvation of your souls .
ESV	1%20Peter	1	10	Concerning this salvation , ( X ) the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully ,
ESV	1%20Peter	1	11	inquiring ( Y ) what person or time [ a ] ( Z ) the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating ( AA ) when he predicted ( AB ) the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories .
ESV	1%20Peter	1	12	( AC ) It was revealed to them that ( AD ) they were serving not themselves but you , in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you ( AE ) by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven , ( AF ) things into which angels long to look . Called to Be Holy
ESV	1%20Peter	1	13	Therefore , ( AG ) preparing your minds for action , [ b ] and ( AH ) being sober-minded , set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
ESV	1%20Peter	1	14	As obedient children , ( AI ) do not be conformed to the passions ( AJ ) of your former ignorance ,
ESV	1%20Peter	1	15	but ( AK ) as he who called you is holy , you also be holy ( AL ) in all your conduct ,
ESV	1%20Peter	1	16	since it is written , ( AM ) “ You shall be holy , for I am holy. ”
ESV	1%20Peter	1	17	And if you ( AN ) call on him as Father who ( AO ) judges ( AP ) impartially according to each one 's deeds , conduct yourselves ( AQ ) with fear throughout the time of your exile ,
ESV	1%20Peter	1	18	knowing that you ( AR ) were ransomed from ( AS ) the futile ways inherited from your forefathers , not with perishable things such as silver or gold ,
ESV	1%20Peter	1	19	but ( AT ) with the precious blood of Christ , like that of ( AU ) a lamb ( AV ) without blemish or spot .
ESV	1%20Peter	1	20	He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but ( AW ) was made manifest ( AX ) in the last times for the sake of you
ESV	1%20Peter	1	21	( AY ) who through him are believers in God , ( AZ ) who raised him from the dead and ( BA ) gave him glory , so that your faith and hope are in God .
ESV	1%20Peter	1	22	Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for ( BB ) a sincere brotherly love , ( BC ) love one another earnestly from a pure heart ,
ESV	1%20Peter	1	23	( BD ) since you have been born again , ( BE ) not of perishable seed but of imperishable , through ( BF ) the living and abiding word of God ;
ESV	1%20Peter	1	24	for ( BG ) “ All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass . The grass withers , and the flower falls ,

ESV	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter 2:16 For the contextual rendering of the Greek word doulos , see Preface The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Peter	2	2	( B ) Like newborn infants , long for the pure spiritual ( C ) milk , that by it you may grow up into salvation—
ESV	1%20Peter	2	3	if indeed you have ( D ) tasted that the Lord is good .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	4	As you come to him , a living stone ( E ) rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious ,
ESV	1%20Peter	2	5	( F ) you yourselves like living stones are being built up as ( G ) a spiritual house , to be ( H ) a holy priesthood , ( I ) to offer spiritual sacrifices ( J ) acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	6	For it stands in Scripture : ( K ) “ Behold , I am laying in Zion a stone , a cornerstone chosen and precious , ( L ) and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame. ”
ESV	1%20Peter	2	7	So the honor is for you who ( M ) believe , but for those who ( N ) do not believe ,
ESV	1%20Peter	2	8	and ( P ) “ A stone of stumbling , and a rock of offense. ” They stumble because they disobey the word , ( Q ) as they were destined to do .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	9	But you are ( R ) a chosen race , ( S ) a royal ( T ) priesthood , ( U ) a holy nation , ( V ) a people for his own possession , that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you ( W ) out of darkness into ( X ) his marvelous light .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	10	( Y ) Once you were not a people , but now you are God 's people ; once you had not received mercy , but now you have received mercy .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	11	Beloved , I urge you ( Z ) as sojourners and exiles ( AA ) to abstain from the passions of the flesh , ( AB ) which wage war against your soul .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	12	( AC ) Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable , so that when they speak against you as evildoers , ( AD ) they may see your good deeds and glorify God on ( AE ) the day of visitation . Submission to Authority
ESV	1%20Peter	2	13	( AF ) Be subject for the Lord 's sake to every human institution , [ b ] whether it be to the emperor [ c ] as supreme ,
ESV	1%20Peter	2	14	or to governors as sent by him ( AG ) to punish those who do evil and ( AH ) to praise those who do good .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	15	For this is the will of God , ( AI ) that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	16	( AJ ) Live as people who are free , not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil , but ( AK ) living as servants [ d ] of God .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	17	-
ESV	1%20Peter	2	18	( AO ) Servants , be subject to your masters with all respect , not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	19	For this is a gracious thing , when , ( AP ) mindful of God , one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	20	For what credit is it if , when you sin and are beaten for it , you endure ? But ( AQ ) if when you do good and suffer for it you endure , this is a gracious thing in the sight of God .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	21	For ( AR ) to this you have been called , ( AS ) because Christ also suffered for you , ( AT ) leaving you an example , so that you might follow in his steps .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	22	( AU ) He committed no sin , neither was deceit found in his mouth .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	23	( AV ) When he was reviled , he did not revile in return ; when he suffered , he did not threaten , ( AW ) but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly .
ESV	1%20Peter	2	24	( AX ) He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we ( AY ) might die to sin and ( AZ ) live to righteousness . ( BA ) By his wounds you have been healed .

ESV	1%20Peter	3	1	Peter 3:20 Or when The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Peter	3	3	( E ) Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry , or the clothing you wear—
ESV	1%20Peter	3	2	when they see your ( D ) respectful and pure conduct .
ESV	1%20Peter	3	4	but let your adorning be ( F ) the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit , which in God 's sight is very precious .
ESV	1%20Peter	3	5	For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves , by submitting to their own husbands ,
ESV	1%20Peter	3	6	as Sarah obeyed Abraham , ( G ) calling him lord . And you are her children , if you do good and ( H ) do not fear anything that is frightening .
ESV	1%20Peter	3	7	Likewise , ( I ) husbands , live with your wives in an understanding way , showing honor to the woman as the weaker ( J ) vessel , since they are heirs with you [ a ] of the grace of life , so that your prayers may not be hindered . Suffering for Righteousness ' Sake
ESV	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , all of you , ( K ) have unity of mind , sympathy , ( L ) brotherly love , ( M ) a tender heart , and ( N ) a humble mind .
ESV	1%20Peter	3	9	( O ) Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling , but on the contrary , ( P ) bless , for ( Q ) to this you were called , that you may obtain a blessing .
ESV	1%20Peter	3	10	For ( R ) “ Whoever desires to love life and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit ;
ESV	1%20Peter	3	11	let him turn away from evil and do good ; let him seek peace and pursue it .
ESV	1%20Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous , and his ears are open to their prayer . But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil. ”
ESV	1%20Peter	3	13	Now ( S ) who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good ?
ESV	1%20Peter	3	14	( T ) But even if you should suffer for righteousness ' sake , you will be blessed . ( U ) Have no fear of them , ( V ) nor be troubled ,
ESV	1%20Peter	3	15	but ( W ) in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy , ( X ) always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you ; yet do it with gentleness and ( Y ) respect ,
ESV	1%20Peter	3	16	( Z ) having a good conscience , so that , ( AA ) when you are slandered , those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame .
ESV	1%20Peter	3	17	For ( AB ) it is better to suffer for doing good , if that should be God 's will , than for doing evil .
ESV	1%20Peter	3	18	For Christ also ( AC ) suffered [ b ] ( AD ) once for sins , the righteous for the unrighteous , ( AE ) that he might bring us to God , being put to death ( AF ) in the flesh but made alive ( AG ) in the spirit ,
ESV	1%20Peter	3	19	in which [ c ] he went and ( AH ) proclaimed [ d ] to the spirits in prison ,
ESV	1%20Peter	3	20	because [ e ] they formerly did not obey , ( AI ) when God 's patience waited in the days of Noah , ( AJ ) while the ark was being prepared , in which a few , that is , ( AK ) eight persons , were brought safely through water .
ESV	1%20Peter	3	21	Baptism , which corresponds to this , ( AL ) now saves you , not as a removal of dirt from the body but ( AM ) as an appeal to God for a good conscience , ( AN ) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
ESV	1%20Peter	3	22	who has gone into heaven and ( AO ) is at the right hand of God , ( AP ) with angels , authorities , and powers having been subjected to him . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Peter	4	1	Peter 4:18 Greek where will the ungodly and sinner appear ? The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Peter	4	4	With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of ( K ) debauchery , and ( L ) they malign you ;
ESV	1%20Peter	4	2	( E ) so as to live for ( F ) the rest of the time in the flesh ( G ) no longer for human passions but ( H ) for the will of God .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	3	For the time that is past ( I ) suffices ( J ) for doing what the Gentiles want to do , living in sensuality , passions , drunkenness , orgies , drinking parties , and lawless idolatry .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	5	but they will give account to him who is ready ( M ) to judge the living and the dead .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	6	For this is why ( N ) the gospel was preached even to those who are dead , that though judged in the flesh the way people are , they might live in the spirit the way God does .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	7	( O ) The end of all things is at hand ; therefore ( P ) be self-controlled and sober-minded ( Q ) for the sake of your prayers .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	8	Above all , keep loving one another earnestly , since ( R ) love covers a multitude of sins .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	9	( S ) Show hospitality to one another without grumbling .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	10	( T ) As each has received a gift , use it to serve one another , ( U ) as good stewards of God 's varied grace :
ESV	1%20Peter	4	11	whoever speaks , as one who speaks ( V ) oracles of God ; whoever serves , as one who serves ( W ) by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything ( X ) God may be glorified through Jesus Christ . ( Y ) To him belong glory and ( Z ) dominion forever and ever . Amen . Suffering as a Christian
ESV	1%20Peter	4	12	Beloved , do not be surprised at ( AA ) the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you , as though something strange were happening to you .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	13	But rejoice ( AB ) insofar as you share Christ 's sufferings , that you may also rejoice and be glad ( AC ) when his glory is revealed .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	14	( AD ) If you are insulted ( AE ) for the name of Christ , you are blessed , because the Spirit of glory [ b ] and of God rests upon you .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	15	But ( AF ) let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or ( AG ) as a meddler .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	16	Yet ( AH ) if anyone suffers as a ( AI ) Christian , let him not be ashamed , but let him glorify God ( AJ ) in that name .
ESV	1%20Peter	4	17	For it is time for judgment ( AK ) to begin at the household of God ; and ( AL ) if it begins with us , what will be the outcome for those who ( AM ) do not obey the gospel of God ?
ESV	1%20Peter	4	18	And
ESV	1%20Peter	4	19	Therefore let those who suffer according to God 's will ( AO ) entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Peter	5	2	( C ) shepherd the flock of God that is among you , exercising oversight , [ a ] ( D ) not under compulsion , but willingly , as God would have you ; [ b ] ( E ) not for shameful gain , but eagerly ;
ESV	1%20Peter	5	3	not ( F ) domineering over those in your charge , but ( G ) being examples to the flock .
ESV	1%20Peter	5	4	And when ( H ) the chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the ( I ) unfading ( J ) crown of glory .
ESV	1%20Peter	5	6	( M ) Humble yourselves , therefore , under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you ,
ESV	1%20Peter	5	7	( N ) casting all your anxieties on him , because ( O ) he cares for you .

ESV	2%20Peter	1	1	Simeon [ a ] Peter , a servant [ b ] and apostle of Jesus Christ , To those who have obtained ( A ) a faith of equal standing with ours ( B ) by the righteousness of our ( C ) God and Savior Jesus Christ :

ESV	2%20Peter	1	4	by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises , so that through them you may become ( G ) partakers of the divine nature , ( H ) having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire .
ESV	2%20Peter	1	5	For this very reason , make every effort to supplement your faith ( I ) with virtue , [ e ] and virtue ( J ) with knowledge ,
ESV	2%20Peter	1	6	and knowledge with self-control , and self-control ( K ) with steadfastness , and steadfastness with godliness ,

ESV	2%20Peter	1	15	And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things . Christ 's Glory and the Prophetic Word
ESV	2%20Peter	1	16	For we did not follow ( Z ) cleverly devised ( AA ) myths when we made known to you ( AB ) the power and ( AC ) coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but ( AD ) we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
ESV	2%20Peter	1	17	For when he received honor and glory from God the Father , and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory , ( AE ) “ This is my beloved Son , [ i ] with whom I am well pleased , ”
ESV	2%20Peter	1	18	we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven , for we were with him on ( AF ) the holy mountain .
ESV	2%20Peter	1	19	And ( AG ) we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed , to which you will do well to pay attention ( AH ) as to a lamp shining in a dark place , until ( AI ) the day ( AJ ) dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts ,
ESV	2%20Peter	1	20	knowing this first of all , that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone 's own interpretation .

ESV	2%20Peter	3	4	( F ) They will say , “ Where is the promise of ( G ) his coming ? For ever since the fathers fell asleep , all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation. ”
ESV	2%20Peter	3	5	For they deliberately overlook this fact , that the heavens existed long ago , and the earth ( H ) was formed out of water and through water ( I ) by the word of God ,
ESV	2%20Peter	3	6	and that by means of these the world that then existed ( J ) was deluged with water and ( K ) perished .
ESV	2%20Peter	3	7	But by the same word ( L ) the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire , being kept until the day of judgment and ( M ) destruction of the ungodly .
ESV	2%20Peter	3	8	But do not overlook this one fact , beloved , that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years , and ( N ) a thousand years as one day .
ESV	2%20Peter	3	9	( O ) The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise ( P ) as some count slowness , but ( Q ) is patient toward you , [ a ] ( R ) not wishing that any should perish , but ( S ) that all should reach repentance .
ESV	2%20Peter	3	10	But ( T ) the day of the Lord will come like a thief , and then ( U ) the heavens will pass away with a roar , and ( V ) the heavenly bodies [ b ] will be burned up and dissolved , and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed . [ c ]

ESV	1%20John	2	4	Whoever says “ I know him ” but does not keep his commandments ( E ) is a liar , and ( F ) the truth is not in him ,

ESV	1%20John	2	6	whoever says he ( J ) abides in him ( K ) ought to walk in the same way in which he walked . The New Commandment
ESV	1%20John	2	7	Beloved , I am writing you ( L ) no new commandment , but ( M ) an old commandment ( N ) that you had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word that you have heard .
ESV	1%20John	2	8	At the same time , it is ( O ) a new commandment that I am writing to you , which is true in him and in you , because [ a ] ( P ) the darkness is passing away and ( Q ) the true light is already shining .

ESV	1%20John	2	16	For all that is in the world— ( AC ) the desires of the flesh and ( AD ) the desires of the eyes and pride of life [ c ] —is not from the Father but is from the world .

ESV	1%20John	3	2	Beloved , we are ( E ) God 's children ( F ) now , and what we will be ( G ) has not yet appeared ; but we know that ( H ) when he appears [ a ] ( I ) we shall be like him , because ( J ) we shall see him as he is .
ESV	1%20John	3	4	Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness ; ( M ) sin is lawlessness .
ESV	1%20John	3	5	You know that ( N ) he appeared in order to ( O ) take away sins , and ( P ) in him there is no sin .
ESV	1%20John	3	6	No one who abides in him keeps on sinning ; ( Q ) no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him .
ESV	1%20John	3	7	Little children , ( R ) let no one deceive you . ( S ) Whoever practices righteousness is righteous , as he is righteous .
ESV	1%20John	3	8	( T ) Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil , for the devil has been sinning from the beginning . The reason the Son of God appeared was ( U ) to destroy the works of the devil .
ESV	1%20John	3	9	( V ) No one born of God makes a practice of sinning , for God 's [ b ] seed abides in him ; and he can not keep on sinning , because he has been born of God .
ESV	1%20John	3	10	By this it is evident who are the children of God , and who are the children of the devil : whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God , ( W ) nor is the one who ( X ) does not love his brother . Love One Another
ESV	1%20John	3	11	For ( Y ) this is the message that you have heard from the beginning , ( Z ) that we should love one another .
ESV	1%20John	3	12	We should not be like ( AA ) Cain , who was of the evil one and murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? ( AB ) Because his own deeds were evil and his brother 's righteous .
ESV	1%20John	3	13	Do not be surprised , brothers , [ c ] ( AC ) that the world hates you .
ESV	1%20John	3	14	,
ESV	1%20John	3	15	( AE ) Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that ( AF ) no murderer has eternal life abiding in him .
ESV	1%20John	3	16	-
ESV	1%20John	3	17	But ( AI ) if anyone has the world 's goods and sees his brother in need , yet ( AJ ) closes his heart against him , ( AK ) how does God 's love abide in him ?
ESV	1%20John	3	18	Little children , let us not ( AL ) love in word or talk but in deed and ( AM ) in truth .
ESV	1%20John	3	19	By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him ;
ESV	1%20John	3	20	for whenever our heart condemns us , God is greater than our heart , and he knows everything .
ESV	1%20John	3	21	Beloved , ( AN ) if our heart does not condemn us , ( AO ) we have confidence before God ;
ESV	1%20John	3	22	and ( AP ) whatever we ask we receive from him , because we keep his commandments and ( AQ ) do what pleases him .
ESV	1%20John	3	23	And this is his commandment , ( AR ) that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and ( AS ) love one another , ( AT ) just as he has commanded us .

ESV	1%20John	4	6	We are from God . ( N ) Whoever knows God listens to us ; whoever is not from God does not listen to us . By this we know ( O ) the Spirit of truth and ( P ) the spirit of error . God Is Love
ESV	1%20John	4	7	Beloved , ( Q ) let us love one another , for love is from God , and ( R ) whoever loves has been born of God and knows God .
ESV	1%20John	4	8	( S ) Anyone who does not love does not know God , because ( T ) God is love .
ESV	1%20John	4	9	In this the love of God was made manifest among us , that ( U ) God sent his only Son into the world , so that we might live through him .
ESV	1%20John	4	10	In this is love , ( V ) not that we have loved God ( W ) but that he loved us and sent his Son to be ( X ) the propitiation for our sins .
ESV	1%20John	4	11	Beloved , if God so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
ESV	1%20John	4	12	( Y ) No one has ever seen God ; if we love one another , God abides in us and ( Z ) his love is perfected in us .
ESV	1%20John	4	13	( AA ) By this we know that we abide in him and he in us , because he has given us of his Spirit .

ESV	1%20John	4	15	( AE ) Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God , God abides in him , and he in God .
ESV	1%20John	4	16	So ( AF ) we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us . ( AG ) God is love , and ( AH ) whoever abides in love abides in God , and God abides in him .
ESV	1%20John	4	17	By this ( AI ) is love perfected with us , so that ( AJ ) we may have confidence for the day of judgment , because ( AK ) as he is so also are we in this world .
ESV	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love , but ( AL ) perfect love casts out fear . For fear has to do with punishment , and whoever fears has not ( AM ) been perfected in love .

ESV	1%20John	5	2	( D ) By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and obey his commandments .
ESV	1%20John	5	3	For ( E ) this is the love of God , that we ( F ) keep his commandments . And ( G ) his commandments are not burdensome .
ESV	1%20John	5	4	For ( H ) everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world . And this is the victory that has overcome the world— ( I ) our faith .
ESV	1%20John	5	6	This is he who came ( K ) by water and blood—Jesus Christ ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood . And ( L ) the Spirit is the one who testifies , because ( M ) the Spirit is the truth .
ESV	1%20John	5	7	For there are three that testify :
ESV	1%20John	5	8	the Spirit and the water and the blood ; and these three agree .
ESV	1%20John	5	9	( N ) If we receive the testimony of men , the testimony of God is greater , for this is the testimony of God ( O ) that he has borne concerning his Son .
ESV	1%20John	5	10	Whoever believes in the Son of God ( P ) has the testimony in himself . Whoever does not believe God ( Q ) has made him a liar , ( R ) because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son .
ESV	1%20John	5	11	And this is the testimony , that God gave us ( S ) eternal life , and ( T ) this life is in his Son .
ESV	1%20John	5	12	( U ) Whoever has the Son has life ; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life . That You May Know
ESV	1%20John	5	13	I write ( V ) these things to you who ( W ) believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eternal life .

ESV	1%20John	5	15	And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask , we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him .
ESV	1%20John	5	16	If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death , he shall ask , and ( Z ) God [ a ] will give him life—to those who commit sins that do not lead to death . ( AA ) There is sin that leads to death ; ( AB ) I do not say that one should pray for that .
ESV	1%20John	5	17	( AC ) All wrongdoing is sin , but there is sin that does not lead to death .
ESV	1%20John	5	18	We know that ( AD ) everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning , but ( AE ) he who was born of God ( AF ) protects him , and the evil one does not touch him .
ESV	1%20John	5	19	We know that we are from God , and ( AG ) the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .

ESV	Jude	1	1	Jude , a servant [ a ] of Jesus Christ and brother of James , ( A ) To those who are called , ( B ) beloved in God the Father and ( C ) kept for [ b ] Jesus Christ :
ESV	Jude	1	2	May ( D ) mercy , ( E ) peace , and love be multiplied to you . Judgment on False Teachers
ESV	Jude	1	3	Beloved , although I was very eager to write to you about our ( F ) common salvation , I found it necessary to write appealing to you ( G ) to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints .
ESV	Jude	1	4	For ( H ) certain people ( I ) have crept in unnoticed ( J ) who long ago were designated for this condemnation , ungodly people , who pervert ( K ) the grace of our God into sensuality and ( L ) deny our only Master and Lord , Jesus Christ .
ESV	Jude	1	5	Now I want ( M ) to remind you , although you once fully knew it , that ( N ) Jesus , who saved [ c ] a people out of the land of Egypt , ( O ) afterward destroyed those who did not believe .
ESV	Jude	1	6	And ( P ) the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority , but left their proper dwelling , he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day—
ESV	Jude	1	7	just as ( Q ) Sodom and Gomorrah and ( R ) the surrounding cities , which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and ( S ) pursued unnatural desire , [ d ] serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire .
ESV	Jude	1	8	Yet in like manner these people also , relying on their dreams , defile the flesh , reject authority , and ( T ) blaspheme the glorious ones .
ESV	Jude	1	9	But when ( U ) the archangel ( V ) Michael , contending with the devil , was disputing ( W ) about the body of Moses , he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment , but said , ( X ) “ The Lord rebuke you. ”
ESV	Jude	1	10	( Y ) But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand , and they are destroyed by all that they , like unreasoning animals , understand instinctively .
ESV	Jude	1	11	Woe to them ! For they walked in ( Z ) the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain ( AA ) to Balaam 's error and ( AB ) perished in Korah 's rebellion .
ESV	Jude	1	12	These are hidden reefs [ e ] ( AC ) at your love feasts , as they feast with you without fear , ( AD ) shepherds feeding themselves ; ( AE ) waterless clouds , ( AF ) swept along by winds ; fruitless trees in late autumn , twice dead , ( AG ) uprooted ;
ESV	Jude	1	13	( AH ) wild waves of the sea , casting up the foam of ( AI ) their own shame ; ( AJ ) wandering stars , ( AK ) for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever .
ESV	Jude	1	14	It was also about these that Enoch , ( AL ) the seventh from Adam , prophesied , saying , ( AM ) “ Behold , the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones ,
ESV	Jude	1	15	( AN ) to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have ( AO ) committed in such an ungodly way , and of all ( AP ) the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him. ”
ESV	Jude	1	16	These are grumblers , malcontents , ( AQ ) following their own sinful desires ; ( AR ) they are loud-mouthed boasters , ( AS ) showing favoritism to gain advantage . A Call to Persevere
ESV	Jude	1	17	But you must ( AT ) remember , beloved , the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
ESV	Jude	1	18	They [ f ] said to you , ( AU ) “ In the last time there will be scoffers , following their own ungodly passions. ”
ESV	Jude	1	19	It is these who cause divisions , worldly people , ( AV ) devoid of the Spirit .
ESV	Jude	1	20	But you , beloved , ( AW ) building yourselves up in your most holy faith and ( AX ) praying in the Holy Spirit ,
ESV	Jude	1	21	( AY ) keep yourselves in the love of God , ( AZ ) waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life .
ESV	Jude	1	22	And have mercy on those who doubt ;
ESV	Jude	1	23	save others by ( BA ) snatching them out of ( BB ) the fire ; to others show mercy ( BC ) with fear , hating even ( BD ) the garment [ g ] stained by the flesh . Doxology
ESV	Jude	1	24	( BE ) Now to him who is able ( BF ) to keep you from stumbling and ( BG ) to present you ( BH ) blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy ,
ESV	Jude	1	25	to ( BI ) the only God , our Savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord , ( BJ ) be glory , majesty , dominion , and authority , before all time [ h ] and now and forever . Amen .

ESV	Revelation	1	9	I , John , your brother and ( AA ) partner in ( AB ) the tribulation and ( AC ) the kingdom and ( AD ) the patient endurance that are in Jesus , was on the island called Patmos ( AE ) on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus .
ESV	Revelation	1	10	( AF ) I was in the Spirit ( AG ) on the Lord 's day , and I heard behind me a loud voice ( AH ) like a trumpet
ESV	Revelation	1	11	saying , ( AI ) “ Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches , to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea. ”
ESV	Revelation	1	12	Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me , and on turning I saw ( AJ ) seven golden lampstands ,
ESV	Revelation	1	13	and in the midst of the lampstands ( AK ) one like ( AL ) a son of man , ( AM ) clothed with a long robe and ( AN ) with a golden sash around his chest .
ESV	Revelation	1	14	( AO ) The hairs of his head were white , like white wool , like snow . ( AP ) His eyes were like a flame of fire ,
ESV	Revelation	1	15	( AQ ) his feet were like burnished bronze , refined in a furnace , and ( AR ) his voice was like the roar of many waters .
ESV	Revelation	1	16	( AS ) In his right hand he held seven stars , ( AT ) from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword , and ( AU ) his face was like the sun shining ( AV ) in full strength .
ESV	Revelation	1	17	( AW ) When I saw him , I fell at his feet as though dead . But ( AX ) he laid his right hand on me , ( AY ) saying , “ Fear not , ( AZ ) I am the first and the last ,
ESV	Revelation	1	18	and the living one . ( BA ) I died , and behold I am alive forevermore , and ( BB ) I have the keys of Death and Hades .
ESV	Revelation	1	19	( BC ) Write therefore ( BD ) the things that you have seen , those that are and those that are to take place after this .

ESV	Revelation	7	3	saying , ( E ) “ Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees , until we have sealed the servants of our God ( F ) on their foreheads. ”

ESV	Revelation	7	12	( O ) saying , “ Amen ! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever ! Amen. ”
ESV	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders addressed me , saying , “ Who are these , ( P ) clothed in white robes , and from where have they come ? ”
ESV	Revelation	7	14	I said to him , “ Sir , you know. ” And he said to me , “ These are the ones coming out of ( Q ) the great tribulation . ( R ) They have washed their robes and ( S ) made them white ( T ) in the blood of the Lamb .

ESV	Revelation	9	12	( U ) The first woe has passed ; behold , two woes are still to come .

ESV	Revelation	9	14	saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , “ Release ( W ) the four angels who are bound at ( X ) the great river Euphrates. ”
ESV	Revelation	9	15	So the four angels , who had been prepared for the hour , the day , the month , and the year , were released ( Y ) to kill a third of mankind .
ESV	Revelation	9	16	The number of ( Z ) mounted troops was ( AA ) twice ten thousand times ten thousand ; ( AB ) I heard their number .
ESV	Revelation	9	17	And this is how I saw the horses in my vision and those who rode them : they wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire [ c ] and of sulfur , and the heads of the horses were ( AC ) like lions ' heads , and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths .
ESV	Revelation	9	18	By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed , by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
ESV	Revelation	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails , for their tails are like serpents with heads , and by means of them they wound .
ESV	Revelation	9	20	The rest of mankind , who were not killed by these plagues , ( AD ) did not repent of ( AE ) the works of their hands nor give up worshiping ( AF ) demons ( AG ) and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood , which can not see or hear or walk ,

ESV	Revelation	10	10	And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it . It was sweet as honey in my mouth , but when I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter .
ESV	Revelation	10	2	( D ) He had a little scroll open in his hand . And he set his right foot on the sea , and his left foot on the land ,
ESV	Revelation	10	3	and called out with a loud voice , ( E ) like a lion roaring . When he called out , the seven thunders sounded .
ESV	Revelation	10	4	And when the seven thunders had sounded , I was about to write , but I heard a voice from heaven saying , ( F ) “ Seal up what the seven thunders have said , and do not write it down. ”
ESV	Revelation	10	5	And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land ( G ) raised his right hand to heaven
ESV	Revelation	10	6	and swore by ( H ) him who lives forever and ever , ( I ) who created heaven and what is in it , the earth and what is in it , and the sea and what is in it , that there would be no more delay ,
ESV	Revelation	10	7	but that ( J ) in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel , the mystery of God would be fulfilled , ( K ) just as he announced to his servants the prophets .
ESV	Revelation	10	8	Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again , saying , “ Go , take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. ”

ESV	Revelation	11	11	But after the three and a half days ( U ) a breath of life from God entered them , and they stood up on their feet , and great fear fell on those who saw them .
ESV	Revelation	11	2	but do not measure ( B ) the court outside the temple ; leave that out , for ( C ) it is given over to the nations , and they will trample the holy city for ( D ) forty-two months .
ESV	Revelation	11	3	And I will grant authority to my two witnesses , and they will prophesy for ( E ) 1,260 days , ( F ) clothed in sackcloth. ”
ESV	Revelation	11	4	These are ( G ) the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth .
ESV	Revelation	11	5	And if anyone would harm them , ( H ) fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes . If anyone would harm them , ( I ) this is how he is doomed to be killed .
ESV	Revelation	11	6	They have the power ( J ) to shut the sky , that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying , and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and ( K ) to strike the earth with every kind of plague , as often as they desire .
ESV	Revelation	11	7	And when they have finished their testimony , ( L ) the beast that rises from ( M ) the bottomless pit [ a ] ( N ) will make war on them and conquer them and kill them ,
ESV	Revelation	11	8	and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically [ b ] is called ( O ) Sodom and ( P ) Egypt , where their Lord was crucified .
ESV	Revelation	11	9	For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and ( Q ) refuse to let them be placed in a tomb ,
ESV	Revelation	11	10	and ( R ) those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and ( S ) exchange presents , because these two prophets ( T ) had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth .
ESV	Revelation	11	12	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , ( V ) “ Come up here ! ” And ( W ) they went up to heaven ( X ) in a cloud , and their enemies watched them .
ESV	Revelation	11	13	And at that hour there was ( Y ) a great earthquake , and ( Z ) a tenth of the city fell . Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were terrified and ( AA ) gave glory to ( AB ) the God of heaven .
ESV	Revelation	11	14	( AC ) The second woe has passed ; behold , the third woe is soon to come . The Seventh Trumpet
ESV	Revelation	11	15	Then ( AD ) the seventh angel blew his trumpet , and ( AE ) there were loud voices in heaven , saying , ( AF ) “ The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of ( AG ) his Christ , and ( AH ) he shall reign forever and ever. ”
ESV	Revelation	11	16	And the twenty-four elders ( AI ) who sit on their thrones before God ( AJ ) fell on their faces and worshiped God ,
ESV	Revelation	11	17	saying , “ We give thanks to you , Lord God Almighty , ( AK ) who is and who was , for you have taken your great power and ( AL ) begun to reign .
ESV	Revelation	11	18	The nations raged , but ( AM ) your wrath came , and ( AN ) the time for the dead to be judged , and for rewarding your servants , the prophets and saints , and ( AO ) those who fear your name , both small and great , and ( AP ) for destroying the destroyers of the earth. ”
ESV	Revelation	11	19	Then ( AQ ) God 's temple in heaven was opened , and ( AR ) the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple . There were flashes of lightning , rumblings , [ c ] peals of thunder , an earthquake , and ( AS ) heavy hail .

ESV	Revelation	12	12	Therefore , ( Z ) rejoice , O heavens and you who dwell in them ! But ( AA ) woe to you , O earth and sea , for the devil has come down to you in great wrath , because ( AB ) he knows that his time is short ! ”
ESV	Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant and ( D ) was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth .
ESV	Revelation	12	3	And another sign appeared in heaven : behold , a great ( E ) red dragon , ( F ) with seven heads and ( G ) ten horns , and on his heads ( H ) seven diadems .
ESV	Revelation	12	4	His tail swept down ( I ) a third of the stars of heaven and ( J ) cast them to the earth . And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she bore her child ( K ) he might devour it .
ESV	Revelation	12	5	She gave birth to a male child , ( L ) one who is to rule [ a ] all the nations with a rod of iron , but her child was ( M ) caught up to God and to his throne ,
ESV	Revelation	12	6	and the woman fled into the wilderness , where she has a place prepared by God , in which she is to be nourished for ( N ) 1,260 days . Satan Thrown Down to Earth
ESV	Revelation	12	7	Now war arose in heaven , ( O ) Michael and ( P ) his angels fighting against the dragon . And the dragon and his angels fought back ,
ESV	Revelation	12	8	but he was defeated , and there was no longer any place for them in heaven .
ESV	Revelation	12	9	And ( Q ) the great dragon was thrown down , ( R ) that ancient serpent , who is called the devil and Satan , ( S ) the deceiver of the whole world— ( T ) he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
ESV	Revelation	12	10	And I heard a loud voice in heaven , saying , “ Now ( U ) the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come , for the accuser of our brothers [ b ] has been thrown down , ( V ) who accuses them day and night before our God .
ESV	Revelation	12	11	And ( W ) they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony , for ( X ) they loved not their lives ( Y ) even unto death .
ESV	Revelation	12	13	And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth , he pursued ( AC ) the woman who had given birth to the male child .
ESV	Revelation	12	14	But the woman was given the two ( AD ) wings of the great eagle so that she might fly from the serpent ( AE ) into the wilderness , to the place where she is to be nourished ( AF ) for a time , and times , and half a time .
ESV	Revelation	12	15	The serpent poured water ( AG ) like a river out of his mouth after the woman , to sweep her away with a flood .
ESV	Revelation	12	16	But the earth came to the help of the woman , and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth .
ESV	Revelation	12	17	Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off ( AH ) to make war on the rest of ( AI ) her offspring , ( AJ ) on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to ( AK ) the testimony of Jesus . And he stood [ c ] on the sand of the sea .

ESV	Revelation	13	13	( W ) It performs great signs , even ( X ) making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people ,
ESV	Revelation	13	2	And the beast that I saw was ( C ) like a leopard ; its feet were like ( D ) a bear 's , and its mouth was like ( E ) a lion 's mouth . And to it ( F ) the dragon gave his power and ( G ) his throne and great authority .
ESV	Revelation	13	3	One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound , but its mortal wound was healed , and ( H ) the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast .
ESV	Revelation	13	4	And they worshiped the dragon , for he had given his authority to the beast , and they worshiped the beast , saying , ( I ) “ Who is like the beast , and who can fight against it ? ”
ESV	Revelation	13	5	And the beast was given ( J ) a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words , and it was allowed to exercise authority for ( K ) forty-two months .
ESV	Revelation	13	6	It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God , blaspheming his name and his dwelling , [ a ] that is , those who dwell in heaven .
ESV	Revelation	13	7	Also it was allowed ( L ) to make war on the saints and to conquer them . [ b ] And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation ,
ESV	Revelation	13	8	and all ( M ) who dwell on earth will worship it , everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in ( N ) the book of life of ( O ) the Lamb ( P ) who was slain .
ESV	Revelation	13	9	( Q ) If anyone has an ear , let him hear :
ESV	Revelation	13	10	( R ) If anyone is to be taken captive , to captivity he goes ; ( S ) if anyone is to be slain with the sword , with the sword must he be slain . ( T ) Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints . The Second Beast
ESV	Revelation	13	11	Then ( U ) I saw another beast rising out of the earth . It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon .
ESV	Revelation	13	12	It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence , [ c ] and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast , ( V ) whose mortal wound was healed .
ESV	Revelation	13	14	and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of [ d ] the beast ( Y ) it deceives those who dwell on earth , telling them to make an image for the beast ( Z ) that was wounded by the sword and yet lived .
ESV	Revelation	13	15	And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast , so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not ( AA ) worship the image of the beast ( AB ) to be slain .
ESV	Revelation	13	16	Also it causes all , both small and great , both rich and poor , both free and slave , [ e ] ( AC ) to be marked on the right hand or the forehead ,
ESV	Revelation	13	17	so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark , that is , ( AD ) the name of the beast or ( AE ) the number of its name .
ESV	Revelation	13	18	( AF ) This calls for wisdom : let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number ( AG ) of a man , and his number is

ESV	Revelation	14	14	Then I looked , and behold , a white cloud , and seated on the cloud one ( AM ) like a son of man , ( AN ) with a golden crown on his head , and a sharp sickle in his hand .
ESV	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a voice from heaven ( F ) like the roar of many waters and ( G ) like the sound of loud thunder . The voice I heard was like the sound of ( H ) harpists playing on their harps ,
ESV	Revelation	14	3	and they were singing ( I ) a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders . ( J ) No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth .
ESV	Revelation	14	4	It is these who have not defiled themselves with women , for ( K ) they are virgins . It is these ( L ) who follow the Lamb wherever he goes . These have been redeemed from mankind as ( M ) firstfruits for God and the Lamb ,
ESV	Revelation	14	5	and ( N ) in their mouth no lie was found , for they are ( O ) blameless . The Messages of the Three Angels
ESV	Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel ( P ) flying directly overhead , with an eternal gospel to proclaim to ( Q ) those who dwell on earth , to every nation and tribe and language and people .
ESV	Revelation	14	7	And he said with a loud voice , ( R ) “ Fear God and ( S ) give him glory , because the hour of his judgment has come , and ( T ) worship him who made heaven and earth , the sea and the ( U ) springs of water. ”
ESV	Revelation	14	8	Another angel , a second , followed , saying , ( V ) “ Fallen , fallen is ( W ) Babylon the great , ( X ) she who made all nations drink ( Y ) the wine of the passion [ a ] of her sexual immorality. ”
ESV	Revelation	14	9	And another angel , a third , followed them , saying with a loud voice , “ If anyone ( Z ) worships the beast and its image and receives ( AA ) a mark on his forehead or on his hand ,
ESV	Revelation	14	10	he also will drink ( AB ) the wine of God 's wrath , ( AC ) poured full strength into the cup of his anger , and ( AD ) he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb .
ESV	Revelation	14	11	And ( AE ) the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever , and ( AF ) they have no rest , day or night , these ( AG ) worshipers of the beast and its image , and whoever receives the mark of its name. ”
ESV	Revelation	14	12	( AH ) Here is a call for the endurance of the saints , those who ( AI ) keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus . [ b ]
ESV	Revelation	14	13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying , “ Write this : ( AJ ) Blessed are the dead ( AK ) who die in the Lord from now on. ” “ Blessed indeed , ” says the Spirit , ( AL ) “ that they may rest from their labors , for their deeds follow them ! ” The Harvest of the Earth
ESV	Revelation	14	15	And another angel ( AO ) came out of the temple , calling with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud , ( AP ) “ Put in your sickle , and reap , for the hour to reap has come , for ( AQ ) the harvest of the earth is fully ripe. ”
ESV	Revelation	14	16	So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth , and the earth was reaped .
ESV	Revelation	14	17	Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he too had a sharp sickle .
ESV	Revelation	14	18	And another angel came out from the altar , ( AR ) the angel who has authority over the fire , and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle , “ Put in your sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth , ( AS ) for its grapes are ripe. ”
ESV	Revelation	14	19	So the angel swung his sickle across the earth and gathered the grape harvest of the earth and threw it into the great ( AT ) winepress of the wrath of God .
ESV	Revelation	14	20	And ( AU ) the winepress was trodden ( AV ) outside the city , and blood flowed from the winepress , as high as ( AW ) a horse 's bridle , for 1,600 stadia . [ c ] Footnotes - Revelation 14:8 Or wrath - Revelation 14:12 Greek and the faith of Jesus - Revelation 14:20 About

ESV	Revelation	15	15	Then ( A ) I saw another sign in heaven , great and amazing , ( B ) seven angels with seven plagues , which are the last , for with them the wrath of God is finished .
ESV	Revelation	15	2	And I saw ( C ) what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire—and also those ( D ) who had conquered the beast and its image and ( E ) the number of its name , standing beside the sea of glass ( F ) with harps of God in their hands .
ESV	Revelation	15	3	And they sing ( G ) the song of Moses , ( H ) the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , ( I ) “ Great and amazing are your deeds , O Lord God the Almighty ! ( J ) Just and true are your ways , O King of the nations ! [ a ]

ESV	Revelation	16	4	The third angel poured out his bowl into ( H ) the rivers and the springs of water , and ( I ) they became blood .

ESV	Revelation	17	17	for ( AR ) God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and ( AS ) handing over their royal power to the beast , until the words of God are fulfilled .
ESV	Revelation	17	2	( E ) with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality , and ( F ) with the wine of whose sexual immorality ( G ) the dwellers on earth have become drunk. ”
ESV	Revelation	17	3	And ( H ) he carried me away in the Spirit ( I ) into a wilderness , and I saw a woman sitting on ( J ) a scarlet beast that was full of ( K ) blasphemous names , and ( L ) it had seven heads and ten horns .
ESV	Revelation	17	4	The woman ( M ) was arrayed in purple and scarlet , and adorned ( N ) with gold and jewels and pearls , holding in her hand ( O ) a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality .
ESV	Revelation	17	5	And on her forehead was written a name of ( P ) mystery : ( Q ) “ Babylon the great , mother of prostitutes and of earth 's abominations. ”
ESV	Revelation	17	6	And I saw the woman , drunk ( R ) with the blood of the saints , the blood of ( S ) the martyrs of Jesus . [ a ] When I saw her , I marveled greatly .
ESV	Revelation	17	7	But the angel said to me , “ Why do you marvel ? I will tell you ( T ) the mystery of the woman , and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her .
ESV	Revelation	17	8	The beast that you saw ( U ) was , and is not , and ( V ) is about to rise from ( W ) the bottomless pit [ b ] and ( X ) go to destruction . And ( Y ) the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in ( Z ) the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast , because ( AA ) it was and is not and is to come .
ESV	Revelation	17	9	( AB ) This calls for a mind with wisdom : the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated ;
ESV	Revelation	17	10	they are also seven kings , five of whom have fallen , one is , the other has not yet come , and when he does come he must remain only a little while .
ESV	Revelation	17	11	As for the beast ( AC ) that was and is not , it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven , and it goes to destruction .
ESV	Revelation	17	12	And ( AD ) the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power , but they are to receive authority as kings ( AE ) for one hour , together with the beast .
ESV	Revelation	17	13	These are of one mind , and they hand over their power and authority to the beast .
ESV	Revelation	17	14	They ( AF ) will make war on the Lamb , and ( AG ) the Lamb will conquer them , for he is ( AH ) Lord of lords and ( AI ) King of kings , and those with him are ( AJ ) called and chosen and faithful. ”
ESV	Revelation	17	15	And the angel [ c ] said to me , ( AK ) “ The waters that you saw , where the prostitute is seated , are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages .
ESV	Revelation	17	16	And ( AL ) the ten horns that you saw , they and the beast ( AM ) will hate the prostitute . They will make her ( AN ) desolate and ( AO ) naked , and ( AP ) devour her flesh and ( AQ ) burn her up with fire ,

ESV	Revelation	18	18	and ( AH ) cried out ( AI ) as they saw the smoke of her burning , ( AJ ) “ What city was like the great city ? ”
ESV	Revelation	18	2	And he called out with a mighty voice , ( C ) “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great ! She has become ( D ) a dwelling place for demons , a haunt ( E ) for every unclean spirit , a haunt ( F ) for every unclean bird , a haunt for every unclean and detestable beast .
ESV	Revelation	18	3	For all nations have drunk [ a ] ( G ) the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality , and ( H ) the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her , and ( I ) the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living. ”
ESV	Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying , ( J ) “ Come out of her , my people , lest you take part in her sins , lest you share in her plagues ;
ESV	Revelation	18	5	for ( K ) her sins are heaped high as heaven , and ( L ) God has remembered her iniquities .
ESV	Revelation	18	6	( M ) Pay her back as she herself has paid back others , and repay her ( N ) double for her deeds ; mix a double portion for her ( O ) in the cup she mixed .
ESV	Revelation	18	7	( P ) As she glorified herself and lived in luxury , so give her a like measure of torment and mourning , since in her heart she says , ( Q ) ‘ I sit as a queen , I am no widow , and mourning I shall never see. ’
ESV	Revelation	18	8	For this reason her plagues will come ( R ) in a single day , death and mourning and famine , and ( S ) she will be burned up with fire ; for ( T ) mighty is the Lord God who has judged her. ”
ESV	Revelation	18	9	And ( U ) the kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her , ( V ) will weep and wail over her ( W ) when they see the smoke of her burning .
ESV	Revelation	18	10	( X ) They will stand far off , in fear of her torment , and say , “ Alas ! Alas ! ( Y ) You great city , you mighty city , Babylon ! For ( Z ) in a single hour your judgment has come. ”
ESV	Revelation	18	11	And ( AA ) the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her , since no one buys their cargo anymore ,
ESV	Revelation	18	12	cargo of gold , silver , jewels , pearls , fine linen , purple cloth , silk , scarlet cloth , all kinds of scented wood , all kinds of articles of ivory , all kinds of articles of costly wood , bronze , iron and marble ,

ESV	Revelation	18	15	( AB ) The merchants of these wares , who gained wealth from her , ( AC ) will stand far off , in fear of her torment , weeping and mourning aloud ,
ESV	Revelation	18	16	“ Alas , alas , for the great city ( AD ) that was clothed in fine linen , in purple and scarlet , adorned with gold , with jewels , and with pearls !
ESV	Revelation	18	17	For ( AE ) in a single hour all this wealth ( AF ) has been laid waste. ” And ( AG ) all shipmasters and seafaring men , sailors and all whose trade is on the sea , stood far off
ESV	Revelation	18	19	And they threw ( AK ) dust on their heads as they wept and mourned , crying out , “ Alas , alas , for the great city ( AL ) where all who had ships at sea grew rich by her wealth ! For ( AM ) in a single hour she has been laid waste .
ESV	Revelation	18	20	( AN ) Rejoice over her , O heaven , and you saints and ( AO ) apostles and prophets , for ( AP ) God has given judgment for you against her ! ”
ESV	Revelation	18	21	Then ( AQ ) a mighty angel ( AR ) took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea , saying , “ So will Babylon ( AS ) the great city be thrown down with violence , and will be found no more ;
ESV	Revelation	18	22	and ( AT ) the sound of harpists and musicians , of flute players and trumpeters , will be heard in you no more , and a craftsman of any craft will be found in you no more , and ( AU ) the sound of the mill will be heard in you no more ,

ESV	Revelation	19	19	And I saw ( AR ) the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies ( AS ) gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army .
ESV	Revelation	19	2	for ( C ) his judgments are true and just ; for he has judged ( D ) the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality , and ( E ) has avenged on her the blood of his servants. ”
ESV	Revelation	19	3	Once more they cried out , “ Hallelujah ! ( F ) The smoke from her goes up forever and ever. ”
ESV	Revelation	19	4	And ( G ) the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated on the throne , saying , “ Amen . Hallelujah ! ”
ESV	Revelation	19	5	And from the throne came a voice saying , The Marriage Supper of the Lamb
ESV	Revelation	19	6	Then I heard what seemed to be ( J ) the voice of a great multitude , like ( K ) the roar of many waters and ( L ) like the sound of mighty peals of thunder , crying out , “ Hallelujah ! For the Lord our God the Almighty ( M ) reigns .
ESV	Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory , for ( N ) the marriage of the Lamb has come , and ( O ) his Bride has made herself ready ;

ESV	Revelation	19	9	And the angel said [ a ] to me , “ Write this : ( R ) Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb. ” And he said to me , ( S ) “ These are the true words of God. ”
ESV	Revelation	19	10	Then ( T ) I fell down at his feet to worship him , ( U ) but he said to me , “ You must not do that !

ESV	Revelation	19	12	( AA ) His eyes are like a flame of fire , and on his head are ( AB ) many diadems , and he has ( AC ) a name written that no one knows but himself .
ESV	Revelation	19	13	He is clothed in ( AD ) a robe dipped in [ b ] blood , and the name by which he is called is ( AE ) The Word of God .
ESV	Revelation	19	14	And the armies of heaven , ( AF ) arrayed in fine linen , white and pure , ( AG ) were following him on white horses .
ESV	Revelation	19	15	( AH ) From his mouth comes a sharp sword ( AI ) with which to strike down the nations , and ( AJ ) he will rule [ c ] them with a rod of iron . ( AK ) He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty .
ESV	Revelation	19	16	On his robe and on his thigh ( AL ) he has a name written , ( AM ) King of kings and Lord of lords .
ESV	Revelation	19	17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun , and with a loud voice he called to ( AN ) all the birds that fly directly overhead , ( AO ) “ Come , gather for ( AP ) the great supper of God ,

ESV	Revelation	19	20	And the beast was captured , and with it ( AT ) the false prophet ( AU ) who in its presence [ e ] had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who ( AV ) worshiped its image . These two were ( AW ) thrown alive into the lake of ( AX ) fire that burns with sulfur .
