ESV	Genesis	18	8	Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared , and set it before them . And he stood by them under the tree while they ate .

ESV	Genesis	18	11	Now ( I ) Abraham and Sarah were old , advanced in years . The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah .

ESV	Genesis	18	22	( U ) So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom , but Abraham ( V ) still stood before the Lord .
ESV	Genesis	18	23	Then Abraham drew near and said , ( W ) “ Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked ?

ESV	Genesis	19	19	Behold , your servant has found favor in your sight , and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life . But I can not escape to the hills , lest the disaster overtake me and I die .
ESV	Genesis	19	2	and said , “ My lords , ( B ) please turn aside to your servant 's house and spend the night ( C ) and wash your feet . Then you may rise up early and go on your way. ” They said , ( D ) “ No ; we will spend the night in the town square. ”
ESV	Genesis	19	3	But he pressed them strongly ; so they turned aside to him and entered his house . And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread , and they ate .
ESV	Genesis	19	4	But before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of Sodom , both young and old , all the people to the last man , surrounded the house .
ESV	Genesis	19	5	( E ) And they called to Lot , “ Where are the men who came to you tonight ? ( F ) Bring them out to us , that we ( G ) may know them. ”
ESV	Genesis	19	6	Lot went out to the men at the entrance , shut the door after him ,
ESV	Genesis	19	7	and said , “ I beg you , my brothers , do not act so wickedly .
ESV	Genesis	19	8	( H ) Behold , I have two daughters who have not known any man . Let me bring them out to you , and do to them as you please . Only do nothing to these men , for they have come under the shelter of my roof. ”
ESV	Genesis	19	9	But they said , “ Stand back ! ” And they said , “ This fellow ( I ) came to sojourn , and ( J ) he has become the judge ! Now we will deal worse with you than with them. ” Then they pressed hard against the man Lot , and drew near to break the door down .
ESV	Genesis	19	10	But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door .
ESV	Genesis	19	11	And they struck with ( K ) blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house , both small and great , so that they wore themselves out groping for the door .
ESV	Genesis	19	12	Then the men said to Lot , “ Have you anyone else here ? Sons-in-law , sons , daughters , or anyone you have in the city , ( L ) bring them out of the place .
ESV	Genesis	19	13	For we are about to destroy this place , ( M ) because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord , and the Lord has sent us to destroy it. ”
ESV	Genesis	19	14	So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law , who were to marry his daughters , ( N ) “ Up ! Get out of this place , for the Lord is about to destroy the city. ” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting .
ESV	Genesis	19	15	As morning dawned , the angels urged Lot , saying , “ Up ! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here , lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city. ”
ESV	Genesis	19	16	But he lingered . So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand , ( O ) the Lord being merciful to him , and they brought him out and set him outside the city .
ESV	Genesis	19	17	And as they brought them out , one said , “ Escape for your life . ( P ) Do not look back or stop anywhere in the ( Q ) valley . Escape to the hills , lest you be swept away. ”
ESV	Genesis	19	18	And Lot said to them , “ Oh , no , my lords .
ESV	Genesis	19	20	Behold , this city is near enough to flee to , and it is a little one . Let me escape there—is it not a little one ? —and my life will be saved ! ”
ESV	Genesis	19	21	He said to him , “ Behold , I grant you this favor also , that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken .
ESV	Genesis	19	22	Escape there quickly , for I can do nothing till you arrive there. ” Therefore the name of the city was called ( R ) Zoar . [ a ] God Destroys Sodom
ESV	Genesis	19	23	The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar .
ESV	Genesis	19	24	Then ( S ) the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven .
ESV	Genesis	19	25	And he overthrew those cities , and all the valley , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and what grew on the ground .
ESV	Genesis	19	26	But Lot 's wife , behind him , looked back , and she became ( T ) a pillar of salt .
ESV	Genesis	19	27	And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had ( U ) stood before the Lord .
ESV	Genesis	19	28	And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley , and he looked and , behold , the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace .
ESV	Genesis	19	29	So it was that , when God destroyed the cities of the valley , God ( V ) remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived . Lot and His Daughters
ESV	Genesis	19	30	Now Lot went up out of Zoar and ( W ) lived in the hills with his two daughters , for he was afraid to live in Zoar . So he lived in a cave with his two daughters .
ESV	Genesis	19	31	And the firstborn said to the younger , “ Our father is old , and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth .
ESV	Genesis	19	32	Come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve offspring from our father. ”
ESV	Genesis	19	33	So they made their father drink wine that night . And the firstborn went in and lay with her father . He did not know when she lay down or when she arose .
ESV	Genesis	19	34	The next day , the firstborn said to the younger , “ Behold , I lay last night with my father . Let us make him drink wine tonight also . Then you go in and lie with him , that we may preserve offspring from our father. ”
ESV	Genesis	19	35	So they made their father drink wine that night also . And the younger arose and lay with him , and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose .
ESV	Genesis	19	36	Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father .
ESV	Genesis	19	37	The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab . [ b ] ( X ) He is the father of the Moabites to this day .

ESV	Genesis	20	3	( E ) But God came to Abimelech ( F ) in a dream by night and said to him , “ Behold , you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken , for she is a man 's wife. ”
ESV	Genesis	20	4	Now Abimelech had not approached her . So he said , ( G ) “ Lord , will you kill an innocent people ?
ESV	Genesis	20	5	Did he not himself say to me , ‘ She is my sister ’ ? And she herself said , ‘ He is my brother. ’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this. ”

ESV	Genesis	20	14	Then Abimelech ( P ) took sheep and oxen , and male servants and female servants , and gave them to Abraham , and returned Sarah his wife to him .
ESV	Genesis	20	15	And Abimelech said , “ Behold , ( Q ) my land is before you ; dwell where it pleases you. ”
ESV	Genesis	20	16	To Sarah he said , “ Behold , I have given ( R ) your brother a thousand pieces of silver . It is ( S ) a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all [ a ] who are with you , and before everyone you are vindicated. ”

ESV	Genesis	21	8	And the child grew and was weaned . And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned .
ESV	Genesis	21	9	But Sarah ( K ) saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian , whom she had borne to Abraham , ( L ) laughing . [ b ]
ESV	Genesis	21	10	So she said to Abraham , ( M ) “ Cast out this slave woman with her son , for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac. ”
ESV	Genesis	21	11	And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son .
ESV	Genesis	21	12	But God said to Abraham , “ Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman . Whatever Sarah says to you , do as she tells you , for ( N ) through Isaac shall your offspring be named .
ESV	Genesis	21	13	And I will make ( O ) a nation of the son of the slave woman also , because he is your offspring. ”

ESV	Genesis	21	15	When the water in the skin was gone , she put the child under one of the bushes .
ESV	Genesis	21	16	Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off , about the distance of a bowshot , for she said , “ Let me not look on the death of the child. ” And as she sat opposite him , she lifted up her voice and wept .

ESV	Genesis	21	20	And God was with the boy , and he grew up . He lived in the wilderness ( R ) and became an expert with the bow .
ESV	Genesis	21	22	At that time ( S ) Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham , ( T ) “ God is with you in all that you do .
ESV	Genesis	21	23	Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity , but ( U ) as I have dealt kindly with you , so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned. ”
ESV	Genesis	21	24	And Abraham said , “ I will swear. ”
ESV	Genesis	21	25	When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech 's servants ( V ) had seized ,
ESV	Genesis	21	26	Abimelech said , “ I do not know who has done this thing ; you did not tell me , and I have not heard of it until today. ”
ESV	Genesis	21	27	So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech , and the two men ( W ) made a covenant .
ESV	Genesis	21	28	Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart .
ESV	Genesis	21	29	And Abimelech said to Abraham , “ What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart ? ”
ESV	Genesis	21	30	He said , “ These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand , that this [ c ] may be a witness for me that I dug this well. ”
ESV	Genesis	21	31	Therefore ( X ) that place was called Beersheba , [ d ] because there both of them swore an oath .
ESV	Genesis	21	32	So they made a covenant at Beersheba . Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines .
ESV	Genesis	21	33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and ( Y ) called there on the name of the Lord , ( Z ) the Everlasting God .

ESV	Genesis	24	9	So the servant ( J ) put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter .

ESV	Genesis	24	15	Before he had finished speaking , behold , Rebekah , who was born to Bethuel the son of ( Q ) Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother , came out with her water jar on her shoulder .
ESV	Genesis	24	16	The young woman ( R ) was very attractive in appearance , a maiden [ c ] whom no man had known . She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up .

ESV	Genesis	24	21	The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the Lord had prospered his journey or not .
ESV	Genesis	24	22	When the camels had finished drinking , the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel , [ d ] and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels ,

ESV	Genesis	24	33	Then food was set before him to eat . But he said , “ I will not eat until I have said what I have to say. ” He said , “ Speak on. ”

ESV	Genesis	26	15	( Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells ( R ) that his father 's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father . )
ESV	Genesis	26	16	And Abimelech said to Isaac , “ Go away from us , for you are much mightier than we. ”
ESV	Genesis	26	17	So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there .
ESV	Genesis	26	18	And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father , which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham . And ( S ) he gave them the names that his father had given them .
ESV	Genesis	26	19	But when Isaac 's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water ,
ESV	Genesis	26	20	the herdsmen of Gerar ( T ) quarreled with Isaac 's herdsmen , saying , “ The water is ours. ” So he called the name of the well Esek , [ b ] because they contended with him .
ESV	Genesis	26	21	Then they dug another well , and they quarreled over that also , so he called its name Sitnah . [ c ]
ESV	Genesis	26	22	And he moved from there and dug another well , and they did not quarrel over it . So he called its name Rehoboth , [ d ] saying , “ For now the Lord has made room for us , and we shall be fruitful in the land. ”
ESV	Genesis	26	23	From there he went up to Beersheba .
ESV	Genesis	26	24	And the Lord appeared to him the same night and said , ( U ) “ I am the God of Abraham your father . ( V ) Fear not , for ( W ) I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham 's sake. ”
ESV	Genesis	26	25	So he ( X ) built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent there . And there Isaac 's servants dug a well .
ESV	Genesis	26	27	Isaac said to them , “ Why have you come to me , seeing that you hate me and ( Z ) have sent me away from you ? ”
ESV	Genesis	26	28	They said , “ We see plainly that the Lord has been with you . So we said , let there be a sworn pact between us , between you and us , and let us make a covenant with you ,
ESV	Genesis	26	29	that you will do us no harm , just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace . ( AA ) You are now the blessed of the Lord. ”
ESV	Genesis	26	30	So he made them a feast , and they ate and drank .
ESV	Genesis	26	31	In the morning they rose early and ( AB ) exchanged oaths . And Isaac sent them on their way , and they departed from him in peace .
ESV	Genesis	26	32	That same day Isaac 's servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him , “ We have found water. ”
ESV	Genesis	26	33	He called it Shibah ; [ e ] therefore the name of the city is ( AC ) Beersheba to this day .
ESV	Genesis	26	34	When Esau was forty years old , he took ( AD ) Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife , and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite ,
ESV	Genesis	26	35	and ( AE ) they made life bitter [ f ] for Isaac and Rebekah .

ESV	Genesis	27	27	So he came near and kissed him . And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments ( O ) and blessed him and said , “ See , ( P ) the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed !
ESV	Genesis	27	2	He said , “ Behold , I am old ; I do not know the day of my death .
ESV	Genesis	27	3	( B ) Now then , take your weapons , your quiver and your bow , and go out to the field and hunt game for me ,
ESV	Genesis	27	4	and prepare for me delicious food , such as I love , and bring it to me so that I may eat , that my soul ( C ) may bless you before I die. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	5	Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau . So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it ,
ESV	Genesis	27	6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob , “ I heard your father speak to your brother Esau ,
ESV	Genesis	27	7	‘ Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food , that I may eat it and bless you before the Lord before I die. ’
ESV	Genesis	27	8	Now therefore , my son , ( D ) obey my voice as I command you .
ESV	Genesis	27	9	Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats , so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father , such as he loves .
ESV	Genesis	27	10	And you shall bring it to your father to eat , ( E ) so that he may bless you before he dies. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	11	But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother , “ Behold , ( F ) my brother Esau is a hairy man , and I am a smooth man .
ESV	Genesis	27	12	Perhaps my father ( G ) will feel me , and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring ( H ) a curse upon myself and not a blessing. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	13	His mother said to him , ( I ) “ Let your curse be on me , my son ; only obey my voice , and go , bring them to me. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	14	So he went and took them and brought them to his mother , and his mother prepared delicious food , such as his father loved .
ESV	Genesis	27	15	Then Rebekah took the ( J ) best garments of Esau her older son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob her younger son .
ESV	Genesis	27	16	And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck .
ESV	Genesis	27	17	And she put the delicious food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
ESV	Genesis	27	18	So he went in to his father and said , “ My father. ” And he said , “ Here I am . Who are you , my son ? ”
ESV	Genesis	27	19	Jacob said to his father , “ I am Esau your firstborn . I have done as you told me ; now sit up and eat of my game , that your soul may bless me. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	20	But Isaac said to his son , “ How is it that you have found it so quickly , my son ? ” He answered , “ Because the Lord your God granted me success. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	21	Then Isaac said to Jacob , “ Please come near , that I ( K ) may feel you , my son , to know whether you are really my son Esau or not. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	22	So Jacob went near to Isaac his father , who felt him and said , “ The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	23	And he did not recognize him , because ( L ) his hands were hairy like his brother Esau 's hands . ( M ) So he blessed him .
ESV	Genesis	27	24	He said , “ Are you really my son Esau ? ” He answered , “ I am. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	25	Then he said , “ Bring it near to me , ( N ) that I may eat of my son 's game and bless you. ” So he brought it near to him , and he ate ; and he brought him wine , and he drank .
ESV	Genesis	27	26	Then his father Isaac said to him , “ Come near and kiss me , my son. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	28	May God give you of ( Q ) the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and ( R ) plenty of grain and wine .
ESV	Genesis	27	29	Let peoples serve you , and nations ( S ) bow down to you . ( T ) Be lord over your brothers , and may your mother 's sons bow down to you . ( U ) Cursed be everyone who curses you , and blessed be everyone who blesses you ! ”
ESV	Genesis	27	30	As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob , when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
ESV	Genesis	27	31	He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father . And he said to his father , “ Let my father arise and eat of his son 's game , that you may bless me. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	32	His father Isaac said to him , “ Who are you ? ” He answered , “ I am your son , your firstborn , Esau. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	33	Then Isaac trembled very violently and said , “ Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me , and I ate it all before you came , and I have blessed him ? Yes , and he shall be blessed. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	34	As soon as Esau heard the words of his father , ( V ) he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father , “ Bless me , even me also , O my father ! ”
ESV	Genesis	27	35	But he said , “ Your brother came deceitfully , and he has taken away your blessing. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	36	Esau said , ( W ) “ Is he not rightly named Jacob ? [ a ] For he has cheated me these two times . ( X ) He took away my birthright , and behold , now he has taken away my blessing. ” Then he said , “ Have you not reserved a blessing for me ? ”
ESV	Genesis	27	37	Isaac answered and said to Esau , “ Behold , ( Y ) I have made him lord over you , and all his brothers I have given to him for servants , and ( Z ) with grain and wine I have sustained him . What then can I do for you , my son ? ”
ESV	Genesis	27	38	Esau said to his father , “ Have you but one blessing , my father ? Bless me , even me also , O my father. ” And ( AA ) Esau lifted up his voice and wept .
ESV	Genesis	27	39	Then Isaac his father answered and said to him : “ Behold , ( AB ) away from [ b ] the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be , and away from [ c ] the dew of heaven on high .
ESV	Genesis	27	40	By your sword you shall live , and you ( AC ) shall serve your brother ; but when you grow restless ( AD ) you shall break his yoke from your neck. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	41	Now Esau ( AE ) hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him , and Esau said to himself , ( AF ) “ The days of mourning for my father are approaching ; ( AG ) then I will kill my brother Jacob. ”
ESV	Genesis	27	42	But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah . So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him , “ Behold , your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you .
ESV	Genesis	27	43	Now therefore , my son , obey my voice . Arise , flee to Laban my brother in Haran
ESV	Genesis	27	44	and stay with him a while , until your brother 's fury turns away—
ESV	Genesis	27	45	until your brother 's anger turns away from you , and he forgets what you have done to him . Then I will send and bring you from there . Why should I be bereft of you both in one day ? ”
ESV	Genesis	27	46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac , ( AH ) “ I loathe my life because of the Hittite women . [ d ] ( AI ) If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these , one of the women of the land , what good will my life be to me ? ” Footnotes - Genesis 27:36 Jacob means He takes by the heel , or He cheats - Genesis 27:39 Or Behold , of - Genesis 27:39 Or and of - Genesis 27:46 Hebrew daughters of Heth The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Genesis	28	28	Then Isaac called Jacob ( A ) and blessed him and directed him , ( B ) “ You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women .
ESV	Genesis	28	2	( C ) Arise , go to Paddan-aram to the house of ( D ) Bethuel your mother 's father , and take as your wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother 's brother .
ESV	Genesis	28	3	( E ) God Almighty [ a ] bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you , that you may become a company of peoples .
ESV	Genesis	28	4	May he give ( F ) the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you , that you may take possession of ( G ) the land of your sojournings that God gave to Abraham ! ”
ESV	Genesis	28	5	Thus Isaac sent Jacob away . And he went to Paddan-aram , to Laban , the son of Bethuel the Aramean , the brother of Rebekah , Jacob 's and Esau 's mother . Esau Marries an Ishmaelite
ESV	Genesis	28	6	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there , and that as he blessed him he directed him , “ You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women , ”
ESV	Genesis	28	7	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram .
ESV	Genesis	28	8	So when Esau saw ( H ) that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father ,
ESV	Genesis	28	9	Esau went to Ishmael and took as his wife , besides the wives he had , ( I ) Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , the sister of ( J ) Nebaioth . Jacob 's Dream
ESV	Genesis	28	10	Jacob left ( K ) Beersheba and went toward ( L ) Haran .
ESV	Genesis	28	11	And he came to a certain place and stayed there that night , because the sun had set . Taking one of the stones of the place , he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep .
ESV	Genesis	28	12	And he ( M ) dreamed , and behold , there was a ladder [ b ] set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven . And behold , ( N ) the angels of God were ascending and descending on it !
ESV	Genesis	28	13	And behold , ( O ) the Lord stood above it [ c ] and said , ( P ) “ I am the Lord , the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac . ( Q ) The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring .
ESV	Genesis	28	14	Your offspring shall be like ( R ) the dust of the earth , and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south , and in you and ( S ) your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
ESV	Genesis	28	15	Behold , ( T ) I am with you and will keep you wherever you go , and ( U ) will bring you back to this land . For I will ( V ) not leave you until I have done what I have promised you. ”
ESV	Genesis	28	16	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said , “ Surely the Lord is ( W ) in this place , and I did not know it. ”
ESV	Genesis	28	17	And he was afraid and said , “ How awesome is this place ! This is none other than the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven. ”
ESV	Genesis	28	18	So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up ( X ) for a pillar ( Y ) and poured oil on the top of it .
ESV	Genesis	28	19	He called the name of that place ( Z ) Bethel , [ d ] but the name of the city was Luz at the first .
ESV	Genesis	28	20	Then Jacob ( AA ) made a vow , saying , “ If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear ,
ESV	Genesis	28	21	( AB ) so that I come again to my father 's house in peace , ( AC ) then the Lord shall be my God ,
ESV	Genesis	28	22	and this stone , which I have set up for a pillar , ( AD ) shall be God 's house . And ( AE ) of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you. ” Footnotes - Genesis 28:3 Hebrew El Shaddai - Genesis 28:12 Or a flight of steps - Genesis 28:13 Or beside him - Genesis 28:19 Bethel means the house of God The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Genesis	29	2	As he looked , he saw a well in the field , and behold , three flocks of sheep lying beside it , for out of that well the flocks were watered . The stone on the well 's mouth was large ,
ESV	Genesis	29	3	and when all the flocks were gathered there , the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep , and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well .
ESV	Genesis	29	4	Jacob said to them , “ My brothers , where do you come from ? ” They said , ( B ) “ We are from Haran. ”
ESV	Genesis	29	5	He said to them , “ Do you know Laban the son of Nahor ? ” They said , “ We know him. ”
ESV	Genesis	29	6	He said to them , “ Is it well with him ? ” They said , “ It is well ; and see , Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep ! ”
ESV	Genesis	29	7	He said , “ Behold , it is still high day ; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together . Water the sheep and go , pasture them. ”
ESV	Genesis	29	8	But they said , “ We can not until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well ; then we water the sheep. ”
ESV	Genesis	29	9	While he was still speaking with them , ( C ) Rachel came with her father 's sheep , for she was a shepherdess .
ESV	Genesis	29	10	Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Laban his mother 's brother , Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother 's brother .
ESV	Genesis	29	11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud .
ESV	Genesis	29	12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was ( D ) her father 's kinsman , and that he was Rebekah 's son , ( E ) and she ran and told her father .
ESV	Genesis	29	13	As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob , his sister 's son , ( F ) he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house . Jacob told Laban all these things ,
ESV	Genesis	29	14	and Laban said to him , ( G ) “ Surely you are my bone and my flesh ! ” And he stayed with him a month .
ESV	Genesis	29	15	Then Laban said to Jacob , “ Because you are my kinsman , should you therefore serve me for nothing ? Tell me , what shall your wages be ? ”
ESV	Genesis	29	16	Now Laban had two daughters . The name of the older was Leah , and the name of the younger was Rachel .
ESV	Genesis	29	17	Leah 's eyes were weak , [ a ] but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance .
ESV	Genesis	29	18	Jacob loved Rachel . And he said , ( H ) “ I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel. ”
ESV	Genesis	29	19	Laban said , “ It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man ; stay with me. ”
ESV	Genesis	29	20	So Jacob ( I ) served seven years for Rachel , and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her .
ESV	Genesis	29	21	Then Jacob said to Laban , “ Give me my wife that I may go in to her , for my time is completed. ”
ESV	Genesis	29	22	So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and ( J ) made a feast .
ESV	Genesis	29	23	But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob , and he went in to her .
ESV	Genesis	29	24	( Laban gave [ b ] ( K ) his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant . )
ESV	Genesis	29	25	And in the morning , behold , it was Leah ! And Jacob said to Laban , “ What is this you have done to me ? Did I not serve with you for Rachel ? Why then have you deceived me ? ”
ESV	Genesis	29	26	Laban said , “ It is not so done in our country , to give the younger before the firstborn .
ESV	Genesis	29	27	( L ) Complete the week of this one , and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years. ”
ESV	Genesis	29	28	Jacob did so , and completed her week . Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife .
ESV	Genesis	29	30	So Jacob went in to Rachel also , and he loved Rachel more than Leah , and served Laban ( N ) for another seven years . Jacob 's Children
ESV	Genesis	29	31	When the Lord saw that Leah was ( O ) hated , ( P ) he opened her womb , but Rachel was barren .
ESV	Genesis	29	32	And Leah conceived and bore a son , and she called his name Reuben , [ c ] for she said , “ Because the Lord ( Q ) has looked upon my affliction ; for now my husband will love me. ”
ESV	Genesis	29	33	She conceived again and bore a son , and said , “ Because the Lord has heard that I am hated , he has given me this son also. ” And she called his name Simeon . [ d ]
ESV	Genesis	29	34	Again she conceived and bore a son , and said , “ Now this time my husband will be ( R ) attached to me , because I have borne him three sons. ” Therefore his name was called Levi . [ e ]
ESV	Genesis	29	35	And she conceived again and bore a son , and said , “ This time I will praise the Lord. ” Therefore she called his name ( S ) Judah . [ f ] Then she ceased bearing . Footnotes - Genesis 29:17 Or soft - Genesis 29:24 Or had given ; also verse

ESV	Genesis	30	30	For you had little before I came , ( T ) and it has increased abundantly , and the Lord has blessed you wherever I turned . But now when shall I ( U ) provide for my own household also ? ”
ESV	Genesis	30	2	Jacob 's anger was kindled against Rachel , and he said , “ Am I in the place of God , ( B ) who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb ? ”
ESV	Genesis	30	3	Then she said , “ Here is my servant ( C ) Bilhah ; go in to her , so that she may give birth ( D ) on my behalf , [ a ] that even I may have children [ b ] through her. ”
ESV	Genesis	30	4	So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife , and Jacob went in to her .
ESV	Genesis	30	5	And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son .
ESV	Genesis	30	6	Then Rachel said , “ God has ( E ) judged me , and has also heard my voice and given me a son. ” Therefore she called his name Dan . [ c ]
ESV	Genesis	30	7	Rachel 's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son .
ESV	Genesis	30	8	Then Rachel said , “ With mighty wrestlings [ d ] I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed. ” So she called his name ( F ) Naphtali . [ e ]
ESV	Genesis	30	9	When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children , she took her servant Zilpah and ( G ) gave her to Jacob as a wife .
ESV	Genesis	30	10	Then Leah 's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son .
ESV	Genesis	30	11	And Leah said , ( H ) “ Good fortune has come ! ” so she called his name ( I ) Gad . [ f ]
ESV	Genesis	30	12	Leah 's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son .
ESV	Genesis	30	13	And Leah said , “ Happy am I ! For women ( J ) have called me happy. ” So she called his name Asher . [ g ]
ESV	Genesis	30	14	In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found ( K ) mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah . Then Rachel said to Leah , “ Please give me some of your son 's mandrakes. ”
ESV	Genesis	30	15	But she said to her , “ Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband ? Would you take away my son 's mandrakes also ? ” Rachel said , “ Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son 's mandrakes. ”
ESV	Genesis	30	16	When Jacob came from the field in the evening , Leah went out to meet him and said , “ You must come in to me , for I have hired you with my son 's mandrakes. ” So he lay with her that night .
ESV	Genesis	30	17	And God listened to Leah , and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son .
ESV	Genesis	30	18	Leah said , “ God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband. ” So she called his name Issachar . [ h ]
ESV	Genesis	30	19	And Leah conceived again , and she bore Jacob a sixth son .
ESV	Genesis	30	20	Then Leah said , “ God has endowed me with a good endowment ; now my husband will honor me , because I have borne him six sons. ” So she called his name ( L ) Zebulun . [ i ]
ESV	Genesis	30	21	Afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah .
ESV	Genesis	30	22	Then God ( M ) remembered Rachel , and God listened to her and ( N ) opened her womb .
ESV	Genesis	30	23	She conceived and bore a son and said , “ God has taken away ( O ) my reproach. ”
ESV	Genesis	30	24	And she called his name Joseph , [ j ] saying , ( P ) “ May the Lord add to me another son ! ” Jacob 's Prosperity
ESV	Genesis	30	25	As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph , Jacob said to Laban , “ Send me away , that I may go to my own home and country .
ESV	Genesis	30	26	Give me my wives and my children ( Q ) for whom I have served you , that I may go , for you know the service that I have given you. ”
ESV	Genesis	30	27	But Laban said to him , “ If I have found favor in your sight , I have learned by divination that [ k ] the Lord has blessed me because of you .
ESV	Genesis	30	28	( R ) Name your wages , and I will give it. ”
ESV	Genesis	30	29	Jacob said to him , ( S ) “ You yourself know how I have served you , and how your livestock has fared with me .
ESV	Genesis	30	31	He said , “ What shall I give you ? ” Jacob said , “ You shall not give me anything . If you will do this for me , I will again pasture your flock and keep it :
ESV	Genesis	30	32	let me pass through all your flock today , removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb , and the spotted and speckled among the goats , and ( V ) they shall be my wages .
ESV	Genesis	30	33	So my honesty will answer for me later , when you come to look into my wages with you . Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs , if found with me , shall be counted stolen. ”
ESV	Genesis	30	34	Laban said , “ Good ! Let it be as you have said. ”
ESV	Genesis	30	35	But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted , and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted , every one that had white on it , and every lamb that was black , and put them in the charge of his sons .
ESV	Genesis	30	36	And he set a distance of three days ' journey between himself and Jacob , and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban 's flock .
ESV	Genesis	30	37	Then ( W ) Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees , and peeled white streaks in them , exposing the white of the sticks .
ESV	Genesis	30	38	He set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs , that is , the ( X ) watering places , where the flocks came to drink . And since they bred when they came to drink ,
ESV	Genesis	30	39	the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped , speckled , and spotted .
ESV	Genesis	30	40	And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban . He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban 's flock .
ESV	Genesis	30	41	Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding , Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock , that they might breed among the sticks ,

ESV	Genesis	31	31	Jacob answered and said to Laban , “ Because I was afraid , for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force .
ESV	Genesis	31	2	And Jacob saw ( A ) that Laban did not regard him with favor as before .
ESV	Genesis	31	3	Then the Lord said to Jacob , ( B ) “ Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred , and I will be with you. ”
ESV	Genesis	31	4	So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was
ESV	Genesis	31	5	and said to them , ( C ) “ I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before . But the God of my father ( D ) has been with me .
ESV	Genesis	31	6	( E ) You know that I have served your father with all my strength ,
ESV	Genesis	31	7	yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ( F ) ten times . But God did not permit him to harm me .
ESV	Genesis	31	8	If he said , ( G ) ‘ The spotted shall be your wages , ’ then all the flock bore spotted ; and if he said , ‘ The striped shall be your wages , ’ then all the flock bore striped .
ESV	Genesis	31	9	Thus God has ( H ) taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me .
ESV	Genesis	31	10	In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped , spotted , and mottled .
ESV	Genesis	31	11	Then the angel of God said to me in the dream , ‘ Jacob , ’ and I said , ‘ Here I am ! ’
ESV	Genesis	31	12	And he said , ‘ Lift up your eyes and see , all the goats that mate with the flock are striped , spotted , and mottled , for ( I ) I have seen all that Laban is doing to you .
ESV	Genesis	31	13	I am the God of Bethel , ( J ) where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me . Now ( K ) arise , go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred. ’ ”
ESV	Genesis	31	14	Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him , “ Is there ( L ) any portion or inheritance left to us in our father 's house ?
ESV	Genesis	31	15	Are we not regarded by him as foreigners ? For ( M ) he has sold us , and he has indeed devoured our money .
ESV	Genesis	31	16	All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children . Now then , whatever God has said to you , do. ”
ESV	Genesis	31	17	So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels .
ESV	Genesis	31	18	He drove away all his livestock , all his property that he had gained , the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in ( N ) Paddan-aram , to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac .
ESV	Genesis	31	19	Laban had gone to shear his sheep , and Rachel stole her father 's ( O ) household gods .
ESV	Genesis	31	20	And Jacob tricked [ a ] Laban the Aramean , by not telling him that he intended to flee .
ESV	Genesis	31	21	He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the ( P ) Euphrates , [ b ] and ( Q ) set his face toward the hill country of Gilead .
ESV	Genesis	31	22	When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled ,
ESV	Genesis	31	23	he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead .
ESV	Genesis	31	24	But God came to Laban the Aramean ( R ) in a dream by night and said to him , “ Be careful not to say anything to Jacob , ( S ) either good or bad. ”
ESV	Genesis	31	25	And Laban overtook Jacob . Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country , and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead .

ESV	Genesis	31	28	And why did you not permit me ( V ) to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell ? Now you have done foolishly .
ESV	Genesis	31	29	It is ( W ) in my power to do you harm . But the ( X ) God of your [ c ] father spoke to me last night , saying , ‘ Be careful not to say anything to Jacob , ( Y ) either good or bad. ’
ESV	Genesis	31	30	And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father 's house , but why did you ( Z ) steal my gods ? ”
ESV	Genesis	31	32	( AA ) Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live . In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours , and take it. ” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them .
ESV	Genesis	31	33	So Laban went into Jacob 's tent and into Leah 's tent and into the tent of the two female servants , but he did not find them . And he went out of Leah 's tent and entered Rachel 's .
ESV	Genesis	31	34	Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel 's saddle and sat on them . Laban felt all about the tent , but did not find them .
ESV	Genesis	31	35	And she said to her father , “ Let not my lord be angry that I can not ( AB ) rise before you , for the way of women is upon me. ” So he searched but did not find the household gods .
ESV	Genesis	31	36	Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban . Jacob said to Laban , “ What is my offense ? What is my sin , that you have hotly pursued me ?
ESV	Genesis	31	37	For you have felt through all my goods ; what have you found of all your household goods ? Set it here before my kinsmen and ( AC ) your kinsmen , that they may decide between us two .
ESV	Genesis	31	38	These twenty years I have been with you . Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried , and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks .
ESV	Genesis	31	39	What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you . I bore the loss of it myself . ( AD ) From my hand you required it , whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
ESV	Genesis	31	40	There I was : by day the heat consumed me , and the cold by night , and my sleep fled from my eyes .
ESV	Genesis	31	41	These twenty years I have been in your house . ( AE ) I served you fourteen years for your two daughters , and six years for your flock , and ( AF ) you have changed my wages ten times .
ESV	Genesis	31	42	( AG ) If the God of my father , the God of Abraham and the ( AH ) Fear of Isaac , had not been on my side , surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed . ( AI ) God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and ( AJ ) rebuked you last night. ”
ESV	Genesis	31	43	Then Laban answered and said to Jacob , “ The daughters are my daughters , the children are my children , the flocks are my flocks , and all that you see is mine . But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne ?
ESV	Genesis	31	44	Come now , ( AK ) let us make a covenant , you and I . ( AL ) And let it be a witness between you and me. ”
ESV	Genesis	31	45	So Jacob ( AM ) took a stone and set it up as a pillar .
ESV	Genesis	31	46	And Jacob said to his kinsmen , “ Gather stones. ” And they took stones and made a heap , and they ate there by the heap .
ESV	Genesis	31	47	Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha , [ d ] but Jacob called it Galeed . [ e ]
ESV	Genesis	31	48	Laban said , ( AN ) “ This heap is a witness between you and me today. ” Therefore he named it Galeed ,
ESV	Genesis	31	49	( AO ) and Mizpah , [ f ] for he said , “ The Lord watch between you and me , when we are out of one another 's sight .
ESV	Genesis	31	50	If you oppress my daughters , or if you take wives besides my daughters , although no one is with us , see , ( AP ) God is witness between you and me. ”
ESV	Genesis	31	51	Then Laban said to Jacob , “ See this heap and the pillar , which I have set between you and me .
ESV	Genesis	31	52	( AQ ) This heap is a witness , and the pillar is a witness , that I will not pass over this heap to you , and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me , to do harm .
ESV	Genesis	31	53	The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge between us. ” So Jacob swore by the ( AR ) Fear of his father Isaac ,
ESV	Genesis	31	54	and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called ( AS ) his kinsmen to eat bread . They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country .

ESV	Genesis	32	2	And when Jacob saw them he said , “ This is God 's ( A ) camp ! ” So he called the name of that place ( B ) Mahanaim . [ a ]
ESV	Genesis	32	3	And Jacob sent [ b ] messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of ( C ) Seir , the country of Edom ,
ESV	Genesis	32	4	instructing them , “ Thus you shall say to my lord Esau : Thus says your servant Jacob , ‘ I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now .
ESV	Genesis	32	5	I have oxen , donkeys , flocks , male servants , and female servants . I have sent to tell my lord , in order that ( D ) I may find favor in your sight. ’ ”
ESV	Genesis	32	6	And the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , “ We came to your brother Esau , and ( E ) he is coming to meet you , and there are four hundred men with him. ”
ESV	Genesis	32	7	Then Jacob was ( F ) greatly afraid and distressed . He divided the people who were with him , and the flocks and herds and camels , into two camps ,
ESV	Genesis	32	8	thinking , “ If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it , then the camp that is left will escape. ”
ESV	Genesis	32	9	And Jacob said , ( G ) “ O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac , O Lord who ( H ) said to me , ‘ Return to your country and to your kindred , that I may do you good , ’
ESV	Genesis	32	10	( I ) I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant , for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan , and now I have become two camps .
ESV	Genesis	32	11	Please deliver me from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau , for ( J ) I fear him , that he may come and attack me , the mothers with the children .
ESV	Genesis	32	12	But ( K ) you said , ‘ I will surely do you good , and make your offspring as the sand of the sea , which can not be numbered for multitude. ’ ”
ESV	Genesis	32	13	So he stayed there that night , and from what he had with him he took ( L ) a present for his brother Esau ,
ESV	Genesis	32	14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats , two hundred ewes and twenty rams ,
ESV	Genesis	32	15	thirty milking camels and their calves , forty cows and ten bulls , twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys .
ESV	Genesis	32	16	These he handed over to his servants , every drove by itself , and said to his servants , “ Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove. ”
ESV	Genesis	32	17	He instructed the first , “ When Esau my brother meets you and asks you , ‘ To whom do you belong ? Where are you going ? And whose are these ahead of you ? ’
ESV	Genesis	32	18	then you shall say , ‘ They belong to your servant Jacob . They are a present sent to my lord Esau . And moreover , he is behind us. ’ ”
ESV	Genesis	32	19	He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves , “ You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him ,
ESV	Genesis	32	20	and you shall say , ‘ Moreover , your servant Jacob is behind us. ’ ” For he thought , “ I may appease him [ c ] with the present that goes ahead of me , and afterward I shall see his face . Perhaps he will accept me. ” [ d ]
ESV	Genesis	32	21	So the present passed on ahead of him , and he himself stayed that night in the camp . Jacob Wrestles with God
ESV	Genesis	32	22	The same night he arose and took his two wives , his two female servants , and his eleven children , [ e ] and crossed the ford of the ( M ) Jabbok .
ESV	Genesis	32	23	He took them and sent them across the stream , and everything else that he had .
ESV	Genesis	32	24	And Jacob was left alone . And ( N ) a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day .
ESV	Genesis	32	25	When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob , he touched his hip socket , and Jacob 's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him .
ESV	Genesis	32	26	Then he said , “ Let me go , for the day has broken. ” But Jacob said , ( O ) “ I will not let you go unless you bless me. ”
ESV	Genesis	32	27	And he said to him , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ Jacob. ”
ESV	Genesis	32	28	Then he said , ( P ) “ Your name shall no longer be called Jacob , but Israel , [ f ] for ( Q ) you have striven with God and ( R ) with men , and have prevailed. ”
ESV	Genesis	32	29	Then Jacob asked him , “ Please tell me your name. ” But he said , ( S ) “ Why is it that you ask my name ? ” And there he blessed him .
ESV	Genesis	32	30	So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel , [ g ] saying , “ For ( T ) I have seen God face to face , and yet my life has been delivered. ”
ESV	Genesis	32	31	The sun rose upon him as he passed ( U ) Penuel , limping because of his hip .

ESV	Genesis	33	33	And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , ( A ) Esau was coming , and four hundred men with him . So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants .
ESV	Genesis	33	2	And he put the servants with their children in front , then Leah with her children , and Rachel and Joseph last of all .
ESV	Genesis	33	3	He himself went on before them , ( B ) bowing himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
ESV	Genesis	33	4	( C ) But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him ( D ) and fell on his neck and kissed him , and they wept .
ESV	Genesis	33	5	And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children , he said , “ Who are these with you ? ” Jacob said , ( E ) “ The children whom God has graciously given your servant. ”
ESV	Genesis	33	6	Then the servants drew near , they and their children , and bowed down .
ESV	Genesis	33	7	Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down . And last Joseph and Rachel drew near , and they bowed down .
ESV	Genesis	33	8	Esau said , “ What do you mean by ( F ) all this company [ a ] that I met ? ” Jacob answered , ( G ) “ To find favor in the sight of my lord. ”
ESV	Genesis	33	9	But Esau said , “ I have enough , my brother ; keep what you have for yourself. ”
ESV	Genesis	33	10	Jacob said , “ No , please , if I have found favor in your sight , then accept my present from my hand . ( H ) For I have seen your face , which is like seeing the face of God , and you have accepted me .
ESV	Genesis	33	11	Please accept my ( I ) blessing that is brought to you , because God has dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough. ” Thus he ( J ) urged him , and he took it .
ESV	Genesis	33	12	Then Esau said , “ Let us journey on our way , and I will go ahead of [ b ] you. ”
ESV	Genesis	33	13	But Jacob said to him , “ My lord knows that the children are frail , and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me . If they are driven hard for one day , all the flocks will die .
ESV	Genesis	33	14	Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant , and I will lead on slowly , at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children , until I come to my lord ( K ) in Seir. ”
ESV	Genesis	33	15	So Esau said , “ Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me. ” But he said , “ What need is there ? ( L ) Let me find favor in the sight of my lord. ”
ESV	Genesis	33	16	So Esau returned that day on his way to ( M ) Seir .
ESV	Genesis	33	17	But Jacob journeyed to ( N ) Succoth , and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock . Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth . [ c ]
ESV	Genesis	33	18	And Jacob came safely [ d ] to the city of ( O ) Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , on his way from Paddan-aram , and he camped before the city .
ESV	Genesis	33	19	And from the sons of ( P ) Hamor , Shechem 's father , ( Q ) he bought for a hundred pieces of money [ e ] the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent .

ESV	Genesis	34	34	Now ( A ) Dinah the daughter of Leah , whom she had borne to Jacob , went out to see the women of the land .
ESV	Genesis	34	2	And when Shechem the son of ( B ) Hamor the Hivite , the prince of the land , saw her , he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her .
ESV	Genesis	34	3	And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob . He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her .
ESV	Genesis	34	4	So Shechem ( C ) spoke to his father Hamor , saying , “ Get me this girl for my wife. ”
ESV	Genesis	34	5	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah . But his sons were with his livestock in the field , so Jacob held his peace until they came .
ESV	Genesis	34	6	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him .
ESV	Genesis	34	7	The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it , and the men were indignant and ( D ) very angry , because he ( E ) had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob 's daughter , ( F ) for such a thing must not be done .
ESV	Genesis	34	8	But Hamor spoke with them , saying , “ The soul of my son Shechem longs for your [ a ] daughter . Please give her to him to be his wife .
ESV	Genesis	34	9	Make marriages with us . Give your daughters to us , and take our daughters for yourselves .
ESV	Genesis	34	10	You shall dwell with us , and ( G ) the land shall be open to you . Dwell and ( H ) trade in it , and ( I ) get property in it. ”
ESV	Genesis	34	11	Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers , ( J ) “ Let me find favor in your eyes , and whatever you say to me I will give .
ESV	Genesis	34	12	Ask me for as great a ( K ) bride-price [ b ] and gift as you will , and I will give whatever you say to me . Only give me the young woman to be my wife. ”
ESV	Genesis	34	13	The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully , because he had defiled their sister Dinah .
ESV	Genesis	34	14	They said to them , “ We can not do this thing , to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised , for ( L ) that would be a disgrace to us .
ESV	Genesis	34	15	Only on this condition will we agree with you—that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised .
ESV	Genesis	34	16	Then we will give our daughters to you , and we will take your daughters to ourselves , and we will dwell with you and become one people .
ESV	Genesis	34	17	But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised , then we will take our daughter , and we will be gone. ”
ESV	Genesis	34	18	Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor 's son Shechem .
ESV	Genesis	34	19	And the young man did not delay to do the thing , because he delighted in Jacob 's daughter . Now ( M ) he was the most honored of all his father 's house .
ESV	Genesis	34	20	So Hamor and his son Shechem ( N ) came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city , saying ,
ESV	Genesis	34	21	“ These men are at peace with us ; let them dwell in the land and ( O ) trade in it , for behold , the land is large enough for them . Let us take their daughters as wives , and let us give them our daughters .
ESV	Genesis	34	22	Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us to become one people—when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised .
ESV	Genesis	34	23	Will not their livestock , their property and all their beasts be ours ? Only let us agree with them , and they will dwell with us. ”
ESV	Genesis	34	24	And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem , and every male was circumcised , all who ( P ) went out of the gate of his city .
ESV	Genesis	34	25	On the third day , when they were sore , two of the sons of Jacob , ( Q ) Simeon and Levi , ( R ) Dinah 's brothers , took their swords and came against the city while it felt secure and killed all the males .
ESV	Genesis	34	26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house and went away .
ESV	Genesis	34	27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city , because they had defiled their sister .
ESV	Genesis	34	28	They took their flocks and their herds , their donkeys , and whatever was in the city and in the field .
ESV	Genesis	34	29	All their wealth , all their little ones and their wives , all that was in the houses , they captured and plundered .
ESV	Genesis	34	30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , ( S ) “ You have brought trouble on me ( T ) by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land , ( U ) the Canaanites and the Perizzites . ( V ) My numbers are few , and if they gather themselves against me and attack me , I shall be destroyed , both I and my household. ”

ESV	Genesis	35	35	God said to Jacob , “ Arise , go up to ( A ) Bethel and dwell there . Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you ( B ) when you fled from your brother Esau. ”
ESV	Genesis	35	2	So Jacob said to his ( C ) household and to all who were with him , “ Put away ( D ) the foreign gods that are among you and ( E ) purify yourselves and change your garments .
ESV	Genesis	35	3	Then let us arise and go up to Bethel , so that I may make there an altar to the God ( F ) who answers me in the day of my distress and ( G ) has been with me wherever I have gone. ”
ESV	Genesis	35	4	So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had , and the rings that were in their ears . Jacob hid them under ( H ) the terebinth tree that was near Shechem .
ESV	Genesis	35	5	And as they journeyed , a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them , so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob .

ESV	Genesis	35	10	And God said to him , “ Your name is Jacob ; ( L ) no longer shall your name be called Jacob , but ( M ) Israel shall be your name. ” So he called his name Israel .
ESV	Genesis	35	11	And God said to him , ( N ) “ I am God Almighty : [ d ] be ( O ) fruitful and multiply . ( P ) A nation and a company of nations shall come from you , and kings shall come from your own body . [ e ]
ESV	Genesis	35	12	( Q ) The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you , and I will give the land to your offspring after you. ”
ESV	Genesis	35	13	Then God ( R ) went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him .
ESV	Genesis	35	14	And Jacob ( S ) set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him , a pillar of stone . He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it .
ESV	Genesis	35	15	So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him ( T ) Bethel . The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac
ESV	Genesis	35	16	Then they journeyed from Bethel . When they were still some distance [ f ] from Ephrath , Rachel went into labor , and she had hard labor .
ESV	Genesis	35	17	And when her labor was at its hardest , the midwife said to her , “ Do not fear , for ( U ) you have another son. ”
ESV	Genesis	35	18	And as her soul was departing ( for she was dying ) , she called his name Ben-oni ; [ g ] ( V ) but his father called him Benjamin . [ h ]

ESV	Genesis	37	37	Jacob lived in ( A ) the land of his father 's sojournings , in the land of Canaan .
ESV	Genesis	37	2	These are the generations of Jacob . Joseph , being seventeen years old , was pasturing the flock with his brothers . He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah , his father 's wives . And Joseph brought ( B ) a bad report of them to their father .
ESV	Genesis	37	3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons , because he was ( C ) the son of his old age . And he made him ( D ) a robe of many colors . [ a ]
ESV	Genesis	37	4	But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers , they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him .
ESV	Genesis	37	5	Now Joseph had a dream , and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more .
ESV	Genesis	37	6	He said to them , “ Hear this dream that I have dreamed :
ESV	Genesis	37	7	Behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and behold , ( E ) my sheaf arose and stood upright . And behold , your sheaves gathered around it and ( F ) bowed down to my sheaf. ”
ESV	Genesis	37	8	His brothers said to him , “ Are you indeed to reign over us ? Or are you indeed to rule over us ? ” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words .
ESV	Genesis	37	9	Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said , “ Behold , I have dreamed another dream . Behold , the sun , the moon , and eleven stars were bowing down to me. ”
ESV	Genesis	37	10	But when he told it to his father and to his brothers , his father rebuked him and said to him , “ What is this dream that you have dreamed ? Shall I and ( G ) your mother and your brothers indeed come ( H ) to bow ourselves to the ground before you ? ”

ESV	Genesis	37	12	Now his brothers went to pasture their father 's flock near ( K ) Shechem .
ESV	Genesis	37	13	And Israel said to Joseph , “ Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem ? Come , I will send you to them. ” And he said to him , “ Here I am. ”
ESV	Genesis	37	14	So he said to him , “ Go now , see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock , and bring me word. ” So he sent him from the Valley of ( L ) Hebron , and he came to Shechem .
ESV	Genesis	37	15	And a man found him wandering in the fields . And the man asked him , “ What are you seeking ? ”
ESV	Genesis	37	16	“ I am seeking my brothers , ” he said . “ Tell me , please , where they are pasturing the flock. ”
ESV	Genesis	37	17	And the man said , “ They have gone away , for I heard them say , ‘ Let us go to ( M ) Dothan. ’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at ( N ) Dothan .
ESV	Genesis	37	18	They saw him from afar , and before he came near to them ( O ) they conspired against him to kill him .
ESV	Genesis	37	19	They said to one another , “ Here comes this dreamer .
ESV	Genesis	37	20	Come now , ( P ) let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits . [ b ] Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him , and we will see what will become of his dreams. ”

ESV	Genesis	37	26	Then Judah said to his brothers , “ What profit is it ( X ) if we kill our brother and conceal his blood ?
ESV	Genesis	37	27	Come , let us sell him to the Ishmaelites , and ( Y ) let not our hand be upon him , for he is our brother , our own flesh. ” And his brothers listened to him .

ESV	Genesis	38	38	It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and ( A ) turned aside to a certain ( B ) Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
ESV	Genesis	38	2	There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was ( C ) Shua . He took her and went in to her ,
ESV	Genesis	38	3	and she conceived and bore a son , and he called his name ( D ) Er .
ESV	Genesis	38	4	She conceived again and bore a son , and she called his name ( E ) Onan .
ESV	Genesis	38	5	Yet again she bore a son , and she called his name ( F ) Shelah . Judah [ a ] was in Chezib when she bore him .
ESV	Genesis	38	6	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn , and her name was Tamar .
ESV	Genesis	38	7	But Er , Judah 's firstborn , ( G ) was wicked in the sight of the Lord , and the Lord put him to death .
ESV	Genesis	38	8	Then Judah said to Onan , “ Go in to ( H ) your brother 's wife and ( I ) perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her , and raise up offspring for your brother. ”
ESV	Genesis	38	9	But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his . So whenever he went in to his brother 's wife he would waste the semen on the ground , so as not to give offspring to his brother .
ESV	Genesis	38	10	And what he did was wicked in the sight of the Lord , and he put him to death also .
ESV	Genesis	38	11	Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law , ( J ) “ Remain a widow in your father 's house , till Shelah my son grows up ” —for he feared that he would die , like his brothers . So Tamar went and remained ( K ) in her father 's house .
ESV	Genesis	38	12	In the course of time the wife of Judah , Shua 's daughter , died . When Judah ( L ) was comforted , he went up to ( M ) Timnah to his sheepshearers , he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite .
ESV	Genesis	38	13	And when Tamar was told , “ Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep , ”
ESV	Genesis	38	14	she took off her widow 's garments ( N ) and covered herself with a veil , wrapping herself up , and sat at the entrance to ( O ) Enaim , which is on the road to Timnah . For she saw that Shelah was grown up , ( P ) and she had not been given to him in marriage .
ESV	Genesis	38	15	When Judah saw her , he thought she was a prostitute , for she had covered her face .
ESV	Genesis	38	16	He turned to her at the roadside and said , “ Come , let me come in to you , ” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law . She said , “ What will you give me , that you may come in to me ? ”
ESV	Genesis	38	17	He answered , “ I will send you a young goat from the flock. ” And she said , “ If you give me a pledge , until you send it— ”
ESV	Genesis	38	18	He said , “ What pledge shall I give you ? ” She replied , ( Q ) “ Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand. ” So he gave them to her and went in to her , and she conceived by him .
ESV	Genesis	38	19	Then she arose and went away , and taking off ( R ) her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood .
ESV	Genesis	38	20	When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman 's hand , he did not find her .
ESV	Genesis	38	21	And he asked the men of the place , “ Where is the cult prostitute [ b ] who was at ( S ) Enaim at the roadside ? ” And they said , “ No cult prostitute has been here. ”

ESV	Genesis	38	24	About three months later Judah was told , “ Tamar your daughter-in-law ( T ) has been immoral . [ c ] Moreover , she is pregnant by immorality. ” [ d ] And Judah said , “ Bring her out , and ( U ) let her be burned. ”
ESV	Genesis	38	25	As she was being brought out , she sent word to her father-in-law , “ By the man to whom these belong , I am pregnant. ” And she said , “ Please identify whose these are , ( V ) the signet and the cord and the staff. ”
ESV	Genesis	38	26	Then Judah identified them and said , ( W ) “ She is more righteous than I , since ( X ) I did not give her to my son Shelah. ” And he did not know her again .
ESV	Genesis	38	27	When the time of her labor came , there were twins in her womb .
ESV	Genesis	38	28	And when she was in labor , one put out a hand , and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand , saying , “ This one came out first. ”
ESV	Genesis	38	29	But as he drew back his hand , behold , his brother came out . And she said , “ What a breach you have made for yourself ! ” Therefore his name was called ( Y ) Perez . [ e ]

ESV	Genesis	39	39	Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt , and ( A ) Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , ( B ) had bought him from the ( C ) Ishmaelites who had brought him down there .
ESV	Genesis	39	2	( D ) The Lord was with Joseph , and he became a successful man , and he was in the house of his Egyptian master .
ESV	Genesis	39	3	His master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord ( E ) caused all that he did to succeed in his hands .
ESV	Genesis	39	4	So Joseph ( F ) found favor in his sight and attended him , and he made him overseer of his house ( G ) and put him in charge of all that he had .
ESV	Genesis	39	5	From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had , the Lord blessed the Egyptian 's house ( H ) for Joseph 's sake ; the blessing of the Lord was on all that he had , in house and field .
ESV	Genesis	39	6	So he left all that he had in Joseph 's charge , and because of him he had no concern about anything but the food he ate . Now Joseph was ( I ) handsome in form and appearance .
ESV	Genesis	39	7	And after a time his master 's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said , “ Lie with me. ”
ESV	Genesis	39	8	But he refused and said to his master 's wife , “ Behold , because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house , and ( J ) he has put everything that he has in my charge .
ESV	Genesis	39	9	He is not greater in this house than I am , nor has he kept back anything from me except you , because you are his wife . How then can I do this great wickedness and ( K ) sin against God ? ”
ESV	Genesis	39	10	And as she spoke to Joseph day after day , he ( L ) would not listen to her , to lie beside her or to be with her .
ESV	Genesis	39	11	But one day , when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house ,
ESV	Genesis	39	12	( M ) she caught him by his garment , saying , “ Lie with me. ” But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house .
ESV	Genesis	39	13	And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house ,
ESV	Genesis	39	14	she called to the men of her household and said to them , “ See , he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us . He came in to me to lie with me , and I cried out with a loud voice .
ESV	Genesis	39	15	And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out , he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house. ”
ESV	Genesis	39	16	Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home ,
ESV	Genesis	39	17	and she told him the same story , saying , “ The Hebrew servant , whom you have brought among us , came in to me to laugh at me .
ESV	Genesis	39	18	But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried , he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house. ”
ESV	Genesis	39	19	As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him , “ This is the way your servant treated me , ” his anger was kindled .

ESV	Genesis	40	40	Some time after this , the ( A ) cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt .
ESV	Genesis	40	2	And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers , the chief cupbearer and the chief baker ,
ESV	Genesis	40	3	( B ) and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , in the prison where Joseph was confined .
ESV	Genesis	40	4	The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them , and he attended them . They continued for some time in custody .
ESV	Genesis	40	5	And one night they both dreamed—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt , who were confined in the prison—each his own dream , and each dream with its own interpretation .
ESV	Genesis	40	6	When Joseph came to them in the morning , he saw that they were troubled .
ESV	Genesis	40	7	So he asked Pharaoh 's officers who were with him in custody in his master 's house , ( C ) “ Why are your faces downcast today ? ”
ESV	Genesis	40	8	They said to him , ( D ) “ We have had dreams , and there is no one to interpret them. ” And Joseph said to them , ( E ) “ Do not interpretations belong to God ? Please tell them to me. ”
ESV	Genesis	40	9	So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him , “ In my dream there was a vine before me ,
ESV	Genesis	40	10	and on the vine there were three branches . As soon as it budded , its blossoms shot forth , and the clusters ripened into grapes .
ESV	Genesis	40	11	Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand , and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh 's hand. ”
ESV	Genesis	40	12	Then Joseph said to him , ( F ) “ This is its interpretation : ( G ) the three branches are three days .
ESV	Genesis	40	13	In three days Pharaoh will ( H ) lift up your head and restore you to your office , and you shall place Pharaoh 's cup in his hand as formerly , when you were his cupbearer .
ESV	Genesis	40	14	Only remember me , when it is well with you , and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh , and so get me out of this house .
ESV	Genesis	40	15	For ( I ) I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews , and ( J ) here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit. ”
ESV	Genesis	40	16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable , he said to Joseph , “ I also had a dream : there were three cake baskets on my head ,
ESV	Genesis	40	17	and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh , but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head. ”
ESV	Genesis	40	18	And Joseph answered and said , ( K ) “ This is its interpretation : the three baskets are three days .
ESV	Genesis	40	19	( L ) In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—from you ! —and ( M ) hang you on a tree . And the birds will eat the flesh from you. ”
ESV	Genesis	40	20	On the third day , which was Pharaoh 's ( N ) birthday , he made a feast for all his servants and ( O ) lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants .
ESV	Genesis	40	21	( P ) He restored the chief cupbearer to his position , and ( Q ) he placed the cup in Pharaoh 's hand .
ESV	Genesis	40	22	But he ( R ) hanged the chief baker , as Joseph had interpreted to them .

ESV	Genesis	41	41	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ See , ( AA ) I have set you over all the land of Egypt. ”
ESV	Genesis	41	2	and behold , there came up out of the Nile seven cows , attractive and plump , and they fed in the reed grass .
ESV	Genesis	41	3	And behold , seven other cows , ugly and thin , came up out of the Nile after them , and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile .

ESV	Genesis	41	13	And ( H ) as he interpreted to us , so it came about . I was restored to my office , and the baker was hanged. ”
ESV	Genesis	41	14	( I ) Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they ( J ) quickly brought him ( K ) out of the pit . And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes , he came in before Pharaoh .
ESV	Genesis	41	15	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ I have had a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it . ( L ) I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it. ”
ESV	Genesis	41	16	Joseph answered Pharaoh , ( M ) “ It is not in me ; ( N ) God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer. ” [ a ]
ESV	Genesis	41	17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Behold , ( O ) in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile .
ESV	Genesis	41	18	Seven cows , plump and attractive , came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass .
ESV	Genesis	41	19	Seven other cows came up after them , poor and very ugly and thin , such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt .
ESV	Genesis	41	20	And the thin , ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows ,
ESV	Genesis	41	21	but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them , for they were still as ugly as at the beginning . Then I awoke .
ESV	Genesis	41	22	I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk , full and good .
ESV	Genesis	41	23	Seven ears , withered , thin , and blighted by the east wind , sprouted after them ,
ESV	Genesis	41	24	and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears . And ( P ) I told it to the magicians , but there was no one who could explain it to me. ”
ESV	Genesis	41	25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh , “ The dreams of Pharaoh are one ; ( Q ) God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do .
ESV	Genesis	41	26	The seven good cows are seven years , and the seven good ears are seven years ; the dreams are one .
ESV	Genesis	41	27	The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years , and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also ( R ) seven years of famine .
ESV	Genesis	41	28	It is as I told Pharaoh ; ( S ) God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do .
ESV	Genesis	41	29	There will come ( T ) seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt ,
ESV	Genesis	41	30	but after them there will arise ( U ) seven years of famine , and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt . ( V ) The famine will consume the land ,
ESV	Genesis	41	31	and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow , for it will be very severe .
ESV	Genesis	41	32	And the doubling of Pharaoh 's dream means that the ( W ) thing is fixed by God , and God will shortly bring it about .
ESV	Genesis	41	33	Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man , and set him over the land of Egypt .
ESV	Genesis	41	34	Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land [ b ] of Egypt during the seven plentiful years .
ESV	Genesis	41	35	And ( X ) let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
ESV	Genesis	41	36	That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt , so that the land may not perish through the famine. ” Joseph Rises to Power
ESV	Genesis	41	37	This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants .
ESV	Genesis	41	38	And Pharaoh said to his servants , “ Can we find a man like this , ( Y ) in whom is the Spirit of God ? ” [ c ]
ESV	Genesis	41	39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Since God has shown you all this , there is none so discerning and wise as you are .
ESV	Genesis	41	40	( Z ) You shall be over my house , and all my people shall order themselves as you command . [ d ] Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you. ”
ESV	Genesis	41	42	Then Pharaoh ( AB ) took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph 's hand , and ( AC ) clothed him in garments of fine linen ( AD ) and put a gold chain about his neck .
ESV	Genesis	41	43	And he made him ride in his second chariot . ( AE ) And they called out before him , “ Bow the knee ! ” [ e ] Thus he set him ( AF ) over all the land of Egypt .
ESV	Genesis	41	44	Moreover , Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ I am Pharaoh , and ( AG ) without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. ”
ESV	Genesis	41	45	And Pharaoh called Joseph 's name Zaphenath-paneah . And he gave him in marriage Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera priest of On . So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt .
ESV	Genesis	41	46	Joseph was thirty years old when he ( AH ) entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt . And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt .
ESV	Genesis	41	47	During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly ,
ESV	Genesis	41	48	and he gathered up all the food of these seven years , which occurred in the land of Egypt , and put the food in the cities . He put in every city the food from the fields around it .
ESV	Genesis	41	49	And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance , ( AI ) like the sand of the sea , until he ceased to measure it , for it could not be measured .
ESV	Genesis	41	50	Before the year of famine came , ( AJ ) two sons were born to Joseph . Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera priest of On , bore them to him .
ESV	Genesis	41	51	Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh . “ For , ” he said , “ God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father 's house. ” [ f ]
ESV	Genesis	41	52	The name of the second he called Ephraim , “ For God has ( AK ) made me fruitful in the land of my affliction. ” [ g ]
ESV	Genesis	41	53	The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end ,
ESV	Genesis	41	54	and ( AL ) the seven years of famine began to come , ( AM ) as Joseph had said . There was famine in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
ESV	Genesis	41	55	When all the land of Egypt was famished , the people cried to Pharaoh for bread . Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians , “ Go to Joseph . What he says to you , do. ”
ESV	Genesis	41	56	So when the famine had spread over all the land , Joseph opened all the storehouses [ h ] and ( AN ) sold to the Egyptians , for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt .
ESV	Genesis	41	57	Moreover , all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain , because the famine was severe ( AO ) over all the earth .

ESV	Genesis	42	42	When ( A ) Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt , he said to his sons , “ Why do you look at one another ? ”
ESV	Genesis	42	2	And he said , “ Behold , I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt . Go down and buy grain for us there , that we may ( B ) live and not die. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	3	So ten of Joseph 's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt .
ESV	Genesis	42	4	But Jacob did not send Benjamin , ( C ) Joseph 's brother , with his brothers , for ( D ) he feared that harm might happen to him .
ESV	Genesis	42	5	Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came , for the famine was in the land of Canaan .
ESV	Genesis	42	6	Now Joseph was governor ( E ) over the land . He was the one who sold to all the people of the land . And Joseph 's brothers came and ( F ) bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground .
ESV	Genesis	42	7	Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them , but he treated them like strangers and ( G ) spoke roughly to them . “ Where do you come from ? ” he said . They said , “ From the land of Canaan , to buy food. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	8	And Joseph recognized his brothers , but they did not recognize him .
ESV	Genesis	42	9	And Joseph ( H ) remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them . ( I ) And he said to them , “ You are spies ; you have come to see the nakedness of the land. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	10	They said to him , “ No , my lord , your servants have come to buy food .
ESV	Genesis	42	11	We are all sons of one man . We are honest men . Your servants have never been spies. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	12	He said to them , “ No , it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	13	And they said , “ We , your servants , are twelve brothers , the sons of one man in the land of Canaan , and behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one ( J ) is no more. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	14	But Joseph said to them , “ It is as I said to you . You are spies .
ESV	Genesis	42	15	By this you shall be tested : by the life of Pharaoh , you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here .
ESV	Genesis	42	16	Send one of you , and let him bring your brother , while you remain confined , that your words may be tested , whether there is truth in you . Or else , by the life of Pharaoh , surely you are spies. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	17	And he put them all together in custody for three days .
ESV	Genesis	42	18	On the third day Joseph said to them , “ Do this and you will live , ( K ) for I fear God :
ESV	Genesis	42	19	if you are honest men , let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody , and let the rest go and carry ( L ) grain for the famine of your households ,
ESV	Genesis	42	20	and ( M ) bring your youngest brother to me . So your words will be verified , and you shall not die. ” And they did so .
ESV	Genesis	42	21	Then they said to one another , ( N ) “ In truth we are guilty concerning our brother , in that we saw the distress of his soul , when he begged us and we did not listen . That is why this distress has come upon us. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	22	And Reuben answered them , ( O ) “ Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy ? But you did not listen . So now ( P ) there comes a reckoning for his blood. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	23	They did not know that Joseph understood them , for there was an interpreter between them .
ESV	Genesis	42	24	Then he turned away from them and ( Q ) wept . And he returned to them and spoke to them . And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes .
ESV	Genesis	42	25	( R ) And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain , and to replace every man 's money in his sack , and to give them provisions for the journey . This was done for them .
ESV	Genesis	42	26	Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed .
ESV	Genesis	42	27	And as ( S ) one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at ( T ) the lodging place , he saw his money in the mouth of his sack .
ESV	Genesis	42	28	He said to his brothers , “ My money has been put back ; here it is in the mouth of my sack ! ” At this their hearts failed them , and they turned trembling to one another , saying , “ What is this that God has done to us ? ”
ESV	Genesis	42	29	When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan , they told him all that had happened to them , saying ,
ESV	Genesis	42	30	“ The man , the lord of the land , ( U ) spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land .
ESV	Genesis	42	31	But we said to him , ‘ We are honest men ; we have never been spies .
ESV	Genesis	42	32	We are twelve brothers , sons of our father . One ( V ) is no more , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. ’
ESV	Genesis	42	33	Then the man , the lord of the land , said to us , ( W ) ‘ By this I shall know that you are honest men : leave one of your brothers with me , and take ( X ) grain for the famine of your households , and go your way .
ESV	Genesis	42	34	Bring your youngest brother to me . Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men , and I will deliver your brother to you , and you shall ( Y ) trade in the land. ’ ”
ESV	Genesis	42	35	( Z ) As they emptied their sacks , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack . And when they and their father saw their bundles of money , they were afraid .
ESV	Genesis	42	36	And Jacob their father said to them , “ You have ( AA ) bereaved me of my children : Joseph is no more , and Simeon is no more , and now you would take Benjamin . All this has come against me. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	37	Then Reuben said to his father , “ Kill ( AB ) my two sons if I do not bring him back to you . Put him in my hands , and I will bring him back to you. ”
ESV	Genesis	42	38	But he said , “ My son shall not go down with you , for ( AC ) his brother is dead , and he is the only one left . ( AD ) If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make , ( AE ) you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol. ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Genesis	43	43	Now the famine was ( A ) severe in the land .
ESV	Genesis	43	2	And when they had eaten the grain that they had brought from Egypt , their father said to them , “ Go again , buy us a little food. ”
ESV	Genesis	43	3	But Judah said to him , “ The man solemnly warned us , saying , ‘ You shall not see my face unless your ( B ) brother is with you. ’
ESV	Genesis	43	4	If you will send our brother with us , we will go down and buy you food .
ESV	Genesis	43	5	But if you will not send him , we will not go down , for the man said to us , ‘ You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you. ’ ”
ESV	Genesis	43	6	Israel said , “ Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother ? ”
ESV	Genesis	43	7	They replied , “ The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred , saying , ‘ Is your father still alive ? Do you have another brother ? ’ What we told him was in answer to these questions . Could we in any way know that he would say , ‘ Bring your brother down ’ ? ”
ESV	Genesis	43	8	And Judah said to Israel his father , “ Send the boy with me , and we will arise and go , that we may ( C ) live and not die , both we and you and also our little ones .
ESV	Genesis	43	9	I will be a pledge of his safety . From my hand you shall require him . ( D ) If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you , then let me bear the blame forever .
ESV	Genesis	43	10	If we had not delayed , we would now have returned twice. ”
ESV	Genesis	43	11	Then their father Israel said to them , “ If it must be so , then do this : take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags , and carry a present down to the man , a little ( E ) balm and a little honey , gum , myrrh , pistachio nuts , and almonds .
ESV	Genesis	43	12	Take double the money with you . Carry back with you the money ( F ) that was returned in the mouth of your sacks . Perhaps it was an oversight .
ESV	Genesis	43	13	Take also your brother , and arise , go again to the man .
ESV	Genesis	43	14	May ( G ) God Almighty [ a ] ( H ) grant you mercy before the man , and may he send back your other brother and Benjamin . And as for me , ( I ) if I am bereaved of my children , I am bereaved. ”
ESV	Genesis	43	15	So the men took this present , and they took double the money with them , and Benjamin . They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph .
ESV	Genesis	43	16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the ( J ) steward of his house , “ Bring the men into the house , and slaughter an animal and make ready , for the men are to dine with me at noon. ”
ESV	Genesis	43	17	The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph 's house .
ESV	Genesis	43	18	And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph 's house , and they said , “ It is because of the money , which was replaced in our sacks the first time , that we are brought in , so that he may assault us and fall upon us to make us servants and seize our donkeys. ”
ESV	Genesis	43	19	So they went up to the steward of Joseph 's house and spoke with him at the door of the house ,
ESV	Genesis	43	20	and said , ( K ) “ Oh , my lord , ( L ) we came down the first time to buy food .
ESV	Genesis	43	21	And ( M ) when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks , and there was each man 's money in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight . So we have brought it again with us ,
ESV	Genesis	43	22	and we have brought other money down with us to buy food . We do not know who put our money in our sacks. ”
ESV	Genesis	43	23	He replied , “ Peace to you , do not be afraid . Your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you . I received your money. ” Then he brought Simeon out to them .
ESV	Genesis	43	24	And when the man had brought the men into Joseph 's house and ( N ) given them water , and they had washed their feet , and when he had given their donkeys fodder ,
ESV	Genesis	43	25	they prepared ( O ) the present for Joseph 's coming at noon , for they heard that they should eat bread there .
ESV	Genesis	43	26	When Joseph came home , they brought into the house to him the present that they had with them and ( P ) bowed down to him to the ground .
ESV	Genesis	43	27	And he inquired about their welfare and said , “ Is your father well , the old man ( Q ) of whom you spoke ? Is he still alive ? ”
ESV	Genesis	43	28	They said , “ Your servant our father is well ; he is still alive. ” And they ( R ) bowed their heads and prostrated themselves .
ESV	Genesis	43	29	And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin , ( S ) his mother 's son , and said , “ Is this your youngest brother , ( T ) of whom you spoke to me ? God be gracious to you , my son ! ”
ESV	Genesis	43	30	Then Joseph hurried out , for ( U ) his compassion grew warm for his brother , and he sought a place to weep . And he entered his chamber and ( V ) wept there .
ESV	Genesis	43	31	Then he washed his face and came out . And ( W ) controlling himself he said , “ Serve the food. ”
ESV	Genesis	43	32	They served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves , because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews , for that is ( X ) an abomination to the Egyptians .
ESV	Genesis	43	33	And they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth . And the men looked at one another in amazement .
ESV	Genesis	43	34	( Y ) Portions were taken to them from Joseph 's table , but Benjamin 's portion was ( Z ) five times as much as any of theirs . And they drank and were merry [ b ] with him .

ESV	Genesis	44	44	Then he commanded ( A ) the steward of his house , ( B ) “ Fill the men 's sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put each man 's money in the mouth of his sack ,
ESV	Genesis	44	2	and put my cup , the silver cup , in the mouth of the sack of the youngest , with his money for the grain. ” And he did as Joseph told him .
ESV	Genesis	44	3	As soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away with their donkeys .
ESV	Genesis	44	4	They had gone only a short distance from the city . Now Joseph said to his ( C ) steward , “ Up , follow after the men , and when you overtake them , say to them , ‘ Why have you repaid evil for good ? [ a ]
ESV	Genesis	44	5	Is it not from this that my lord drinks , and ( D ) by this that he practices divination ? You have done evil in doing this. ’ ”
ESV	Genesis	44	6	When he overtook them , he spoke to them these words .
ESV	Genesis	44	7	They said to him , “ Why does my lord speak such words as these ? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing !
ESV	Genesis	44	8	Behold , ( E ) the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan . How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord 's house ?
ESV	Genesis	44	9	( F ) Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die , and we also will be ( G ) my lord 's servants. ”
ESV	Genesis	44	10	He said , “ Let it be as you say : he who is found with it shall be my servant , and the rest of you shall be innocent. ”
ESV	Genesis	44	11	Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground , and each man opened his sack .
ESV	Genesis	44	12	And he searched , beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest . And the cup was found in Benjamin 's sack .
ESV	Genesis	44	13	Then they ( H ) tore their clothes , and every man loaded his donkey , and they returned to the city .
ESV	Genesis	44	14	When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph 's house , he was still there . They ( I ) fell before him to the ground .
ESV	Genesis	44	15	Joseph said to them , “ What deed is this that you have done ? Do you not know that a man like me ( J ) can indeed practice divination ? ”
ESV	Genesis	44	16	And Judah said , “ What shall we say to my lord ? What shall we speak ? Or how can we clear ourselves ? God has found out ( K ) the guilt of your servants ; behold , we are ( L ) my lord 's servants , both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found. ”
ESV	Genesis	44	17	But he said , “ Far be it from me that I should do so ! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant . But as for you , go up in peace to your father. ”
ESV	Genesis	44	18	Then Judah went up to him and said , ( M ) “ Oh , my lord , please let your servant speak a word in my lord 's ears , and ( N ) let not your anger burn against your servant , for ( O ) you are like Pharaoh himself .
ESV	Genesis	44	19	My lord asked his servants , saying , ‘ Have you a father , or a brother ? ’
ESV	Genesis	44	20	And we said to my lord , ‘ We have a father , an old man , ( P ) and a young brother , ( Q ) the child of his old age . His brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother 's children , and his father loves him. ’
ESV	Genesis	44	21	Then you said to your servants , ( R ) ‘ Bring him down to me , that I may set my eyes on him. ’
ESV	Genesis	44	22	We said to my lord , ‘ The boy can not leave his father , for if he should leave his father , ( S ) his father would die. ’
ESV	Genesis	44	23	Then you said to your servants , ( T ) ‘ Unless your youngest brother comes down with you , you shall not see my face again. ’
ESV	Genesis	44	24	“ When we went back to your servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
ESV	Genesis	44	25	And when ( U ) our father said , ‘ Go again , buy us a little food , ’
ESV	Genesis	44	26	we said , ‘ We can not go down . If our youngest brother goes with us , then we will go down . For we can not see the man 's face unless our youngest brother is with us. ’
ESV	Genesis	44	27	Then your servant my father said to us , ‘ You know that my wife bore me ( V ) two sons .
ESV	Genesis	44	28	One left me , and I said , ( W ) “ Surely he has been torn to pieces , ” and I have never seen him since .
ESV	Genesis	44	29	If you ( X ) take this one also from me , ( Y ) and harm happens to him , you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol. ’
ESV	Genesis	44	30	“ Now therefore , as soon as I come to your servant my father , and the boy is not with us , then , as his life is bound up in the boy 's life ,
ESV	Genesis	44	31	as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us , he will die , and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol .
ESV	Genesis	44	32	For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father , saying , ( Z ) ‘ If I do not bring him back to you , then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life. ’
ESV	Genesis	44	33	Now therefore , please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord , and let the boy go back with his brothers .
ESV	Genesis	44	34	For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me ? I fear to see the evil that would find my father. ” Footnotes - Genesis 44:4 Septuagint ( compare Vulgate ) adds Why have you stolen my silver cup ? The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Genesis	45	45	Then Joseph could not ( A ) control himself before all those who stood by him . He cried , “ Make everyone go out from me. ” So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
ESV	Genesis	45	2	And he wept aloud , so that the Egyptians heard it , and the household of Pharaoh heard it .
ESV	Genesis	45	3	And Joseph said to his brothers , ( B ) “ I am Joseph ! Is my father still alive ? ” But his brothers could not answer him , for they were dismayed at his presence .
ESV	Genesis	45	4	So Joseph said to his brothers , “ Come near to me , please. ” And they came near . And he said , “ I am your brother , Joseph , ( C ) whom you sold into Egypt .
ESV	Genesis	45	5	And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here , ( D ) for God sent me before you to preserve life .

ESV	Genesis	45	18	and take your father and your households , and come to me , and ( L ) I will give you the best of the land of Egypt , and you shall eat the fat of the land. ’
ESV	Genesis	45	19	And you , Joseph , are commanded to say , ‘ Do this : take ( M ) wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
ESV	Genesis	45	20	Have no concern for [ a ] your goods , for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours. ’ ”
ESV	Genesis	45	21	The sons of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them ( N ) wagons , according to the command of Pharaoh , and gave them provisions for the journey .
ESV	Genesis	45	22	To each and all of them he gave ( O ) a change of clothes , but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels [ b ] of silver and ( P ) five changes of clothes .
ESV	Genesis	45	23	To his father he sent as follows : ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain , bread , and provision for his father on the journey .
ESV	Genesis	45	24	Then he sent his brothers away , and as they departed , he said to them , ( Q ) “ Do not quarrel on the way. ”
ESV	Genesis	45	25	So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob .
ESV	Genesis	45	26	And they told him , “ Joseph is still alive , and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. ” And his heart became numb , for he did not believe them .
ESV	Genesis	45	27	But when they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said to them , and when he saw ( R ) the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of their father Jacob revived .
ESV	Genesis	45	28	And Israel said , “ It is enough ; Joseph my son is still alive . I will go and see him before I die. ” Footnotes - Genesis 45:20 Hebrew Let your eye not pity - Genesis 45:22 A shekel was about 2/5 ounce or

ESV	Genesis	47	47	So Joseph ( A ) went in and told Pharaoh , “ My father and my brothers , with their flocks and herds and all that they possess , have come from the land of Canaan . They are now in ( B ) the land of Goshen. ”
ESV	Genesis	47	2	And from among his brothers he took five men and ( C ) presented them to Pharaoh .
ESV	Genesis	47	3	Pharaoh said to his brothers , ( D ) “ What is your occupation ? ” And they said to Pharaoh , ( E ) “ Your servants are shepherds , as our fathers were. ”
ESV	Genesis	47	4	They said to Pharaoh , ( F ) “ We have come to sojourn in the land , for there is no pasture for your servants ' flocks , for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan . And now , please let your servants dwell ( G ) in the land of Goshen. ”
ESV	Genesis	47	5	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Your father and your brothers have come to you .
ESV	Genesis	47	6	The land of Egypt is before you . Settle your father and your brothers ( H ) in the best of the land . ( I ) Let them settle in the land of Goshen , and if you know any ( J ) able men among them , put them in charge of my livestock. ”
ESV	Genesis	47	7	Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and stood him before Pharaoh , ( K ) and Jacob blessed Pharaoh .
ESV	Genesis	47	8	And Pharaoh said to Jacob , “ How many are the days of the years of your life ? ”
ESV	Genesis	47	9	And Jacob said to Pharaoh , “ The days of the years of my ( L ) sojourning are
ESV	Genesis	47	130	years . ( M ) Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life , and ( N ) they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their ( O ) sojourning. ”
ESV	Genesis	47	10	And Jacob ( P ) blessed Pharaoh and went out from the presence of Pharaoh .
ESV	Genesis	47	11	Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of ( Q ) Rameses , ( R ) as Pharaoh had commanded .
ESV	Genesis	47	12	And Joseph ( S ) provided his father , his brothers , and all his father 's household with food , according to the number of their dependents . Joseph and the Famine
ESV	Genesis	47	13	Now there was no food in all the land , for the famine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine .
ESV	Genesis	47	14	( T ) And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan , in exchange for the grain that they bought . And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
ESV	Genesis	47	15	And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said , “ Give us food . ( U ) Why should we die before your eyes ? For our money is gone. ”
ESV	Genesis	47	16	And Joseph answered , “ Give your livestock , and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock , if your money is gone. ”
ESV	Genesis	47	17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph , and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses , the flocks , the herds , and the donkeys . He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year .
ESV	Genesis	47	18	And when that year was ended , they came to him the following year and said to him , “ We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent . The herds of livestock are my lord 's . There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our land .
ESV	Genesis	47	19	Why should we die before your eyes , both we and our land ? ( V ) Buy us and our land for food , and we with our land will be servants to Pharaoh . And give us seed that we may live and not die , and that the land may not be desolate. ”
ESV	Genesis	47	20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh , for all the Egyptians sold their fields , because the famine was severe on them . The land became Pharaoh 's .
ESV	Genesis	47	21	As for the people , he made servants of them [ a ] from one end of Egypt to the other .
ESV	Genesis	47	22	( W ) Only the land of the priests he did not buy , for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them ; therefore they did not sell their land .
ESV	Genesis	47	23	Then Joseph said to the people , “ Behold , I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh . Now here is seed for you , and you shall sow the land .
ESV	Genesis	47	24	And at the harvests you shall give a ( X ) fifth to Pharaoh , and four fifths shall be your own , as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households , and as food for your little ones. ”
ESV	Genesis	47	25	And they said , “ You have saved our lives ; ( Y ) may it please my lord , we will be servants to Pharaoh. ”
ESV	Genesis	47	26	So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt , and it stands to this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth ; ( Z ) the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh 's .
ESV	Genesis	47	27	Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt , ( AA ) in the land of Goshen . ( AB ) And they gained possessions in it , and were fruitful and multiplied greatly .
ESV	Genesis	47	28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years . ( AC ) So the days of Jacob , the years of his life , were
ESV	Genesis	47	147	years .
ESV	Genesis	47	29	And ( AD ) when the time drew near that Israel must die , he called his son Joseph and said to him , “ If now ( AE ) I have found favor in your sight , ( AF ) put your hand under my thigh and ( AG ) promise to deal kindly and truly with me . ( AH ) Do not bury me in Egypt ,
ESV	Genesis	47	30	but let me lie with my fathers . Carry me out of Egypt and ( AI ) bury me in their burying place. ” He answered , “ I will do as you have said. ”

ESV	Genesis	48	48	After this , Joseph was told , “ Behold , your father is ill. ” So he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
ESV	Genesis	48	2	And it was told to Jacob , “ Your son Joseph has come to you. ” Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed .
ESV	Genesis	48	3	And Jacob said to Joseph , ( A ) “ God Almighty [ a ] appeared to me at ( B ) Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me ,
ESV	Genesis	48	4	and said to me , ‘ Behold , I will make you fruitful and multiply you , and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you ( C ) for an everlasting possession. ’
ESV	Genesis	48	5	And now your ( D ) two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt , ( E ) are mine ; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine , as Reuben and Simeon are .
ESV	Genesis	48	6	And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours . They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance .
ESV	Genesis	48	7	As for me , when I came from Paddan , to my sorrow ( F ) Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way , when there was still some distance [ b ] to go to Ephrath , and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath ( that is , Bethlehem ) . ”
ESV	Genesis	48	8	When Israel saw Joseph 's sons , he said , “ Who are these ? ”
ESV	Genesis	48	9	Joseph said to his father , ( G ) “ They are my sons , whom God has given me here. ” And he said , “ Bring them to me , please , that ( H ) I may bless them. ”
ESV	Genesis	48	10	Now ( I ) the eyes of Israel were dim with age , so that he could not see . So Joseph brought them near him , ( J ) and he kissed them and embraced them .
ESV	Genesis	48	11	And Israel said to Joseph , ( K ) “ I never expected to see your face ; and behold , God has let me see your offspring also. ”
ESV	Genesis	48	12	Then Joseph removed them from his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
ESV	Genesis	48	13	And Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near him .
ESV	Genesis	48	14	( L ) And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim , who was the younger , and his left hand on the head of Manasseh , ( M ) crossing his hands ( for Manasseh was the firstborn ) .
ESV	Genesis	48	15	And he blessed Joseph and said , “ The God ( N ) before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked , the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day ,
ESV	Genesis	48	16	( O ) the angel who has ( P ) redeemed me from all evil , bless the boys ; and in them let ( Q ) my name be carried on , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and let them ( R ) grow into a multitude [ c ] in the midst of the earth. ”
ESV	Genesis	48	17	When Joseph saw that his father ( S ) laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim , it displeased him , and he took his father 's hand to move it from Ephraim 's head to Manasseh 's head .
ESV	Genesis	48	18	And Joseph said to his father , “ Not this way , my father ; since this one is the firstborn , put your right hand on his head. ”
ESV	Genesis	48	19	But his father refused and said , ( T ) “ I know , my son , I know . He also shall become a people , and he also shall be great . Nevertheless , ( U ) his younger brother shall be greater than he , and his offspring shall become a multitude [ d ] of nations. ”
ESV	Genesis	48	20	So he blessed them that day , saying , “ By you Israel will pronounce blessings , saying , ( V ) ‘ God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh. ’ ” Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh .
ESV	Genesis	48	21	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ Behold , I am about to die , but ( W ) God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers .

ESV	Exodus	1	1	( A ) These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob , each with his household :
ESV	Exodus	1	2	Reuben , Simeon , Levi , and Judah ,
ESV	Exodus	1	3	Issachar , Zebulun , and Benjamin ,
ESV	Exodus	1	4	Dan and Naphtali , Gad and Asher .
ESV	Exodus	1	5	All the descendants of Jacob were ( B ) seventy persons ; Joseph was already in Egypt .
ESV	Exodus	1	6	Then ( C ) Joseph died , and all his brothers and all that generation .
ESV	Exodus	1	7	( D ) But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly ; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong , so that the land was filled with them . Pharaoh Oppresses Israel
ESV	Exodus	1	8	Now there arose a new king over Egypt , ( E ) who did not know Joseph .
ESV	Exodus	1	9	And he said to his people , “ Behold , ( F ) the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us .
ESV	Exodus	1	10	( G ) Come , ( H ) let us deal shrewdly with them , lest they multiply , and , if war breaks out , they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land. ”
ESV	Exodus	1	11	Therefore they set taskmasters over them ( I ) to afflict them with heavy ( J ) burdens . They built for Pharaoh ( K ) store cities , Pithom and ( L ) Raamses .
ESV	Exodus	1	12	But the more they were oppressed , the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad . And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel .
ESV	Exodus	1	13	So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel ( M ) work as slaves
ESV	Exodus	1	14	and ( N ) made their lives bitter with hard service , in mortar and brick , and in all kinds of work in the field . In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves .
ESV	Exodus	1	15	Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives , one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah ,
ESV	Exodus	1	16	“ When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool , if it is a son , you shall kill him , but if it is a daughter , she shall live. ”
ESV	Exodus	1	17	But the midwives ( O ) feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them , but let the male children live .
ESV	Exodus	1	18	So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them , “ Why have you done this , and let the male children live ? ”
ESV	Exodus	1	19	The midwives said to Pharaoh , “ Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women , for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them. ”
ESV	Exodus	1	20	( P ) So God dealt well with the midwives . And the people multiplied and grew very strong .
ESV	Exodus	1	21	And because the midwives feared God , ( Q ) he gave them families .
ESV	Exodus	1	22	Then Pharaoh commanded all his people , ( R ) “ Every son that is born to the Hebrews [ a ] you shall cast into ( S ) the Nile , but you shall let every daughter live. ” Footnotes - Exodus 1:22 Samaritan , Septuagint , Targum ; Hebrew lacks to the Hebrews The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Exodus	2	2	The woman conceived and bore a son , and ( B ) when she saw that he was a fine child , she hid him three months .
ESV	Exodus	2	3	When she could hide him no longer , she took for him a basket made of bulrushes [ a ] and daubed it with bitumen and pitch . She put the child in it and placed it among the ( C ) reeds by the river bank .
ESV	Exodus	2	4	And ( D ) his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him .
ESV	Exodus	2	5	Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river , while her young women walked beside the river . She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman , and she took it .
ESV	Exodus	2	6	When she opened it , she saw the child , and behold , the baby was crying . She took pity on him and said , “ This is one of the Hebrews ' children. ”
ESV	Exodus	2	7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh 's daughter , “ Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you ? ”
ESV	Exodus	2	8	And Pharaoh 's daughter said to her , “ Go. ” So the girl went and called the child 's mother .
ESV	Exodus	2	9	And Pharaoh 's daughter said to her , “ Take this child away and nurse him for me , and I will give you your wages. ” So the woman took the child and nursed him .
ESV	Exodus	2	10	When the child grew older , she brought him to Pharaoh 's daughter , and he became ( E ) her son . She named him Moses , “ Because , ” she said , “ I ( F ) drew him out of the water. ” [ b ] Moses Flees to Midian
ESV	Exodus	2	11	One day , ( G ) when Moses had grown up , he went out to his people and looked on their ( H ) burdens , and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew , one of his people . [ c ]
ESV	Exodus	2	12	He looked this way and that , and seeing no one , he ( I ) struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand .
ESV	Exodus	2	13	When ( J ) he went out the next day , behold , two Hebrews were struggling together . And he said to the man in the wrong , “ Why do you strike your companion ? ”
ESV	Exodus	2	14	He answered , ( K ) “ Who made you a prince and a judge over us ? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian ? ” Then Moses was afraid , and thought , “ Surely the thing is known. ”
ESV	Exodus	2	15	When Pharaoh heard of it , he sought to kill Moses . But ( L ) Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian . And he sat down by ( M ) a well .
ESV	Exodus	2	16	Now the ( N ) priest of Midian had seven daughters , and ( O ) they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father 's flock .
ESV	Exodus	2	17	The shepherds came and drove them away , but Moses stood up and saved them , and ( P ) watered their flock .
ESV	Exodus	2	18	When they came home to their father ( Q ) Reuel , he said , “ How is it that you have come home so soon today ? ”
ESV	Exodus	2	19	They said , “ An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and ( R ) watered the flock. ”
ESV	Exodus	2	20	He said to his daughters , “ Then where is he ? Why have you left the man ? Call him , that he may ( S ) eat bread. ”
ESV	Exodus	2	21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man , and he gave Moses his daughter ( T ) Zipporah .
ESV	Exodus	2	22	She gave birth to a son , and he called his name ( U ) Gershom , for he said , “ I have been a ( V ) sojourner [ d ] in a foreign land. ” God Hears Israel 's Groaning
ESV	Exodus	2	23	( W ) During those many days the king of Egypt died , and the people of Israel ( X ) groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help . ( Y ) Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God .
ESV	Exodus	2	24	And ( Z ) God heard their groaning , and God ( AA ) remembered his covenant with ( AB ) Abraham , with Isaac , and with Jacob .

ESV	Exodus	3	10	( R ) Come , I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people , the children of Israel , out of Egypt. ”
ESV	Exodus	3	11	But Moses said to God , ( S ) “ Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt ? ”
ESV	Exodus	3	12	He said , ( T ) “ But I will be with you , and this shall be the sign for you , that I have sent you : when you have brought the people out of Egypt , ( U ) you shall serve God on this mountain. ”
ESV	Exodus	3	13	Then Moses said to God , “ If I come to the people of Israel and say to them , ‘ The God of your fathers has sent me to you , ’ and they ask me , ‘ What is his name ? ’ what shall I say to them ? ”

ESV	Exodus	3	19	But I know that the king of Egypt ( AF ) will not let you go unless compelled ( AG ) by a mighty hand . [ c ]
ESV	Exodus	3	20	So ( AH ) I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with ( AI ) all the wonders that I will do in it ; ( AJ ) after that he will let you go .

ESV	Exodus	4	21	And the Lord said to Moses , “ When you go back to Egypt , see that you do before Pharaoh all the ( T ) miracles that I have put in your power . But ( U ) I will harden his heart , so that he will not let the people go .

ESV	Exodus	5	5	And Pharaoh said , “ Behold , ( F ) the people of the land are now many , [ a ] and you make them rest from their burdens ! ”
ESV	Exodus	5	2	But Pharaoh said , ( B ) “ Who is the Lord , that I should obey his voice and let Israel go ? I do not know the Lord , and moreover , ( C ) I will not let Israel go. ”
ESV	Exodus	5	3	Then they said , “ The ( D ) God of the Hebrews has met with us . Please let us go a three days ' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God , lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword. ”
ESV	Exodus	5	4	But the king of Egypt said to them , “ Moses and Aaron , why do you take the people away from their work ? Get back to your ( E ) burdens. ”
ESV	Exodus	5	6	The same day Pharaoh commanded the ( G ) taskmasters of the people and their ( H ) foremen ,
ESV	Exodus	5	7	“ You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks , as in the past ; let them go and gather straw for themselves .
ESV	Exodus	5	8	But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them , you shall by no means reduce it , for they are idle . Therefore they cry , ‘ Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God. ’
ESV	Exodus	5	9	Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words. ”
ESV	Exodus	5	10	So the ( I ) taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people , “ Thus says Pharaoh , ‘ I will not give you straw .
ESV	Exodus	5	11	Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it , but your work will not be reduced in the least. ’ ”
ESV	Exodus	5	12	So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw .
ESV	Exodus	5	13	The ( J ) taskmasters were urgent , saying , “ Complete your work , your daily task each day , as when there was straw. ”
ESV	Exodus	5	14	And the foremen of the people of Israel , whom Pharaoh 's ( K ) taskmasters had set over them , were beaten and were asked , “ Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday , as in the past ? ”
ESV	Exodus	5	15	Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh , “ Why do you treat your servants like this ?
ESV	Exodus	5	16	No straw is given to your servants , yet they say to us , ‘ Make bricks ! ’ And behold , your servants are beaten ; but the fault is in your own people. ”
ESV	Exodus	5	17	But he said , “ You are idle , you are idle ; that is why you say , ‘ Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord. ’
ESV	Exodus	5	18	Go now and work . No straw will be given you , but you must still deliver the same number of bricks. ”
ESV	Exodus	5	19	The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said , “ You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks , your daily task each day. ”
ESV	Exodus	5	20	They met Moses and Aaron , who were waiting for them , as they came out from Pharaoh ;
ESV	Exodus	5	21	and ( L ) they said to them , “ The Lord look on you and judge , because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants , and have put a sword in their hand to kill us. ”

ESV	Exodus	7	13	Still ( K ) Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he would not listen to them , ( L ) as the Lord had said . The First Plague : Water Turned to Blood
ESV	Exodus	7	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Pharaoh 's heart is hardened ; he refuses to let the people go .
ESV	Exodus	7	15	( M ) Go to Pharaoh in the morning , as he is going out to the water . Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him , and take in your hand ( N ) the staff that turned into a ( O ) serpent .
ESV	Exodus	7	16	And you shall say to him , ‘ The ( P ) Lord , the God of the Hebrews , sent me to you , saying , “ Let my people go , ( Q ) that they may serve me in the wilderness. ” But so far , you have not obeyed .
ESV	Exodus	7	17	Thus says the Lord , “ By this ( R ) you shall know that I am the Lord : behold , with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile , and ( S ) it shall turn into blood .
ESV	Exodus	7	18	The fish in the Nile shall die , and the Nile will stink , and the Egyptians will ( T ) grow weary of drinking water from the Nile. ” ’ ”
ESV	Exodus	7	19	And the Lord said to Moses , “ Say to Aaron , ‘ Take your staff and ( U ) stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt , over their rivers , their canals , and their ponds , and all their pools of water , so that they may become blood , and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt , even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone. ’ ”
ESV	Exodus	7	20	Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded . In the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants he ( V ) lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile , and all the ( W ) water in the Nile turned into blood .
ESV	Exodus	7	21	And the fish in the Nile died , and the Nile stank , so that the Egyptians ( X ) could not drink water from the Nile . There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
ESV	Exodus	7	22	But ( Y ) the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts . So ( Z ) Pharaoh 's heart remained hardened , and he would not listen to them , as ( AA ) the Lord had said .
ESV	Exodus	7	23	Pharaoh turned and went into his house , and he did not take even this to heart .
ESV	Exodus	7	24	And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink , for they could not drink the water of the Nile .

ESV	Exodus	8	8	Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said , ( H ) “ Plead with the Lord to take away the frogs from me and from my people , and ( I ) I will let the people go to sacrifice to the Lord. ”
ESV	Exodus	8	2	But if you ( B ) refuse to let them go , behold , I will plague all your country with ( C ) frogs .
ESV	Exodus	8	3	The Nile shall swarm with frogs that shall come up into your house and into ( D ) your bedroom and on your bed and into the houses of your servants and your people , [ b ] and into your ovens and your kneading bowls .
ESV	Exodus	8	4	The frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your servants. ” ’ ”
ESV	Exodus	8	5	[ c ] And the Lord said to Moses , “ Say to Aaron , ( E ) ‘ Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers , over the canals and over the pools , and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt ! ’ ”
ESV	Exodus	8	6	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt , and ( F ) the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt .
ESV	Exodus	8	7	But ( G ) the magicians did the same by their secret arts and made frogs come up on the land of Egypt .
ESV	Exodus	8	9	Moses said to Pharaoh , “ Be pleased to command me when ( J ) I am to plead for you and for your servants and for your people , that the frogs be cut off from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile. ”
ESV	Exodus	8	10	And he said , “ Tomorrow. ” Moses said , “ Be it as you say , so ( K ) that you may know that ( L ) there is no one like the Lord our God .
ESV	Exodus	8	11	The frogs shall go away from you and your houses and your servants and your people . They shall be left only in the Nile. ”
ESV	Exodus	8	12	So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh , and Moses cried to the Lord about the frogs , as he had agreed with Pharaoh . [ d ]
ESV	Exodus	8	13	And the Lord did according to the word of Moses . The frogs died out in the houses , the courtyards , and the fields .
ESV	Exodus	8	14	And they gathered them together in heaps , and the land stank .
ESV	Exodus	8	15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was a ( M ) respite , he ( N ) hardened his heart and would not listen to them , as the Lord had said . The Third Plague : Gnats
ESV	Exodus	8	16	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Say to Aaron , ( O ) ‘ Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth , so that it may become gnats in all the land of Egypt. ’ ”
ESV	Exodus	8	17	And they did so . Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth , and ( P ) there were gnats on man and beast . All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt .
ESV	Exodus	8	18	The ( Q ) magicians tried by their secret arts to produce gnats , but they could not . So there were gnats on man and beast .
ESV	Exodus	8	19	Then the magicians said to Pharaoh , “ This is ( R ) the finger of God. ” But Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he would not listen to them , as the Lord had said . The Fourth Plague : Flies
ESV	Exodus	8	20	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( S ) “ Rise up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh , as he goes out to the water , and say to him , ‘ Thus says the Lord , ( T ) “ Let my people go , that they may serve me .
ESV	Exodus	8	21	Or else , if you will not let my people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants and your people , and into your houses . And the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies , and also the ground on which they stand .
ESV	Exodus	8	22	But on that day ( U ) I will set apart the land of Goshen , where my people dwell , so that no swarms of flies shall be there , ( V ) that you may know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth . [ e ]
ESV	Exodus	8	23	Thus I will put a division [ f ] between my people and your people . Tomorrow this sign shall happen. ” ’ ”
ESV	Exodus	8	24	And the Lord did so . ( W ) There came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants ' houses . Throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by the swarms of flies .
ESV	Exodus	8	25	Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said , “ Go , sacrifice to your God within the land. ”
ESV	Exodus	8	26	But Moses said , “ It would not be right to do so , for the offerings we shall sacrifice to the Lord our God are an ( X ) abomination to the Egyptians . If we sacrifice offerings ( Y ) abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes , will they not stone us ?
ESV	Exodus	8	27	We must go ( Z ) three days ' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God ( AA ) as he tells us. ”
ESV	Exodus	8	28	So Pharaoh said , “ I will let you go to sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness ; only you must not go very far away . ( AB ) Plead for me. ”
ESV	Exodus	8	29	Then Moses said , “ Behold , I am going out from you and I will plead with the Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people , tomorrow . Only let not Pharaoh ( AC ) cheat again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord. ”
ESV	Exodus	8	30	So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord .
ESV	Exodus	8	31	And the Lord did as Moses asked , and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; not one remained .
ESV	Exodus	8	32	But Pharaoh ( AD ) hardened his heart this time also , and did not let the people go .

ESV	Exodus	9	9	It shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt , and become ( G ) boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt. ”
ESV	Exodus	9	2	For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them ,
ESV	Exodus	9	3	behold , ( C ) the hand of the Lord will fall with a very severe plague upon your livestock that are in the field , the horses , the donkeys , the camels , the herds , and the flocks .
ESV	Exodus	9	4	( D ) But the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt , so that nothing of all that belongs to the people of Israel shall die. ” ’ ”
ESV	Exodus	9	5	And the Lord set a time , saying , “ Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land. ”
ESV	Exodus	9	6	And the next day the Lord did this thing . ( E ) All the livestock of the Egyptians died , but not one of the livestock of the people of Israel died .
ESV	Exodus	9	7	And Pharaoh sent , and behold , not one of the livestock of Israel was dead . But ( F ) the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go . The Sixth Plague : Boils
ESV	Exodus	9	8	And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Take handfuls of soot from the kiln , and let Moses throw them in the air in the sight of Pharaoh .
ESV	Exodus	9	10	So they took soot from the kiln and stood before Pharaoh . And Moses threw it in the air , and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast .
ESV	Exodus	9	11	And ( H ) the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils , for the boils came upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians .
ESV	Exodus	9	12	( I ) But the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh , and he did not listen to them , as ( J ) the Lord had spoken to Moses . The Seventh Plague : Hail
ESV	Exodus	9	13	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( K ) “ Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh and say to him , ‘ Thus says the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , “ Let my people go , that they may serve me .
ESV	Exodus	9	14	For this time I will send all my plagues on you yourself , [ a ] and on your servants and your people , so ( L ) that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth .
ESV	Exodus	9	15	For by now I could have put out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence , and you would have been cut off from the earth .
ESV	Exodus	9	16	( M ) But for this purpose I have raised you up , to show you my power , so ( N ) that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth .
ESV	Exodus	9	17	( O ) You are still exalting yourself against my people and will not let them go .
ESV	Exodus	9	18	Behold , about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall , such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now .
ESV	Exodus	9	19	Now therefore send , ( P ) get your livestock and all that you have in the field into safe shelter , for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home will die when the hail falls on them. ” ’ ”
ESV	Exodus	9	20	Then whoever feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses ,
ESV	Exodus	9	21	but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the Lord left his slaves and his livestock in the field .
ESV	Exodus	9	22	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Stretch out your hand toward heaven , so that there may be ( Q ) hail in all the land of Egypt , on man and beast and every plant of the field , in the land of Egypt. ”
ESV	Exodus	9	23	Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven , and the ( R ) Lord sent thunder and hail , and fire ran down to the earth . And the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
ESV	Exodus	9	24	There was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail , very heavy hail , such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
ESV	Exodus	9	25	The hail struck down everything that was in the field in all the land of Egypt , both man and beast . And the hail ( S ) struck down every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field .
ESV	Exodus	9	26	( T ) Only in the land of Goshen , where the people of Israel were , was there no hail .
ESV	Exodus	9	27	Then Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them , “ This time ( U ) I have sinned ; the ( V ) Lord is in the right , and I and my people are in the wrong .
ESV	Exodus	9	28	( W ) Plead with the Lord , for there has been enough of God 's thunder and hail . I will let you go , and you shall stay no longer. ”
ESV	Exodus	9	29	Moses said to him , “ As soon as I have gone out of the city , ( X ) I will stretch out my hands to the Lord . The thunder will cease , and there will be no more hail , so that you may know that ( Y ) the earth is the Lord 's .
ESV	Exodus	9	30	But as for you and your servants , ( Z ) I know that you do not yet fear the Lord God. ”
ESV	Exodus	9	31	( The flax and the barley were struck down , for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud .
ESV	Exodus	9	32	But the wheat and the emmer [ b ] were not struck down , for they are late in coming up . )
ESV	Exodus	9	33	So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and ( AA ) stretched out his hands to the Lord , and the thunder and the hail ceased , and the rain no longer poured upon the earth .
ESV	Exodus	9	34	But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased , he sinned yet again and ( AB ) hardened his heart , ( AC ) he and his servants .
ESV	Exodus	9	35	So ( AD ) the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people of Israel go , just as the Lord had spoken through Moses . Footnotes - Exodus 9:14 Hebrew on your heart - Exodus 9:32 A type of wheat The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Exodus	10	10	But he said to them , “ The Lord be with you , if ever I let you and your ( I ) little ones go ! Look , you have some evil purpose in mind . [ a ]
ESV	Exodus	10	2	and ( A ) that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your grandson how I have dealt harshly with the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them , ( B ) that you may know that I am the Lord. ”
ESV	Exodus	10	3	So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , ‘ How long will you refuse to ( C ) humble yourself before me ? Let my people go , that they may serve me .
ESV	Exodus	10	4	For if you refuse to let my people go , behold , tomorrow I will bring ( D ) locusts into your country ,
ESV	Exodus	10	5	and they shall cover the face of the land , so that no one can see the land . And they shall ( E ) eat what is left to you after the hail , and they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field ,
ESV	Exodus	10	6	and they shall fill ( F ) your houses and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians , as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen , from the day they came on earth to this day. ’ ” Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh .
ESV	Exodus	10	7	Then Pharaoh 's servants said to him , “ How long shall this man be a snare to us ? Let the men go , that they may serve the Lord their God . Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined ? ”
ESV	Exodus	10	8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh . And he said to them , ( G ) “ Go , serve the Lord your God . But which ones are to go ? ”
ESV	Exodus	10	9	Moses said , “ We will go with our young and our old . We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds , for ( H ) we must hold a feast to the Lord. ”
ESV	Exodus	10	11	No ! Go , the men among you , and serve the Lord , for that is what you are asking. ” And they were driven out from Pharaoh 's presence .
ESV	Exodus	10	12	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( J ) “ Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , so that they may come upon the land of Egypt and ( K ) eat every plant in the land , all that the hail has left. ”
ESV	Exodus	10	13	So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night . When it was morning , the east wind had brought the locusts .
ESV	Exodus	10	14	( L ) The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country of Egypt , ( M ) such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before , nor ever will be again .
ESV	Exodus	10	15	They covered the face of the whole land , so that the land was darkened , and ( N ) they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left . Not a green thing remained , neither tree nor plant of the field , through all the land of Egypt .
ESV	Exodus	10	16	Then Pharaoh hastily called Moses and Aaron and said , ( O ) “ I have sinned against the Lord your God , and against you .
ESV	Exodus	10	17	Now therefore , forgive my sin , please , only this once , and ( P ) plead with the Lord your God only to remove this death from me. ”
ESV	Exodus	10	18	So ( Q ) he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the Lord .
ESV	Exodus	10	19	And the Lord turned the wind into a very strong west wind , which lifted the locusts and drove them ( R ) into the Red Sea . Not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt .
ESV	Exodus	10	20	But the Lord ( S ) hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and he did not let the people of Israel go . The Ninth Plague : Darkness
ESV	Exodus	10	21	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( T ) “ Stretch out your hand toward heaven , that there may be ( U ) darkness over the land of Egypt , a darkness to be felt. ”
ESV	Exodus	10	22	So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven , and there was pitch darkness in all the land of Egypt three days .
ESV	Exodus	10	23	They did not see one another , nor did anyone rise from his place for three days , but ( V ) all the people of Israel had light where they lived .
ESV	Exodus	10	24	Then Pharaoh called Moses and said , ( W ) “ Go , serve the Lord ; ( X ) your little ones also may go with you ; only let your flocks and your herds remain behind. ”
ESV	Exodus	10	25	But Moses said , “ You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God .
ESV	Exodus	10	26	Our livestock also must go with us ; not a hoof shall be left behind , for we must take of them to serve the Lord our God , and we do not know with what we must serve the Lord until we arrive there. ”
ESV	Exodus	10	27	But the Lord ( Y ) hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and he would not let them go .
ESV	Exodus	10	28	Then Pharaoh said to him , “ Get away from me ; take care never to see my face again , for on the day you see my face you shall die. ”

ESV	Exodus	12	31	Then he summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said , “ Up , go out from among my people , ( AP ) both you and the people of Israel ; and go , serve the Lord , as you have said .

ESV	Exodus	12	33	( AR ) The Egyptians were urgent with the people to send them out of the land in haste . For they said , “ We shall all be dead. ”
ESV	Exodus	12	34	So the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneading bowls being bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders .
ESV	Exodus	12	35	The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them , for they had ( AS ) asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing .
ESV	Exodus	12	36	( AT ) And the Lord had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , so that ( AU ) they let them have what they asked . Thus they plundered the Egyptians .

ESV	Exodus	14	2	“ Tell the people of Israel to ( A ) turn back and encamp in front of Pi-hahiroth , between ( B ) Migdol and the sea , in front of Baal-zephon ; you shall encamp facing it , by the sea .

ESV	Exodus	14	4	And ( C ) I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , and he will pursue them , and I will ( D ) get glory over Pharaoh and all his host , ( E ) and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord. ” And they did so .
ESV	Exodus	14	5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled , the ( F ) mind of Pharaoh and his servants was changed toward the people , and they said , “ What is this we have done , that we have let Israel go from serving us ? ”
ESV	Exodus	14	6	So he made ready his chariot and took his army with him ,
ESV	Exodus	14	7	and took ( G ) six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them .
ESV	Exodus	14	8	And ( H ) the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued the people of Israel while ( I ) the people of Israel were going out defiantly .
ESV	Exodus	14	9	The ( J ) Egyptians pursued them , all Pharaoh 's horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army , and overtook them ( K ) encamped at the sea , by Pi-hahiroth , in front of Baal-zephon .
ESV	Exodus	14	10	When Pharaoh drew near , the people of Israel lifted up their eyes , and behold , the Egyptians were marching after them , and they feared greatly . And the people of Israel ( L ) cried out to the Lord .
ESV	Exodus	14	11	They ( M ) said to Moses , “ Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness ? What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt ?
ESV	Exodus	14	12	Is not this what ( N ) we said to you in Egypt : ‘ Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians ’ ? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness. ”
ESV	Exodus	14	13	And Moses said to the people , ( O ) “ Fear not , stand firm , and see the salvation of the Lord , which he will work for you today . For ( P ) the Egyptians whom you see today , you shall never see again .
ESV	Exodus	14	15	The Lord said to Moses , “ Why do you cry to me ? Tell the people of Israel to go forward .

ESV	Exodus	14	22	And ( AD ) the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground , the waters being ( AE ) a wall to them on their right hand and on their left .
ESV	Exodus	14	23	The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea , all Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
ESV	Exodus	14	24	And in the morning watch the Lord in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic ,
ESV	Exodus	14	25	clogging [ b ] their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily . And the Egyptians said , “ Let us flee from before Israel , for the ( AF ) Lord fights for them against the Egyptians. ”
ESV	Exodus	14	26	Then the Lord said to Moses , ( AG ) “ Stretch out your hand over the sea , that the water may come back upon the Egyptians , upon their chariots , and upon their horsemen. ”
ESV	Exodus	14	27	( AH ) So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and the sea ( AI ) returned to its normal course when the morning appeared . And as the Egyptians fled into it , the Lord ( AJ ) threw [ c ] the Egyptians into the midst of the sea .
ESV	Exodus	14	28	The ( AK ) waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen ; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea , ( AL ) not one of them remained .
ESV	Exodus	14	29	But the ( AM ) people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea , the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left .

ESV	Exodus	32	14	And the Lord ( W ) relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people .

ESV	Exodus	32	28	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses . And that day about three thousand men of the people fell .
ESV	Exodus	32	29	And Moses said , “ Today you have been ( AJ ) ordained for the service of the Lord , each one at the cost of his son and of his brother , so that he might bestow a blessing upon you this day. ”

ESV	Leviticus	10	12	Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar , his surviving sons : “ Take the ( P ) grain offering that is left of the Lord 's food offerings , and eat it unleavened beside the altar , for ( Q ) it is most holy .
ESV	Leviticus	10	13	You shall eat it in a holy place , because it is your due and your sons ' due , from the Lord 's food offerings , for ( R ) so I am commanded .
ESV	Leviticus	10	14	But the ( S ) breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place , you and your sons and your daughters with you , for they are given as your due and your sons ' due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel .

ESV	Leviticus	10	16	Now Moses diligently inquired about ( U ) the goat of the sin offering , and behold , it was burned up ! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar , the surviving sons of Aaron , saying ,
ESV	Leviticus	10	17	( V ) “ Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary , since ( W ) it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation , to make atonement for them before the Lord ?

ESV	Leviticus	25	48	then after he is sold he may be redeemed . One of his brothers may redeem him ,

ESV	Leviticus	25	52	If there remain but a few years until the year of jubilee , he shall calculate and pay for his redemption in proportion to his years of service .
ESV	Leviticus	25	53	He shall treat him as a worker hired year by year . ( BB ) He shall not rule ruthlessly over him in your sight .
ESV	Leviticus	25	54	And if he is not redeemed by these means , then ( BC ) he and his children with him shall be released in the year of jubilee .

ESV	Numbers	8	2	“ Speak to Aaron and say to him , When you set up the lamps , the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand. ”

ESV	Numbers	8	4	And ( A ) this was the workmanship of the lampstand , hammered work of gold . From its base to its flowers , it was hammered work ; according to the pattern that the Lord had shown Moses , so he made the lampstand . Cleansing of the Levites
ESV	Numbers	8	5	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
ESV	Numbers	8	6	“ Take the Levites from among the people of Israel and cleanse them .
ESV	Numbers	8	7	Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them : sprinkle the ( B ) water of purification upon them , and ( C ) let them go with a razor over all their body , and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves .
ESV	Numbers	8	9	( F ) And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting ( G ) and assemble the whole congregation of the people of Israel .
ESV	Numbers	8	10	When you bring the Levites before the Lord , the people of Israel ( H ) shall lay their hands on the Levites ,

ESV	Numbers	8	16	For they are ( N ) wholly given to me from among the people of Israel . ( O ) Instead of all who open the womb , the firstborn of all the people of Israel , I have taken them for myself .
ESV	Numbers	8	17	( P ) For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine , both of man and of beast . On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself ,
ESV	Numbers	8	18	and I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel .
ESV	Numbers	8	19	( Q ) And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the people of Israel , to do the service for the people of Israel at the tent of meeting and ( R ) to make atonement for the people of Israel , ( S ) that there may be no plague among the people of Israel when the people of Israel come near the sanctuary. ”
ESV	Numbers	8	20	Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the people of Israel to the Levites . According to all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites , the people of Israel did to them .
ESV	Numbers	8	21	And ( T ) the Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes , and ( U ) Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the Lord , and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them .

ESV	Numbers	9	9	The Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
ESV	Numbers	9	2	“ Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time .
ESV	Numbers	9	3	( B ) On the fourteenth day of this month , at twilight , you shall keep it at its appointed time ; according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it. ”
ESV	Numbers	9	4	So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover .
ESV	Numbers	9	5	And they kept the Passover in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month , at twilight , in the wilderness of Sinai ; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so the people of Israel did .
ESV	Numbers	9	6	And there were certain men who were ( C ) unclean through touching a dead body , so that they could not keep the Passover on that day , and ( D ) they came before Moses and Aaron on that day .
ESV	Numbers	9	7	And those men said to him , “ We are unclean through touching a dead body . Why are we kept from bringing the Lord 's ( E ) offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel ? ”
ESV	Numbers	9	8	And Moses said to them , “ Wait , that ( F ) I may hear what the Lord will command concerning you. ”
ESV	Numbers	9	10	“ Speak to the people of Israel , saying , If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body , or is on a long journey , he shall still keep the Passover to the Lord .
ESV	Numbers	9	11	( G ) In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it . ( H ) They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
ESV	Numbers	9	12	( I ) They shall leave none of it until the morning , ( J ) nor break any of its bones ; ( K ) according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it .
ESV	Numbers	9	13	But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover , ( L ) that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the Lord 's ( M ) offering at its appointed time ; that man shall bear his sin .
ESV	Numbers	9	14	And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the Lord , according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule , so shall he do . ( N ) You shall have one statute , both for the sojourner and for the native. ” The Cloud Covering the Tabernacle
ESV	Numbers	9	15	( O ) On the day that the tabernacle was set up , the cloud covered the tabernacle , the tent of the testimony . And ( P ) at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning .
ESV	Numbers	9	16	So it was always : the cloud covered it by day [ a ] and the appearance of fire by night .
ESV	Numbers	9	17	And whenever the cloud ( Q ) lifted from over the tent , after that the people of Israel set out , and in the place where the cloud settled down , there the people of Israel camped .
ESV	Numbers	9	18	At the command of the Lord the people of Israel set out , and at the command of the Lord they camped . ( R ) As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle , they remained in camp .
ESV	Numbers	9	19	Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days , the people of Israel ( S ) kept the charge of the Lord and did not set out .
ESV	Numbers	9	20	Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle , and according to the command of the Lord they remained in camp ; then according to the command of the Lord they set out .
ESV	Numbers	9	21	And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning . And when the cloud lifted in the morning , they set out , or if it continued for a day and a night , when the cloud lifted they set out .
ESV	Numbers	9	22	Whether it was two days , or a month , or a longer time , that the cloud continued over the tabernacle , abiding there , the people of Israel ( T ) remained in camp and did not set out , but when it lifted they set out .
ESV	Numbers	9	23	At the command of the Lord they camped , and at the command of the Lord they set out . ( U ) They kept the charge of the Lord , at the command of the Lord by Moses .

ESV	Numbers	10	28	( AO ) This was the order of march of the people of Israel by their companies , when they set out .
ESV	Numbers	10	29	And Moses said to Hobab the son of ( AP ) Reuel the Midianite , Moses ' father-in-law , “ We are setting out for the place of which the Lord said , ( AQ ) ‘ I will give it to you. ’ Come with us , and we will do good to you , for ( AR ) the Lord has promised good to Israel. ”

ESV	Numbers	11	11	( P ) Moses said to the Lord , “ Why have you dealt ill with your servant ? And why have I not found favor in your sight , that you lay the burden of all this people on me ?
ESV	Numbers	11	2	Then ( D ) the people cried out to Moses , ( E ) and Moses prayed to the Lord , and the fire died down .
ESV	Numbers	11	3	So the name of that place was called ( F ) Taberah , [ a ] because the fire of the Lord burned among them .
ESV	Numbers	11	4	Now the ( G ) rabble that was among them had a strong craving . And the people of Israel also ( H ) wept again and said , ( I ) “ Oh that we had meat to eat !
ESV	Numbers	11	5	( J ) We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing , the cucumbers , the melons , the leeks , the onions , and the garlic .

ESV	Numbers	11	7	Now ( K ) the manna was like coriander seed , and its appearance like that of bdellium .
ESV	Numbers	11	8	( L ) The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it . ( M ) And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil .
ESV	Numbers	11	9	( N ) When the dew fell upon the camp in the night , the manna fell with it .
ESV	Numbers	11	10	Moses heard the people ( O ) weeping throughout their clans , everyone at the door of his tent . And the anger of the Lord blazed hotly , and Moses was displeased .
ESV	Numbers	11	12	Did I conceive all this people ? Did I give them birth , that you should say to me , ( Q ) ‘ Carry them in your bosom , as a ( R ) nurse carries a nursing child , ’ to the land ( S ) that you swore to give their fathers ?
ESV	Numbers	11	13	( T ) Where am I to get meat to give to all this people ? For they weep before me and say , ‘ Give us meat , that we may eat. ’
ESV	Numbers	11	14	( U ) I am not able to carry all this people alone ; the burden is too heavy for me .
ESV	Numbers	11	15	If you will treat me like this , kill me at once , if I find favor in your sight , that I may not see my wretchedness. ” Elders Appointed to Aid Moses
ESV	Numbers	11	16	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Gather for me ( V ) seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom you know to be the elders of the people and ( W ) officers over them , and bring them to the tent of meeting , and let them take their stand there with you .
ESV	Numbers	11	17	( X ) And I will come down and talk with you there . And ( Y ) I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them , and ( Z ) they shall bear the burden of the people with you , so that you may not bear it yourself alone .
ESV	Numbers	11	18	inches or
ESV	Numbers	11	19	You shall not eat just one day , or two days , or five days , or ten days , or twenty days ,
ESV	Numbers	11	20	but a whole month , ( AC ) until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you , because you have rejected the Lord who is among you and have wept before him , saying , ( AD ) “ Why did we come out of Egypt ? ” ’ ”
ESV	Numbers	11	21	But Moses said , ( AE ) “ The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot , and you have said , ‘ I will give them meat , that they may eat a whole month ! ’
ESV	Numbers	11	22	( AF ) Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them , and be enough for them ? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , and be enough for them ? ”
ESV	Numbers	11	23	And the Lord said to Moses , ( AG ) “ Is the Lord 's hand shortened ? Now you shall see whether ( AH ) my word will come true for you or not. ”
ESV	Numbers	11	24	So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord . ( AI ) And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent .
ESV	Numbers	11	25	Then ( AJ ) the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him , and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders . And as soon as the Spirit rested on them , they prophesied . But they did not continue doing it .
ESV	Numbers	11	26	Now two men remained in the camp , one named Eldad , and the other named Medad , and the Spirit rested on them . They were among those registered , but they ( AK ) had not gone out to the tent , and so they prophesied in the camp .
ESV	Numbers	11	27	And a young man ran and told Moses , “ Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp. ”
ESV	Numbers	11	28	And ( AL ) Joshua the son of Nun , the assistant of Moses from his youth , said , “ My lord Moses , ( AM ) stop them. ”
ESV	Numbers	11	29	But Moses said to him , “ Are you jealous for my sake ? ( AN ) Would that all the Lord 's people were prophets , that the Lord would put his Spirit on them ! ”
ESV	Numbers	11	30	And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp . Quail and a Plague
ESV	Numbers	11	31	Then a ( AO ) wind from the Lord sprang up , and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp , about a day 's journey on this side and a day 's journey on the other side , around the camp , and about two cubits [ b ] above the ground .
ESV	Numbers	11	32	And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day , and gathered the quail . Those who gathered least gathered ten ( AP ) homers . [ c ] And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp .
ESV	Numbers	11	33	( AQ ) While the meat was yet between their teeth , before it was consumed , the anger of the Lord was kindled against the people , and ( AR ) the Lord struck down the people with a very great plague .
ESV	Numbers	11	34	Therefore the name of that place was called ( AS ) Kibroth-hattaavah , [ d ] because there they buried the people who had the craving .

ESV	Numbers	12	2	And they said , “ Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses ? ( A ) Has he not spoken through us also ? ” And ( B ) the Lord heard it .
ESV	Numbers	12	3	Now the man Moses was very meek , more than all people who were on the face of the earth .
ESV	Numbers	12	4	And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam , “ Come out , you three , to the tent of meeting. ” And the three of them came out .
ESV	Numbers	12	5	And ( C ) the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam , and they both came forward .
ESV	Numbers	12	6	And he said , “ Hear my words : If there is a prophet among you , I the Lord make myself known to him ( D ) in a vision ; I speak with him ( E ) in a dream .
ESV	Numbers	12	7	Not so with ( F ) my servant Moses . ( G ) He is faithful in all my house .

ESV	Numbers	12	9	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them , and he departed .
ESV	Numbers	12	10	When the cloud removed from over the tent , behold , ( K ) Miriam was ( L ) leprous , [ a ] like snow . And Aaron turned toward Miriam , and behold , she was leprous .

ESV	Numbers	16	16	And Moses said to Korah , “ Be present , you and all your company , ( U ) before the Lord , you and they , and Aaron , tomorrow .
ESV	Numbers	16	2	And they rose up before Moses , with a number of the people of Israel ,

ESV	Numbers	16	3	( C ) They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said to them , ( D ) “ You have gone too far !

ESV	Numbers	16	4	When Moses heard it , ( F ) he fell on his face ,
ESV	Numbers	16	5	and he said to Korah and all his company , “ In the morning the Lord will show ( G ) who is his , [ a ] and who is ( H ) holy , and will bring him near to him . The one ( I ) whom he chooses he will ( J ) bring near to him .
ESV	Numbers	16	6	Do this : take ( K ) censers , Korah and all his company ;

ESV	Numbers	16	8	And Moses said to Korah , “ Hear now , you sons of Levi :
ESV	Numbers	16	9	is it ( M ) too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has ( N ) separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to himself , to do service in the tabernacle of the Lord and to stand before the congregation to minister to them ,
ESV	Numbers	16	10	and that he has brought you near him , and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you ? And would you seek the priesthood also ?
ESV	Numbers	16	11	Therefore it is against the Lord that you and all your company have gathered together . What is ( O ) Aaron that you grumble against him ? ”
ESV	Numbers	16	12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab , and they said , “ We will not come up .
ESV	Numbers	16	13	Is it ( P ) a small thing that you have brought us up out of ( Q ) a land flowing with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , that you must also ( R ) make yourself a prince over us ?
ESV	Numbers	16	14	Moreover , you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey , nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards . Will you put out the eyes of these men ? We will not come up. ”
ESV	Numbers	16	15	And Moses was very angry and said to the Lord , ( S ) “ Do not respect their offering . ( T ) I have not taken one donkey from them , and I have not harmed one of them. ”
ESV	Numbers	16	17	And ( V ) let every one of you take his censer and put incense on it , and every one of you bring before the Lord his censer , ( W )
ESV	Numbers	16	18	So every man took his censer and put fire in them and laid incense on them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron .
ESV	Numbers	16	19	Then Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting . ( X ) And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation .
ESV	Numbers	16	20	And the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
ESV	Numbers	16	21	( Y ) “ Separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may consume them ( Z ) in a moment. ”
ESV	Numbers	16	22	And they ( AA ) fell on their faces and said , “ O God , ( AB ) the God of the spirits of all flesh , ( AC ) shall one man sin , and will you be angry with all the congregation ? ”
ESV	Numbers	16	23	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
ESV	Numbers	16	24	“ Say to the congregation , Get away from the dwelling of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram. ”
ESV	Numbers	16	25	Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram , and the elders of Israel followed him .
ESV	Numbers	16	26	And he spoke to the congregation , saying , ( AD ) “ Depart , please , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest you be swept away with all their sins. ”
ESV	Numbers	16	27	So they got away from the dwelling of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram . And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood ( AE ) at the door of their tents , together with their wives , their sons , and their little ones .
ESV	Numbers	16	28	And Moses said , “ Hereby you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works , and that it has not been ( AF ) of my own accord .
ESV	Numbers	16	29	If these men die as all men die , or if they are visited by the fate of all mankind , ( AG ) then the Lord has not sent me .
ESV	Numbers	16	30	But if the Lord creates something new , and ( AH ) the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them , and they ( AI ) go down alive into Sheol , then you shall know that these men have despised the Lord. ”
ESV	Numbers	16	31	( AJ ) And as soon as he had finished speaking all these words , the ground under them split apart .
ESV	Numbers	16	32	And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up , with their households and ( AK ) all the people who belonged to Korah and all their goods .
ESV	Numbers	16	33	So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol , and the earth closed over them , and ( AL ) they perished from the midst of the assembly .
ESV	Numbers	16	34	And all Israel who were around them fled at their cry , for they said , “ Lest the earth swallow us up ! ”
ESV	Numbers	16	35	And ( AM ) fire came out from the Lord and consumed ( AN ) the
ESV	Numbers	16	36	[ b ] Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
ESV	Numbers	16	37	“ Tell Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers out of the blaze . Then scatter the fire far and wide , for they have become holy .
ESV	Numbers	16	38	As for the censers of ( AO ) these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives , let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar , for they offered them before the Lord , and they became holy . ( AP ) Thus they shall be a sign to the people of Israel. ”
ESV	Numbers	16	39	So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers , which those who were burned had offered , and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar ,
ESV	Numbers	16	40	to be a reminder to the people of Israel , so ( AQ ) that no outsider , who is not of the descendants of Aaron , should draw near to burn incense before the Lord , lest he become like Korah and his company—as the Lord said to him through Moses .
ESV	Numbers	16	41	But on the next day all the congregation of the people of Israel ( AR ) grumbled against Moses and against Aaron , saying , “ You have killed the people of the Lord. ”
ESV	Numbers	16	42	And when the congregation had assembled against Moses and against Aaron , they turned toward the tent of meeting . And behold , ( AS ) the cloud covered it , and ( AT ) the glory of the Lord appeared .

ESV	Numbers	16	46	And Moses said to Aaron , “ Take your censer , and put fire on it from off the altar and lay incense on it and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them , for ( AW ) wrath has gone out from the Lord ; the plague has begun. ”
ESV	Numbers	16	47	So Aaron took it as Moses said and ran into the midst of the assembly . And behold , the plague had already begun among the people . And he put on the incense and made atonement for the people .
ESV	Numbers	16	48	And he stood between the dead and the living , and ( AX ) the plague was stopped .

ESV	Numbers	21	13	From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon , which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites , for the ( S ) Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .

ESV	Numbers	21	23	( AA ) But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory . He gathered all his people together and went out against Israel to the wilderness and ( AB ) came to Jahaz and fought against Israel .
ESV	Numbers	21	24	( AC ) And Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the ( AD ) Jabbok , as far as to the Ammonites , for the border of the Ammonites was strong .
ESV	Numbers	21	25	And Israel took all these cities , and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon , and in all its villages .
ESV	Numbers	21	26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand , as far as the Arnon .
ESV	Numbers	21	27	Therefore the ( AE ) ballad singers say , “ Come to ( AF ) Heshbon , let it be built ; let the city of Sihon be established .
ESV	Numbers	21	28	For ( AG ) fire came out from ( AH ) Heshbon , flame from the city of Sihon . It devoured ( AI ) Ar of Moab , and swallowed [ f ] the heights of the Arnon .

ESV	Numbers	21	31	Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites .
ESV	Numbers	21	32	And Moses sent to spy out ( AN ) Jazer , and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there .
ESV	Numbers	21	33	Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan . And Og the king of Bashan came out against them , he and all his people , to battle ( AO ) at Edrei .

ESV	Numbers	22	22	But God 's anger was kindled because he went , ( S ) and the angel of the Lord took his stand in the way ( T ) as his adversary . Now he was riding on the donkey , and his two servants were with him .
ESV	Numbers	22	2	And ( B ) Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
ESV	Numbers	22	3	And ( C ) Moab was in great dread of the people , because they were many . Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel .
ESV	Numbers	22	4	And Moab said to ( D ) the elders of Midian , “ This horde will now lick up all that is around us , as the ox licks up the grass of the field. ” So Balak the son of Zippor , who was king of Moab at that time ,
ESV	Numbers	22	5	( E ) sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor ( F ) at Pethor , which is near the River [ a ] in the land of the people of Amaw , [ b ] to call him , saying , “ Behold , a people has come out of Egypt . They cover the face of the earth , and they are dwelling opposite me .
ESV	Numbers	22	6	( G ) Come now , curse this people for me , since they are too mighty for me . Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land , for I know that he whom you bless is blessed , and he whom you curse is cursed. ”
ESV	Numbers	22	7	So the elders of Moab and ( H ) the elders of Midian departed with ( I ) the fees for divination in their hand . And they came to Balaam and gave him Balak 's message .
ESV	Numbers	22	8	And he said to them , “ Lodge here tonight , and I will bring back word to you , as the Lord speaks to me. ” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam .
ESV	Numbers	22	9	( J ) And God came to Balaam and said , “ Who are these men with you ? ”
ESV	Numbers	22	10	And Balaam said to God , “ Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , has sent to me , saying ,
ESV	Numbers	22	11	‘ Behold , a people has come out of Egypt , and it covers the face of the earth . Now come , curse them for me . Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out. ’ ”
ESV	Numbers	22	12	God said to Balaam , “ You shall not go with them . You shall not curse the people , for ( K ) they are blessed. ”
ESV	Numbers	22	13	So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak , “ Go to your own land , for the Lord has refused to let me go with you. ”
ESV	Numbers	22	14	So the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak and said , “ Balaam refuses to come with us. ”
ESV	Numbers	22	15	Once again Balak sent princes , more in number and more honorable than these .
ESV	Numbers	22	16	And they came to Balaam and said to him , “ Thus says Balak the son of Zippor : ‘ Let nothing hinder you from coming to me ,
ESV	Numbers	22	17	( L ) for I will surely do you great honor , and whatever you say to me I will do . ( M ) Come , curse this people for me. ’ ”
ESV	Numbers	22	18	But Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak , ( N ) “ Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold , ( O ) I could not go beyond the command of the Lord my God to do less or more .
ESV	Numbers	22	19	So you , too , ( P ) please stay here tonight , that I may know what more the Lord will say to me. ”
ESV	Numbers	22	20	( Q ) And God came to Balaam at night and said to him , “ If the men have come to call you , rise , go with them ; ( R ) but only do what I tell you. ”
ESV	Numbers	22	21	So Balaam rose in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab . Balaam 's Donkey and the Angel
ESV	Numbers	22	23	And the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road , with a drawn sword in his hand . And the donkey turned aside out of the road and went into the field . And Balaam struck the donkey , to turn her into the road .
ESV	Numbers	22	24	Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path between the vineyards , with a wall on either side .
ESV	Numbers	22	25	And when the donkey saw the angel of the Lord , she pushed against the wall and pressed Balaam 's foot against the wall . So he struck her again .
ESV	Numbers	22	26	Then the angel of the Lord went ahead and stood in a narrow place , where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left .
ESV	Numbers	22	27	When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord , she lay down under Balaam . And Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he struck the donkey with his staff .
ESV	Numbers	22	28	Then the Lord ( U ) opened the mouth of the donkey , and she said to Balaam , “ What have I done to you , that you have struck me these three times ? ”
ESV	Numbers	22	29	And Balaam said to the donkey , “ Because you have made a fool of me . I wish I had a sword in my hand , for then I would kill you. ”
ESV	Numbers	22	30	And the donkey said to Balaam , “ Am I not your donkey , on which you have ridden all your life long to this day ? Is it my habit to treat you this way ? ” And he said , “ No. ”
ESV	Numbers	22	31	Then the Lord ( V ) opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way , with his drawn sword in his hand . And he bowed down and fell on his face .

ESV	Numbers	23	6	And he returned to him , and behold , he and all the princes of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering .

ESV	Numbers	23	14	And he took him to the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , ( R ) and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
ESV	Numbers	23	15	Balaam said to Balak , ( S ) “ Stand here beside your burnt offering , while I meet the Lord over there. ”

ESV	Numbers	23	26	But Balaam answered Balak , “ Did I not tell you , ( AE ) ‘ All that the Lord says , that I must do ’ ? ”
ESV	Numbers	23	27	And Balak said to Balaam , ( AF ) “ Come now , I will take you to another place . Perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there. ”
ESV	Numbers	23	28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of ( AG ) Peor , which overlooks ( AH ) the desert . [ b ]

ESV	Numbers	24	10	And Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he ( Q ) struck his hands together . And Balak said to Balaam , ( R ) “ I called you to curse my enemies , and behold , you have blessed them these three times .
ESV	Numbers	24	11	Therefore now flee to your own place . I said , ( S ) ‘ I will certainly honor you , ’ but the Lord has held you back from honor. ”

ESV	Numbers	31	2	( A ) “ Avenge the people of Israel on the Midianites . Afterward you shall ( B ) be gathered to your people. ”
ESV	Numbers	31	3	So Moses spoke to the people , saying , “ Arm men from among you for the war , that they may go against Midian to execute the Lord 's vengeance on Midian .
ESV	Numbers	31	4	You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war. ”
ESV	Numbers	31	5	So there were provided , out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand from each tribe , twelve thousand ( C ) armed for war .
ESV	Numbers	31	6	And Moses sent them to the war , a thousand from each tribe , together with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , with the vessels of the sanctuary and ( D ) the trumpets for the alarm in his hand .
ESV	Numbers	31	7	They warred against Midian , as the Lord commanded Moses , and ( E ) killed every male .
ESV	Numbers	31	8	They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain , ( F ) Evi , Rekem , ( G ) Zur , Hur , and Reba , the five kings of Midian . And they also killed ( H ) Balaam the son of Beor with the sword .

ESV	Numbers	31	12	Then they brought the captives and the plunder and the spoil to Moses , and to Eleazar the priest , and to the congregation of the people of Israel , at the camp on ( K ) the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho .
ESV	Numbers	31	13	Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp .
ESV	Numbers	31	14	And Moses was angry with ( L ) the officers of the army , the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds , who had come from service in the war .
ESV	Numbers	31	15	Moses said to them , “ Have you ( M ) let all the women live ?
ESV	Numbers	31	16	Behold , ( N ) these , ( O ) on Balaam 's advice , caused the people of Israel to act treacherously against the Lord in the incident of ( P ) Peor , and so ( Q ) the plague came among the congregation of the Lord .
ESV	Numbers	31	17	Now therefore , ( R ) kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him .
ESV	Numbers	31	18	But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him ( S ) keep alive for yourselves .

ESV	Numbers	31	20	You shall purify every garment , every article of skin , all work of goats ' hair , and every article of wood. ”
ESV	Numbers	31	21	Then Eleazar the priest said to the men in the army who had gone to battle : “ This is the statute of the law that the Lord has commanded Moses :
ESV	Numbers	31	22	only the gold , the silver , the bronze , the iron , the tin , and the lead ,
ESV	Numbers	31	23	everything that can stand the fire , you shall pass through the fire , and it shall be clean . Nevertheless , it shall also be purified ( V ) with the water for impurity . And whatever can not stand the fire , you shall pass through the water .

ESV	Numbers	32	32	We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan , and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan. ”
ESV	Numbers	32	2	So the people of Gad and the people of Reuben came and said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the chiefs of the congregation ,
ESV	Numbers	32	3	( B ) “ Ataroth , ( C ) Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah , Heshbon , Elealeh , Sebam , ( D ) Nebo , and Beon ,
ESV	Numbers	32	4	the land ( E ) that the Lord struck down before the congregation of Israel , is a land for livestock , and your servants have livestock. ”
ESV	Numbers	32	5	And they said , “ If we have found favor in your sight , let this land be given to your servants for a possession . Do not take us across the Jordan. ”
ESV	Numbers	32	6	But Moses said to the people of Gad and to the people of Reuben , “ Shall your brothers go to the war while you sit here ?
ESV	Numbers	32	7	Why will you discourage the heart of the people of Israel from going over into the land that the Lord has given them ?
ESV	Numbers	32	8	Your fathers did this , ( F ) when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land .
ESV	Numbers	32	9	For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the people of Israel from going into the land that the Lord had given them .
ESV	Numbers	32	10	( G ) And the Lord 's anger was kindled on that day , and he swore , saying ,
ESV	Numbers	32	11	‘ Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt , ( H ) from twenty years old and upward , shall see the land that I swore to give ( I ) to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , because they have not wholly followed me ,
ESV	Numbers	32	12	none except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the ( J ) Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun , for ( K ) they have wholly followed the Lord. ’
ESV	Numbers	32	13	And the Lord 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them ( L ) wander in the wilderness forty years , until ( M ) all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was gone .
ESV	Numbers	32	14	And behold , you have risen in your fathers ' place , a brood of sinful men , to increase still more the fierce anger of the Lord against Israel !
ESV	Numbers	32	15	For if you ( N ) turn away from following him , he will again abandon them in the wilderness , and you will destroy all this people. ”
ESV	Numbers	32	16	Then they came near to him and said , ( O ) “ We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock , and cities for our little ones ,
ESV	Numbers	32	17	but ( P ) we will take up arms , ready to go before the people of Israel , until we have brought them to their place . And our little ones shall live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
ESV	Numbers	32	18	( Q ) We will not return to our homes until each of the people of Israel has gained his inheritance .
ESV	Numbers	32	19	For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond , ( R ) because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan to the east. ”
ESV	Numbers	32	20	So ( S ) Moses said to them , “ If you will do this , if you will take up arms to go before the Lord for the war ,
ESV	Numbers	32	21	and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before the Lord , until he has ( T ) driven out his enemies from before him
ESV	Numbers	32	22	and the land is subdued before the Lord ; then after that you shall return and be free of obligation to the Lord and to Israel , and ( U ) this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
ESV	Numbers	32	23	But if you will not do so , behold , you have sinned against the Lord , and ( V ) be sure your sin will find you out .
ESV	Numbers	32	24	( W ) Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep , and do what you have promised. ”
ESV	Numbers	32	25	And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben said to Moses , “ Your servants will do as my lord commands .
ESV	Numbers	32	26	( X ) Our little ones , our wives , our livestock , and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead ,
ESV	Numbers	32	27	( Y ) but your servants will pass over , every man who is ( Z ) armed for war , before the Lord to battle , as my lord orders. ”

ESV	Numbers	32	29	And Moses said to them , “ If the people of Gad and the people of Reuben , every man who is armed to battle before the Lord , will pass with you over the Jordan and the land shall be subdued before you , then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession .
ESV	Numbers	32	30	However , if they will not pass over with you armed , they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan. ”

ESV	Numbers	35	9	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
ESV	Numbers	35	10	“ Speak to the people of Israel and say to them , ( G ) When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
ESV	Numbers	35	11	( H ) then you shall select cities to be cities of refuge for you , that the manslayer who kills any person without intent may flee there .
ESV	Numbers	35	12	The cities shall be for you a refuge from the avenger , that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment .

ESV	Deuteronomy	1	2	It is eleven days ' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to ( D ) Kadesh-barnea .
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	3	( E ) In the fortieth year , on the first day of the eleventh month , Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the Lord had given him in commandment to them ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	4	after ( F ) he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites , who lived in Heshbon , and ( G ) Og the king of Bashan , who lived in Ashtaroth and in ( H ) Edrei .
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	5	Beyond the Jordan , ( I ) in the land of Moab , Moses undertook to explain this law , saying ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	6	“ The Lord our God said to us in Horeb , ( J ) ‘ You have stayed long enough at this mountain .

ESV	Deuteronomy	1	13	( U ) Choose for your tribes wise , understanding , and experienced men , and I will appoint them as your heads. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	14	And you answered me , ‘ The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	15	So I took the heads of your tribes , wise and experienced men , ( V ) and set them as heads over you , commanders of thousands , commanders of hundreds , commanders of fifties , commanders of tens , and officers , throughout your tribes .
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	16	And I charged your judges at that time , ‘ Hear the cases between your brothers , and ( W ) judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him .
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	17	( X ) You shall not be partial in judgment . You shall hear the small and the great alike . You shall not be intimidated by anyone , for ( Y ) the judgment is God 's . And the case that is too hard for you , you shall ( Z ) bring to me , and I will hear it. ’

ESV	Deuteronomy	1	21	See , the Lord your God has set the land before you . Go up , take possession , as the Lord , the God of your fathers , has told you . ( AC ) Do not fear or be dismayed. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	22	Then all of you came near me and said , ‘ Let us send men before us , that they may explore the land for us and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	23	The thing seemed good to me , and ( AD ) I took twelve men from you , one man from each tribe .
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	24	And ( AE ) they turned and went up into the hill country , and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out .
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	25	And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us , and brought us word again and said , ‘ It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	26	“ Yet you would not go up , but rebelled against the command of the Lord your God .
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	27	And ( AF ) you murmured in your tents and said , ‘ Because the Lord ( AG ) hated us he has brought us out of the land of Egypt , ( AH ) to give us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .

ESV	Deuteronomy	1	39	And as for ( AW ) your little ones , who you said would become a prey , and your children , who today ( AX ) have no knowledge of good or evil , they shall go in there . And to them I will give it , and they shall possess it .
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	40	But as for you , ( AY ) turn , and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	1	41	“ Then you answered me , ( AZ ) ‘ We have sinned against the Lord . We ourselves will go up and fight , just as the Lord our God commanded us. ’ And every one of you fastened on his weapons of war and thought it easy to go up into the hill country .

ESV	Deuteronomy	1	43	So I spoke to you , and you would not listen ; but you rebelled against the command of the Lord and ( BC ) presumptuously went up into the hill country .

ESV	Deuteronomy	2	4	and command the people , “ You are about to pass through the territory of ( C ) your brothers , the people of Esau , ( D ) who live in Seir ; and ( E ) they will be afraid of you . So be very careful .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	5	Do not contend with them , for I will not give you any of their land , no , not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on , because ( F ) I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	6	( G ) You shall purchase food from them with money , that you may eat , and you shall also buy water from them with money , that you may drink .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	7	For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands . ( H ) He knows your going through this great wilderness . ( I ) These forty years the Lord your God has been with you . You have lacked nothing. ” ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	8	So ( J ) we went on , away from our brothers , the people of Esau , who live in Seir , away from ( K ) the Arabah road from ( L ) Elath and ( M ) Ezion-geber . “ And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	9	And the Lord said to me , ( N ) ‘ Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle , for I will not give you any of their land for a possession , because I have given ( O ) Ar to ( P ) the people of Lot for a possession. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	10	( ( Q ) The Emim formerly lived there , ( R ) a people great and many , and tall ( S ) as the Anakim .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	11	Like the Anakim they are also counted as ( T ) Rephaim , but the Moabites call them Emim .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	12	( U ) The Horites also lived in Seir formerly , but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place , ( V ) as Israel did to the land of their possession , which the Lord gave to them . )
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	13	‘ Now rise up and go over ( W ) the brook Zered. ’ So we went over ( X ) the brook Zered .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	14	And the time from our leaving ( Y ) Kadesh-barnea until we crossed ( Z ) the brook Zered was thirty-eight years , ( AA ) until the entire generation , that is , the men of war , had perished from the camp , as the Lord had sworn to them .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	15	For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them , to destroy them from the camp , until they had perished .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	16	“ So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	17	the Lord said to me ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	18	‘ Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	19	And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon , ( AB ) do not harass them or contend with them , for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession , because I have given it to ( AC ) the sons of Lot for a possession. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	20	( It is also counted as a land of ( AD ) Rephaim . Rephaim formerly lived there—but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim—
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	21	( AE ) a people great and many , and tall as the Anakim ; but the Lord destroyed them before the Ammonites , [ a ] and they dispossessed them and settled in their place ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	22	as he did for the people of Esau , who live in Seir , when he destroyed ( AF ) the Horites before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	23	As for ( AG ) the Avvim , who lived in villages as far as ( AH ) Gaza , ( AI ) the Caphtorim , who came from Caphtor , destroyed them and settled in their place . )
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	24	‘ Rise up , set out on your journey and ( AJ ) go over the Valley of the Arnon . Behold , I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite , king of ( AK ) Heshbon , and his land . Begin to take possession , and ( AL ) contend with him in battle .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	25	This day I will begin to put ( AM ) the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven , who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you. ’ The Defeat of King Sihon
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	26	“ So I sent messengers from the wilderness of ( AN ) Kedemoth to Sihon the king of ( AO ) Heshbon , ( AP ) with words of peace , saying ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	27	( AQ ) ‘ Let me pass through your land . I will go only by the road ; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	28	( AR ) You shall sell me food for money , that I may eat , and give me water for money , that I may drink . Only let me pass through on foot ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	29	( AS ) as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me , until I go over the Jordan into the land that the Lord our God is giving to us. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	30	But ( AT ) Sihon the king of ( AU ) Heshbon would not let us pass by him , for the Lord your God ( AV ) hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate , that he might give him into your hand , as he is this day .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	31	And the Lord said to me , ‘ Behold , I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you . Begin to take possession , that you may occupy his land. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	32	Then ( AW ) Sihon came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Jahaz .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	33	And ( AX ) the Lord our God gave him over to us , and ( AY ) we defeated him and his sons and all his people .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	34	And we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction [ b ] every ( AZ ) city , men , women , and children . We left no survivors .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	35	Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves , with the plunder of the cities that we captured .
ESV	Deuteronomy	2	36	( BA ) From Aroer , which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon , and from ( BB ) the city that is in the valley , as far as Gilead , there was not a city too high for us . ( BC ) The Lord our God gave all into our hands .

ESV	Deuteronomy	3	3	So the Lord our God gave into our hand Og also , the king of Bashan , and all his people , ( D ) and we struck him down until he had no survivor left .
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	2	But the Lord said to me , ‘ Do not fear him , for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand . And you shall do to him as you did to ( C ) Sihon the king of the Amorites , who lived at Heshbon. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	4	And we took all his cities at that time—there was not a city that we did not take from them—sixty cities , ( E ) the whole region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	5	All these were cities fortified with high walls , gates , and bars , besides very many unwalled villages .
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	6	And ( F ) we devoted them to destruction , [ a ] as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon , devoting to destruction every ( G ) city , men , women , and children .
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	7	But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder .
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	8	So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	9	( the Sidonians call ( H ) Hermon ( I ) Sirion , while the Amorites call it ( J ) Senir ) ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	10	all the cities of the ( K ) tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan , as far as ( L ) Salecah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	11	( For ( M ) only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of ( N ) the Rephaim . Behold , his bed was a bed of iron . Is it not in ( O ) Rabbah of the Ammonites ? Nine cubits [ b ] was its length , and four cubits its breadth , according to the ( P ) common cubit . [ c ] )
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	12	“ When we took possession of this land at that time , I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning ( Q ) at Aroer , which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon , and half the hill country of Gilead with ( R ) its cities .
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	13	( S ) The rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , the kingdom of Og , that is , ( T ) all the region of Argob , I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh . ( All that portion of Bashan is called the land of ( U ) Rephaim .
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	14	( V ) Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob , that is , Bashan , as far as the border of ( W ) the Geshurites and the Maacathites , and called the villages ( X ) after his own name , Havvoth-jair , as it is to this day . )
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	15	To Machir ( Y ) I gave Gilead ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	16	and to the Reubenites ( Z ) and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon , with the middle of the valley as a border , as far over as the river Jabbok , ( AA ) the border of the Ammonites ;
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	17	the Arabah also , with the Jordan as the border , from ( AB ) Chinnereth as far as ( AC ) the Sea of the Arabah , ( AD ) the Salt Sea , under ( AE ) the slopes of Pisgah on the east .

ESV	Deuteronomy	3	21	And I commanded ( AI ) Joshua at that time , ‘ Your eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings . So will the Lord do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing .
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	22	You shall not fear them , for it is ( AJ ) the Lord your God who fights for you. ’ Moses Forbidden to Enter the Land

ESV	Deuteronomy	3	25	Please let me go over and see ( AM ) the good land beyond the Jordan , that good hill country and ( AN ) Lebanon. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	26	But ( AO ) the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me . And the Lord said to me , ( AP ) ‘ Enough from you ; do not speak to me of this matter again .
ESV	Deuteronomy	3	27	( AQ ) Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward , and look at it with your eyes , for you shall not go over this Jordan .

ESV	Deuteronomy	4	11	And ( Q ) you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain , while ( R ) the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven , wrapped in darkness , cloud , and gloom .
ESV	Deuteronomy	4	12	Then ( S ) the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire . You heard the sound of words , ( T ) but saw no form ; ( U ) there was only a voice .
ESV	Deuteronomy	4	13	( V ) And he declared to you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , that is , ( W ) the Ten Commandments , [ b ] ( X ) and he wrote them on two tablets of stone .

ESV	Deuteronomy	4	20	But the Lord has taken you and ( AG ) brought you out of the iron furnace , out of Egypt , ( AH ) to be a people of his own inheritance , as you are this day .
ESV	Deuteronomy	4	21	Furthermore , ( AI ) the Lord was angry with me because of you , and he swore that I should not cross the Jordan , and that I should not enter the good land that the Lord your God is giving you for an inheritance .

ESV	Deuteronomy	4	33	( BB ) Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire , as you have heard , and still live ?

ESV	Deuteronomy	9	4	( H ) “ Do not say in your heart , after the Lord your God has thrust them out before you , ‘ It is because of my righteousness that the Lord has brought me in to possess this land , ’ whereas it is ( I ) because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is driving them out before you .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	5	( J ) Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land , but because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord your God is driving them out from before you , and that he may confirm ( K ) the word that the Lord swore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	6	“ Know , therefore , that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness , for you are ( L ) a stubborn people .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	7	Remember and do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness . ( M ) From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place , you have been rebellious against the Lord .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	8	Even ( N ) at Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath , and the Lord was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	10	And ( Q ) the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God , and on them were all the words that the Lord had spoken with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire ( R ) on the day of the assembly .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	11	And at the end of forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone , the tablets of the covenant .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	12	Then the Lord said to me , ( S ) ‘ Arise , go down quickly from here , for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly . They have ( T ) turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them ; they have made themselves a metal image. ’ The Golden Calf
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	13	( U ) “ Furthermore , the Lord said to me , ‘ I have seen this people , and behold , it is ( V ) a stubborn people .

ESV	Deuteronomy	9	15	( Z ) So I turned and came down from the mountain , and ( AA ) the mountain was burning with fire . And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	16	And ( AB ) I looked , and behold , you had sinned against the Lord your God . You had made yourselves a golden [ a ] calf . ( AC ) You had turned aside quickly from the way that the Lord had commanded you .

ESV	Deuteronomy	9	18	Then I ( AD ) lay prostrate before the Lord ( AE ) as before , forty days and forty nights . I neither ate bread nor drank water , because of all the sin that you had committed , ( AF ) in doing what was evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	19	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure that the Lord bore against you , so that he was ready to destroy you . ( AG ) But the Lord listened to me that time also .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	20	And the Lord was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him . And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	21	Then ( AH ) I took the sinful thing , the calf that you had made , and burned it with fire and crushed it , grinding it very small , until it was as fine as dust . And I threw the dust of it into the brook that ran down from the mountain .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	22	“ At ( AI ) Taberah also , and at ( AJ ) Massah and at ( AK ) Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the Lord to wrath .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	23	And ( AL ) when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea , saying , ‘ Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you , ’ then you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God and ( AM ) did not believe him or obey his voice .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	24	( AN ) You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	25	( AO ) “ So I lay prostrate before the Lord for these forty days and forty nights , because the Lord had said he would destroy you .
ESV	Deuteronomy	9	26	( AP ) And I prayed to the Lord , ‘ O Lord God , do not destroy your people and your heritage , whom you have redeemed through your greatness , whom you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand .

ESV	Deuteronomy	31	31	So Moses continued to speak these words to all Israel .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	2	And he said to them , “ I am ( A )
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	120	years old today . I am no longer able to ( B ) go out and come in . The Lord has said to me , ( C ) ‘ You shall not go over this Jordan. ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	3	The Lord your God ( D ) himself will go over before you . He will destroy these nations before you , so that you shall dispossess them , and Joshua will go over at your head , ( E ) as the Lord has spoken .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	4	And the Lord will do to them ( F ) as he did to Sihon ( G ) and Og , the kings of the Amorites , and to their land , when he destroyed them .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	5	And the Lord will give them over to you , and you shall do to them ( H ) according to the whole commandment that I have commanded you .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	6	( I ) Be strong and courageous . Do not fear or be in dread of them , ( J ) for it is the Lord your God who goes with you . ( K ) He will not leave you or forsake you. ”
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	7	Then ( L ) Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel , ( M ) “ Be strong and courageous , for you shall go with this people into the land that the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them , and you shall put them in possession of it .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	8	It is the Lord ( N ) who goes before you . He will be with you ; ( O ) he will not leave you or forsake you . ( P ) Do not fear or be dismayed. ” The Reading of the Law
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	9	Then Moses ( Q ) wrote this law and gave it to the priests , the sons of Levi , ( R ) who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and to all the elders of Israel .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	10	And Moses commanded them , ( S ) “ At the end of every seven years , at the set time in the year of release , at ( T ) the Feast of Booths ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	11	when all Israel comes ( U ) to appear before the Lord your God at the place that he will choose , ( V ) you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	12	( W ) Assemble the people , men , women , and little ones , and the sojourner within your towns , that they may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God , and be careful to do all the words of this law ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	13	and that their children , ( X ) who have not known it , ( Y ) may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God , ( Z ) as long as you live in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess. ” Joshua Commissioned to Lead Israel
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	14	And the Lord said to Moses , ( AA ) “ Behold , the days approach when you must die . Call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting , that ( AB ) I may commission him. ” And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	15	And ( AC ) the Lord appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud . And the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance of the tent .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	16	And the Lord said to Moses , ( AD ) “ Behold , you are about to lie down with your fathers . Then this people will rise and ( AE ) whore after the foreign gods among them in the land that they are entering , and they will ( AF ) forsake me and ( AG ) break my covenant that I have made with them .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	17	Then my anger will be kindled against them in that day , and ( AH ) I will forsake them and ( AI ) hide my face from them , and they will be devoured . And many evils and troubles will come upon them , so that they will say in that day , ( AJ ) ‘ Have not these evils come upon us because ( AK ) our God is not among us ? ’
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	18	And I will surely hide my face in that day because of all the evil that they have done , because ( AL ) they have turned to other gods .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	19	“ Now therefore write ( AM ) this song and ( AN ) teach it to the people of Israel . Put it in their mouths , that this song may be ( AO ) a witness for me against the people of Israel .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	20	For when I have brought them into the land ( AP ) flowing with milk and honey , which I swore to give to their fathers , and they have eaten and are full and ( AQ ) grown fat , ( AR ) they will turn to other gods and serve them , and ( AS ) despise me and ( AT ) break my covenant .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	21	And when many evils and troubles have come upon them , this song shall confront them as ( AU ) a witness ( for it will live unforgotten in the mouths of their offspring ) . For ( AV ) I know what they are inclined to do even today , before I have brought them into the land that I swore to give. ”
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	22	So Moses wrote this song the same day and taught it to the people of Israel .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	23	( AW ) And the Lord [ a ] commissioned Joshua the son of Nun and said , ( AX ) “ Be strong and courageous , for you shall bring the people of Israel into the land that I swore to give them . ( AY ) I will be with you. ”
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	24	When Moses had finished ( AZ ) writing the words of this law in a book to the very end ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	25	Moses commanded ( BA ) the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	26	“ Take this Book of the Law ( BB ) and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God , that it may be there for ( BC ) a witness against you .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	27	For I know how rebellious and ( BD ) stubborn you are . Behold , even today while I am yet alive with you , ( BE ) you have been rebellious against the Lord . How much more after my death !
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	28	Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers , that I may speak ( BF ) these words in their ears and ( BG ) call heaven and earth to witness against them .
ESV	Deuteronomy	31	29	For I know that after my death ( BH ) you will surely act corruptly and turn aside from the way that I have commanded you . And ( BI ) in the days to come ( BJ ) evil will befall you , because you will do what is evil in the sight of the Lord , ( BK ) provoking him to anger through the work of your hands. ” The Song of Moses

ESV	Deuteronomy	32	6	Do you thus repay the Lord , you foolish and senseless people ? Is not he ( L ) your father , who ( M ) created you , who ( N ) made you and established you ?

ESV	Deuteronomy	32	12	( W ) the Lord alone guided him , ( X ) no foreign god was with him .
ESV	Deuteronomy	32	13	( Y ) He made him ride on the high places of the land , and he ate the produce of the field , and he suckled him with ( Z ) honey out of the rock , and ( AA ) oil out of ( AB ) the flinty rock .

ESV	Deuteronomy	32	16	( AJ ) They stirred him to jealousy with strange gods ; with abominations they provoked him to anger .
ESV	Deuteronomy	32	17	( AK ) They sacrificed to demons that were no gods , to gods they had never known , to ( AL ) new gods that had come recently , whom your fathers had never dreaded .
ESV	Deuteronomy	32	18	You were unmindful of ( AM ) the Rock that bore [ e ] you , and you ( AN ) forgot the God who gave you birth .
ESV	Deuteronomy	32	19	( AO ) “ The Lord saw it and spurned them , because of the provocation of ( AP ) his sons and his daughters .

ESV	Deuteronomy	32	21	( AR ) They have made me jealous with what is no god ; they have provoked me to anger ( AS ) with their idols . So ( AT ) I will make them jealous with those who are no people ; I will provoke them to anger with ( AU ) a foolish nation .

ESV	Deuteronomy	32	25	( BA ) Outdoors the sword shall bereave , and indoors terror , for young man and woman alike , the nursing child with the man of gray hairs .

ESV	Deuteronomy	32	31	For ( BJ ) their rock is not as our Rock ; ( BK ) our enemies are by themselves .
ESV	Deuteronomy	32	33	their wine is the poison of ( BN ) serpents and the cruel venom of asps .

ESV	Deuteronomy	32	44	Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people , he and ( CG ) Joshua [ o ] the son of Nun .
ESV	Deuteronomy	32	45	And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel ,

ESV	Deuteronomy	34	2	all Naphtali , the land of Ephraim and Manasseh , all the land of Judah ( B ) as far as the western sea ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	34	3	( C ) the Negeb , and ( D ) the Plain , that is , the Valley of Jericho ( E ) the city of palm trees , as far as ( F ) Zoar .

ESV	Deuteronomy	34	5	So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of the Lord ,
ESV	Deuteronomy	34	6	and he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor ; but ( J ) no one knows the place of his burial to this day .

ESV	Joshua	1	1	After the death of Moses the ( A ) servant of the Lord , the Lord said to Joshua the son of Nun , Moses ' ( B ) assistant ,
ESV	Joshua	1	2	“ Moses my servant is dead . Now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , you and all this people , into the land that I am giving to them , to the people of Israel .
ESV	Joshua	1	3	( C ) Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you , just as I promised to Moses .
ESV	Joshua	1	4	( D ) From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory .
ESV	Joshua	1	5	( E ) No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life . Just ( F ) as I was with Moses , so ( G ) I will be with you . ( H ) I will not leave you or forsake you .
ESV	Joshua	1	6	( I ) Be strong and courageous , for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them .
ESV	Joshua	1	7	Only be strong and ( J ) very courageous , being careful to do according to all the law ( K ) that Moses my servant commanded you . ( L ) Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left , that you may have good success [ a ] wherever you go .
ESV	Joshua	1	8	This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth , but ( M ) you shall meditate on it day and night , so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it . For then you will make your way prosperous , and then you will have good success .
ESV	Joshua	1	9	Have I not commanded you ? ( N ) Be strong and courageous . ( O ) Do not be frightened , and do not be dismayed , for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. ” Joshua Assumes Command
ESV	Joshua	1	10	And Joshua commanded the ( P ) officers of the people ,
ESV	Joshua	1	11	“ Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people , ‘ Prepare your provisions , for ( Q ) within three days ( R ) you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess. ’ ”
ESV	Joshua	1	12	And to the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said ,
ESV	Joshua	1	13	“ Remember the word that ( S ) Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , saying , ‘ The Lord your God is providing you a place of rest and will give you this land. ’
ESV	Joshua	1	14	Your wives , your little ones , and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan , but all the men of valor among you shall pass over armed before your brothers and shall help them ,
ESV	Joshua	1	15	( T ) until the Lord gives rest to your brothers as he has to you , and they also take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving them . ( U ) Then you shall return to the land of your possession and shall possess it , the land that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise. ”
ESV	Joshua	1	16	And they answered Joshua , “ All that you have commanded us we will do , and wherever you send us we will go .
ESV	Joshua	1	17	Just as we obeyed Moses in all things , so we will obey you . Only may the Lord your God ( V ) be with you , as he was with Moses !
ESV	Joshua	1	18	Whoever rebels against your commandment and disobeys your words , whatever you command him , shall be put to death . ( W ) Only be strong and courageous. ” Footnotes - Joshua 1:7 Or may act wisely The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Joshua	2	2	And it was told to the king of Jericho , “ Behold , men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land. ”
ESV	Joshua	2	3	Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab , saying , “ Bring out the men who have come to you , who entered your house , for they have come to search out all the land. ”
ESV	Joshua	2	4	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them . And she said , “ True , the men came to me , but I did not know where they were from .
ESV	Joshua	2	5	And when the gate was about to be closed at dark , the men went out . I do not know where the men went . Pursue them quickly , for you will overtake them. ”
ESV	Joshua	2	6	But she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax that she had laid in order on the roof .
ESV	Joshua	2	7	So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan ( D ) as far as the fords . And the gate was shut as soon as the pursuers had gone out .
ESV	Joshua	2	8	Before the men [ b ] lay down , she came up to them on the roof
ESV	Joshua	2	9	and said to the men , “ I know that the Lord has given you the land , ( E ) and that the fear of you has fallen upon us , and that all the inhabitants of the land ( F ) melt away before you .
ESV	Joshua	2	10	For we have heard how the Lord ( G ) dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt , and ( H ) what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , to ( I ) Sihon and Og , whom you devoted to destruction . [ c ]
ESV	Joshua	2	11	And ( J ) as soon as we heard it , ( K ) our hearts melted , and there was no spirit left in any man because of you , for ( L ) the Lord your God , he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath .
ESV	Joshua	2	12	Now then , please swear to me by the Lord that , as I have dealt kindly with you , you also will deal kindly with my father 's house , and ( M ) give me a sure sign
ESV	Joshua	2	13	that you will save alive my father and mother , my brothers and sisters , and all who belong to them , and deliver our lives from death. ”
ESV	Joshua	2	14	And the men said to her , “ Our life for yours even to death ! If you do not tell this business of ours , then when the Lord gives us the land ( N ) we will deal kindly and faithfully with you. ”
ESV	Joshua	2	15	Then she ( O ) let them down by a rope through the window , for her house was built into the city wall , so that she lived in the wall .
ESV	Joshua	2	16	And she said [ d ] to them , “ Go into the hills , or the pursuers will encounter you , and hide there three days until the pursuers have returned . Then afterward you may go your way. ”
ESV	Joshua	2	17	The men said to her , “ We will be guiltless with respect to this oath of yours that you have made us swear .
ESV	Joshua	2	18	( P ) Behold , when we come into the land , you shall tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down , ( Q ) and you shall gather into your house your father and mother , your brothers , and all your father 's household .
ESV	Joshua	2	19	Then if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street , ( R ) his blood shall be on his own head , and we shall be guiltless . But if a hand is laid on anyone who is with you in the house , his blood shall be on our head .
ESV	Joshua	2	20	But if you ( S ) tell this business of ours , then we shall be guiltless with respect to your oath that you have made us swear. ”
ESV	Joshua	2	21	And she said , “ According to your words , so be it. ” Then she sent them away , and they departed . And she tied the scarlet cord in the window .
ESV	Joshua	2	22	They departed and went into the hills and remained there three days until the pursuers returned , and the pursuers searched all along the way and found nothing .
ESV	Joshua	2	23	Then the two men returned . They came down from the hills and ( T ) passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun , and they told him all that had happened to them .
ESV	Joshua	2	24	And they said to Joshua , “ Truly ( U ) the Lord has given all the land into our hands .

ESV	Joshua	3	3	and commanded the people , “ As soon as you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God being carried by ( C ) the Levitical priests , then you shall set out from your place and follow it .
ESV	Joshua	3	2	( B ) At the end of three days the officers went through the camp
ESV	Joshua	3	4	( D ) Yet there shall be a distance between you and it , about 2,000 cubits [ a ] in length . Do not come near it , in order that you may know the way you shall go , for you have not passed this way before. ”
ESV	Joshua	3	5	Then Joshua said to the people , ( E ) “ Consecrate yourselves , for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you. ”
ESV	Joshua	3	6	And Joshua said to the priests , ( F ) “ Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on before the people. ” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people .
ESV	Joshua	3	7	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Today I will begin to ( G ) exalt you in the sight of all Israel , that they may know that , ( H ) as I was with Moses , so I will be with you .
ESV	Joshua	3	8	And as for you , command ( I ) the priests who bear the ark of the covenant , ‘ When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan , ( J ) you shall stand still in the Jordan. ’ ”
ESV	Joshua	3	9	And Joshua said to the people of Israel , “ Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God. ”
ESV	Joshua	3	10	And Joshua said , “ Here is how you shall know that ( K ) the living God is among you and that he will without fail ( L ) drive out from before you the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Hivites , the Perizzites , the Girgashites , the Amorites , and the Jebusites .
ESV	Joshua	3	11	Behold , the ark of the covenant of ( M ) the Lord of all the earth [ b ] ( N ) is passing over before you into the Jordan .
ESV	Joshua	3	12	Now therefore ( O ) take twelve men from the tribes of Israel , ( P ) from each tribe a man .
ESV	Joshua	3	13	And ( Q ) when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the Lord , ( R ) the Lord of all the earth , shall rest in the waters of the Jordan , the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from flowing , and the waters coming down from above shall ( S ) stand in one heap. ”
ESV	Joshua	3	14	So when the people set out from their tents to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing ( T ) the ark of the covenant before the people ,
ESV	Joshua	3	15	and as soon as those bearing the ark had come as far as the Jordan , and ( U ) the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water ( now ( V ) the Jordan overflows all its banks ( W ) throughout the time of harvest ) ,
ESV	Joshua	3	16	the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far away , at Adam , the city that is beside ( X ) Zarethan , and those flowing down toward the Sea of ( Y ) the Arabah , ( Z ) the Salt Sea , were completely cut off . And the people passed over opposite Jericho .
ESV	Joshua	3	17	Now the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firmly on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan , ( AA ) and all Israel was passing over on dry ground until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan . Footnotes - Joshua 3:4 A cubit was about

ESV	Joshua	4	4	Then Joshua called the twelve men from the people of Israel , whom he had appointed , a man from each tribe .
ESV	Joshua	4	2	( B ) “ Take twelve men from the people , from each tribe a man ,
ESV	Joshua	4	3	and command them , saying , ‘ Take ( C ) twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan , from the very place ( D ) where the priests ' feet stood firmly , and bring them over with you and lay them down in ( E ) the place where you lodge tonight. ’ ”
ESV	Joshua	4	5	And Joshua said to them , “ Pass on before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan , and take up each of you a stone upon his shoulder , according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel ,
ESV	Joshua	4	6	that this may be a sign among you . ( F ) When your children ask in time to come , ‘ What do those stones mean to you ? ’
ESV	Joshua	4	7	then you shall tell them that ( G ) the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord . When it passed over the Jordan , the waters of the Jordan were cut off . So these stones shall be to the people of Israel ( H ) a memorial forever. ”
ESV	Joshua	4	8	And the people of Israel did just as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan , according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel , just as the Lord told Joshua . And they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down [ a ] there .
ESV	Joshua	4	9	And Joshua set up [ b ] twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan , ( I ) in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood ; and they are there to this day .
ESV	Joshua	4	10	For the priests bearing the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to tell the people , according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua . The people passed over in haste .
ESV	Joshua	4	11	And when all the people had finished passing over , the ark of the Lord and the priests passed over before the people .
ESV	Joshua	4	12	The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh ( J ) passed over armed before the people of Israel , as Moses had told them .
ESV	Joshua	4	13	About 40,000 ready for war passed over before the Lord for battle , to the plains of Jericho .
ESV	Joshua	4	14	On that day the Lord ( K ) exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel , and they stood in awe of him just as they had stood in awe of Moses , all the days of his life .
ESV	Joshua	4	15	And the Lord said to Joshua ,
ESV	Joshua	4	16	“ Command the priests bearing ( L ) the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan. ”
ESV	Joshua	4	17	So Joshua commanded the priests , “ Come up out of the Jordan. ”
ESV	Joshua	4	18	And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord came up from the midst of the Jordan , and the soles of the priests ' feet were lifted up on dry ground , the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks , ( M ) as before .
ESV	Joshua	4	19	The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and they encamped at ( N ) Gilgal on the east border of Jericho .
ESV	Joshua	4	20	And ( O ) those twelve stones , which they took out of the Jordan , Joshua set up at Gilgal .
ESV	Joshua	4	21	And he said to the people of Israel , ( P ) “ When your children ask their fathers in times to come , ‘ What do these stones mean ? ’
ESV	Joshua	4	22	then you shall let your children know , ( Q ) ‘ Israel passed over this Jordan on dry ground. ’
ESV	Joshua	4	23	For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over , as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea , ( R ) which he dried up for us until we passed over ,

ESV	Joshua	5	5	Though all the people who came out had been circumcised , yet all the people who were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised .
ESV	Joshua	5	2	At that time the Lord said to Joshua , “ Make ( E ) flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time. ”
ESV	Joshua	5	3	So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth . [ a ]
ESV	Joshua	5	4	And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them : ( F ) all the males of the people who came out of Egypt , all the men of war , had died in the wilderness on the way after they had come out of Egypt .
ESV	Joshua	5	6	For the people of Israel walked ( G ) forty years in the wilderness , until all the nation , the men of war who came out of Egypt , perished , because they did not obey the voice of the Lord ; the Lord ( H ) swore to them that he would not let them see the land that the Lord had sworn to their fathers to give to us , ( I ) a land flowing with milk and honey .
ESV	Joshua	5	7	So it was ( J ) their children , whom he raised up in their place , that Joshua circumcised . For they were uncircumcised , because they had not been circumcised on the way .
ESV	Joshua	5	8	When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished , they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed .
ESV	Joshua	5	9	And the Lord said to Joshua , “ Today I have rolled away the ( K ) reproach of Egypt from you. ” And so the name of that place is called ( L ) Gilgal [ b ] to this day . First Passover in Canaan
ESV	Joshua	5	10	While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal , they kept the Passover ( M ) on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho .
ESV	Joshua	5	11	And the day after the Passover , on that very day , they ate of the produce of the land , unleavened cakes and parched grain .
ESV	Joshua	5	12	And ( N ) the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land . And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel , but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year . The Commander of the Lord 's Army
ESV	Joshua	5	13	When Joshua was by Jericho , he lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , ( O ) a man was standing before him ( P ) with his drawn sword in his hand . And Joshua went to him and said to him , “ Are you for us , or for our adversaries ? ”
ESV	Joshua	5	14	And he said , “ No ; but I am the commander of the army of the Lord . Now I have come. ” And Joshua ( Q ) fell on his face to the earth and worshiped [ c ] and said to him , “ What does my lord say to his servant ? ”
ESV	Joshua	5	15	And the commander of the Lord 's army said to Joshua , ( R ) “ Take off your sandals from your feet , for the place where you are standing is holy. ” And Joshua did so .

ESV	Joshua	6	6	So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them , “ Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the ark of the Lord. ”
ESV	Joshua	6	2	And the Lord said to Joshua , “ See , ( A ) I have given Jericho into your hand , with its king and mighty men of valor .
ESV	Joshua	6	3	You shall march around the city , all the men of war going around the city once . Thus shall you do for six days .
ESV	Joshua	6	4	Seven priests shall bear seven ( B ) trumpets of ( C ) rams ' horns before the ark . On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times , and ( D ) the priests shall blow the trumpets .
ESV	Joshua	6	5	And when they make a long blast with the ram 's horn , when you hear the sound of the trumpet , then all the people shall shout with a great shout , and the wall of the city will fall down flat , [ a ] and the people shall go up , everyone straight before him. ”
ESV	Joshua	6	7	And he said to the people , “ Go forward . March around the city and let ( E ) the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord. ”
ESV	Joshua	6	8	And just as Joshua had commanded the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the Lord went forward , blowing the trumpets , with the ark of the covenant of the Lord following them .
ESV	Joshua	6	9	The armed men were walking before the priests who were blowing the trumpets , and the ( F ) rear guard was walking after the ark , while the trumpets blew continually .
ESV	Joshua	6	10	But Joshua commanded the people , “ You shall not shout or make your voice heard , neither shall any word go out of your mouth , until the day I tell you to shout . Then you shall shout. ”
ESV	Joshua	6	11	So he caused the ark of the Lord to circle the city , going about it once . And they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp .
ESV	Joshua	6	12	Then Joshua rose early in the morning , and ( G ) the priests took up the ark of the Lord .
ESV	Joshua	6	13	And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the ark of the Lord walked on , and they blew the trumpets continually . And the armed men were walking before them , and the rear guard was walking after the ark of the Lord , while the trumpets blew continually .
ESV	Joshua	6	14	And the second day they marched around the city once , and returned into the camp . So they did for six days .
ESV	Joshua	6	15	On the seventh day they rose early , at the dawn of day , and marched around the city in the same manner seven times . It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times .
ESV	Joshua	6	16	And at the seventh time , when the priests had blown the trumpets , Joshua said to the people , “ Shout , for the Lord has given you the city .
ESV	Joshua	6	17	And the city and all that is within it shall be ( H ) devoted to the Lord for destruction . [ b ] Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live , because she ( I ) hid the messengers whom we sent .

ESV	Joshua	6	26	Joshua laid an oath on them at that time , saying , ( R ) “ Cursed before the Lord be the man who rises up and rebuilds this city , Jericho . “ At the cost of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation , and at the cost of his youngest son shall he set up its gates. ”

ESV	Joshua	7	7	And Joshua said , “ Alas , O Lord God , ( H ) why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all , to give us into the hands of the Amorites , to destroy us ? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan !
ESV	Joshua	7	2	Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is near ( B ) Beth-aven , east of Bethel , and said to them , “ Go up and spy out the land. ” And the men went up and spied out Ai .
ESV	Joshua	7	3	And they returned to Joshua and said to him , “ Do not have all the people go up , but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai . Do not make the whole people toil up there , for they are few. ”
ESV	Joshua	7	4	So about three thousand men went up there from the people . And ( C ) they fled before the men of Ai ,
ESV	Joshua	7	5	and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six of their men and chased them before the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them at the descent . And the hearts of the people ( D ) melted and became as water .
ESV	Joshua	7	6	Then Joshua ( E ) tore his clothes and ( F ) fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord until the evening , he and the elders of Israel . And they put ( G ) dust on their heads .

ESV	Joshua	7	14	In the morning therefore you shall be brought near ( Q ) by your tribes . And the tribe that the Lord takes by lot shall come near by clans . And the clan that the Lord takes shall come near by households . And the household that the Lord takes shall come near man by man .
ESV	Joshua	7	15	( R ) And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire , he and all that he has , because he has ( S ) transgressed the covenant of the Lord , and because he has done ( T ) an outrageous thing in Israel. ’ ”

ESV	Joshua	7	17	And he brought near the clans of Judah , and the clan of the ( U ) Zerahites was taken . And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man , and Zabdi was taken .
ESV	Joshua	7	18	And he brought near his household man by man , and Achan the son of Carmi , son of Zabdi , son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was taken .
ESV	Joshua	7	19	Then Joshua said to Achan , “ My son , ( V ) give glory to the Lord God of Israel and ( W ) give praise [ b ] to him . And ( X ) tell me now what you have done ; do not hide it from me. ”
ESV	Joshua	7	20	And Achan answered Joshua , “ Truly ( Y ) I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel , and this is what I did :
ESV	Joshua	7	21	when I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar , and
ESV	Joshua	7	200	shekels of silver , and a bar of gold weighing
ESV	Joshua	7	50	shekels , [ c ] then I coveted them and took them . And see , they are hidden in the earth inside my tent , with the silver underneath. ”
ESV	Joshua	7	22	So Joshua sent messengers , and they ran to the tent ; and behold , it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath .
ESV	Joshua	7	23	And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel . And they laid them down before the Lord .
ESV	Joshua	7	24	And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah , and the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold , and his sons and daughters and his oxen and donkeys and sheep and his tent and all that he had . And they brought them up to the ( Z ) Valley of Achor .
ESV	Joshua	7	25	And Joshua said , “ Why did you ( AA ) bring trouble on us ? The Lord brings trouble on you today. ” And all Israel ( AB ) stoned him with stones . ( AC ) They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones .
ESV	Joshua	7	26	And they raised over him ( AD ) a great heap of stones that remains to this day . Then ( AE ) the Lord turned from his burning anger . Therefore , to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor .

ESV	Joshua	8	8	And as soon as you have taken the city , you shall set the city on fire . You shall do according to the word of the Lord . ( H ) See , I have commanded you. ”
ESV	Joshua	8	2	And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did ( C ) to Jericho and its king . Only ( D ) its spoil and its livestock you shall take as plunder for yourselves . Lay an ambush against the city , behind it. ”
ESV	Joshua	8	3	So Joshua and all the fighting men arose to go up to Ai . And Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out by night .
ESV	Joshua	8	4	And he commanded them , “ Behold , ( E ) you shall lie in ambush against the city , behind it . Do not go very far from the city , but all of you remain ready .
ESV	Joshua	8	5	And I and all the people who are with me will approach the city . And when they come out against us ( F ) just as before , we shall flee before them .
ESV	Joshua	8	6	And they will come out after us , until we have ( G ) drawn them away from the city . For they will say , ‘ They are fleeing from us , just as before. ’ So we will flee before them .
ESV	Joshua	8	7	Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city , for the Lord your God will give it into your hand .
ESV	Joshua	8	9	So Joshua sent them out . And they went to the place of ambush and lay between Bethel and Ai , to the west of Ai , but Joshua spent that night among the people .
ESV	Joshua	8	10	Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people and went up , he and the elders of Israel , before the people to Ai .
ESV	Joshua	8	11	And ( I ) all the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai , with a ravine between them and Ai .
ESV	Joshua	8	12	He took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai , to the west of the city .
ESV	Joshua	8	13	So they stationed the forces , the main encampment that was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city . But Joshua spent that night in the valley .
ESV	Joshua	8	14	And as soon as the king of Ai saw this , he and all his people , the men of the city , hurried and went out early to the appointed place [ a ] toward ( J ) the Arabah to meet Israel in battle . ( K ) But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city .
ESV	Joshua	8	15	And Joshua and all Israel ( L ) pretended to be beaten before them and fled in the direction of the wilderness .
ESV	Joshua	8	16	So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them , and as they pursued Joshua they ( M ) were drawn away from the city .
ESV	Joshua	8	17	Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel . They left the city open and pursued Israel .
ESV	Joshua	8	18	Then the Lord said to Joshua , ( N ) “ Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai , for I will give it into your hand. ” And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city .
ESV	Joshua	8	19	And the men in the ambush rose quickly out of their place , and as soon as he had stretched out his hand , they ran and entered the city and captured it . And they hurried to set the city on fire .
ESV	Joshua	8	20	So when the men of Ai looked back , behold , the smoke of the city went up to heaven , and they had no power to flee this way or that , for the people who fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers .
ESV	Joshua	8	21	And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city , and that the smoke of the city went up , then they turned back and struck down the men of Ai .
ESV	Joshua	8	22	And the others came out from the city against them , so they were in the midst of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side . And Israel struck them down , until there was ( O ) left none that survived or escaped .
ESV	Joshua	8	23	But the king of Ai they took alive , and brought him near to Joshua .
ESV	Joshua	8	24	When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them , and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword , all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the edge of the sword .
ESV	Joshua	8	25	And all who fell that day , both men and women , were 12,000 , all the people of Ai .
ESV	Joshua	8	26	But Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he ( P ) stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to destruction . [ b ]
ESV	Joshua	8	27	Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as their plunder , according to the word of the Lord that he ( Q ) commanded Joshua .
ESV	Joshua	8	28	So Joshua burned Ai and made it forever a ( R ) heap of ruins , as it is to this day .
ESV	Joshua	8	29	( S ) And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening . ( T ) And at sunset Joshua commanded , and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city and ( U ) raised over it a great heap of stones , which stands there to this day . Joshua Renews the Covenant
ESV	Joshua	8	30	At that time Joshua built an altar to the Lord , the God of Israel , ( V ) on Mount Ebal ,
ESV	Joshua	8	31	just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the people of Israel , as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses , “ an altar of uncut stones , upon which no man has wielded an iron tool. ” And they offered on it burnt offerings to the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings .
ESV	Joshua	8	32	And there , in the presence of the people of Israel , he wrote on ( W ) the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he had written .
ESV	Joshua	8	33	And all Israel , ( X ) sojourner as well as native born , with their elders and officers and their judges , stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests ( Y ) who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal , ( Z ) just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded at the first , to bless the people of Israel .
ESV	Joshua	8	34	And afterward ( AA ) he read all the words of the law , ( AB ) the blessing and the curse , according to all that is written in the Book of the Law .
ESV	Joshua	8	35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel , ( AC ) and the women , and the little ones , and ( AD ) the sojourners who lived [ c ] among them .

ESV	Joshua	9	9	They said to him , ( K ) “ From a very distant country your servants have come , because of the name of the Lord your God . ( L ) For we have heard a report of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
ESV	Joshua	9	2	they gathered together as one to fight against Joshua and Israel .
ESV	Joshua	9	3	But when the inhabitants of ( D ) Gibeon heard what Joshua had done ( E ) to Jericho and ( F ) to Ai ,
ESV	Joshua	9	4	they on their part acted with cunning and went and made ready provisions and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys , and wineskins , worn-out and torn and mended ,
ESV	Joshua	9	5	with worn-out , patched sandals on their feet , and worn-out clothes . And all their provisions were dry and crumbly .
ESV	Joshua	9	6	And they went to Joshua in ( G ) the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel , “ We have come from a distant country , so now make a covenant with us. ”
ESV	Joshua	9	7	But the men of Israel said to ( H ) the Hivites , “ Perhaps you live among us ; then ( I ) how can we make a covenant with you ? ”
ESV	Joshua	9	8	They said to Joshua , ( J ) “ We are your servants. ” And Joshua said to them , “ Who are you ? And where do you come from ? ”
ESV	Joshua	9	10	( M ) and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , to Sihon the king of Heshbon , and to Og king of Bashan , who lived in ( N ) Ashtaroth .
ESV	Joshua	9	11	So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us , ‘ Take provisions in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say to them , “ We are your servants . Come now , make a covenant with us. ” ’
ESV	Joshua	9	12	Here is our bread . It was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey on the day we set out to come to you , but now , behold , it is dry and crumbly .
ESV	Joshua	9	13	These wineskins were new when we filled them , and behold , they have burst . And these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey. ”
ESV	Joshua	9	14	So the men took some of their provisions , but ( O ) did not ask counsel from the Lord .
ESV	Joshua	9	15	And Joshua ( P ) made peace with them and made a covenant with them , to let them live , and the leaders of the congregation swore to them .
ESV	Joshua	9	16	At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them , they heard that they were their neighbors ( Q ) and that they lived among them .
ESV	Joshua	9	17	And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day . ( R ) Now their cities were Gibeon , Chephirah , Beeroth , and Kiriath-jearim .
ESV	Joshua	9	18	But the people of Israel did not attack them , because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the Lord , the God of Israel . Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders .
ESV	Joshua	9	19	But all the leaders said to all the congregation , “ We have sworn to them by the Lord , the God of Israel , and now we may not touch them .
ESV	Joshua	9	20	This we will do to them : let them live , lest ( S ) wrath be upon us , ( T ) because of the oath that we swore to them. ”
ESV	Joshua	9	21	And the leaders said to them , “ Let them live. ” So they became ( U ) cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation , just as the leaders ( V ) had said of them .
ESV	Joshua	9	22	Joshua summoned them , and he said to them , “ Why did you deceive us , saying , ( W ) ‘ We are very far from you , ’ when ( X ) you dwell among us ?
ESV	Joshua	9	23	Now therefore you are cursed , and some of you shall never be anything but servants , ( Y ) cutters of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God. ”
ESV	Joshua	9	24	They answered Joshua , “ Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the Lord your God had ( Z ) commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you—so ( AA ) we feared greatly for our lives because of you and did this thing .
ESV	Joshua	9	25	And now , behold , we are in your hand . Whatever seems good and right in your sight to do to us , do it. ”
ESV	Joshua	9	26	So he did this to them and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel , and they did not kill them .
ESV	Joshua	9	27	But Joshua made them that day ( AB ) cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord , to this day , ( AC ) in the place that he should choose . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Joshua	10	10	( K ) And the Lord threw them into a panic before Israel , who [ c ] struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and chased them by the way of ( L ) the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah .
ESV	Joshua	10	2	( D ) he [ b ] feared greatly , because Gibeon was a great city , like one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than Ai , and all its men were warriors .
ESV	Joshua	10	3	So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron , to Piram king of Jarmuth , to Japhia king of Lachish , and to Debir king of Eglon , saying ,
ESV	Joshua	10	4	“ Come up to me and help me , and let us strike Gibeon . For ( E ) it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel. ”
ESV	Joshua	10	5	Then the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon , ( F ) gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon and made war against it .
ESV	Joshua	10	6	And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua ( G ) at the camp in Gilgal , saying , “ Do not relax your hand from your servants . Come up to us quickly and save us and help us , for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us. ”
ESV	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal , he and ( H ) all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valor .
ESV	Joshua	10	8	And the Lord said to Joshua , ( I ) “ Do not fear them , for I have given them into your hands . ( J ) Not a man of them shall stand before you. ”
ESV	Joshua	10	9	So Joshua came upon them suddenly , having marched up all night from Gilgal .
ESV	Joshua	10	11	And as they fled before Israel , while they were ( M ) going down the ascent of Beth-horon , ( N ) the Lord threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah , and they died . There were more who died because of the hailstones than the sons of Israel killed with the sword .
ESV	Joshua	10	12	At that time Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel , and he said in the sight of Israel , ( O ) “ Sun , stand still at Gibeon , and moon , in the Valley of Aijalon. ”
ESV	Joshua	10	13	And the sun stood still , and the moon stopped , until the nation took vengeance on their enemies . Is this not written in the Book of Jashar ? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day .
ESV	Joshua	10	14	( P ) There has been no day like it before or since , when the Lord heeded the voice of a man , for ( Q ) the Lord fought for Israel .
ESV	Joshua	10	15	So ( R ) Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to the camp at Gilgal . Five Amorite Kings Executed
ESV	Joshua	10	16	These five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at ( S ) Makkedah .
ESV	Joshua	10	17	And it was told to Joshua , “ The five kings have been found , hidden in the cave at Makkedah. ”
ESV	Joshua	10	18	And Joshua said , “ Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them ,
ESV	Joshua	10	19	but do not stay there yourselves . Pursue your enemies ; ( T ) attack their rear guard . Do not let them enter their cities , for the Lord your God has given them into your hand. ”
ESV	Joshua	10	20	When Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them with a great blow ( U ) until they were wiped out , and when the remnant that remained of them had entered into the fortified cities ,
ESV	Joshua	10	21	then all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah . ( V ) Not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel .
ESV	Joshua	10	22	Then Joshua said , “ Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me from the cave. ”
ESV	Joshua	10	23	And they did so , and brought those five kings out to him from the cave , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
ESV	Joshua	10	24	And when they brought those kings out to Joshua , Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him , “ Come near ; put your feet on the necks of these kings. ” Then they came near and put their feet on their necks .
ESV	Joshua	10	25	And Joshua said to them , ( W ) “ Do not be afraid or dismayed ; be strong and courageous . ( X ) For thus the Lord will do to all your enemies against whom you fight. ”
ESV	Joshua	10	26	And afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death , and he hanged them on five trees . And ( Y ) they hung on the trees until evening .
ESV	Joshua	10	27	But at the time of the going down of the sun , Joshua commanded , and ( Z ) they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves , and they set large stones against the mouth of the cave , which remain to this very day .
ESV	Joshua	10	28	,
ESV	Joshua	10	29	Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to ( AC ) Libnah and fought against Libnah .
ESV	Joshua	10	30	And the Lord gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel . And he struck it with the edge of the sword , and every person in it ; he left none remaining in it . And he did to its king ( AD ) as he had done to the king of Jericho .
ESV	Joshua	10	31	Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to ( AE ) Lachish and laid siege to it and fought against it .
ESV	Joshua	10	32	And the Lord gave Lachish into the hand of Israel , and he captured it on the second day and struck it with the edge of the sword , and every person in it , as he had done to Libnah .
ESV	Joshua	10	33	Then Horam king of ( AF ) Gezer came up to help Lachish . And Joshua struck him and his people , until he left none remaining .
ESV	Joshua	10	34	Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to ( AG ) Eglon . And they laid siege to it and fought against it .
ESV	Joshua	10	35	,
ESV	Joshua	10	36	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to ( AH ) Hebron . And they fought against it

ESV	Joshua	11	2	and to the kings who were in the northern hill country , and in the ( B ) Arabah south of ( C ) Chinneroth , and in the lowland , and ( D ) in Naphoth-dor on the ( E ) west ,
ESV	Joshua	11	3	to the Canaanites in the east and the west , the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , and the ( F ) Jebusites in the hill country , and the ( G ) Hivites under ( H ) Hermon in the land of ( I ) Mizpah .
ESV	Joshua	11	4	And they came out with all their troops , a great horde , in number ( J ) like the sand that is on the seashore , with very many horses and chariots .
ESV	Joshua	11	5	And all these kings joined their forces and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel .
ESV	Joshua	11	6	And the Lord said to Joshua , ( K ) “ Do not be afraid of them , for tomorrow at this time I will give over all of them , slain , to Israel . You shall ( L ) hamstring their horses and burn their ( M ) chariots with fire. ”
ESV	Joshua	11	7	So Joshua and all his warriors came ( N ) suddenly against them by the waters of Merom and fell upon them .
ESV	Joshua	11	8	And the Lord gave them into the hand of Israel , who struck them and chased them as far as ( O ) Great Sidon and ( P ) Misrephoth-maim , and eastward as far as the Valley of ( Q ) Mizpeh . And they struck them until he left none remaining .
ESV	Joshua	11	9	And Joshua did to them ( R ) just as the Lord said to him : he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire .
ESV	Joshua	11	10	And Joshua turned back at that time and captured ( S ) Hazor and struck its king with the sword , for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms .
ESV	Joshua	11	12	,
ESV	Joshua	11	13	But none of the cities that stood on mounds did Israel burn , except Hazor alone ; that Joshua burned .
ESV	Joshua	11	14	And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock , the people of Israel took for their plunder . But every person they struck with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them , and they did not leave any who breathed .

ESV	Joshua	11	17	( AD ) from Mount Halak , which rises toward Seir , as far as ( AE ) Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below ( AF ) Mount Hermon . And he captured ( AG ) all their kings and struck them and put them to death .

ESV	Joshua	13	13	( Z ) Yet the people of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites , but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day .
ESV	Joshua	13	2	( C ) This is the land that yet remains : all the ( D ) regions of the Philistines , and all those of the Geshurites
ESV	Joshua	13	3	( from the ( E ) Shihor , which is east of Egypt , northward to the boundary of Ekron , it is counted as Canaanite ; ( F ) there are five rulers of the Philistines , those of Gaza , Ashdod , Ashkelon , Gath , and Ekron ) , and those of ( G ) the Avvim ,
ESV	Joshua	13	4	in the south , all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians , to Aphek , to the boundary of ( H ) the Amorites ,
ESV	Joshua	13	5	and the land of the ( I ) Gebalites , and all Lebanon , toward the sunrise , from ( J ) Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to ( K ) Lebo-hamath ,
ESV	Joshua	13	6	all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to ( L ) Misrephoth-maim , even all the Sidonians . I myself will drive ( M ) them out from before the people of Israel . Only ( N ) allot the land to Israel ( O ) for an inheritance , as I have commanded you .
ESV	Joshua	13	7	Now therefore ( P ) divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh. ” The Inheritance East of the Jordan

ESV	Joshua	13	15	And Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the people of Reuben according to their clans .

ESV	Joshua	13	22	( AN ) Balaam also , the son of Beor , the one who practiced divination , was killed with the sword by the people of Israel among the rest of their slain .
ESV	Joshua	13	23	And the border of the people of Reuben was the Jordan as a boundary . This was the inheritance of the people of Reuben , according to their clans with their cities and villages .

ESV	Joshua	13	28	This is the inheritance of the people of Gad according to their clans , with their cities and villages .
ESV	Joshua	13	29	And Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh . It was allotted to the half-tribe of the people of Manasseh according to their clans .

ESV	Joshua	13	32	These are the inheritances that Moses distributed ( AX ) in the plains of Moab , beyond the Jordan east of Jericho .

ESV	Joshua	14	14	Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day , ( U ) because he wholly followed the Lord , the God of Israel .
ESV	Joshua	14	2	Their inheritance was ( B ) by lot , just as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine and one-half tribes .
ESV	Joshua	14	3	( C ) For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan , ( D ) but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them .
ESV	Joshua	14	4	For ( E ) the people of Joseph were two tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim . And no portion was given to the Levites in the land , but only cities to dwell in , with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance .
ESV	Joshua	14	5	The people of Israel did ( F ) as the Lord commanded Moses ; they allotted the land . Caleb 's Request and Inheritance
ESV	Joshua	14	6	Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal . And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the ( G ) Kenizzite said to him , “ You know ( H ) what the Lord said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me .
ESV	Joshua	14	7	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord ( I ) sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land , and I brought him word again as it was in my heart .
ESV	Joshua	14	8	But ( J ) my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt ; yet I wholly followed the Lord my God .
ESV	Joshua	14	9	And Moses swore on that day , saying , ( K ) ‘ Surely the land ( L ) on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever , because you have wholly followed the Lord my God. ’
ESV	Joshua	14	10	And now , behold , the Lord has kept me alive , ( M ) just as he said , these ( N ) forty-five years since the time that the Lord spoke this word to Moses , while Israel walked in the wilderness . And now , behold , I am this day ( O ) eighty-five years old .
ESV	Joshua	14	11	( P ) I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me ; my strength now is as my strength was then , for war and ( Q ) for going and coming .
ESV	Joshua	14	12	So now give me this hill country of which the Lord spoke on that day , for you heard on that day how the ( R ) Anakim were there , with great fortified cities . It may be that the Lord will be with me , and I shall drive them out just as the Lord said. ”
ESV	Joshua	14	13	Then Joshua ( S ) blessed him , and he gave ( T ) Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance .
ESV	Joshua	14	15	( V ) Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba . [ a ] ( Arba [ b ] was the greatest man among the Anakim . ) ( W ) And the land had rest from war .

ESV	Joshua	15	15	And he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir . ( AA ) Now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher .
ESV	Joshua	15	2	And their south boundary ran from the end of the ( C ) Salt Sea , from the bay that faces southward .

And the boundary goes up to the top of the mountain that lies over against the Valley of Hinnom , on the west , at the northern end of the Valley ( P ) of Rephaim .

ESV	Joshua	15	12	And the west boundary was ( W ) the Great Sea with its coastline . This is the boundary around the people of Judah according to their clans .
ESV	Joshua	15	13	According to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua , he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the people of Judah , ( X ) Kiriath-arba , that is , ( Y ) Hebron ( Arba was the father of Anak ) .
ESV	Joshua	15	14	And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak , ( Z ) Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai , the descendants of Anak .
ESV	Joshua	15	16	And Caleb said , “ Whoever strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it , to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife. ”
ESV	Joshua	15	17	( AB ) And Othniel the son of Kenaz , ( AC ) the brother of Caleb , captured it . And he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife .
ESV	Joshua	15	18	When she came to him , she urged him to ask her father for a field . And she got off her donkey , and Caleb said to her , “ What do you want ? ”
ESV	Joshua	15	19	She said to him , “ Give me a blessing . Since you have given me the land of the Negeb , give me also springs of water. ” And he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .

ESV	Joshua	16	16	The allotment of the people of Joseph went from the Jordan by Jericho , east of the waters of Jericho , ( A ) into the wilderness , going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel .
ESV	Joshua	16	2	Then ( B ) going from Bethel to Luz , it passes along to Ataroth , the territory of the Archites .
ESV	Joshua	16	3	Then it goes down westward to the territory of the Japhletites , as far as the territory of Lower ( C ) Beth-horon , then to ( D ) Gezer , and it ends at the sea .
ESV	Joshua	16	4	( E ) The people of Joseph , Manasseh and Ephraim , received their inheritance .
ESV	Joshua	16	5	The territory of the people of Ephraim by their clans was as follows : the boundary of their inheritance on the east was ( F ) Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon ,
ESV	Joshua	16	6	and the boundary goes from there to the sea . On the north is ( G ) Michmethath . Then on the east the boundary turns around toward Taanath-shiloh and passes along beyond it on the east to Janoah ,
ESV	Joshua	16	7	then it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and ( H ) to Naarah , and touches Jericho , ending at the Jordan .
ESV	Joshua	16	8	From ( I ) Tappuah the boundary goes westward to the brook Kanah and ends at the sea . Such is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Ephraim by their clans ,
ESV	Joshua	16	9	together with ( J ) the towns that were set apart for the people of Ephraim within the inheritance of the Manassites , all those towns with their villages .
ESV	Joshua	16	10	However , ( K ) they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer , so the Canaanites have lived in the midst of Ephraim to this day but have been made ( L ) to do forced labor . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Joshua	17	17	Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph , to Ephraim and Manasseh , “ You are a numerous people and have great power . You shall not have one allotment only ,
ESV	Joshua	17	2	And allotments were made ( D ) to the rest of the people of Manasseh by their clans , Abiezer , Helek , Asriel , Shechem , Hepher , and Shemida . These were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph , by their clans .
ESV	Joshua	17	3	Now ( E ) Zelophehad the son of Hepher , son of Gilead , son of Machir , son of Manasseh , had no sons , but only daughters , and these are the names of his daughters : ( F ) Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
ESV	Joshua	17	4	They approached ( G ) Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the leaders and said , ( H ) “ The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance along with our brothers. ” So according to the mouth of the Lord he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father .
ESV	Joshua	17	5	Thus there fell to Manasseh ten portions , besides ( I ) the land of Gilead and Bashan , which is on the other side of the Jordan ,
ESV	Joshua	17	6	because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons . The land of Gilead was allotted to the rest of the people of Manasseh .
ESV	Joshua	17	7	The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to ( J ) Michmethath , which is east of Shechem . Then the boundary goes along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah .
ESV	Joshua	17	8	The land of ( K ) Tappuah belonged to Manasseh , but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to the people of Ephraim .
ESV	Joshua	17	9	( L ) Then the boundary went down to the brook Kanah . These cities , to the south of the brook , among the cities of Manasseh , belong to Ephraim . Then the boundary of Manasseh goes on the north side of the brook and ends at the sea ,
ESV	Joshua	17	10	the land to the south being Ephraim 's and that to the north being Manasseh 's , with the sea forming its boundary . On the north Asher is reached , and on the east Issachar .
ESV	Joshua	17	11	Also in Issachar and in Asher ( M ) Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages , and Ibleam and its villages , and the inhabitants of ( N ) Dor and its villages , and the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages , and the inhabitants of ( O ) Taanach and its villages , and the inhabitants of ( P ) Megiddo and its villages ; ( Q ) the third is Naphath . [ a ]
ESV	Joshua	17	12	( R ) Yet the people of Manasseh could not take possession of those cities , but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land .
ESV	Joshua	17	13	Now when the people of Israel grew strong , they put the Canaanites ( S ) to forced labor , but did not utterly drive them out .
ESV	Joshua	17	14	Then ( T ) the people of Joseph spoke to Joshua , saying , “ Why have you given me but ( U ) one lot and one portion as an inheritance , although I am ( V ) a numerous people , since all along the Lord has blessed me ? ”
ESV	Joshua	17	15	And Joshua said to them , “ If you are a numerous people , go up by yourselves to the forest , and there clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and ( W ) the Rephaim , since ( X ) the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you. ”
ESV	Joshua	17	16	The people of Joseph said , “ The hill country is not enough for us . Yet all the Canaanites who dwell in the plain have ( Y ) chariots of iron , both those in Beth-shean and its villages and those in ( Z ) the Valley of Jezreel. ”
ESV	Joshua	17	18	but the hill country shall be yours , for though it is a forest , you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders . For you shall drive out the Canaanites , ( AA ) though they have chariots of iron , and though they are strong. ” Footnotes - Joshua 17:11 The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Joshua	18	18	and passing on to the north of ( Y ) the shoulder of Beth-arabah [ b ] it goes down to ( Z ) the Arabah .
ESV	Joshua	18	2	There remained among the people of Israel seven tribes whose inheritance had not yet been apportioned .
ESV	Joshua	18	3	So Joshua said to the people of Israel , ( C ) “ How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land , which the Lord , the God of your fathers , has given you ?
ESV	Joshua	18	4	Provide three men from each tribe , and I will send them out that they may set out and go up and down the land . They shall write a description of it with a view to their inheritances , and then come to me .
ESV	Joshua	18	5	They shall divide it into seven portions . ( D ) Judah shall continue in his territory on the south , ( E ) and the house of Joseph shall continue in their territory on the north .
ESV	Joshua	18	6	And you shall describe the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me . ( F ) And I will cast lots for you here before the Lord our God .
ESV	Joshua	18	7	( G ) The Levites have no portion among you , for the priesthood of the Lord is their heritage . ( H ) And Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward , which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them. ”
ESV	Joshua	18	8	So the men arose and went , and Joshua charged those who went to write the description of the land , saying , “ Go up and down in the land and write a description and return to me . And I will cast lots for you here before the Lord in Shiloh. ”
ESV	Joshua	18	9	So the men went and passed up and down in the land and wrote in a book a description of it by towns in seven divisions . Then they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh ,
ESV	Joshua	18	10	and Joshua ( I ) cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord . And there Joshua apportioned the land to the people of Israel , ( J ) to each his portion . The Inheritance for Benjamin
ESV	Joshua	18	11	The lot of the tribe of the people of Benjamin according to its clans came up , and the territory allotted to it fell between the people of Judah and the people of Joseph .
ESV	Joshua	18	12	( K ) On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan . ( L ) Then the boundary goes up to the shoulder north of Jericho , then up through the hill country westward , and it ends at the wilderness of ( M ) Beth-aven .
ESV	Joshua	18	13	From there the boundary passes along southward in the direction of Luz , to the shoulder of ( N ) Luz ( that is , Bethel ) , then the boundary goes down to ( O ) Ataroth-addar , on the mountain that lies south of Lower ( P ) Beth-horon .
ESV	Joshua	18	14	Then the boundary goes in another direction , turning on the ( Q ) western side southward from the mountain that lies to the south , opposite Beth-horon , and it ends at Kiriath-baal ( ( R ) that is , Kiriath-jearim ) , a city belonging to the people of Judah . This forms the western side .
ESV	Joshua	18	15	And the southern side begins at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim . And the boundary goes from there to Ephron , [ a ] ( S ) to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah .
ESV	Joshua	18	16	Then the boundary goes down to the border of the mountain that overlooks ( T ) the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , which is at the north end of the Valley of ( U ) Rephaim . And it then goes down the ( V ) Valley of Hinnom , south of the shoulder of the Jebusites , and downward to ( W ) En-rogel .
ESV	Joshua	18	17	Then it bends in a northerly direction going on to En-shemesh , and from there goes to Geliloth , which is opposite the ascent of Adummim . Then it goes down to ( X ) the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
ESV	Joshua	18	19	Then the boundary passes on to the north of the shoulder of ( AA ) Beth-hoglah . And the boundary ends at the northern bay of ( AB ) the Salt Sea , at the south end of the Jordan : this is the southern border .

ESV	Joshua	20	20	Then the Lord said to Joshua ,
ESV	Joshua	20	2	“ Say to the people of Israel , ( A ) ‘ Appoint the cities of refuge , of which I spoke to you through Moses ,
ESV	Joshua	20	3	that the manslayer who strikes any person without intent or unknowingly may flee there . They shall be for you a refuge from the avenger of blood .
ESV	Joshua	20	4	He shall flee to one of these cities and shall stand ( B ) at the entrance of the gate of the city and explain his case to the elders of that city . Then they shall take him into the city and give him a place , and he shall remain with them .
ESV	Joshua	20	5	And if the avenger of blood pursues him , they shall not give up the manslayer into his hand , because he struck his neighbor unknowingly , and did not hate him in the past .
ESV	Joshua	20	6	And he shall remain in that city ( C ) until he has stood before the congregation for judgment , until the death of him who is high priest at the time . Then the manslayer may return to his own town and his own home , to the town from which he fled. ’ ”
ESV	Joshua	20	7	So they set apart ( D ) Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali , and ( E ) Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and ( F ) Kiriath-arba ( that is , Hebron ) ( G ) in the hill country of Judah .
ESV	Joshua	20	8	And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho , they appointed ( H ) Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland , from the tribe of Reuben , and ( I ) Ramoth in Gilead , from the tribe of Gad , and ( J ) Golan in Bashan , from the tribe of Manasseh .

ESV	Joshua	22	22	“ The Mighty One , ( W ) God , the Lord ! The Mighty One , God , the Lord ! ( X ) He knows ; and let Israel itself know ! If it was in rebellion or in breach of faith against the Lord , do not spare us today
ESV	Joshua	22	2	and said to them , “ You have kept ( A ) all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you ( B ) and have obeyed my voice in all that I have commanded you .
ESV	Joshua	22	3	You have not forsaken your brothers these many days , down to this day , but have been careful to keep the charge of the Lord your God .
ESV	Joshua	22	4	( C ) And now the Lord your God has given rest to your brothers , as he promised them . Therefore turn and go to your tents in the land where your possession lies , ( D ) which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the other side of the Jordan .
ESV	Joshua	22	5	( E ) Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , ( F ) to love the Lord your God , and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cling to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. ”
ESV	Joshua	22	6	So Joshua ( G ) blessed them and sent them away , and they went to their tents .
ESV	Joshua	22	7	Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan , ( H ) but to the other half Joshua had given a possession beside their brothers in the land west of the Jordan . And when Joshua sent them away to their homes and blessed them ,
ESV	Joshua	22	8	he said to them , “ Go back to your tents with much wealth and with very much livestock , with silver , gold , bronze , and iron , and with much clothing . ( I ) Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers. ”
ESV	Joshua	22	9	So the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home , parting from the people of Israel at Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan , to go ( J ) to the land of Gilead , their own land of which they had possessed themselves by command of the Lord through Moses . The Eastern Tribes ' Altar of Witness
ESV	Joshua	22	10	And when they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan , the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan , an altar of imposing size .
ESV	Joshua	22	11	And the people of Israel ( K ) heard it said , “ Behold , the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built the altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan , in the region about the Jordan , on the side that belongs to the people of Israel. ”
ESV	Joshua	22	12	And when the people of Israel heard of it , ( L ) the whole assembly of the people of Israel gathered at Shiloh to make war against them .
ESV	Joshua	22	13	Then the people of Israel sent to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh , in the land of Gilead , ( M ) Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
ESV	Joshua	22	14	and with him ten chiefs , one from each of the tribal families of Israel , ( N ) every one of them the head of a family among the clans of Israel .
ESV	Joshua	22	15	And they came to the people of Reuben , the people of Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh , in the land of Gilead , and they said to them ,
ESV	Joshua	22	16	“ Thus says the whole congregation of the Lord , ‘ What is this breach of faith that you have committed against the God of Israel in turning away this day from following the Lord by building yourselves an altar this day ( O ) in rebellion against the Lord ?
ESV	Joshua	22	17	Have we not had enough of ( P ) the sin at Peor from which even yet we have not cleansed ourselves , and for which there came a plague upon the congregation of the Lord ,
ESV	Joshua	22	18	that you too must turn away this day from following the Lord ? And if ( Q ) you too rebel against the Lord today then tomorrow ( R ) he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel .
ESV	Joshua	22	19	But now , if the land of your possession is unclean , pass over into the Lord 's land ( S ) where the Lord 's tabernacle stands , and take for yourselves a possession among us . ( T ) Only do not rebel against the Lord or make us as rebels by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the Lord our God .
ESV	Joshua	22	20	( U ) Did not Achan the son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the devoted things , and ( V ) wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel ? And he did not perish alone for his iniquity. ’ ”
ESV	Joshua	22	21	Then the people of Reuben , the people of Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel ,
ESV	Joshua	22	23	for building an altar to turn away from following the Lord . Or if we did so to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings on it , may the Lord himself ( Y ) take vengeance .
ESV	Joshua	22	24	No , but we did it from fear that ( Z ) in time to come your children might say to our children , ‘ What have you to do with the Lord , the God of Israel ?
ESV	Joshua	22	25	For the Lord has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you , you people of Reuben and people of Gad . You have no portion in the Lord. ’ So your children might make our children cease to worship the Lord .
ESV	Joshua	22	26	Therefore we said , ‘ Let us now build an altar , not for burnt offering , nor for sacrifice ,
ESV	Joshua	22	27	but to be ( AA ) a witness between us and you , and between our generations after us , that we ( AB ) do perform the service of the Lord in his presence with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings , so your children will not say to our children in time to come , “ You have no portion in the Lord. ” ’
ESV	Joshua	22	28	And we thought , ‘ If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come , we should say , “ Behold , the copy of the altar of the Lord , which our fathers made , not for burnt offerings , nor for sacrifice , but to be ( AC ) a witness between us and you. ” ’
ESV	Joshua	22	29	Far be it from us that we should ( AD ) rebel against the Lord and turn away this day from following the Lord ( AE ) by building an altar for burnt offering , grain offering , or sacrifice , other than the altar of the Lord our God that stands before his tabernacle ! ”
ESV	Joshua	22	30	When ( AF ) Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation , the heads of the families of Israel who were with him , heard the words that the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh spoke , ( AG ) it was good in their eyes .
ESV	Joshua	22	31	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh , “ Today we know that ( AH ) the Lord is in our midst , because you have not committed this breach of faith against the Lord . Now you have delivered the people of Israel from the hand of the Lord. ”
ESV	Joshua	22	32	Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the chiefs , returned from the people of Reuben and the people of Gad ( AI ) in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan , to the people of Israel , and brought back word to them .
ESV	Joshua	22	33	And the report ( AJ ) was good in the eyes of the people of Israel . And the people of Israel ( AK ) blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them to destroy the land where the people of Reuben and the people of Gad were settled .
ESV	Joshua	22	34	The people of Reuben and the people of Gad called the altar Witness , “ For , ” they said , ( AL ) “ it is a witness between us that the Lord is God. ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Joshua	23	13	know for certain that ( T ) the Lord your God will no longer drive out these nations before you , ( U ) but they shall be a snare and a trap for you , a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes , until you perish from off this good ground that the Lord your God has given you .
ESV	Joshua	23	14	“ And now ( V ) I am about to go the way of all the earth , and you know in your hearts and souls , all of you , that ( W ) not one word has failed of all the good things [ a ] that the Lord your God promised concerning you .

ESV	Joshua	24	3	( F ) Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River [ b ] and ( G ) led him through all the land of Canaan , and made his offspring many . ( H ) I gave him Isaac .
ESV	Joshua	24	4	And to Isaac I gave ( I ) Jacob and Esau . ( J ) And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess , ( K ) but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt .
ESV	Joshua	24	5	( L ) And I sent Moses and Aaron , ( M ) and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it , and ( N ) afterward I brought you out .
ESV	Joshua	24	6	“ ‘ Then ( O ) I brought your fathers out of Egypt , and ( P ) you came to the sea . ( Q ) And the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea .
ESV	Joshua	24	7	( R ) And when they cried to the Lord , ( S ) he put darkness between you and the Egyptians ( T ) and made the sea come upon them and cover them ; ( U ) and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt . ( V ) And you lived in the wilderness a long time .
ESV	Joshua	24	8	Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites , who lived on the other side of the Jordan . ( W ) They fought with you , and I gave them into your hand , and you took possession of their land , and I destroyed them before you .
ESV	Joshua	24	9	( X ) Then Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , arose and fought against Israel . ( Y ) And he sent and invited Balaam the son of Beor to curse you ,
ESV	Joshua	24	10	( Z ) but I would not listen to Balaam . ( AA ) Indeed , he blessed you . So I delivered you out of his hand .
ESV	Joshua	24	11	( AB ) And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho , ( AC ) and the leaders of Jericho fought against you , and also ( AD ) the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites . And I gave them into your hand .
ESV	Joshua	24	12	And I sent ( AE ) the hornet before you , which drove them out before you , the two kings of the Amorites ; it was ( AF ) not by your sword or by your bow .
ESV	Joshua	24	13	I gave you a land on which you had not labored ( AG ) and cities that you had not built , and you dwell in them . You eat the fruit of vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant. ’ Choose Whom You Will Serve

ESV	Joshua	24	16	Then the people answered , “ Far be it from us that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods ,
ESV	Joshua	24	17	for it is the Lord our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt , out of the house of slavery , and who did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way that we went , and among all the peoples through whom we passed .
ESV	Joshua	24	18	And the Lord drove out before us all the peoples , the Amorites who lived in the land . Therefore we also will serve the Lord , for he is our God. ”
ESV	Joshua	24	19	But Joshua said to the people , “ You are not able to serve the Lord , for he is ( AO ) a holy God . He is ( AP ) a jealous God ; ( AQ ) he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins .
ESV	Joshua	24	20	( AR ) If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods , then ( AS ) he will turn and do you harm and consume you , after having done you good. ”
ESV	Joshua	24	21	And the people said to Joshua , “ No , but we will serve the Lord. ”
ESV	Joshua	24	22	Then Joshua said to the people , “ You are witnesses against yourselves that ( AT ) you have chosen the Lord , to serve him. ” And they said , “ We are witnesses. ”
ESV	Joshua	24	23	He said , “ Then ( AU ) put away the foreign gods that are among you , and incline your heart to the Lord , the God of Israel. ”
ESV	Joshua	24	25	So Joshua ( AV ) made a covenant with the people that day , and put in place ( AW ) statutes and rules for them at Shechem .
ESV	Joshua	24	26	And Joshua ( AX ) wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God . And ( AY ) he took a large stone and set it up there ( AZ ) under the terebinth that was by the sanctuary of the Lord .
ESV	Joshua	24	27	And Joshua said to all the people , “ Behold , ( BA ) this stone shall be a witness against us , for ( BB ) it has heard all the words of the Lord that he spoke to us . Therefore it shall be a witness against you , lest you deal falsely with your God. ”
ESV	Joshua	24	28	So Joshua ( BC ) sent the people away , every man to his inheritance . Joshua 's Death and Burial
ESV	Joshua	24	29	( BD ) After these things Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being

ESV	Judges	1	1	After the death of Joshua , the people of Israel ( A ) inquired of the Lord , ( B ) “ Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites , to fight against them ? ”
ESV	Judges	1	2	The Lord said , “ Judah shall go up ; behold , I have given the land into his hand. ”
ESV	Judges	1	3	And Judah said to Simeon his brother , “ Come up with me into the territory allotted to me , that we may fight against the Canaanites . ( C ) And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you. ” So Simeon went with him .
ESV	Judges	1	4	Then Judah went up and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand , and they defeated 10,000 of them at Bezek .
ESV	Judges	1	5	They found Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
ESV	Judges	1	6	Adoni-bezek fled , but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes .
ESV	Judges	1	7	And Adoni-bezek said , “ Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off ( D ) used to pick up scraps under my table . ( E ) As I have done , so God has repaid me. ” And they brought him to Jerusalem , and he died there .
ESV	Judges	1	8	( F ) And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire .
ESV	Judges	1	9	And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in ( G ) the hill country , in the Negeb , and in ( H ) the lowland .
ESV	Judges	1	10	( I ) And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron ( J ) ( now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba ) , and they defeated ( K ) Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai .
ESV	Judges	1	11	From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir . The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher .
ESV	Judges	1	12	And Caleb said , “ He who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it , I will give him Achsah my daughter for a wife. ”
ESV	Judges	1	13	And Othniel the son of Kenaz , ( L ) Caleb 's younger brother , captured it . And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife .
ESV	Judges	1	14	When she came to him , she urged him to ask her father for a field . And she dismounted from her donkey , and Caleb said to her , “ What do you want ? ”
ESV	Judges	1	15	She said to him , “ Give me a blessing . Since you have set me in the land of the Negeb , give me also springs of water. ” And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
ESV	Judges	1	16	And the descendants of the ( M ) Kenite , Moses ' father-in-law , went up with the people of Judah ( N ) from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah , which lies in the Negeb near ( O ) Arad , ( P ) and they went and settled with the people .
ESV	Judges	1	17	( Q ) And Judah went with Simeon his brother , and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction . So the name of the city was called ( R ) Hormah . [ a ]
ESV	Judges	1	18	Judah also ( S ) captured Gaza with its territory , and Ashkelon with its territory , and Ekron with its territory .
ESV	Judges	1	19	( T ) And the Lord was with Judah , and he took possession of the ( U ) hill country , but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had ( V ) chariots of iron .
ESV	Judges	1	20	( W ) And Hebron was given to Caleb , as Moses had said . And he drove out from it ( X ) the three sons of Anak .
ESV	Judges	1	21	But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem , ( Y ) so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day .
ESV	Judges	1	22	The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel , ( Z ) and the Lord was with them .
ESV	Judges	1	23	And the house of Joseph scouted out Bethel . ( ( AA ) Now the name of the city was formerly Luz . )
ESV	Judges	1	24	And the spies saw a man coming out of the city , and they said to him , “ Please show us the way into the city , ( AB ) and we will deal kindly with you. ”
ESV	Judges	1	25	And he showed them the way into the city . And they struck the city with the edge of the sword , but they let the man and all his family go .
ESV	Judges	1	26	And the man went to ( AC ) the land of the Hittites and built a city and called its name Luz . That is its name to this day . Failure to Complete the Conquest
ESV	Judges	1	27	( AD ) Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages , or Taanach and its villages , or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages , or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages , or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages , for the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land .
ESV	Judges	1	28	When Israel grew strong , they put the Canaanites to forced labor , but did not drive them out completely .
ESV	Judges	1	29	( AE ) And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer , so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them .
ESV	Judges	1	30	Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , or the inhabitants of ( AF ) Nahalol , so the Canaanites lived among them , but became subject to forced labor .
ESV	Judges	1	31	( AG ) Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco , or the inhabitants of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob ,
ESV	Judges	1	32	so the Asherites lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land , for they did not drive them out .
ESV	Judges	1	33	Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of ( AH ) Beth-shemesh , or the inhabitants of Beth-anath , so they lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land . Nevertheless , the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them .
ESV	Judges	1	34	( AI ) The Amorites pressed the people of Dan back into the hill country , for they did not allow them to come down to the plain .
ESV	Judges	1	35	The Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres , ( AJ ) in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim , but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them , and they became subject to forced labor .

ESV	Judges	2	2	( C ) and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; ( D ) you shall break down their altars. ’ But you have not obeyed my voice . What is this you have done ?
ESV	Judges	2	3	So now I say , ( E ) I will not drive them out before you , but they shall become ( F ) thorns in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare to you. ”
ESV	Judges	2	4	As soon as the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the people of Israel , the people lifted up their voices and wept .
ESV	Judges	2	5	And they called the name of that place Bochim . [ a ] And they sacrificed there to the Lord . The Death of Joshua
ESV	Judges	2	6	When Joshua dismissed the people , the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land .
ESV	Judges	2	7	( G ) And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel .
ESV	Judges	2	8	And Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died at the age of
ESV	Judges	2	110	years .
ESV	Judges	2	9	And they buried him within the boundaries of ( H ) his inheritance in Timnath-heres , ( I ) in the hill country of Ephraim , north of the mountain of Gaash .
ESV	Judges	2	10	And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers . And there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel . Israel 's Unfaithfulness
ESV	Judges	2	11	( J ) And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals .
ESV	Judges	2	12	( K ) And they abandoned the Lord , the God of their fathers , who had brought them out of the land of Egypt . ( L ) They went after other gods , from among the gods of the peoples who were around them , and ( M ) bowed down to them . ( N ) And they provoked the Lord to anger .
ESV	Judges	2	13	They abandoned the Lord ( O ) and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth .
ESV	Judges	2	14	( P ) So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and he ( Q ) gave them over to plunderers , who plundered them . ( R ) And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies , ( S ) so that they could no longer withstand their enemies .
ESV	Judges	2	15	Whenever they marched out , the hand of the Lord was against them for harm , as the Lord had warned , ( T ) and as the Lord had sworn to them . And they were in terrible distress . The Lord Raises Up Judges
ESV	Judges	2	16	( U ) Then the Lord raised up judges , ( V ) who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them .
ESV	Judges	2	17	Yet they did not listen to their judges , for ( W ) they whored after other gods and bowed down to them . ( X ) They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked , who had obeyed the commandments of the Lord , and they did not do so .
ESV	Judges	2	18	Whenever the Lord raised up judges for them , ( Y ) the Lord was with the judge , and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge . ( Z ) For the Lord was moved to pity by ( AA ) their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them .
ESV	Judges	2	19	But ( AB ) whenever the judge died , they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers , going after other gods , serving them and bowing down to them . They did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways .
ESV	Judges	2	20	( AC ) So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and he said , “ Because this people ( AD ) have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice ,
ESV	Judges	2	21	( AE ) I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died ,
ESV	Judges	2	22	in order ( AF ) to test Israel by them , whether they will take care to walk in the way of the Lord as their fathers did , or not. ”

ESV	Judges	3	3	These are the nations : ( B ) the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon , from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath .
ESV	Judges	3	2	It was only in order that the generations of the people of Israel might know war , to teach war to those who had not known it before .
ESV	Judges	3	4	They were for ( C ) the testing of Israel , to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the Lord , which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses .
ESV	Judges	3	5	So the people of Israel lived ( D ) among the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
ESV	Judges	3	6	( E ) And their daughters they took to themselves for wives , and their own daughters they gave to their sons , and they served their gods . Othniel
ESV	Judges	3	7	( F ) And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . They forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and ( G ) the Asheroth .
ESV	Judges	3	8	Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , ( H ) and he sold them into the hand of ( I ) Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia . And the people of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years .
ESV	Judges	3	9	But when the people of Israel ( J ) cried out to the Lord , the Lord raised up a ( K ) deliverer for the people of Israel , who saved them , ( L ) Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
ESV	Judges	3	10	( M ) The Spirit of the Lord was upon him , and he judged Israel . He went out to war , and the Lord gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand . And his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim .
ESV	Judges	3	11	( N ) So the land had rest forty years . Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died . Ehud
ESV	Judges	3	12	( O ) And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , and the Lord strengthened Eglon ( P ) the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done what was evil in the sight of the Lord .
ESV	Judges	3	13	He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the ( Q ) Amalekites , and went and defeated Israel . And they took possession of ( R ) the city of palms .
ESV	Judges	3	14	And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years .
ESV	Judges	3	15	Then the people of Israel ( S ) cried out to the Lord , and the Lord raised up for them ( T ) a deliverer , Ehud , the son of Gera , the Benjaminite , ( U ) a left-handed man . The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab .
ESV	Judges	3	16	And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges , a cubit [ a ] in length , and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes .
ESV	Judges	3	17	And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab . Now Eglon was a very fat man .
ESV	Judges	3	18	inches or
ESV	Judges	3	19	But he himself turned back ( V ) at the idols near Gilgal and said , “ I have a secret message for you , O king. ” And he commanded , “ Silence. ” And all his attendants went out from his presence .
ESV	Judges	3	20	And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his ( W ) cool roof chamber . ( X ) And Ehud said , “ I have a message from God for you. ” And he arose from his seat .
ESV	Judges	3	21	And Ehud reached with his left hand , took the sword from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly .
ESV	Judges	3	22	And the hilt also went in after the blade , and the fat closed over the blade , for he did not pull the sword out of his belly ; and the dung came out .
ESV	Judges	3	23	Then Ehud went out into the porch [ b ] and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him ( Y ) and locked them .
ESV	Judges	3	24	When he had gone , the servants came , and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked , they thought , ( Z ) “ Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber. ”
ESV	Judges	3	25	And they waited till they were embarrassed . But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber , they took the key and opened them , and there lay their lord dead on the floor .
ESV	Judges	3	26	Ehud escaped while they delayed , and he passed beyond ( AA ) the idols and escaped to Seirah .
ESV	Judges	3	27	When he arrived , ( AB ) he sounded the trumpet in ( AC ) the hill country of Ephraim . Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he was their leader .
ESV	Judges	3	28	And he said to them , “ Follow after me , ( AD ) for the Lord has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand. ” So they went down after him and seized ( AE ) the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over .
ESV	Judges	3	29	And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites , all strong , able-bodied men ; not a man escaped .

ESV	Judges	4	4	Now Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lappidoth , was judging Israel at that time .
ESV	Judges	4	2	And the Lord ( B ) sold them into the hand of ( C ) Jabin king of Canaan , who reigned in ( D ) Hazor . The commander of his army was ( E ) Sisera , who lived in ( F ) Harosheth-hagoyim .
ESV	Judges	4	3	Then the people of Israel ( G ) cried out to the Lord for help , for he had ( H )
ESV	Judges	4	900	chariots of iron , and all the men who were with him , from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon .
ESV	Judges	4	5	She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in ( I ) the hill country of Ephraim , and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment .
ESV	Judges	4	6	She sent and summoned ( J ) Barak the son of Abinoam from ( K ) Kedesh-naphtali and said to him , “ Has not the Lord , the God of Israel , commanded you , ‘ Go , gather your men at Mount ( L ) Tabor , taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun .
ESV	Judges	4	7	And I will draw out Sisera , the general of Jabin 's army , to meet you by ( M ) the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops , ( N ) and I will give him into your hand ’ ? ”
ESV	Judges	4	8	Barak said to her , “ If you will go with me , I will go , but if you will not go with me , I will not go. ”
ESV	Judges	4	9	And she said , “ I will surely go with you . Nevertheless , the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory , for the Lord will ( O ) sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. ” Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh .
ESV	Judges	4	10	And Barak called out ( P ) Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh . And 10,000 men went up at his heels , and Deborah went up with him .
ESV	Judges	4	11	Now Heber ( Q ) the Kenite had separated from the Kenites , the descendants of ( R ) Hobab the father-in-law of Moses , and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in ( S ) Zaanannim , which is near Kedesh .
ESV	Judges	4	12	When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor ,
ESV	Judges	4	13	Sisera called out all his chariots , ( T )
ESV	Judges	4	14	And Deborah said to Barak , “ Up ! For this is the day in which ( U ) the Lord has given Sisera into your hand . ( V ) Does not the Lord go out before you ? ” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him .
ESV	Judges	4	15	( W ) And the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword . And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot .
ESV	Judges	4	16	And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim , and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword ; not a man was left .
ESV	Judges	4	17	But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael , the wife of Heber the Kenite , for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
ESV	Judges	4	18	And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him , “ Turn aside , my lord ; turn aside to me ; do not be afraid. ” So he turned aside to her into the tent , and she covered him with a rug .
ESV	Judges	4	19	And he said to her , “ Please give me a little water to drink , for I am thirsty. ” So she opened ( X ) a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him .
ESV	Judges	4	20	And he said to her , “ Stand at the opening of the tent , and if any man comes and asks you , ‘ Is anyone here ? ’ say , ‘ No. ’ ”
ESV	Judges	4	21	But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg , and took a hammer in her hand . Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness . So he died .
ESV	Judges	4	22	And behold , as Barak was pursuing Sisera , Jael went out to meet him and said to him , “ Come , and I will show you the man whom you are seeking. ” So he went in to her tent , and there lay Sisera dead , with the tent peg in his temple .
ESV	Judges	4	23	( Y ) So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel .

ESV	Judges	6	6	And Israel was brought very low because of Midian . And the people of Israel ( H ) cried out for help to the Lord .
ESV	Judges	6	2	And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel , and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and ( C ) the caves and the strongholds .
ESV	Judges	6	3	For whenever the Israelites planted crops , the Midianites and ( D ) the Amalekites and ( E ) the people of the East would come up against them .
ESV	Judges	6	4	They would encamp against them ( F ) and devour the produce of the land , as far as Gaza , and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey .
ESV	Judges	6	5	For they would come up with their livestock and their tents ; they would come ( G ) like locusts in number—both they and their camels could not be counted—so that they laid waste the land as they came in .
ESV	Judges	6	7	When the people of Israel cried out to the Lord on account of the Midianites ,
ESV	Judges	6	8	the Lord sent a prophet to the people of Israel . And he said to them , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : ( I ) I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery .
ESV	Judges	6	9	And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you , and ( J ) drove them out before you and gave you their land .
ESV	Judges	6	10	And I said to you , ‘ I am the Lord your God ; ( K ) you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. ’ But you have not obeyed my voice. ” The Call of Gideon
ESV	Judges	6	11	Now the angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah , which belonged to Joash ( L ) the Abiezrite , while his son ( M ) Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites .
ESV	Judges	6	12	And ( N ) the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him , ( O ) “ The Lord is with you , O mighty man of valor. ”
ESV	Judges	6	13	And Gideon said to him , “ Please , my lord , if the Lord is with us , why then has all this happened to us ? And where are ( P ) all his wonderful deeds ( Q ) that our fathers recounted to us , saying , ‘ Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt ? ’ But now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian. ”
ESV	Judges	6	14	And the Lord [ a ] turned to him and said , “ Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian ; ( R ) do not I send you ? ”
ESV	Judges	6	15	And he said to him , ( S ) “ Please , Lord , how can I save Israel ? Behold , ( T ) my clan is the weakest in Manasseh , and I am the least in my father 's house. ”
ESV	Judges	6	16	- Judges 6:19 An ephah was about 3/5 bushel or
ESV	Judges	6	17	And he said to him , ( V ) “ If now I have found favor in your eyes , then ( W ) show me a sign that it is you who speak with me .
ESV	Judges	6	18	Please ( X ) do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you. ” And he said , “ I will stay till you return. ”
ESV	Judges	6	19	So Gideon went into his house ( Y ) and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah [ b ] of flour . The meat he put in a basket , and the broth he put in a pot , and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them .
ESV	Judges	6	20	And the angel of God said to him , “ Take the meat and the unleavened cakes , and put them ( Z ) on this rock , and ( AA ) pour the broth over them. ” And he did so .
ESV	Judges	6	21	Then the angel of the Lord reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes . ( AB ) And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes . And the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight .

ESV	Judges	6	23	But the Lord said to him , ( AD ) “ Peace be to you . Do not fear ; you shall not die. ”
ESV	Judges	6	24	Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it , ( AE ) The Lord Is Peace . To this day it still stands at ( AF ) Ophrah , which belongs to the Abiezrites .
ESV	Judges	6	25	That night the Lord said to him , “ Take your father 's bull , and the second bull seven years old , and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has , and cut down ( AG ) the Asherah that is beside it
ESV	Judges	6	26	and build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of the ( AH ) stronghold here , with stones laid in due order . Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down. ”
ESV	Judges	6	27	So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the Lord had told him . But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day , he did it by night . Gideon Destroys the Altar of Baal
ESV	Judges	6	28	When the men of the town rose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was broken down , and the Asherah beside it was cut down , and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built .
ESV	Judges	6	29	And they said to one another , “ Who has done this thing ? ” And after they had searched and inquired , they said , “ Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing. ”
ESV	Judges	6	30	Then the men of the town said to Joash , “ Bring out your son , that he may die , for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it. ”
ESV	Judges	6	31	But Joash said to all who stood against him , “ Will you contend for Baal ? Or will you save him ? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning . If he is a god , let him contend for himself , because his altar has been broken down. ”
ESV	Judges	6	32	Therefore on that day Gideon [ c ] was called ( AI ) Jerubbaal , that is to say , “ Let Baal contend against him , ” because he broke down his altar .
ESV	Judges	6	33	Now ( AJ ) all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together , and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in ( AK ) the Valley of Jezreel .
ESV	Judges	6	34	But ( AL ) the Spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon , ( AM ) and he sounded the trumpet , and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him .
ESV	Judges	6	35	( AN ) And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh , and they too were called out to follow him . ( AO ) And he sent messengers to Asher , Zebulun , and Naphtali , and they went up to meet them . The Sign of the Fleece
ESV	Judges	6	36	( AP ) Then Gideon said to God , “ If you will save Israel by my hand , as you have said ,
ESV	Judges	6	37	behold , I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor . If there is dew on the fleece alone , and it is dry on all the ground , then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have said. ”
ESV	Judges	6	38	And it was so . When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece , he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water .
ESV	Judges	6	39	Then Gideon said to God , ( AQ ) “ Let not your anger burn against me ; let me speak just once more . Please let me test just once more with the fleece . Please let it be dry on the fleece only , and on all the ground let there be dew. ”
ESV	Judges	6	40	And God did so that night ; and it was dry on the fleece only , and on all the ground there was dew . Footnotes - Judges 6:14 Septuagint the angel of the Lord ; also verse

ESV	Judges	7	7	And the Lord said to Gideon , ( F ) “ With the
ESV	Judges	7	2	The Lord said to Gideon , “ The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand , ( D ) lest Israel boast over me , saying , ‘ My own hand has saved me. ’
ESV	Judges	7	3	Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , ( E ) ‘ Whoever is fearful and trembling , let him return home and hurry away from Mount Gilead. ’ ” Then 22,000 of the people returned , and 10,000 remained .
ESV	Judges	7	4	And the Lord said to Gideon , “ The people are still too many . Take them down to the water , and I will test them for you there , and anyone of whom I say to you , ‘ This one shall go with you , ’ shall go with you , and anyone of whom I say to you , ‘ This one shall not go with you , ’ shall not go. ”
ESV	Judges	7	5	So he brought the people down to the water . And the Lord said to Gideon , “ Every one who laps the water with his tongue , as a dog laps , you shall set by himself . Likewise , every one who kneels down to drink. ”
ESV	Judges	7	6	And the number of those who lapped , putting their hands to their mouths , was
ESV	Judges	7	300	trumpets , ( S ) the Lord set ( T ) every man 's sword against his comrade and against all the army . And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah , [ a ] as far as the border of Abel-meholah , by Tabbath .
ESV	Judges	7	8	So the people took provisions in their hands , and their trumpets . And he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent , but retained the
ESV	Judges	7	9	That same ( H ) night the Lord said to him , “ Arise , go down against the camp , ( I ) for I have given it into your hand .
ESV	Judges	7	10	But if you are afraid to go down , go down to the camp with Purah your servant .
ESV	Judges	7	11	( J ) And you shall hear what they say , and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp. ” ( K ) Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men who were in the camp .
ESV	Judges	7	12	And the Midianites and the Amalekites and ( L ) all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts in abundance , and their camels were without number , ( M ) as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance .
ESV	Judges	7	13	When Gideon came , behold , a man was telling a dream to his comrade . And he said , “ Behold , I dreamed a dream , and behold , a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down , so that the tent lay flat. ”
ESV	Judges	7	14	And his comrade answered , “ This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash , a man of Israel ; God has given into his hand Midian and all the camp. ”
ESV	Judges	7	15	As soon as Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation , he worshiped . And he returned to the camp of Israel and said , “ Arise , for the Lord has given the host of Midian into your hand. ”
ESV	Judges	7	16	And he divided the
ESV	Judges	7	17	And he said to them , “ Look at me , and do likewise . When I come to the outskirts of the camp , do as I do .
ESV	Judges	7	18	When I blow the trumpet , I and all who are with me , then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout , ( O ) ‘ For the Lord and for Gideon. ’ ” Gideon Defeats Midian
ESV	Judges	7	19	So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch , when they had just set the watch . And they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands .
ESV	Judges	7	20	Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars . They held in their left hands the torches , and in their right hands the trumpets to blow . ( P ) And they cried out , “ A sword for the Lord and for Gideon ! ”
ESV	Judges	7	21	Every man stood in his place around the camp , ( Q ) and all the army ran . They cried out and fled .
ESV	Judges	7	22	( R ) When they blew the
ESV	Judges	7	23	And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh , and they pursued after Midian .
ESV	Judges	7	24	( U ) Gideon sent messengers throughout ( V ) all the hill country of Ephraim , saying , “ Come down against the Midianites and capture the waters against them , as far as ( W ) Beth-barah , and also the Jordan. ” So all the men of Ephraim were called out , and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah , and also the Jordan .
ESV	Judges	7	25	And they captured ( X ) the two princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb . They killed Oreb ( Y ) at the rock of Oreb , and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb . Then they pursued Midian , and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon ( Z ) across the Jordan .

ESV	Judges	8	8	And from there he went up to ( J ) Penuel , and spoke to them in the same way , and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered .
ESV	Judges	8	2	And he said to them , “ What have I done now in comparison with you ? Is not ( B ) the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer ?
ESV	Judges	8	3	( C ) God has given into your hands the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb . What have I been able to do in comparison with you ? ” ( D ) Then their anger [ a ] against him subsided when he said this .
ESV	Judges	8	4	And Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over , he and ( E ) the
ESV	Judges	8	300	men who were with him , exhausted yet pursuing .
ESV	Judges	8	5	So he said to the men of ( F ) Succoth , “ Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me , for they are exhausted , and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian. ”
ESV	Judges	8	6	And the officials of Succoth said , ( G ) “ Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand , ( H ) that we should give bread to your army ? ”
ESV	Judges	8	7	So Gideon said , “ Well then , when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand , ( I ) I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. ”
ESV	Judges	8	9	And he said to the men of Penuel , ( K ) “ When I come again in peace , ( L ) I will break down this tower. ”
ESV	Judges	8	10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army , about 15,000 men , all who were left of all the army of ( M ) the people of the East , for there had fallen 120,000 men ( N ) who drew the sword .

ESV	Judges	8	14	And he captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him . And he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth , seventy-seven men .
ESV	Judges	8	15	And he came to the men of Succoth and said , “ Behold Zebah and Zalmunna , about whom you taunted me , saying , ( R ) ‘ Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand , that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted ? ’ ”
ESV	Judges	8	16	And he took the elders of the city , and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth a lesson .
ESV	Judges	8	17	( S ) And he broke down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city .
ESV	Judges	8	18	Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna , “ Where are the men whom you killed at ( T ) Tabor ? ” They answered , “ As you are , so were they . Every one of them resembled the son of a king. ”
ESV	Judges	8	19	And he said , “ They were my brothers , the sons of my mother . ( U ) As the Lord lives , if you had saved them alive , I would not kill you. ”
ESV	Judges	8	20	So he said to Jether his firstborn , “ Rise and kill them ! ” But the young man did not draw his sword , for he was afraid , because he was still a young man .
ESV	Judges	8	21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said , “ Rise yourself and fall upon us , for as the man is , so is his strength. ” And Gideon arose and ( V ) killed Zebah and Zalmunna , and he took ( W ) the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels . Gideon 's Ephod
ESV	Judges	8	22	Then the men of Israel said to Gideon , “ Rule over us , you and your son and your grandson also , for you have saved us from the hand of Midian. ”
ESV	Judges	8	23	Gideon said to them , “ I will not rule over you , and my son will not rule over you ; ( X ) the Lord will rule over you. ”
ESV	Judges	8	24	And Gideon said to them , “ Let me make a request of you : every one of you give me the earrings from his spoil. ” ( For they had golden earrings , ( Y ) because they were Ishmaelites . )
ESV	Judges	8	25	And they answered , “ We will willingly give them. ” And they spread a cloak , and every man threw in it the earrings of his spoil .
ESV	Judges	8	26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels [ b ] of gold , besides ( Z ) the crescent ornaments and ( AA ) the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian , and besides the collars that were around the necks of their camels .

ESV	Judges	9	3	And his mother 's relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem , and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech , for they said , ( E ) “ He is our brother. ”
ESV	Judges	9	4	And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of ( F ) Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired ( G ) worthless and reckless fellows , who followed him .
ESV	Judges	9	5	And he went to his father 's house at ( H ) Ophrah ( I ) and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal , seventy men , on one stone . But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left , for he hid himself .
ESV	Judges	9	6	And all the leaders of Shechem came together , and all ( J ) Beth-millo , and they went and made Abimelech king , by the oak of the pillar at Shechem .
ESV	Judges	9	7	When it was told to Jotham , he went and stood on top of ( K ) Mount Gerizim and cried aloud and said to them , “ Listen to me , you leaders of Shechem , that God may listen to you .
ESV	Judges	9	8	( L ) The trees once went out to anoint a king over them , and they said to the olive tree , ( M ) ‘ Reign over us. ’

ESV	Judges	9	11	But the fig tree said to them , ‘ Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit and go hold sway over the trees ? ’
ESV	Judges	9	12	And the trees said to the vine , ‘ You come and reign over us. ’
ESV	Judges	9	13	But the vine said to them , ‘ Shall I leave my wine that ( N ) cheers God and men and go hold sway over the trees ? ’
ESV	Judges	9	14	Then all the trees said to the bramble , ‘ You come and reign over us. ’
ESV	Judges	9	15	And the bramble said to the trees , ‘ If in good faith you are anointing me king over you , then come and ( O ) take refuge in my shade , but if not , ( P ) let fire come out of the bramble and devour ( Q ) the cedars of Lebanon. ’
ESV	Judges	9	16	“ Now therefore , if you acted in good faith and integrity when you made Abimelech king , and if you have dealt well with ( R ) Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him ( S ) as his deeds deserved—
ESV	Judges	9	17	for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian ,
ESV	Judges	9	18	and you have risen up against my father 's house this day ( T ) and have killed his sons , seventy men on one stone , and have made ( U ) Abimelech , the son of his female servant , king over the leaders of Shechem , ( V ) because he is your relative—
ESV	Judges	9	19	if you then have acted in good faith and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then ( W ) rejoice in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you .
ESV	Judges	9	20	But if not , ( X ) let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo ; and let fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and from Beth-millo and devour Abimelech. ”
ESV	Judges	9	21	And Jotham ran away and fled and went to ( Y ) Beer and lived there , because of Abimelech his brother . The Downfall of Abimelech
ESV	Judges	9	22	Abimelech ruled over Israel three years .
ESV	Judges	9	23	( Z ) And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem , and the leaders of Shechem ( AA ) dealt treacherously with Abimelech ,
ESV	Judges	9	24	( AB ) that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come , and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother , who killed them , and on the men of Shechem , who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers .
ESV	Judges	9	25	And the leaders of Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops , and they robbed all who passed by them along that way . And it was told to Abimelech .
ESV	Judges	9	26	And Gaal the son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his relatives , and the leaders of Shechem put confidence in him .
ESV	Judges	9	27	And they went out into the field and gathered the grapes from their vineyards and trod them and held a festival ; and they went into ( AC ) the house of their god and ate and drank and reviled Abimelech .
ESV	Judges	9	28	And Gaal the son of Ebed said , ( AD ) “ Who is Abimelech , and who are we of Shechem , that we should serve him ? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal , and is not Zebul his officer ? Serve the men of ( AE ) Hamor the father of Shechem ; but why should we serve him ?
ESV	Judges	9	29	Would that this people were under my hand ! Then I would remove Abimelech . I would say [ a ] to Abimelech , ‘ Increase your army , and come out. ’ ”
ESV	Judges	9	30	When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , his anger was kindled .
ESV	Judges	9	31	And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly , [ b ] saying , “ Behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem , and they are stirring up [ c ] the city against you .
ESV	Judges	9	32	Now therefore , go by night , you and the people who are with you , and set an ambush in the field .
ESV	Judges	9	33	Then in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , rise early and rush upon the city . And when he and the people who are with him come out against you , you may do to them ( AF ) as your hand finds to do. ”
ESV	Judges	9	34	So Abimelech and all the men who were with him rose up by night and set an ambush against Shechem in four companies .
ESV	Judges	9	35	And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city , and Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from the ambush .
ESV	Judges	9	36	And when Gaal saw the people , he said to Zebul , “ Look , people are coming down from ( AG ) the mountaintops ! ” And Zebul said to him , “ You mistake [ d ] the shadow of the mountains for men. ”
ESV	Judges	9	37	Gaal spoke again and said , “ Look , people are coming down from the center of the land , and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners ' Oak. ”
ESV	Judges	9	38	Then Zebul said to him , “ Where is your mouth now , you who said , ( AH ) ‘ Who is Abimelech , that we should serve him ? ’ Are not these the people whom you despised ? Go out now and fight with them. ”
ESV	Judges	9	39	And Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech .
ESV	Judges	9	40	And Abimelech chased him , and he fled before him . And many fell wounded , up to the entrance of the gate .
ESV	Judges	9	41	And Abimelech lived at Arumah , and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives , so that they could not dwell at Shechem .
ESV	Judges	9	42	On the following day , the people went out into the field , and Abimelech was told .
ESV	Judges	9	43	He took his people and divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields . And he looked and saw the people coming out of the city . So he rose against them and killed them .
ESV	Judges	9	44	Abimelech and the company that was with him ( AI ) rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city , while the two companies rushed upon all who were in the field and killed them .
ESV	Judges	9	45	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day . He captured the city and killed the people who were in it , and ( AJ ) he razed the city and ( AK ) sowed it with salt .
ESV	Judges	9	46	When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard of it , they entered ( AL ) the stronghold of the house of ( AM ) El-berith .
ESV	Judges	9	47	Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together .
ESV	Judges	9	48	And Abimelech went up to Mount ( AN ) Zalmon , he and all the people who were with him . And Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bundle of brushwood and took it up and laid it on his shoulder . And he said to the men who were with him , “ What you have seen me do , hurry and do as I have done. ”
ESV	Judges	9	49	So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following Abimelech put it against ( AO ) the stronghold , and they set the stronghold on fire over them , so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died , about 1,000 men and women .
ESV	Judges	9	50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez and captured it .
ESV	Judges	9	51	But there was a strong tower within the city , and all the men and women and all the leaders of the city fled to it and shut themselves in , and they went up to the roof of the tower .
ESV	Judges	9	52	And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
ESV	Judges	9	53	( AP ) And a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech 's head and crushed his skull .
ESV	Judges	9	54	( AQ ) Then he called quickly to the young man his armor-bearer and said to him , “ Draw your sword and kill me , lest they say of me , ‘ A woman killed him. ’ ” And his young man thrust him through , and he died .
ESV	Judges	9	55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , everyone departed to his home .
ESV	Judges	9	56	( AR ) Thus God returned the evil of Abimelech , which he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers .
ESV	Judges	9	57	And God also made all the evil of the men of Shechem return on their heads , and upon them came ( AS ) the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .

ESV	Judges	10	10	And the people of Israel ( J ) cried out to the Lord , saying , “ We have sinned against you , because ( K ) we have forsaken our God and have served the Baals. ”
ESV	Judges	10	2	And he judged Israel twenty-three years . Then he died and was buried at Shamir .
ESV	Judges	10	3	After him arose Jair the Gileadite , who judged Israel twenty-two years .
ESV	Judges	10	4	And he had thirty sons who ( C ) rode on thirty donkeys , and they had thirty cities , called Havvoth-jair to this day , ( D ) which are in the land of Gilead .
ESV	Judges	10	5	And Jair died and was buried in Kamon . Further Disobedience and Oppression
ESV	Judges	10	6	( E ) The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord ( F ) and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth , the gods of Syria , ( G ) the gods of Sidon , the gods of Moab , the gods of the Ammonites , and the gods of the Philistines . And they ( H ) forsook the Lord and did not serve him .
ESV	Judges	10	7	So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and ( I ) he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites ,
ESV	Judges	10	8	and they crushed and oppressed the people of Israel that year . For eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites , which is in Gilead .
ESV	Judges	10	9	And the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim , so that Israel was severely distressed .
ESV	Judges	10	11	And the Lord said to the people of Israel , “ Did I not save you ( L ) from the Egyptians and ( M ) from the Amorites , ( N ) from the Ammonites and ( O ) from the Philistines ?
ESV	Judges	10	12	The Sidonians also , and ( P ) the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you , and you cried out to me , and I ( Q ) saved you out of their hand .
ESV	Judges	10	13	Yet you have ( R ) forsaken me and served other gods ; therefore I will save you no more .
ESV	Judges	10	14	Go and cry out ( S ) to the gods whom you have chosen ; let them save you in the time of your distress. ”
ESV	Judges	10	15	And the people of Israel said to the Lord , “ We have sinned ; do to us whatever seems good to you . Only please deliver us this day. ”
ESV	Judges	10	16	So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the Lord , and ( T ) he became impatient over the misery of Israel .
ESV	Judges	10	17	Then the Ammonites were called to arms , and they encamped in Gilead . And the people of Israel came together , and they encamped at ( U ) Mizpah .
ESV	Judges	10	18	And the people , the leaders of Gilead , said one to another , “ Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites ? ( V ) He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Judges	11	11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people ( H ) made him head and leader over them . And Jephthah spoke all his words ( I ) before the Lord at ( J ) Mizpah .
ESV	Judges	11	2	And Gilead 's wife also bore him sons . And when his wife 's sons grew up , they drove Jephthah out and said to him , “ You shall not have an inheritance in our father 's house , for you are the son of another woman. ”
ESV	Judges	11	3	Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of ( C ) Tob , and ( D ) worthless fellows collected around Jephthah and went out with him .
ESV	Judges	11	4	After a time the Ammonites made war against Israel .
ESV	Judges	11	5	And when the Ammonites made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of ( E ) Tob .
ESV	Judges	11	6	And they said to Jephthah , “ Come and be our leader , that we may fight against the Ammonites. ”
ESV	Judges	11	7	But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , “ Did you not hate me and drive me out of my father 's house ? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress ? ”
ESV	Judges	11	8	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , “ That is why we have turned to you now , that you may go with us and fight against the Ammonites and ( F ) be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. ”
ESV	Judges	11	9	Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , “ If you bring me home again to fight against the Ammonites , and the Lord gives them over to me , I will be your head. ”
ESV	Judges	11	10	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , ( G ) “ The Lord will be witness between us , if we do not do as you say. ”
ESV	Judges	11	12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites and said , “ What do you have against me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? ”
ESV	Judges	11	13	And the king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah , ( K ) “ Because Israel on coming up from Egypt took away my land , from the ( L ) Arnon to the ( M ) Jabbok and to the Jordan ; now therefore restore it peaceably. ”
ESV	Judges	11	14	Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites
ESV	Judges	11	15	and said to him , “ Thus says Jephthah : ( N ) Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites ,
ESV	Judges	11	16	but when they came up from Egypt , Israel went through the wilderness ( O ) to the Red Sea and ( P ) came to Kadesh .
ESV	Judges	11	17	( Q ) Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom , saying , ‘ Please let us pass through your land , ’ ( R ) but the king of Edom would not listen . And they sent also to the king of Moab , but he would not consent . So Israel ( S ) remained at Kadesh .
ESV	Judges	11	18	“ Then they journeyed through the wilderness and ( T ) went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab and ( U ) arrived on the east side of the land of Moab and ( V ) camped on the other side of the Arnon . But they did not enter the territory of Moab , for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab .
ESV	Judges	11	19	( W ) Israel then sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , king of Heshbon , and Israel said to him , ‘ Please let us pass through your land to our country , ’
ESV	Judges	11	20	but Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory , so Sihon gathered all his people together and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel .
ESV	Judges	11	21	And the Lord , the God of Israel , gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they defeated them . So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites , who inhabited that country .
ESV	Judges	11	22	And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan .
ESV	Judges	11	23	So then the Lord , the God of Israel , dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel ; and are you to take possession of them ?
ESV	Judges	11	24	Will you not possess what ( X ) Chemosh your god gives you to possess ? ( Y ) And all that the Lord our God has dispossessed before us , we will possess .
ESV	Judges	11	25	Now are you any better than ( Z ) Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? Did he ever contend against Israel , or did he ever go to war with them ?
ESV	Judges	11	26	While Israel lived ( AA ) in Heshbon and its villages , and ( AB ) in Aroer and its villages , and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon ,
ESV	Judges	11	300	years , why did you not deliver them within that time ?
ESV	Judges	11	27	I therefore have not sinned against you , and you do me wrong by making war on me . ( AC ) The Lord , the Judge , decide this day between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon. ”
ESV	Judges	11	28	But the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the words of Jephthah that he sent to him . Jephthah 's Tragic Vow
ESV	Judges	11	29	( AD ) Then the Spirit of the Lord was upon Jephthah , and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and passed on to Mizpah of Gilead , and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites .
ESV	Judges	11	30	And Jephthah ( AE ) made a vow to the Lord and said , “ If you will give the Ammonites into my hand ,
ESV	Judges	11	31	then whatever [ a ] comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites ( AF ) shall be the Lord 's , and ( AG ) I will offer it [ b ] up for a burnt offering. ”
ESV	Judges	11	32	So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them , and the Lord gave them into his hand .
ESV	Judges	11	33	And he struck them from Aroer to the neighborhood of ( AH ) Minnith , twenty cities , and as far as Abel-keramim , with a great blow . So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel .
ESV	Judges	11	34	Then Jephthah came to his home at ( AI ) Mizpah . And behold , his daughter came out to meet him ( AJ ) with tambourines and with dances . She was his only child ; besides her he had neither son nor daughter .
ESV	Judges	11	35	And as soon as he saw her , he tore his clothes and said , “ Alas , my daughter ! You have brought me very low , and you have become the cause of great trouble to me . For I have opened my mouth to the Lord , ( AK ) and I can not take back my vow. ”
ESV	Judges	11	36	And she said to him , “ My father , you have opened your mouth to the Lord ; do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth , now that the Lord has avenged you on your enemies , on the Ammonites. ”
ESV	Judges	11	37	So she said to her father , “ Let this thing be done for me : leave me alone two months , that I may go up and down on the mountains and weep for my virginity , I and my companions. ”
ESV	Judges	11	38	So he said , “ Go. ” Then he sent her away for two months , and she departed , she and her companions , and wept for her virginity on the mountains .
ESV	Judges	11	39	And at the end of two months , she returned to her father , ( AL ) who did with her according to his vow that he had made . She had never known a man , and it became a custom in Israel

ESV	Judges	12	12	Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun .
ESV	Judges	12	2	And Jephthah said to them , “ I and my people had a great dispute with the Ammonites , and when I called you , you did not save me from their hand .
ESV	Judges	12	3	And when I saw that you would not save me , ( B ) I took my life in my hand and crossed over against the Ammonites , and the Lord gave them into my hand . Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me ? ”
ESV	Judges	12	4	Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim . And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim , because they said , ( C ) “ You are fugitives of Ephraim , you Gileadites , in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh. ”
ESV	Judges	12	5	And the Gileadites captured ( D ) the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites . And when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said , “ Let me go over , ” the men of Gilead said to him , “ Are you an Ephraimite ? ” When he said , “ No , ”
ESV	Judges	12	6	they said to him , “ Then say Shibboleth , ” and he said , “ Sibboleth , ” for he could not pronounce it right . Then they seized him and slaughtered him at ( E ) the fords of the Jordan . At that time 42,000 of the Ephraimites fell .
ESV	Judges	12	7	Jephthah judged Israel six years . Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in his city in Gilead . [ a ] Ibzan , Elon , and Abdon

ESV	Judges	13	13	And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah , “ Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful .
ESV	Judges	13	2	There was a certain man of ( C ) Zorah , of the tribe of the Danites , whose name was Manoah . ( D ) And his wife was barren and had no children .
ESV	Judges	13	3	( E ) And the angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her , “ Behold , you are barren and have not borne children , but you shall conceive and bear a son .
ESV	Judges	13	4	Therefore be careful ( F ) and drink no wine or strong drink , and eat nothing unclean ,
ESV	Judges	13	5	for behold , you shall conceive and bear a son . ( G ) No razor shall come upon his head , for the child shall be ( H ) a Nazirite to God from the womb , and he shall ( I ) begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines. ”
ESV	Judges	13	6	Then the woman came and told her husband , ( J ) “ A man of God came to me , and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God , very awesome . ( K ) I did not ask him where he was from , and he did not tell me his name ,
ESV	Judges	13	7	but he said to me , ( L ) ‘ Behold , you shall conceive and bear a son . So then drink no wine or strong drink , and eat nothing unclean , for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death. ’ ”
ESV	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah prayed to the Lord and said , “ O Lord , please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us and teach us what we are to do with the child who will be born. ”
ESV	Judges	13	9	And God listened to the voice of Manoah , and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field . But Manoah her husband was not with her .
ESV	Judges	13	10	So the woman ran quickly and told her husband , “ Behold , the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me. ”
ESV	Judges	13	11	And Manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said to him , “ Are you the man who spoke to this woman ? ” And he said , “ I am. ”
ESV	Judges	13	12	And Manoah said , “ Now when your words come true , ( M ) what is to be the child 's manner of life , and what is his mission ? ”
ESV	Judges	13	14	She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine , ( N ) neither let her drink wine or strong drink , or eat any unclean thing . All that I commanded her let her observe. ”
ESV	Judges	13	15	Manoah said to the angel of the Lord , “ Please let us detain you and ( O ) prepare a young goat for you. ”
ESV	Judges	13	16	And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah , “ If you detain me , I will not eat of your food . But if you prepare a burnt offering , then offer it to the Lord. ” ( For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the Lord . )
ESV	Judges	13	17	And Manoah said to the angel of the Lord , ( P ) “ What is your name , so that , when your words come true , we may honor you ? ”
ESV	Judges	13	18	And the angel of the Lord said to him , ( Q ) “ Why do you ask my name , seeing ( R ) it is wonderful ? ”
ESV	Judges	13	19	So ( S ) Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering , and offered it on the rock to the Lord , to the one who works [ a ] wonders , and Manoah and his wife were watching .
ESV	Judges	13	20	And when the flame went up toward heaven from the altar , the angel of the Lord went up in the flame of the altar . Now Manoah and his wife were watching , ( T ) and they fell on their faces to the ground .
ESV	Judges	13	21	The angel of the Lord appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife . ( U ) Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the Lord .
ESV	Judges	13	22	And Manoah said to his wife , ( V ) “ We shall surely die , for we have seen God. ”
ESV	Judges	13	23	But his wife said to him , “ If the Lord had meant to kill us , he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands , or shown us all these things , or now announced to us such things as these. ”
ESV	Judges	13	24	And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson . ( W ) And the young man grew , and the Lord blessed him .

ESV	Judges	14	14	And he said to them , “ Out of the eater came something to eat . Out of the strong came something sweet. ” And in three days they could not solve the riddle .
ESV	Judges	14	2	Then he came up and told his father and mother , “ I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah . ( C ) Now get her for me as my wife. ”
ESV	Judges	14	3	But his father and mother said to him , “ Is there not a woman among the daughters ( D ) of your relatives , or among all our people , that you must go to take a wife from the ( E ) uncircumcised Philistines ? ” But Samson said to his father , “ Get her for me , for she is right in my eyes. ”
ESV	Judges	14	4	His father and mother did not know that it was ( F ) from the Lord , for he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines . ( G ) At that time the Philistines ruled over Israel .
ESV	Judges	14	5	Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah , and they came to the vineyards of Timnah . And behold , a young lion came toward him roaring .
ESV	Judges	14	6	( H ) Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him , and although he had nothing in his hand , he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat . But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done .
ESV	Judges	14	7	Then he went down and talked with the woman , and she was right in Samson 's eyes .
ESV	Judges	14	8	After some days he returned to take her . And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion , and behold , there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion , and honey .
ESV	Judges	14	9	He scraped it out into his hands and went on , eating as he went . And he came to his father and mother and gave some to them , and they ate . But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion .
ESV	Judges	14	10	His father went down to the woman , and Samson prepared a feast there , for so the young men used to do .
ESV	Judges	14	11	As soon as the people saw him , they brought thirty companions to be with him .
ESV	Judges	14	12	And Samson said to them , ( I ) “ Let me now put a riddle to you . If you can tell me what it is , within ( J ) the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty ( K ) changes of clothes ,
ESV	Judges	14	13	but if you can not tell me what it is , then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes. ” And they said to him , “ Put your riddle , that we may hear it. ”
ESV	Judges	14	15	On the fourth [ a ] day they said to Samson 's wife , ( L ) “ Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle is , ( M ) lest we burn you and your father 's house with fire . Have you invited us here to impoverish us ? ”
ESV	Judges	14	16	And Samson 's wife wept over him and said , ( N ) “ You only hate me ; you do not love me . You have put a riddle to my people , and you have not told me what it is. ” And he said to her , “ Behold , I have not told my father nor my mother , and shall I tell you ? ”
ESV	Judges	14	17	She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted , and on the seventh day he told her , because ( O ) she pressed him hard . Then she told the riddle to her people .
ESV	Judges	14	18	And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down , “ What is sweeter than honey ? What is stronger than a lion ? ” And he said to them , “ If you had not plowed with my heifer , you would not have found out my riddle. ”
ESV	Judges	14	19	( P ) And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him , and he went down to ( Q ) Ashkelon and struck down thirty men of the town and took their spoil and gave the garments to those who had told the riddle . In hot anger he went back to his father 's house .

ESV	Judges	15	15	And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey , and put out his hand and took it , ( K ) and with it he struck 1,000 men .
ESV	Judges	15	2	And her father said , “ I really thought that you utterly hated her , ( B ) so I gave her to your companion . Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she ? Please take her instead. ”
ESV	Judges	15	3	And Samson said to them , “ This time I shall be innocent in regard to the Philistines , when I do them harm. ”
ESV	Judges	15	4	So Samson went and caught

ESV	Judges	15	6	Then the Philistines said , “ Who has done this ? ” And they said , “ Samson , the son-in-law of the Timnite , because he has taken his wife ( C ) and given her to his companion. ” And the Philistines came up and ( D ) burned her and her father with fire .
ESV	Judges	15	7	And Samson said to them , “ If this is what you do , I swear I will be avenged on you , and after that I will quit. ”

ESV	Judges	15	10	And the men of Judah said , “ Why have you come up against us ? ” They said , “ We have come up to bind Samson , to do to him as he did to us. ”
ESV	Judges	15	11	Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam , and said to Samson , “ Do you not know that ( H ) the Philistines are rulers over us ? What then is this that you have done to us ? ” And he said to them , “ As they did to me , so have I done to them. ”
ESV	Judges	15	12	And they said to him , “ We have come down to bind you , that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines. ” And Samson said to them , “ Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves. ”
ESV	Judges	15	13	They said to him , “ No ; we will only bind you and give you into their hands . We will surely not kill you. ” So they bound him with two ( I ) new ropes and brought him up from the rock .
ESV	Judges	15	14	When he came to Lehi , the Philistines came shouting to meet him . ( J ) Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him , and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire , and his bonds melted off his hands .
ESV	Judges	15	16	And Samson said , “ With the jawbone of a donkey , heaps upon heaps , with the jawbone of a donkey have I struck down a thousand men. ”
ESV	Judges	15	17	As soon as he had finished speaking , he threw away the jawbone out of his hand . And that place ( L ) was called Ramath-lehi . [ a ]
ESV	Judges	15	18	And he was very thirsty , and he called upon the Lord and said , ( M ) “ You have granted this great salvation by the hand of your servant , and shall I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised ? ”
ESV	Judges	15	19	And God split open the hollow place that is ( N ) at Lehi , and water came out from it . And when he drank , ( O ) his spirit returned , and he revived . Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore ; [ b ] it is at Lehi to this day .

ESV	Judges	16	16	And ( J ) when she pressed him hard with her words day after day , and urged him , his soul was vexed to death .
ESV	Judges	16	2	The Gazites were told , “ Samson has come here. ” And they ( B ) surrounded the place and set an ambush for him all night at the gate of the city . They kept quiet all night , saying , “ Let us wait till the light of the morning ; then we will kill him. ”
ESV	Judges	16	3	But Samson lay till midnight , and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts , and pulled them up , bar and all , and put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that is in front of Hebron .
ESV	Judges	16	4	After this he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
ESV	Judges	16	5	And ( C ) the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her , ( D ) “ Seduce him , and see where his great strength lies , and by what means we may overpower him , that we may bind him to ( E ) humble him . And we will each give you 1,100 pieces of silver. ”
ESV	Judges	16	6	So Delilah said to Samson , “ Please tell me where your great strength lies , and how you might be bound , that one could ( F ) subdue you. ”
ESV	Judges	16	7	Samson said to her , “ If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried , ( G ) then I shall become weak and be like any other man. ”
ESV	Judges	16	8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
ESV	Judges	16	9	Now she had men lying in ambush in an inner chamber . And she said to him , “ The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! ” But he snapped the bowstrings , as a thread of flax snaps when it touches the fire . So the secret of his strength was not known .
ESV	Judges	16	10	Then Delilah said to Samson , “ Behold , you have mocked me and told me lies . Please tell me how you might be bound. ”
ESV	Judges	16	11	And he said to her , “ If they bind me with ( H ) new ropes that have not been used , then I shall become weak and be like any other man. ”
ESV	Judges	16	12	So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him , “ The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! ” And the men lying in ambush were in an inner chamber . But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread .
ESV	Judges	16	13	Then Delilah said to Samson , “ Until now you have mocked me and told me lies . Tell me how you might be bound. ” And he said to her , “ If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and fasten it tight with the pin , then I shall become weak and be like any other man. ”
ESV	Judges	16	14	So while he slept , Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web . [ a ] And she made them tight with the pin and said to him , “ The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! ” But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin , the loom , and the web .
ESV	Judges	16	15	And she said to him , ( I ) “ How can you say , ‘ I love you , ’ when your heart is not with me ? You have mocked me these three times , and you have not told me where your great strength lies. ”
ESV	Judges	16	17	And he told her all his heart , and said to her , ( K ) “ A razor has never come upon my head , for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother 's womb . If my head is shaved , then my strength will leave me , and I shall become weak and be like any other man. ”
ESV	Judges	16	18	When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart , she sent and called the lords of the Philistines , saying , “ Come up again , for he has told me all his heart. ” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought ( L ) the money in their hands .
ESV	Judges	16	19	She made him sleep on her knees . And she called a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head . Then she began ( M ) to torment him , and his strength left him .
ESV	Judges	16	20	And she said , “ The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! ” And he awoke from his sleep and said , “ I will go out as at other times and shake myself free. ” But he did not know that ( N ) the Lord had left him .
ESV	Judges	16	21	And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles . ( O ) And he ground at the mill in the prison .
ESV	Judges	16	22	But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved . The Death of Samson
ESV	Judges	16	23	Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to ( P ) Dagon their god and to rejoice , and they said , “ Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand. ”
ESV	Judges	16	24	And when the people saw him , ( Q ) they praised their god . For they said , “ Our god has given our enemy into our hand , the ravager of our country , who has killed many of us. ” [ b ]
ESV	Judges	16	25	And ( R ) when their hearts were merry , they said , “ Call Samson , that he may entertain us. ” So they called Samson out of the prison , and he entertained them . They made him stand between the pillars .
ESV	Judges	16	26	And Samson said to the young man who held him by the hand , “ Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests , that I may lean against them. ”
ESV	Judges	16	27	Now the house was full of men and women . All the lords of the Philistines were there , and ( S ) on the roof there were about 3,000 men and women , who looked on while Samson entertained .
ESV	Judges	16	28	Then Samson called to the Lord and said , “ O Lord God , ( T ) please remember me and please strengthen me only this once , O God , that I may be avenged on the Philistines for my two eyes. ”
ESV	Judges	16	29	And Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested , and he leaned his weight against them , his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other .
ESV	Judges	16	30	And Samson said , “ Let me die with the Philistines. ” Then he bowed with all his strength , and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people who were in it . So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he had killed during his life .
ESV	Judges	16	31	Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him ( U ) between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father . He had judged Israel twenty years .

ESV	Judges	17	17	There was a man of ( A ) the hill country of Ephraim , whose name was Micah .
ESV	Judges	17	2	And he said to his mother , “ The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you , about which you uttered a curse , and also spoke it in my ears , behold , the silver is with me ; I took it. ” And his mother said , ( B ) “ Blessed be my son by the Lord. ”
ESV	Judges	17	3	And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother . And his mother said , “ I dedicate the silver to the Lord from my hand for my son , to make ( C ) a carved image and ( D ) a metal image . Now therefore I will restore it to you. ”
ESV	Judges	17	4	So when he restored the money to his mother , his mother ( E ) took
ESV	Judges	17	200	pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith , who made it into a carved image and a metal image . And it was in the house of Micah .
ESV	Judges	17	5	And the man Micah had a shrine , and he made ( F ) an ephod and ( G ) household gods , and ( H ) ordained [ a ] one of his sons , who became his priest .
ESV	Judges	17	6	( I ) In those days there was no king in Israel . ( J ) Everyone did what was right in his own eyes .
ESV	Judges	17	7	Now there was a young man of ( K ) Bethlehem in Judah , of the family of Judah , who was a Levite , and he sojourned there .
ESV	Judges	17	8	And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place . And as he journeyed , he came to ( L ) the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah .
ESV	Judges	17	9	And Micah said to him , “ Where do you come from ? ” And he said to him , “ I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah , and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place. ”
ESV	Judges	17	10	And Micah said to him , “ Stay with me , and be to me ( M ) a father and a priest , and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living. ” And the Levite went in .
ESV	Judges	17	11	And the Levite ( N ) was content to dwell with the man , and the young man became to him like one of his sons .

ESV	Judges	18	18	And when these went into Micah 's house and took ( AA ) the carved image , the ephod , the household gods , and the metal image , the priest said to them , “ What are you doing ? ”
ESV	Judges	18	2	So the people of Dan sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe , ( C ) from Zorah and from Eshtaol , ( D ) to spy out the land and to explore it . And they said to them , “ Go and explore the land. ” And they came ( E ) to the hill country of Ephraim , to the house of Micah , and lodged there .
ESV	Judges	18	3	When they were by the house of Micah , they recognized the voice of the young Levite . And they turned aside and said to him , “ Who brought you here ? What are you doing in this place ? What is your business here ? ”
ESV	Judges	18	4	And he said to them , “ This is how Micah dealt with me : ( F ) he has hired me , and I have become his priest. ”
ESV	Judges	18	5	And they said to him , ( G ) “ Inquire of God , please , that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed. ”
ESV	Judges	18	6	And the priest said to them , ( H ) “ Go in peace . The journey on which you go is under the eye of the Lord. ”
ESV	Judges	18	7	Then the five men departed and came to ( I ) Laish and saw the people who were there , how they lived in security , after the manner of the Sidonians , ( J ) quiet and unsuspecting , lacking [ a ] nothing that is in the earth and possessing wealth , and how ( K ) they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone .
ESV	Judges	18	8	And when they came to their brothers at ( L ) Zorah and Eshtaol , their brothers said to them , “ What do you report ? ”
ESV	Judges	18	9	They said , ( M ) “ Arise , and let us go up against them , for we have seen the land , and behold , it is very good . ( N ) And will you do nothing ? ( O ) Do not be slow to go , to enter in and possess the land .
ESV	Judges	18	10	As soon as you go , you will come to an ( P ) unsuspecting people . The land is spacious , for God has given it into your hands , ( Q ) a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth. ”
ESV	Judges	18	11	So
ESV	Judges	18	600	men armed with weapons of war .
ESV	Judges	18	12	and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah . On this account that place is called ( S ) Mahaneh-dan [ b ] to this day ; behold , it is west of ( T ) Kiriath-jearim .
ESV	Judges	18	13	And they passed on from there to ( U ) the hill country of Ephraim , and came to the house of Micah .
ESV	Judges	18	14	Then the five men who had gone to scout out the country of Laish said to their brothers , “ Do you know that ( V ) in these houses there are an ephod , household gods , a carved image , and a metal image ? Now therefore consider what you will do. ”
ESV	Judges	18	15	And they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite , at the home of Micah , and ( W ) asked him about his welfare .
ESV	Judges	18	16	Now the
ESV	Judges	18	17	And ( Y ) the five men who had gone to scout out the land went up and entered and took ( Z ) the carved image , the ephod , the household gods , and the metal image , while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the
ESV	Judges	18	19	And they said to him , “ Keep quiet ; ( AB ) put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be to us ( AC ) a father and a priest . Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man , or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel ? ”
ESV	Judges	18	20	And the priest 's heart was glad . He took the ephod and the household gods and the carved image and went along with the people .
ESV	Judges	18	21	So they turned and departed , putting the little ones and the livestock and ( AD ) the goods in front of them .
ESV	Judges	18	22	When they had gone a distance from the home of Micah , the men who were in the houses near Micah 's house were called out , and they overtook the people of Dan .
ESV	Judges	18	23	And they shouted to the people of Dan , who turned around and said to Micah , “ What is the matter with you , that you come with such a company ? ”
ESV	Judges	18	24	And he said , ( AE ) “ You take my gods that I made and the priest , and go away , and what have I left ? How then do you ask me , ‘ What is the matter with you ? ’ ”
ESV	Judges	18	25	And the people of Dan said to him , “ Do not let your voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows fall upon you , and you lose your life with the lives of your household. ”
ESV	Judges	18	26	Then the people of Dan went their way . And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his home .
ESV	Judges	18	27	But the people of Dan took what Micah had made , and the priest who belonged to him , and they came to Laish , to a people ( AF ) quiet and unsuspecting , and ( AG ) struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire .
ESV	Judges	18	28	And there was no deliverer because it was ( AH ) far from Sidon , and they had no dealings with anyone . It was in the valley that belongs to ( AI ) Beth-rehob . Then they rebuilt the city and lived in it .
ESV	Judges	18	29	And they named the city ( AJ ) Dan , after the name of Dan their ancestor , who was born to Israel ; but ( AK ) the name of the city was Laish at the first .
ESV	Judges	18	30	And the people of Dan set up the carved image for themselves , and Jonathan the son of Gershom , ( AL ) son of Moses , [ c ] ( AM ) and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day ( AN ) of the captivity of the land .

ESV	Judges	19	19	We have straw and feed for our donkeys , with bread and wine for me and your female servant and the young man with your servants . ( O ) There is no lack of anything. ”
ESV	Judges	19	2	And his concubine was unfaithful to [ a ] him , and she went away from him to her father 's house at Bethlehem in Judah , and was there some four months .
ESV	Judges	19	3	Then her husband arose and went after her , to speak kindly to her and bring her back . He had with him his servant and a couple of donkeys . And she brought him into her father 's house . And when the girl 's father saw him , he came with joy to meet him .
ESV	Judges	19	4	And his father-in-law , the girl 's father , made him stay , and he remained with him three days . So they ate and drank and spent the night there .
ESV	Judges	19	5	And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning , and he prepared to go , but the girl 's father said to his son-in-law , ( D ) “ Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread , and after that you may go. ”
ESV	Judges	19	6	So the two of them sat and ate and drank together . And the girl 's father said to the man , “ Be pleased to spend the night , and ( E ) let your heart be merry. ”
ESV	Judges	19	7	And when the man rose up to go , his father-in-law pressed him , till he spent the night there again .
ESV	Judges	19	8	And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart . And the girl 's father said , ( F ) “ Strengthen your heart and wait until the day declines. ” So they ate , both of them .
ESV	Judges	19	9	And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart , his father-in-law , the girl 's father , said to him , “ Behold , now the day has waned toward evening . Please , spend the night . Behold , the day draws to its close . Lodge here and let your heart be merry , and tomorrow you shall arise early in the morning for your journey , and go home. ”
ESV	Judges	19	10	But the man would not spend the night . He rose up and departed and arrived opposite ( G ) Jebus ( that is , Jerusalem ) . He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys , and his concubine was with him .
ESV	Judges	19	11	When they were near Jebus , the day was nearly over , and the servant said to his master , “ Come now , let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it. ”
ESV	Judges	19	12	And his master said to him , “ We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners , who do not belong to the people of Israel , but we will pass on to ( H ) Gibeah. ”
ESV	Judges	19	13	And he said to his young man , “ Come and let us draw near to one of these places and spend the night at Gibeah or at ( I ) Ramah. ”
ESV	Judges	19	14	So they passed on and went their way . And the sun went down on them near Gibeah , which belongs to Benjamin ,
ESV	Judges	19	15	and they turned aside there , to go in and spend the night at Gibeah . And he went in and sat down in the open square of the city , ( J ) for no one took them into his house to spend the night .
ESV	Judges	19	16	And behold , an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening . The man was from ( K ) the hill country of Ephraim , and he was sojourning in Gibeah . ( L ) The men of the place were Benjaminites .
ESV	Judges	19	17	And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city . And the old man said , “ Where are you going ? And where do you come from ? ”
ESV	Judges	19	18	And he said to him , “ We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim , from which I come . I went to Bethlehem in Judah , and I am going ( M ) to the house of the Lord , [ b ] ( N ) but no one has taken me into his house .
ESV	Judges	19	20	And the old man said , ( P ) “ Peace be to you ; I will care for all your wants . ( Q ) Only , do not spend the night in the square. ”
ESV	Judges	19	21	So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys feed . ( R ) And they washed their feet , and ate and drank . Gibeah 's Crime
ESV	Judges	19	22	As they were ( S ) making their hearts merry , behold , the men of the city , worthless fellows , ( T ) surrounded the house , beating on the door . And they said to the old man , the master of the house , “ Bring out the man who came into your house , that we may know him. ”
ESV	Judges	19	23	And the man , the master of the house , went out to them and said to them , “ No , my brothers , ( U ) do not act so wickedly ; since this man has come into my house , ( V ) do not do this vile thing .
ESV	Judges	19	24	( W ) Behold , here are my virgin daughter and his concubine . Let me bring them out now . ( X ) Violate them and do with them what seems good to you , but against this man ( Y ) do not do this outrageous thing. ”
ESV	Judges	19	25	But the men would not listen to him . So the man seized his concubine and made her go out to them . And they knew her and abused her all night until the morning . And as the dawn began to break , they let her go .
ESV	Judges	19	26	And as morning appeared , the woman came and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her master was , until it was light .
ESV	Judges	19	27	And her master rose up in the morning , and when he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way , behold , there was his concubine lying at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .

ESV	Judges	20	2	And the ( D ) chiefs of all the people , of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , 400,000 men on foot ( E ) that drew the sword .

ESV	Judges	20	14	Then the people of Benjamin came together out of the cities to Gibeah to go out to battle against the people of Israel .
ESV	Judges	20	15	And the people of Benjamin mustered out of their cities on that day ( N ) 26,000 men ( O ) who drew the sword , besides the inhabitants of Gibeah , who mustered

ESV	Judges	20	27	And the people of Israel inquired of the Lord ( Z ) ( for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days ,
ESV	Judges	20	28	and ( AA ) Phinehas the son of Eleazar , son of Aaron , ( AB ) ministered before it in those days ) , saying , “ Shall we go out once more to battle against our brothers , the people of Benjamin , or shall we cease ? ” And the Lord said , “ Go up , for tomorrow I will give them into your hand. ”
ESV	Judges	20	29	( AC ) So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah .
ESV	Judges	20	30	And the people of Israel went up against the people of Benjamin on the third day and set themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
ESV	Judges	20	31	And the people of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city . And as at other times they began to strike and kill some of the people in the highways , ( AD ) one of which goes up to ( AE ) Bethel and the other to Gibeah , and in the open country , about thirty men of Israel .
ESV	Judges	20	32	And the people of Benjamin said , ( AF ) “ They are routed before us , as at the first. ” But the people of Israel said , “ Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways. ”
ESV	Judges	20	33	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar , and the men of Israel who were in ambush rushed out of their place from Maareh-geba . [ a ]
ESV	Judges	20	34	And there came against Gibeah 10,000 chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was hard , ( AG ) but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was close upon them .
ESV	Judges	20	35	And the Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel , and the people of Israel destroyed 25,100 men of Benjamin that day . All these were men who ( AH ) drew the sword .
ESV	Judges	20	36	So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated . The men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin , because they trusted the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah .
ESV	Judges	20	37	( AI ) Then the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah ; the men in ambush moved out and struck all the city with the edge of the sword .
ESV	Judges	20	38	Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in the main ambush was that when they made a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city
ESV	Judges	20	39	the men of Israel should turn in battle . Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel . They said , ( AJ ) “ Surely they are defeated before us , as in the first battle. ”
ESV	Judges	20	40	But when the signal began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke , the Benjaminites looked behind them , and behold , ( AK ) the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven .
ESV	Judges	20	41	Then the men of Israel turned , and the men of Benjamin were dismayed , ( AL ) for they saw that disaster was close upon them .
ESV	Judges	20	42	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in ( AM ) the direction of the wilderness , but the battle overtook them . And those who came out of the cities were destroying them in their midst .
ESV	Judges	20	43	Surrounding the Benjaminites , they pursued them and trod them down from Nohah [ b ] as far as opposite Gibeah on the east .
ESV	Judges	20	44	Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell , all of them men of valor .
ESV	Judges	20	45	And they turned ( AN ) and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of ( AO ) Rimmon . Five thousand men of them were cut down in the highways . And they were pursued hard to Gidom , and 2,000 men of them were struck down .
ESV	Judges	20	46	So all who fell that day of Benjamin were 25,000 men who drew the sword , all of them men of valor .
ESV	Judges	20	47	But
ESV	Judges	20	600	men turned and ( AP ) fled toward the wilderness to the rock of ( AQ ) Rimmon and remained at the rock of Rimmon four months .
ESV	Judges	20	48	And the men of Israel turned back against the people of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword , the city , men and beasts and all that they found . And all the towns that they found they set on fire .

ESV	Judges	21	21	and watch . If the daughters of Shiloh come out to ( R ) dance in the dances , then come out of the vineyards and snatch each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh , and go to the land of Benjamin .
ESV	Judges	21	2	And the people came to ( B ) Bethel and sat there till evening before God , and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly .
ESV	Judges	21	3	And they said , “ O Lord , the God of Israel , why has this happened in Israel , that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel ? ”
ESV	Judges	21	4	And the next day the people rose early and ( C ) built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
ESV	Judges	21	5	And the people of Israel said , “ Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the Lord ? ” ( D ) For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah , saying , “ He shall surely be put to death. ”
ESV	Judges	21	6	And the people of Israel ( E ) had compassion for Benjamin their brother and said , “ One tribe is cut off from Israel this day .
ESV	Judges	21	7	( F ) What shall we do for wives for those who are left , since we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them any of our daughters for wives ? ”
ESV	Judges	21	8	And they said , “ What one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah ? ” And behold , no one had come to the camp from ( G ) Jabesh-gilead , to the assembly .
ESV	Judges	21	9	For when the people were mustered , behold , not one of the inhabitants of ( H ) Jabesh-gilead was there .
ESV	Judges	21	10	So the congregation sent 12,000 of their bravest men there and commanded them , ( I ) “ Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword ; also the women and the little ones .
ESV	Judges	21	11	This is what you shall do : ( J ) every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall devote to destruction. ”
ESV	Judges	21	12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead
ESV	Judges	21	400	young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him , and they brought them to the camp at ( K ) Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
ESV	Judges	21	13	Then the whole congregation sent word to the people of Benjamin who were at the ( L ) rock of Rimmon and ( M ) proclaimed peace to them .
ESV	Judges	21	14	And Benjamin returned at that time . And they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead , but they were not enough for them .
ESV	Judges	21	15	And the people ( N ) had compassion on Benjamin because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel .
ESV	Judges	21	16	Then the elders of the congregation said , ( O ) “ What shall we do for wives for those who are left , since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin ? ”
ESV	Judges	21	17	And they said , “ There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin , that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel .
ESV	Judges	21	18	Yet we can not give them wives from our daughters. ” ( P ) For the people of Israel had sworn , “ Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin. ”
ESV	Judges	21	19	So they said , “ Behold , there is the yearly feast of the Lord at Shiloh , which is north of Bethel , on the east of ( Q ) the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem , and south of Lebonah. ”
ESV	Judges	21	20	And they commanded the people of Benjamin , saying , “ Go and lie in ambush in the vineyards
ESV	Judges	21	22	And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us , we will say to them , ‘ Grant them graciously to us , because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle , neither did you give them to them , else you would now be guilty. ’ ”
ESV	Judges	21	23	And the people of Benjamin did so and took their wives , according to their number , from the dancers whom they carried off . Then they went and returned to their inheritance ( S ) and rebuilt the towns and lived in them .
ESV	Judges	21	24	And the people of Israel departed from there at that time , every man to his tribe and family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .

ESV	Ruth	1	1	In the days ( A ) when the judges ruled there was ( B ) a famine in the land , and a man of ( C ) Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab , he and his wife and his two sons .
ESV	Ruth	1	2	The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi , and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion . They were ( D ) Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah . They went into the country of Moab and remained there .
ESV	Ruth	1	3	But Elimelech , the husband of Naomi , died , and she was left with her two sons .
ESV	Ruth	1	4	These took Moabite wives ; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth . They lived there about ten years ,
ESV	Ruth	1	5	and both Mahlon and Chilion died , so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband . Ruth 's Loyalty to Naomi
ESV	Ruth	1	6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab , for she had heard in the fields of Moab that ( E ) the Lord had visited his people and ( F ) given them food .
ESV	Ruth	1	7	So she set out from the place where she was with her two daughters-in-law , and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah .
ESV	Ruth	1	8	But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law , “ Go , return each of you to her mother 's house . May the Lord ( G ) deal kindly with you , as you have dealt with ( H ) the dead and with me .
ESV	Ruth	1	9	The Lord grant that you may find ( I ) rest , each of you in the house of her husband ! ” Then she kissed them , and they lifted up their voices and wept .
ESV	Ruth	1	10	And they said to her , “ No , we will return with you to your people. ”
ESV	Ruth	1	11	But Naomi said , “ Turn back , my daughters ; why will you go with me ? Have I yet sons in my womb ( J ) that they may become your husbands ?
ESV	Ruth	1	12	Turn back , my daughters ; go your way , for I am too old to have a husband . If I should say I have hope , even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons ,
ESV	Ruth	1	13	would you therefore wait till they were grown ? Would you therefore refrain from marrying ? No , my daughters , for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that ( K ) the hand of the Lord has gone out against me. ”
ESV	Ruth	1	14	Then they lifted up their voices and wept again . And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law , but Ruth clung to her .
ESV	Ruth	1	15	And she said , “ See , your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to ( L ) her gods ; return after your sister-in-law. ”
ESV	Ruth	1	16	But Ruth said , “ Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you . For where you go I will go , and where you lodge I will lodge . ( M ) Your people shall be my people , and your God my God .
ESV	Ruth	1	17	Where you die I will die , and there will I be buried . ( N ) May the Lord do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you. ”
ESV	Ruth	1	18	( O ) And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her , she said no more . Naomi and Ruth Return
ESV	Ruth	1	19	So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem . And when they came to Bethlehem , ( P ) the whole town was stirred because of them . And the women said , “ Is this Naomi ? ”
ESV	Ruth	1	20	She said to them , “ Do not call me Naomi ; [ a ] call me ( Q ) Mara , [ b ] for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me .
ESV	Ruth	1	21	( R ) I went away full , and the Lord has brought me back empty . Why call me Naomi , when the Lord has testified against me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me ? ”
ESV	Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabite her daughter-in-law with her , who returned from the country of Moab . And they came to Bethlehem ( S ) at the beginning of barley harvest . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Ruth	2	2	And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi , “ Let me go to the field and ( C ) glean among the ears of grain after him ( D ) in whose sight I shall find favor. ” And she said to her , “ Go , my daughter. ”
ESV	Ruth	2	3	So she set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers , and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz , who was of the clan of Elimelech .
ESV	Ruth	2	4	And behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem . And he said to the reapers , ( E ) “ The Lord be with you ! ” And they answered , “ The Lord bless you. ”
ESV	Ruth	2	5	Then Boaz said to his young man who was in charge of the reapers , “ Whose young woman is this ? ”
ESV	Ruth	2	6	And the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered , “ She is the young Moabite woman , ( F ) who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab .
ESV	Ruth	2	7	She said , ‘ Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers. ’ So she came , and she has continued from early morning until now , except for a short rest. ” [ a ]
ESV	Ruth	2	8	Then Boaz said to Ruth , “ Now , listen , my daughter , do not go to glean in another field or leave this one , but keep close to my young women .
ESV	Ruth	2	9	Let your eyes be on the field that they are reaping , and go after them . Have I not charged the young men not to touch you ? And when you are thirsty , go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn. ”
ESV	Ruth	2	10	Then ( G ) she fell on her face , bowing to the ground , and said to him , “ Why have I found favor in your eyes , that you should ( H ) take notice of me , since I am a foreigner ? ”
ESV	Ruth	2	11	But Boaz answered her , ( I ) “ All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me , and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before .
ESV	Ruth	2	12	( J ) The Lord repay you for what you have done , and a full reward be given you by the Lord , the God of Israel , under whose wings you have come to take refuge ! ”
ESV	Ruth	2	13	Then she said , ( K ) “ I have found favor in your eyes , my lord , for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant , though I am not one of your servants. ”
ESV	Ruth	2	14	And at mealtime Boaz said to her , “ Come here and eat some bread and dip your morsel in the wine. ” So she sat beside the reapers , and he passed to her roasted grain . And she ate until ( L ) she was satisfied , and she had some left over .
ESV	Ruth	2	15	When she rose to glean , Boaz instructed his young men , saying , “ Let her glean even among the sheaves , and do not reproach her .
ESV	Ruth	2	16	And also pull out some from the bundles for her and leave it for her to glean , and do not rebuke her. ”
ESV	Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until evening . Then she beat out what she had gleaned , and it was about an ephah [ b ] of barley .
ESV	Ruth	2	18	And she took it up and went into the city . Her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned . She also brought out and gave her what food she had left over ( M ) after being satisfied .
ESV	Ruth	2	19	And her mother-in-law said to her , “ Where did you glean today ? And where have you worked ? Blessed be the man ( N ) who took notice of you. ” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said , “ The man 's name with whom I worked today is Boaz. ”
ESV	Ruth	2	20	And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law , ( O ) “ May he be blessed by the Lord , whose kindness has not forsaken ( P ) the living or the dead ! ” Naomi also said to her , “ The man is a close relative of ours , one of ( Q ) our redeemers. ”
ESV	Ruth	2	21	And Ruth the Moabite said , “ Besides , he said to me , ‘ You shall keep close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest. ’ ”
ESV	Ruth	2	22	And Naomi said to Ruth , her daughter-in-law , “ It is good , my daughter , that you go out with his young women , lest in another field you be assaulted. ”
ESV	Ruth	2	23	So she kept close to the young women of Boaz , gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests . And she lived with her mother-in-law . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Ruth	3	3	( D ) Wash therefore and anoint yourself , and put on your cloak and go down to the threshing floor , but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
ESV	Ruth	3	2	Is not Boaz ( B ) our relative , ( C ) with whose young women you were ? See , he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor .
ESV	Ruth	3	4	But when he lies down , observe the place where he lies . Then go and uncover his feet and lie down , and he will tell you what to do. ”
ESV	Ruth	3	5	And she replied , “ All that you say I will do. ”
ESV	Ruth	3	6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had commanded her .
ESV	Ruth	3	7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk , and ( E ) his heart was merry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain . Then she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down .
ESV	Ruth	3	8	At midnight the man was startled and turned over , and behold , a woman lay at his feet !
ESV	Ruth	3	9	He said , “ Who are you ? ” And she answered , “ I am Ruth , your servant . ( F ) Spread your wings [ a ] over your servant , for you are ( G ) a redeemer. ”
ESV	Ruth	3	10	And he said , ( H ) “ May you be blessed by the Lord , my daughter . You have made this last kindness greater than ( I ) the first in that you have not gone after young men , whether poor or rich .
ESV	Ruth	3	11	And now , my daughter , do not fear . I will do for you all that you ask , for all my fellow townsmen know that you are ( J ) a worthy woman .
ESV	Ruth	3	12	And now it is true that I am ( K ) a redeemer . Yet there is a redeemer nearer than I .
ESV	Ruth	3	13	Remain tonight , and in the morning , if he will ( L ) redeem you , good ; let him do it . But if he is not willing to redeem you , then , ( M ) as the Lord lives , I will redeem you . Lie down until the morning. ”
ESV	Ruth	3	14	So she lay at his feet until the morning , but arose before one could recognize another . And he said , “ Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor. ”
ESV	Ruth	3	15	And he said , “ Bring the garment you are wearing and hold it out. ” So she held it , and he measured out six measures of barley and put it on her . Then she went into the city .
ESV	Ruth	3	16	And when she came to her mother-in-law , she said , “ How did you fare , my daughter ? ” Then she told her all that the man had done for her ,
ESV	Ruth	3	17	saying , “ These six measures of barley he gave to me , for he said to me , ‘ You must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law. ’ ”
ESV	Ruth	3	18	She replied , “ Wait , my daughter , until you learn how the matter turns out , for the man will not rest but will settle the matter today. ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Ruth	4	4	So I thought I would tell you of it and say , ( D ) ‘ Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people. ’ If you will redeem it , redeem it . But if you [ a ] will not , tell me , that I may know , for there is no one besides you to redeem it , and I come after you. ” And he said , “ I will redeem it. ”
ESV	Ruth	4	2	And he took ten men ( C ) of the elders of the city and said , “ Sit down here. ” So they sat down .
ESV	Ruth	4	3	Then he said to the redeemer , “ Naomi , who has come back from the country of Moab , is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech .
ESV	Ruth	4	5	Then Boaz said , “ The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi , you also acquire Ruth [ b ] the Moabite , the widow of the dead , in order ( E ) to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance. ”
ESV	Ruth	4	6	( F ) Then the redeemer said , “ I can not redeem it for myself , lest I impair my own inheritance . Take my right of redemption yourself , for I can not redeem it. ”
ESV	Ruth	4	7	( G ) Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging : to confirm a transaction , the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other , and this was the manner of attesting in Israel .
ESV	Ruth	4	8	So when the redeemer said to Boaz , “ Buy it for yourself , ” he drew off his sandal .
ESV	Ruth	4	9	Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people , “ You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to ( H ) Chilion and to Mahlon .
ESV	Ruth	4	10	Also Ruth the Moabite , the widow of Mahlon , I have bought to be my wife , ( I ) to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance , that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his native place . You are witnesses this day. ”
ESV	Ruth	4	11	Then all the people who were ( J ) at the gate and the elders said , “ We are witnesses . May the Lord make the woman , who is coming into your house , like Rachel and Leah , ( K ) who together ( L ) built up the house of Israel . May you act worthily in ( M ) Ephrathah and ( N ) be renowned in Bethlehem ,
ESV	Ruth	4	12	and may your house be like the house of Perez , ( O ) whom Tamar bore to Judah , because ( P ) of the offspring that the Lord will give you by this young woman. ” Ruth and Boaz Marry
ESV	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth , and she became his wife . And he went in to her , ( Q ) and the Lord gave her conception , and she bore a son .
ESV	Ruth	4	14	( R ) Then the women said to Naomi , “ Blessed be the Lord , who has not left you this day without ( S ) a redeemer , and may his name ( T ) be renowned in Israel !
ESV	Ruth	4	15	He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age , for your daughter-in-law who loves you , ( U ) who is more to you than seven sons , has given birth to him. ”
ESV	Ruth	4	16	Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse .
ESV	Ruth	4	17	( V ) And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name , saying , “ A son has been born to Naomi. ” They named him Obed . He was the father of Jesse , the father of David . The Genealogy of David

ESV	1%20Samuel	1	2	He had two wives . The name of the one was Hannah , and the name of the other , Peninnah . And Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	3	Now this man used to go up ( D ) year by year from his city ( E ) to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of hosts ( F ) at Shiloh , where the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were priests of the Lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	4	On the day when Elkanah sacrificed , ( G ) he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters .
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	5	But to Hannah he gave a double portion , because he loved her , though the Lord had closed her womb . [ a ]
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	6	And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her , because the Lord had closed her womb .
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	7	So it went on year by year . As often as she went up to the house of the Lord , she used to provoke her . Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat .
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	8	And Elkanah , her husband , said to her , “ Hannah , why do you weep ? And why do you not eat ? And why is your heart sad ? ( H ) Am I not more to you than ten sons ? ”

ESV	1%20Samuel	1	10	She was ( J ) deeply distressed and prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly .
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	11	And she ( K ) vowed a vow and said , “ O Lord of hosts , if you will indeed ( L ) look on the affliction of your servant and ( M ) remember me and not forget your servant , but will give to your servant a son , then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life , ( N ) and no razor shall touch his head. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	12	As she continued praying before the Lord , Eli observed her mouth .
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	13	Hannah was speaking in her heart ; only her lips moved , and her voice was not heard . Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman .
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	14	And Eli said to her , “ How long will you go on being drunk ? Put your wine away from you. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	15	But Hannah answered , “ No , my lord , I am a woman troubled in spirit . I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but ( O ) I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	16	Do not regard your servant as ( P ) a worthless woman , for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	17	Then Eli answered , ( Q ) “ Go in peace , and the God of Israel ( R ) grant your petition that you have made to him. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	18	And she said , ( S ) “ Let your servant find favor in your eyes. ” Then the woman ( T ) went her way and ate , and her face was no longer sad .
ESV	1%20Samuel	1	19	They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the Lord ; then they went back to their house at ( U ) Ramah . And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife , and the Lord ( V ) remembered her .

ESV	1%20Samuel	2	4	( F ) The bows of the mighty are broken , but the feeble bind on strength .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	5	Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread , but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger . ( G ) The barren has borne seven , ( H ) but she who has many children is forlorn .

ESV	1%20Samuel	2	11	Then Elkanah went home ( T ) to Ramah . ( U ) And the boy [ a ] was ministering to the Lord in the presence of Eli the priest . Eli 's Worthless Sons
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	12	Now the sons of Eli were ( V ) worthless men . ( W ) They did not know the Lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	13	The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice , the priest 's servant would come , while the meat was boiling , with a three-pronged fork in his hand ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	14	and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot . All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself . This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there .

ESV	1%20Samuel	2	16	And if the man said to him , “ Let them burn the fat first , and then take as much as you wish , ” he would say , “ No , you must give it now , and if not , I will take it by force. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	17	Thus the sin of the young men was very great ( Y ) in the sight of the Lord , ( Z ) for the men treated the offering of the Lord with contempt .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	18	,
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	19	And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year ( AC ) when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	20	Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife , and say , “ May the Lord give you children by this woman ( AD ) for the petition she asked of the Lord. ” So then they would return to their home .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	21	,
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	22	Now Eli was very old , and he kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel , and how they lay with the women who ( AG ) were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	23	And he said to them , “ Why do you do such things ? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	24	No , my sons ; it is no good report that I hear the people of the Lord spreading abroad .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	25	If someone sins against a man , God will mediate for him , but if someone sins against the Lord , who can intercede for him ? ” But they would not listen to the voice of their father , ( AH ) for it was the will of the Lord to put them to death .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	26	; 3:1 ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	27	And there came ( AJ ) a man of God to Eli and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord , ( AK ) ‘ Did I indeed reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt subject to the house of Pharaoh ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	28	( AL ) Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest , to go up to my altar , to burn incense , ( AM ) to wear an ephod before me ? ( AN ) I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	29	Why then do you ( AO ) scorn [ b ] my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded for my dwelling , and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel ? ’
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	30	Therefore the Lord , the God of Israel , declares : ( AP ) ‘ I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever , ’ ( AQ ) but now the Lord declares : ‘ Far be it from me , for those who honor me I will honor , and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	31	Behold , ( AR ) the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father 's house , so that there will not be an old man in your house .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	32	Then ( AS ) in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed on Israel , ( AT ) and there shall not be an old man in your house forever .
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	33	The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep his [ c ] eyes out to grieve his heart , and all the descendants [ d ] of your house shall die by the sword of men . [ e ]
ESV	1%20Samuel	2	34	( AU ) And this that shall come upon your two sons , Hophni and Phinehas , shall be the sign to you : both of them shall die ( AV ) on the same day .

ESV	1%20Samuel	3	1	Samuel 3:13 Or blaspheming for themselves The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	3	( D ) The lamp of God had not yet gone out , and Samuel was lying down ( E ) in the temple of the Lord , where the ark of God was .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	2	At that time Eli , ( C ) whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see , was lying down in his own place .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	4	Then the Lord called Samuel , and he said , “ Here I am ! ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	5	and ran to Eli and said , “ Here I am , for you called me. ” But he said , “ I did not call ; lie down again. ” So he went and lay down .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	6	And the Lord called again , “ Samuel ! ” and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said , “ Here I am , for you called me. ” But he said , “ I did not call , my son ; lie down again. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	7	Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord , and the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	8	And the Lord called Samuel again the third time . And he arose and went to Eli and said , “ Here I am , for you called me. ” Then Eli perceived that the Lord was calling the boy .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	9	Therefore Eli said to Samuel , “ Go , lie down , and if he calls you , you shall say , ‘ Speak , Lord , for your servant hears. ’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	10	And the Lord came and stood , calling as at other times , “ Samuel ! Samuel ! ” And Samuel said , “ Speak , for your servant hears. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	11	Then the Lord said to Samuel , “ Behold , I am about to do a thing in Israel ( F ) at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	12	On that day I will fulfill against Eli ( G ) all that I have spoken concerning his house , from beginning to end .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	13	( H ) And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever , for the iniquity that he knew , ( I ) because his sons were blaspheming God , [ a ] ( J ) and he did not restrain them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	14	Therefore I swear to the house of Eli ( K ) that the iniquity of Eli 's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	15	Samuel lay until morning ; then he opened the doors of the house of the Lord . And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	16	But Eli called Samuel and said , “ Samuel , my son. ” And he said , “ Here I am. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	17	And Eli said , “ What was it that he told you ? Do not hide it from me . ( L ) May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that he told you. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	18	So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him . And he said , ( M ) “ It is the Lord . Let him do what seems good to him. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	19	( N ) And Samuel grew , and the Lord was with him ( O ) and let none of his words fall to the ground .
ESV	1%20Samuel	3	20	And all Israel ( P ) from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the Lord .

ESV	1%20Samuel	4	1	Samuel 4:21 Or gone into exile ; also verse
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	4	So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts , ( D ) who is enthroned on the cherubim . And the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there with the ark of the covenant of God .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	2	The Philistines drew up in line against Israel , and when the battle spread , Israel was defeated before the Philistines , who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	3	And when the people came to the camp , the elders of Israel said , “ Why has the Lord defeated us today before the Philistines ? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord here ( C ) from Shiloh , that it [ a ] may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	5	As soon as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp , all Israel ( E ) gave a mighty shout , so that the earth resounded .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	6	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting , they said , “ What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean ? ” And when they learned that the ark of the Lord had come to the camp ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	7	the Philistines were afraid , for they said , “ A god has come into the camp. ” And they said , “ Woe to us ! For nothing like this has happened before .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	8	Woe to us ! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods ? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	9	( F ) Take courage , and be men , O Philistines , lest you become slaves to the Hebrews ( G ) as they have been to you ; be men and fight. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	10	So the Philistines fought , ( H ) and Israel was defeated , ( I ) and they fled , every man to his home . And there was a very great slaughter , for thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	11	( J ) And the ark of God was captured , ( K ) and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , died . The Death of Eli
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	12	A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day , ( L ) with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	13	When he arrived , ( M ) Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching , for his heart trembled for the ark of God . And when the man came into the city and told the news , all the city cried out .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	14	When Eli heard the sound of the outcry , he said , “ What is this uproar ? ” Then the man hurried and came and told Eli .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	15	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old ( N ) and his eyes were set so that he could not see .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	16	And the man said to Eli , “ I am he who has come from the battle ; I fled from the battle today. ” And he said , ( O ) “ How did it go , my son ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	17	He who brought the news answered and said , “ Israel has fled before the Philistines , and there has also been a great defeat among the people . Your two sons also , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead , and the ark of God has been captured. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	18	As soon as he mentioned the ark of God , Eli fell over backward ( P ) from his seat by the side of the gate , and his neck was broken and he died , for the man was old and heavy . He had judged Israel forty years .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	19	Now his daughter-in-law , the wife of Phinehas , was pregnant , about to give birth . And when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured , and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead , she bowed and gave birth , for her pains came upon her .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	20	And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her , ( Q ) “ Do not be afraid , for you have borne a son. ” But she did not answer or pay attention .
ESV	1%20Samuel	4	21	And she named the child ( R ) Ichabod , saying , ( S ) “ The glory has departed [ b ] from Israel ! ” because ( T ) the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband .

ESV	1%20Samuel	5	1	Samuel
ESV	1%20Samuel	5	5	This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon ( F ) do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day .
ESV	1%20Samuel	5	2	Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it up beside ( C ) Dagon .
ESV	1%20Samuel	5	3	And when the people of Ashdod rose early the next day , behold , ( D ) Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the Lord . So they took Dagon and put him back in his place .
ESV	1%20Samuel	5	4	But when they rose early on the next morning , behold , Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the Lord , ( E ) and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off on the threshold . Only the trunk of Dagon was left to him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	5	6	( G ) The hand of the Lord was heavy against the people of Ashdod , and he terrified and afflicted them with ( H ) tumors , both Ashdod and its territory .
ESV	1%20Samuel	5	7	And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were , they said , “ The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us , for his hand is hard against us and against Dagon our god. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	5	8	So they sent and gathered together all ( I ) the lords of the Philistines and said , “ What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel ? ” They answered , “ Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath. ” So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there .
ESV	1%20Samuel	5	9	But after they had brought it around , ( J ) the hand of the Lord was against the city , causing a very great panic , and he afflicted the men of the city , both young and old , so that ( K ) tumors broke out on them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	5	10	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron . But as soon as the ark of God came to Ekron , the people of Ekron cried out , “ They have brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	5	11	( L ) They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said , “ Send away the ark of the God of Israel , and let it return to its own place , that it may not kill us and our people. ” For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city . ( M ) The hand of God was very heavy there .

ESV	1%20Samuel	6	6	Why should you harden your hearts as ( J ) the Egyptians and ( K ) Pharaoh hardened their hearts ? After he had dealt severely with them , ( L ) did they not send the people away , and they departed ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	2	And the Philistines called for the priests and ( A ) the diviners and said , “ What shall we do with the ark of the Lord ? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	3	They said , “ If you send away the ark of the God of Israel , do not send it empty , but by all means return him ( B ) a guilt offering . Then you will be healed , and it will be known to you why ( C ) his hand does not turn away from you. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	4	And they said , “ What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him ? ” They answered , “ Five golden ( D ) tumors and five golden mice , ( E ) according to the number of the lords of the Philistines , for the same plague was on all of you and on your lords .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	5	So you must make images of your ( F ) tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land , ( G ) and give glory to the God of Israel . Perhaps ( H ) he will lighten his hand from off you ( I ) and your gods and your land .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	7	Now then , take and prepare ( M ) a new cart and two milk cows ( N ) on which there has never come a yoke , and yoke the cows to the cart , but take their calves home , away from them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	8	And take the ark of the Lord and place it on the cart and put in a box at its side ( O ) the figures of gold , which you are returning to him as ( P ) a guilt offering . Then send it off and let it go its way
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	9	and watch . If it goes up on the way to its own land , to ( Q ) Beth-shemesh , then it is he who has done us this great harm , but if not , then we shall know that it is not ( R ) his hand that struck us ; it happened to us by coincidence. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	10	The men did so , and took two milk cows and yoked them to the cart and shut up their calves at home .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	11	And they put the ark of the Lord on the cart and the box with the golden mice and the images of their tumors .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	12	And the cows went straight in the direction of ( S ) Beth-shemesh along ( T ) one highway , lowing as they went . They turned neither to the right nor to the left , and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of ( U ) Beth-shemesh .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	13	Now the people of ( V ) Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley . And when they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark , they rejoiced to see it .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	14	The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there . ( W ) A great stone was there . And they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	15	And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the box that was beside it , in which were the golden figures , and set them upon ( X ) the great stone . And the men of ( Y ) Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices on that day to the Lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	16	And when ( Z ) the five lords of the Philistines saw it , they returned that day to Ekron .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	17	These are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a ( AA ) guilt offering to the Lord : one for Ashdod , one for Gaza , one for Ashkelon , one for Gath , one for Ekron ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	18	and the golden mice , according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords , ( AB ) both fortified cities and unwalled villages . ( AC ) The great stone beside which they set down the ark of the Lord is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	19	( AD ) And he struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh , because they looked upon the ark of the Lord . He struck seventy men of them , [ a ] and the people mourned because the Lord had struck the people with a great blow .
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	20	Then the men of Beth-shemesh said , ( AE ) “ Who is able to stand before the Lord , this holy God ? And to whom shall he go up away from us ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	6	21	So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of ( AF ) Kiriath-jearim , saying , “ The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord . Come down and take it up to you. ” Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Samuel	8	9	Now then , obey their voice ; only you shall solemnly warn them ( H ) and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them. ” Samuel 's Warning Against Kings
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	10	So Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking for a king from him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	11	He said , ( I ) “ These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you : ( J ) he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots .
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	12	And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties , and some ( K ) to plow his ground and to reap his harvest , and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots .
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	13	He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers .
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	14	( L ) He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants .
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	15	He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants .
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	16	He will take your male servants and female servants and the best of your young men [ a ] and your donkeys , and put them to his work .
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	17	He will take the tenth of your flocks , and you shall be his slaves .
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	18	And in that day you will cry out because of your king , whom you have chosen for yourselves , ( M ) but the Lord will not answer you in that day. ” The Lord Grants Israel 's Request
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	19	But the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel . And they said , “ No ! But there shall be a king over us ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	20	( N ) that we also may be like all the nations , and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	21	And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people , he repeated them in the ears of the Lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	8	22	And the Lord said to Samuel , ( O ) “ Obey their voice and make them a king. ” Samuel then said to the men of Israel , “ Go every man to his city. ” Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Samuel	9	3	Now the donkeys of Kish , Saul 's father , were lost . So Kish said to Saul his son , “ Take one of the young men with you , and arise , go and look for the donkeys. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	9	4	And he passed through ( D ) the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of ( E ) Shalishah , but they did not find them . And they passed through the land of Shaalim , but they were not there . Then they passed through the land of Benjamin , but did not find them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	9	5	When they came to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant [ a ] who was with him , “ Come , let us go back , ( F ) lest my father cease to care about the donkeys and become anxious about us. ”

ESV	1%20Samuel	9	14	So they went up to the city . As they were entering the city , they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the high place .
ESV	1%20Samuel	9	15	Now the day before Saul came , ( N ) the Lord had ( O ) revealed to Samuel :

ESV	1%20Samuel	9	19	Samuel answered Saul , “ I am the seer . Go up before me to the high place , for today you shall eat with me , and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind .

ESV	1%20Samuel	9	21	Saul answered , “ Am I not a Benjaminite , ( T ) from the least of the tribes of Israel ? ( U ) And is not my clan the humblest of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin ? Why then have you spoken to me in this way ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	9	22	Then Samuel took Saul and his young man and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited , who were about thirty persons .
ESV	1%20Samuel	9	23	And Samuel said to the cook , “ Bring the portion I gave you , of which I said to you , ‘ Put it aside. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	9	24	So the cook took up ( V ) the leg and what was on it and set them before Saul . And Samuel said , “ See , what was kept is set before you . Eat , because it was kept for you until the hour appointed , that you might eat with the guests. ” [ e ] So Saul ate with Samuel that day .

ESV	1%20Samuel	10	14	( Y ) Saul 's uncle said to him and to his servant , “ Where did you go ? ” And he said , ( Z ) “ To seek the donkeys . And when we saw they were not to be found , we went to Samuel. ”

ESV	1%20Samuel	10	21	He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its clans , and the clan of the Matrites was taken by lot ; [ e ] and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot . But when they sought him , he could not be found .

ESV	1%20Samuel	11	2	But Nahash the Ammonite said to them , “ On this condition I will make a treaty with you , ( D ) that I gouge out all your right eyes , and thus ( E ) bring disgrace on all Israel. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	11	3	The elders of Jabesh said to him , “ Give us seven days ' respite that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel . Then , if there is no one to save us , we will give ourselves up to you. ”

ESV	1%20Samuel	11	8	When he mustered them at ( L ) Bezek , ( M ) the people of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .

ESV	1%20Samuel	14	7	And his armor-bearer said to him , “ Do all that is in your heart . Do as you wish . [ b ] Behold , I am with you heart and soul. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	8	Then Jonathan said , “ Behold , we will cross over to the men , and we will show ourselves to them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they say to us , ‘ Wait until we come to you , ’ then we will stand still in our place , and we will not go up to them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	10	But if they say , ‘ Come up to us , ’ then we will go up , for the Lord has given them into our hand . And this shall be the sign to us. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	11	So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines . And the Philistines said , “ Look , Hebrews are coming ( K ) out of the holes where they have hidden themselves. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	12	And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said , “ Come up to us , and we will show you a thing. ” And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer , “ Come up after me , for the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	13	Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet , and his armor-bearer after him . And they fell before Jonathan , and his armor-bearer killed them after him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	15	And there was a panic in the camp , in the field , and among all the people . The garrison and even ( L ) the raiders trembled , the earth quaked , and it became a very great panic . [ d ]
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked , and behold , the multitude ( M ) was dispersing here and there . [ e ]
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	17	Then Saul said to the people who were with him , “ Count and see who has gone from us. ” And when they had counted , behold , Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	18	So Saul said to Ahijah , “ Bring the ark of God here. ” For the ark of God went at that time with the people [ f ] of Israel .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	19	Now ( N ) while Saul was talking to the priest , the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more . So Saul said to the priest , “ Withdraw your hand. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	20	Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle . And behold , ( O ) every Philistine 's sword was against his fellow , and there was very great confusion .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	21	Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp , ( P ) even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	22	Likewise , when all the men of Israel ( Q ) who had hidden themselves ( R ) in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing , they too followed hard after them in the battle .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	23	( S ) So the Lord saved Israel that day . And the battle passed beyond ( T ) Beth-aven . Saul 's Rash Vow
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	24	And the men of Israel had been hard pressed that day , ( U ) so Saul had laid an oath on the people , saying , “ Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies. ” So none of the people had tasted food .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	25	Now when all the people [ g ] came to the forest , behold , there was honey on the ground .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	26	And when the people entered the forest , behold , the honey was dropping , but no one put his hand to his mouth , for the people feared the oath .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	27	But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath , ( V ) so he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth , and his eyes became bright .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	28	Then one of the people said , “ Your father strictly charged the people with an oath , saying , ‘ Cursed be the man who eats food this day. ’ ” And the people were ( W ) faint .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	29	Then Jonathan said , “ My father has troubled the land . See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	30	How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found . For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	31	They struck down the Philistines that day from ( X ) Michmash to ( Y ) Aijalon . And the people were very ( Z ) faint .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	32	The people ( AA ) pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground . And the people ate them ( AB ) with the blood .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	33	Then they told Saul , “ Behold , the people are sinning against the Lord by eating ( AC ) with the blood. ” And he said , “ You have dealt treacherously ; roll a great stone to me here. ” [ h ]
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	34	And Saul said , “ Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them , ‘ Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat , and do not sin against the Lord by eating with the blood. ’ ” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	35	And Saul ( AD ) built an altar to the Lord ; it was the first altar that he built to the Lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	36	Then Saul said , “ Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light ; let us not leave a man of them. ” And they said , “ Do whatever seems good to you. ” But ( AE ) the priest said , “ Let us draw near to God here. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	37	And Saul inquired of God , “ Shall I go down after the Philistines ? Will you give them into the hand of Israel ? ” ( AF ) But he did not answer him that day .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	38	And Saul said , “ Come here , all you leaders of the people , and know and see how this sin has arisen today .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	39	For ( AG ) as the Lord lives who saves Israel , ( AH ) though it be in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die. ” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	40	Then he said to all Israel , “ You shall be on one side , and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. ” And the people said to Saul , “ Do what seems good to you. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	41	Therefore Saul said , “ O Lord God of Israel , why have you not answered your servant this day ? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son , O Lord , God of Israel , give Urim . But if this guilt is in your people Israel , give Thummim. ” [ i ] ( AI ) And Jonathan and Saul were taken , but the people escaped .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	42	Then Saul said , ( AJ ) “ Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan. ” And Jonathan was taken .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	43	Then Saul said to Jonathan , ( AK ) “ Tell me what you have done. ” And Jonathan told him , ( AL ) “ I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand . Here I am ; I will die. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	44	And Saul said , ( AM ) “ God do so to me and more also ; ( AN ) you shall surely die , Jonathan. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	45	Then the people said to Saul , “ Shall Jonathan die , who has worked this great salvation in Israel ? Far from it ! ( AO ) As the Lord lives , ( AP ) there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground , for he has worked with God this day. ” So the people ransomed Jonathan , so that he did not die .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	46	Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines , and the Philistines went to their own place . Saul Fights Israel 's Enemies
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	47	When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel , he fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , ( AQ ) against the Ammonites , against Edom , against the kings of ( AR ) Zobah , and against the Philistines . Wherever he turned he routed them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	48	And he did valiantly ( AS ) and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	49	( AT ) Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , Ishvi , and Malchi-shua . And the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn was ( AU ) Merab , and the name of the younger Michal .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	50	And the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz . ( AV ) And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner , ( AW ) Saul 's uncle .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	51	( AX ) Kish was the father of Saul , and Ner the father of Abner was the son of ( AY ) Abiel .
ESV	1%20Samuel	14	52	There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul . And when Saul saw any strong man , or any valiant man , ( AZ ) he attached him to himself . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Samuel	15	3	Now go and strike Amalek and ( C ) devote to destruction [ a ] all that they have . Do not spare them , ( D ) but kill both man and woman , child and infant , ox and sheep , camel and donkey. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	4	So Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim , two hundred thousand men on foot , and ten thousand men of Judah .
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	5	And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley .
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	6	Then Saul said to ( E ) the Kenites , “ Go , depart ; go down from among the Amalekites , lest I destroy you with them . ( F ) For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. ” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites .
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	7	( G ) And Saul defeated the Amalekites from ( H ) Havilah as far as ( I ) Shur , which is east of Egypt .

ESV	1%20Samuel	15	10	The word of the Lord came to Samuel :
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	11	( L ) “ I regret [ c ] that I have made Saul king , for he has turned back from following me and ( M ) has not performed my commandments. ” And Samuel was angry , and he cried to the Lord all night .
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	12	And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning . And it was told Samuel , “ Saul came to ( N ) Carmel , and behold , he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	13	And Samuel came to Saul , and Saul said to him , ( O ) “ Blessed be you to the Lord . I have performed the commandment of the Lord. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	14	And Samuel said , “ What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	16	Then Samuel said to Saul , “ Stop ! I will tell you what the Lord said to me this night. ” And he said to him , “ Speak. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	17	And Samuel said , ( Q ) “ Though you are little in your own eyes , are you not the head of the tribes of Israel ? The Lord anointed you king over Israel .
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	18	,
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	19	Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord ? ( R ) Why did you pounce on the spoil and do what was evil in the sight of the Lord ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	20	,
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	21	-
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	22	And Samuel said , ( U ) “ Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices , as in obeying the voice of the Lord ? Behold , ( V ) to obey is better than sacrifice , and to listen than the fat of rams .
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	23	For rebellion is as the sin of divination , and presumption is as iniquity and ( W ) idolatry . Because ( X ) you have rejected the word of the Lord , ( Y ) he has also rejected you from being king. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	24	Saul said to Samuel , ( Z ) “ I have sinned , for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and your words , because I feared the people and obeyed their voice .
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	25	Now therefore , please pardon my sin and ( AA ) return with me that I may bow before the Lord. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	26	And Samuel said to Saul , “ I will not return with you . ( AB ) For you have rejected the word of the Lord , ( AC ) and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	27	( AD ) As Samuel turned to go away , Saul seized the skirt of his robe , and it tore .
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	28	And Samuel said to him , ( AE ) “ The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours , who is better than you .
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	29	,
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	30	Then he said , “ I have sinned ; yet ( AG ) honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel , ( AH ) and return with me , that I may bow before the Lord your God. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Samuel turned back after Saul , and Saul bowed before the Lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	32	Then Samuel said , “ Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. ” And Agag came to him cheerfully . [ d ] Agag said , “ Surely the bitterness of death is past. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	15	33	And Samuel said , ( AI ) “ As your sword has made women childless , so shall your mother be childless among women. ” And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the Lord ( AJ ) in Gilgal .

ESV	1%20Samuel	16	2	And Samuel said , “ How can I go ? If Saul hears it , he will kill me. ” And the Lord said , “ Take a heifer with you and say , ( E ) ‘ I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. ’
ESV	1%20Samuel	16	3	And invite Jesse to the sacrifice , and I will show you what you shall do . ( F ) And you shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	16	4	Samuel did what the Lord commanded and came to Bethlehem . The elders of the city ( G ) came to meet him trembling and said , ( H ) “ Do you come peaceably ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	16	5	And he said , “ Peaceably ; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord . ( I ) Consecrate yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice. ” And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice .
ESV	1%20Samuel	16	6	When they came , he looked on ( J ) Eliab and thought , “ Surely the Lord 's anointed is before him. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	16	7	But the Lord said to Samuel , ( K ) “ Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature , because I have rejected him . For the Lord sees not as man sees : man looks on the outward appearance , ( L ) but the Lord looks on the heart. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	16	8	Then Jesse called ( M ) Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel . And he said , “ Neither has the Lord chosen this one. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	16	9	Then Jesse made ( N ) Shammah pass by . And he said , “ Neither has the Lord chosen this one. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	16	10	And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel . And Samuel said to Jesse , “ The Lord has not chosen these. ”

ESV	1%20Samuel	16	12	And he sent and brought him in . Now he was ( Q ) ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome . And the Lord said , ( R ) “ Arise , anoint him , for this is he. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	16	13	Then Samuel took ( S ) the horn of oil ( T ) and anointed him in the midst of his brothers . ( U ) And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward . And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah . David in Saul 's Service

ESV	1%20Samuel	16	20	( AC ) And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by David his son to Saul .

ESV	1%20Samuel	17	24	All the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him and were much afraid .
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	25	And the men of Israel said , “ Have you seen this man who has come up ? Surely he has come up to ( AA ) defy Israel . And the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches ( AB ) and will give him his daughter and make his father 's house free in Israel. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	26	And David said to the men who stood by him , “ What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away ( AC ) the reproach from Israel ? For who is this ( AD ) uncircumcised Philistine , that he should ( AE ) defy the armies of ( AF ) the living God ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	27	And the people answered him in the same way , ( AG ) “ So shall it be done to the man who kills him. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	28	Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men . And Eliab 's anger was kindled against David , and he said , “ Why have you come down ?

ESV	1%20Samuel	17	49	And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead . The stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the ground .
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and struck the Philistine and killed him . There was no sword in the hand of David .
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	51	Then David ran and stood over the Philistine ( AY ) and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it . When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , ( AZ ) they fled .
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	52	And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath [ f ] and the gates of ( BA ) Ekron , so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from ( BB ) Shaaraim as far as ( BC ) Gath and Ekron .
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	53	And the people of Israel came back from chasing the Philistines , and they plundered their camp .
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	54	And David took ( BD ) the head of the Philistine ( BE ) and brought it to Jerusalem , but he put his armor in his tent .
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	55	As soon as Saul saw David go out against the Philistine , he said to Abner , ( BF ) the commander of the army , “ Abner , ( BG ) whose son is this youth ? ” And Abner said , ( BH ) “ As your soul lives , O king , I do not know. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	56	And the king said , “ Inquire whose son the boy is. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	57	And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine , Abner took him , and brought him before Saul ( BI ) with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
ESV	1%20Samuel	17	58	And Saul said to him , “ Whose son are you , young man ? ” And David answered , ( BJ ) “ I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite. ” Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Samuel	18	1	Samuel 18:21 Hebrew by two The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	18	And David said to Saul , ( Z ) “ Who am I , and who are my relatives , my father 's clan in Israel , that I should be son-in-law to the king ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	2	And Saul took him that day ( B ) and would not let him return to his father 's house .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	3	Then Jonathan made a covenant with David , because ( C ) he loved him as his own soul .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	4	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David , and his armor , and even his sword and his bow and his belt .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	5	And David went out ( D ) and was successful wherever Saul sent him , so that Saul set him over the men of war . And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul 's servants . Saul 's Jealousy of David
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	6	As they were coming home , when David returned from striking down the Philistine , ( E ) the women came out of all the cities of Israel , singing and dancing , to meet King Saul , with tambourines , with songs of joy , and with musical instruments . [ a ]
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	7	And the women ( F ) sang to one another as they celebrated , ( G ) “ Saul has struck down his thousands , and David his ten thousands. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	8	And Saul was very angry , and this saying displeased him . He said , “ They have ascribed to David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed thousands , and what more can he have but ( H ) the kingdom ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	9	And Saul eyed David from that day on .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	10	The next day ( I ) a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul , and ( J ) he raved within his house while David was ( K ) playing the lyre , as he did day by day . ( L ) Saul had his spear in his hand .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	11	And Saul ( M ) hurled the spear , for he thought , “ I will pin David to the wall. ” But David evaded him twice .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	12	( N ) Saul was afraid of David because ( O ) the Lord was with him ( P ) but had departed from Saul .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	13	So Saul removed him from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand . ( Q ) And he went out and came in before the people .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	14	And David ( R ) had success in all his undertakings , ( S ) for the Lord was with him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	15	And when Saul saw that ( T ) he had great success , he stood in fearful awe of him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	16	( U ) But all Israel and Judah loved David , for he went out and came in before them . David Marries Michal
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	17	Then Saul said to David , “ Here is ( V ) my elder daughter Merab . ( W ) I will give her to you for a wife . Only be valiant for me ( X ) and fight the Lord 's battles. ” For Saul thought , “ Let not my hand be against him , ( Y ) but let the hand of the Philistines be against him. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	19	But at the time when Merab , Saul 's daughter , should have been given to David , she was given to ( AA ) Adriel the ( AB ) Meholathite for a wife .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	20	Now ( AC ) Saul 's daughter Michal ( AD ) loved David . And they told Saul , and the thing pleased him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	21	Saul thought , “ Let me give her to him , that she may ( AE ) be a snare for him ( AF ) and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. ” Therefore Saul said to David a second time , [ b ] ( AG ) “ You shall now be my son-in-law. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	22	And Saul commanded his servants , “ Speak to David in private and say , ‘ Behold , the king has delight in you , and all his servants love you . Now then become the king 's son-in-law. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	23	And Saul 's servants spoke those words in the ears of David . And David said , ( AH ) “ Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king 's son-in-law , since I am a poor man and have no reputation ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	24	And the servants of Saul told him , “ Thus and so did David speak. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	25	Then Saul said , “ Thus shall you say to David , ‘ The king desires no ( AI ) bride-price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines , ( AJ ) that he may be avenged of the king 's enemies. ’ ” ( AK ) Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	26	And when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son-in-law . ( AL ) Before the time had expired ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	27	David arose and went , ( AM ) along with his men , and killed two hundred of the Philistines . ( AN ) And David brought their foreskins , which were given in full number to the king , that he might become the king 's son-in-law . And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	28	But when Saul saw and knew that ( AO ) the Lord was with David , ( AP ) and that Michal , Saul 's daughter , loved him ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	29	Saul was even more afraid of David . So Saul was David 's enemy continually .
ESV	1%20Samuel	18	30	( AQ ) Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle , and as often as they came out ( AR ) David had more success than all the servants of Saul , so that his name was highly esteemed . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Samuel	19	1	Samuel 19:13 Or a household god The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	19	And it was told Saul , “ Behold , David is at Naioth in Ramah. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	2	And Jonathan told David , “ Saul my father seeks to kill you . Therefore be on your guard in the morning . Stay in a secret place and hide yourself .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	3	And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will speak to my father about you . And if I learn anything I will tell you. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	4	And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him , “ Let not the king ( B ) sin against his servant David , because he has not sinned against you , and because his deeds have brought good to you .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	5	For ( C ) he took his life in his hand ( D ) and he struck down the Philistine , ( E ) and the Lord worked a great salvation for all Israel . You saw it , and rejoiced . Why then will you sin against ( F ) innocent blood by killing David without cause ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	6	And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan . Saul swore , ( G ) “ As the Lord lives , he shall not be put to death. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	7	And Jonathan called David , and Jonathan reported to him all these things . And Jonathan brought David to Saul , and he was in his presence ( H ) as before .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	8	And there was war again . And David went out and fought with the Philistines and struck them with a great blow , so that they fled before him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	9	( I ) Then a harmful spirit from the Lord came upon Saul , as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand . ( J ) And David was playing the lyre .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	10	( K ) And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear , but he eluded Saul , so that he struck the spear into the wall . And David fled and escaped that night .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	11	( L ) Saul sent messengers to David 's house to watch him , that he might kill him in the morning . But Michal , David 's wife , told him , “ If you do not escape with your life tonight , tomorrow you will be killed. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	12	( M ) So Michal let David down through the window , and he fled away and escaped .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	13	Michal took ( N ) an image [ a ] and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of goats ' hair at its head and covered it with the clothes .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	14	And when Saul sent messengers to take David , she said , “ He is sick. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	15	Then Saul sent the messengers to see David , saying , “ Bring him up to me in the bed , that I may kill him. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	16	And when the messengers came in , behold , ( O ) the image was in the bed , with the pillow of goats ' hair at its head .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	17	Saul said to Michal , “ Why have you deceived me thus and let my enemy go , so that he has escaped ? ” And Michal answered Saul , “ He said to me , ‘ Let me go . ( P ) Why should I kill you ? ’ ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	18	Now David fled and escaped , and he came to Samuel at ( Q ) Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him . And he and Samuel went and lived at Naioth .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	20	Then Saul sent messengers to take David , and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying , and Samuel standing as head over them , ( R ) the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul , ( S ) and they also prophesied .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	21	When it was told Saul , he sent other messengers , ( T ) and they also prophesied . And Saul sent messengers again the third time , ( U ) and they also prophesied .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	22	Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great well that is in Secu . And he asked , “ Where are Samuel and David ? ” And one said , “ Behold , they are at Naioth in ( V ) Ramah. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	23	And he went there to Naioth in Ramah . ( W ) And the Spirit of God came upon him also , and as he went he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah .
ESV	1%20Samuel	19	24	( X ) And he too stripped off his clothes , and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night . Thus it is said , ( Y ) “ Is Saul also among the prophets ? ” Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Samuel	20	1	Samuel 20:42 This sentence is 21:1 in Hebrew The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	20	And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it , as though I shot at a mark .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	2	And he said to him , “ Far from it ! You shall not die . Behold , my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me . And why should my father hide this from me ? It is not so. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	3	But David vowed again , saying , “ Your father knows well that ( B ) I have found favor in your eyes , and he thinks , ‘ Do not let Jonathan know this , lest he be grieved. ’ But truly , ( C ) as the Lord lives and ( D ) as your soul lives , there is but a step between me and death. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	4	Then Jonathan said to David , “ Whatever you say , I will do for you. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	5	David said to Jonathan , “ Behold , tomorrow is ( E ) the new moon , and I should not fail to sit at table with the king . But let me go , ( F ) that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	6	( G ) If your father misses me at all , then say , ‘ David earnestly asked leave of me to run ( H ) to Bethlehem his city , for there is a yearly ( I ) sacrifice there for all the clan. ’
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	7	If he says , ‘ Good ! ’ it will be well with your servant , but if he is angry , then know that ( J ) harm is determined by him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	8	Therefore deal kindly with your servant , ( K ) for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with you . ( L ) But if there is guilt in me , kill me yourself , for why should you bring me to your father ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	9	And Jonathan said , “ Far be it from you ! If I knew that ( M ) it was determined by my father that harm should come to you , would I not tell you ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	10	Then David said to Jonathan , “ Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	11	And Jonathan said to David , “ Come , let us go out into the field. ” So they both went out into the field .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	12	And Jonathan said to David , “ The Lord , the God of Israel , be witness ! [ a ] When I have sounded out my father , about this time tomorrow , or the third day , behold , if he is well disposed toward David , shall I not then send and disclose it to you ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	13	But should it please my father to do you harm , ( N ) the Lord do so to Jonathan and more also if I do not disclose it to you and send you away , that you may go in safety . ( O ) May the Lord be with you , as he has been with my father .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	14	If I am still alive , show me the steadfast love of the Lord , that I may not die ;
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	15	( P ) and do not cut off [ b ] your steadfast love from my house forever , when the Lord cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	16	And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David , saying , ( Q ) “ May [ c ] the Lord take vengeance on David 's enemies. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	17	And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him , ( R ) for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	18	Then Jonathan said to him , ( S ) “ Tomorrow is the new moon , and ( T ) you will be missed , because ( U ) your seat will be empty .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	19	On the third day go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand , and remain beside the stone heap . [ d ]
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	21	And behold , I will send the boy , saying , ‘ Go , find the arrows. ’ If I say to the boy , ‘ Look , the arrows are on this side of you , take them , ’ then you are to come , for , ( V ) as the Lord lives , it is safe for you and there is no danger .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	22	But if I say to the youth , ( W ) ‘ Look , the arrows are beyond you , ’ then go , for the Lord has sent you away .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	23	( X ) And as for the matter of which you and I have spoken , behold , ( Y ) the Lord is between you and me forever. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	24	So David hid himself in the field . And when the new moon came , the king sat down to eat food .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	25	The king sat on his seat , as at other times , on the seat by the wall . Jonathan sat opposite , [ e ] and Abner sat by Saul 's side , ( Z ) but David 's place was empty .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	26	Yet Saul did not say anything that day , for he thought , “ Something has happened to him . ( AA ) He is not clean ; surely he is not clean. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	27	But on ( AB ) the second day , the day after the new moon , ( AC ) David 's place was empty . And Saul said to Jonathan his son , “ Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal , either yesterday or today ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	28	Jonathan answered Saul , ( AD ) “ David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	29	He said , ‘ Let me go , for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city , and my brother has commanded me to be there . So now , if I have found favor in your eyes , let me get away and see my brothers. ’ For this reason he has not come to the king 's table. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	30	Then Saul 's anger was kindled against Jonathan , and he said to him , “ You son of a perverse , rebellious woman , do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame , and to the shame of your mother 's nakedness ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth , neither you nor your kingdom shall be established . Therefore send and bring him to me , for he shall surely die. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	32	Then Jonathan answered Saul his father , ( AE ) “ Why should he be put to death ? What has he done ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	33	( AF ) But Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him . So Jonathan knew ( AG ) that his father was determined to put David to death .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	34	And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month , for he was grieved for David , because his father had disgraced him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	35	In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David , and with him a little boy .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	36	And he said to his boy , “ Run and find the arrows that I shoot. ” As the boy ran , he shot an arrow beyond him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	37	And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot , Jonathan called after the boy and said , ( AH ) “ Is not the arrow beyond you ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	38	And Jonathan called after the boy , “ Hurry ! Be quick ! Do not stay ! ” So Jonathan 's boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	39	But the boy knew nothing . Only Jonathan and David knew the matter .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	40	And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him , “ Go and carry them to the city. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	41	And as soon as the boy had gone , David rose from beside the stone heap [ f ] and fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times . And they kissed one another and wept with one another , David weeping the most .
ESV	1%20Samuel	20	42	Then Jonathan said to David , ( AI ) “ Go in peace , because we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord , saying , ( AJ ) ‘ The Lord shall be between me and you , ( AK ) and between my offspring and your offspring , forever. ’ ” And he rose and departed , and Jonathan went into the city .

ESV	1%20Samuel	21	21	[ a ] Then David came to ( A ) Nob , to ( B ) Ahimelech the priest . And Ahimelech ( C ) came to meet David , trembling , and said to him , “ Why are you alone , and no one with you ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	2	And David said to Ahimelech the priest , “ The king has charged me with a matter and said to me , ‘ Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you , and with which I have charged you. ’ I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place .
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	3	Now then , what do you have on hand ? Give me five loaves of bread , or whatever is here. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	4	And the priest answered David , “ I have no common bread on hand , but there is ( D ) holy bread— ( E ) if the young men have kept themselves from women. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	5	And David answered the priest , “ Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition . The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey . How much more today will their vessels be holy ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	6	So the priest gave him ( F ) the holy bread , for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence , ( G ) which is removed from before the Lord , to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away .
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before the Lord . His name was ( H ) Doeg the Edomite , the chief of Saul 's herdsmen .
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	8	Then David said to Ahimelech , “ Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand ? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me , because the king 's business required haste. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	9	And the priest said , ( I ) “ The sword of Goliath the Philistine , whom you struck down in ( J ) the Valley of Elah , behold , it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod . If you will take that , take it , for there is none but that here. ” And David said , “ There is none like that ; give it to me. ” David Flees to Gath
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	10	And David rose and fled that day from Saul and went to ( K ) Achish the king of Gath .
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	11	And the servants of Achish said to him , “ Is not this David the king of the land ? ( L ) Did they not sing to one another of him in dances , ‘ Saul has struck down his thousands , and David his ten thousands ’ ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	12	And David ( M ) took these words to heart and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath .
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	13	So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands and made marks on the doors of the gate and let his spittle run down his beard .
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	14	Then Achish said to his servants , “ Behold , you see the man is mad . Why then have you brought him to me ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	21	15	Do I lack madmen , that you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence ? Shall this fellow come into my house ? ” Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Samuel	22	22	And David said to Abiathar , “ I knew on that day , ( X ) when Doeg the Edomite was there , that he would surely tell Saul . I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father 's house .
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	2	( C ) And everyone who was in distress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was bitter in soul , [ a ] gathered to him . And he became commander over them . And there were with him ( D ) about four hundred men .
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	3	And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab . And he said to the king of Moab , “ Please let my father and my mother stay [ b ] with you , till I know what God will do for me. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	4	And he left them with the king of Moab , and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold .
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	5	Then the prophet ( E ) Gad said to David , “ Do not remain in the stronghold ; depart , and go into the land of Judah. ” So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth . Saul Kills the Priests at Nob
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	6	Now Saul heard that David was discovered , and the men who were with him . Saul was sitting at Gibeah under ( F ) the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	7	And Saul said to his servants who stood about him , “ Hear now , people of Benjamin ; will the son of Jesse ( G ) give every one of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	8	that all of you have conspired against me ? No one discloses to me ( H ) when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse . None of you ( I ) is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me , ( J ) to lie in wait , as at this day. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	9	Then answered ( K ) Doeg the Edomite , who stood by the servants of Saul , “ I saw the son of Jesse ( L ) coming to Nob , to ( M ) Ahimelech the son of Ahitub ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	10	( N ) and he inquired of the Lord for him and ( O ) gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	11	Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests who were at Nob , and all of them came to the king .
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	12	And Saul said , “ Hear now , son of Ahitub. ” And he answered , “ Here I am , my lord. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	13	And Saul said to him , “ Why have you conspired against me , you and the son of Jesse , in that you have given him bread and a sword and ( P ) have inquired of God for him , so that he has risen against me , ( Q ) to lie in wait , as at this day ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	14	Then Ahimelech answered the king , “ And who among all your servants is so faithful as David , who is the king 's son-in-law , and captain over [ c ] your bodyguard , and honored in your house ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	15	Is today the first time ( R ) that I have inquired of God for him ? No ! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father , for your servant has known nothing of all this , ( S ) much or little. ”

ESV	1%20Samuel	22	17	And the king said to ( T ) the guard who stood about him , “ Turn and kill the priests of the Lord , because their hand also is with David , and they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me. ” But the servants of the king would not put out their hand to strike the priests of the Lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	18	Then the king said to Doeg , “ You turn and strike the priests. ” And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests , ( U ) and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod .
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	19	And Nob , the city of the priests , he put to the sword ; ( V ) both man and woman , child and infant , ox , donkey and sheep , he put to the sword .
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	20	But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub , named ( W ) Abiathar , escaped and fled after David .
ESV	1%20Samuel	22	21	And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord .

ESV	1%20Samuel	23	23	See therefore and take note of all the lurking places where he hides , and come back to me with sure information . Then I will go with you . And if he is in the land , I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	2	Therefore David ( B ) inquired of the Lord , “ Shall I go and attack these Philistines ? ” And the Lord said to David , “ Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	3	But David 's men said to him , “ Behold , we are afraid here in Judah ; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	4	Then David ( C ) inquired of the Lord again . And the Lord answered him , “ Arise , go down to Keilah , ( D ) for I will give the Philistines into your hand. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	5	And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and brought away their livestock and struck them with a great blow . So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	6	( E ) When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech had fled to David to Keilah , he had come down with an ephod in his hand .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	7	Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah . And Saul said , “ God has given him into my hand , for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	8	And Saul summoned all the people to war , to go down to Keilah , to besiege David and his men .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	9	David knew that Saul was plotting harm against him . And he said to Abiathar the priest , ( F ) “ Bring the ephod here. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	10	Then David said , “ O Lord , the God of Israel , your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah , to destroy the city on my account .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand ? Will Saul come down , as your servant has heard ? O Lord , the God of Israel , please tell your servant. ” And the Lord said , “ He will come down. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	12	Then David said , “ Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul ? ” And the Lord said , ( G ) “ They will surrender you. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	13	Then David and his men , ( H ) who were about six hundred , arose and departed from Keilah , and they went ( I ) wherever they could go . When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah , he gave up the expedition .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	14	And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness , in the hill country ( J ) of the wilderness of ( K ) Ziph . And Saul sought him every day , but God did not give him into his hand . Saul Pursues David
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	15	David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life . David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	16	And Jonathan , Saul 's son , rose and went to David at Horesh , and strengthened his hand in God .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	17	And he said to him , “ Do not fear , for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you . You shall be king over Israel , and I shall be next to you . ( L ) Saul my father also knows this. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	18	( M ) And the two of them made a covenant before the Lord . David remained at Horesh , and Jonathan went home .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	19	( N ) Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah , saying , “ Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh , on the hill of Hachilah , which is south of ( O ) Jeshimon ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	20	Now come down , O king , according to all your heart 's desire to come down , ( P ) and our part shall be to surrender him into the king 's hand. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	21	And Saul said , ( Q ) “ May you be blessed by the Lord , ( R ) for you have had compassion on me .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	22	Go , make yet more sure . Know and see the place where his foot is , and who has seen him there , for it is told me that he is very cunning .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	24	And they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul . Now David and his men were ( S ) in the wilderness of Maon , ( T ) in the Arabah to the south of ( U ) Jeshimon .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	25	And Saul and his men went to seek him . And David was told , so he went down to the rock and lived in the wilderness of Maon . And when Saul heard that , he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon .
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	26	Saul went on one side of the mountain , and David and his men on the other side of the mountain . And David was hurrying to get away from Saul . As Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	27	a messenger came to Saul , saying , “ Hurry and come , for the Philistines have made a raid against the land. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	23	28	So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines . Therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape . [ a ]

ESV	1%20Samuel	24	24	[ a ] ( A ) When Saul returned from following the Philistines , he was told , “ Behold , David is in the wilderness of Engedi. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	2	Then Saul took ( B ) three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats ' Rocks .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	3	And he came to the sheepfolds by the way , where there was a cave , and Saul went in ( C ) to relieve himself . [ b ] Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts ( D ) of the cave .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	4	And the men of David said to him , ( E ) “ Here is the day of which the Lord said to you , ‘ Behold , I will give your enemy into your hand , and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you. ’ ” Then David arose and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul 's robe .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	5	And afterward ( F ) David 's heart struck him , because he had cut off a corner of Saul 's robe .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	6	He said to his men , ( G ) “ The Lord forbid that I should do this thing to my lord , the Lord 's anointed , to put out my hand against him , seeing he is ( H ) the Lord 's anointed. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	7	So David persuaded his men with these words ( I ) and did not permit them to attack Saul . And Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	8	Afterward David also arose and went out of the cave , and called after Saul , “ My lord the king ! ” And when Saul looked behind him , David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	9	And David said to Saul , “ Why do you listen to the words of men who say , ‘ Behold , David seeks your harm ’ ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	10	Behold , this day your eyes have seen how the Lord gave you today into my hand in the cave . ( J ) And some told me to kill you , but I spared you . [ c ] I said , ‘ I will not put out my hand against my lord , ( K ) for he is the Lord 's anointed. ’
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	11	See , my father , see the corner of your robe in my hand . For by the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you , you may know and see that ( L ) there is no wrong or treason in my hands . I have not sinned against you , though ( M ) you hunt my life to take it .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	12	( N ) May the Lord judge between me and you , may the Lord avenge me against you , but my hand shall not be against you .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	13	As the proverb of the ancients says , ‘ Out of the wicked comes wickedness. ’ But my hand shall not be against you .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	14	After whom has the king of Israel come out ? After whom do you pursue ? ( O ) After a dead dog ! ( P ) After a flea !
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	15	( Q ) May the Lord therefore be judge and give sentence between me and you , and see to it and ( R ) plead my cause and deliver me from your hand. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	16	As soon as David had finished speaking these words to Saul , Saul said , ( S ) “ Is this your voice , my son David ? ” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	17	He said to David , “ You are more righteous than I , ( T ) for you have repaid me good , whereas I have repaid you evil .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	18	And you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me , in that you did not kill me when the Lord put me into your hands .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	19	For if a man finds his enemy , will he let him go away safe ? So may the Lord reward you with good for what you have done to me this day .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	20	And now , behold , ( U ) I know that you shall surely be king , and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand .
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	21	( V ) Swear to me therefore by the Lord that you will not cut off my offspring after me , and ( W ) that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	24	22	And David swore this to Saul . Then Saul went home , but David and his men went up ( X ) to the stronghold . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Samuel	25	1	Samuel 25:30 Or leader The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	25	Let not my lord regard ( AE ) this worthless fellow , Nabal , for as his name is , so is he . Nabal [ c ] is his name , and folly is with him . But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord , whom you sent .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	2	And there was a man in ( F ) Maon whose business was in ( G ) Carmel . The man was very rich ; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats . ( H ) He was shearing his sheep in Carmel .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	3	Now the name of the man was Nabal , and the name of his wife Abigail . The woman was discerning and beautiful , but the man was harsh and badly behaved ; ( I ) he was a Calebite .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	4	David heard in the wilderness that Nabal ( J ) was shearing his sheep .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	5	So David sent ten young men . And David said to the young men , “ Go up to Carmel , and go to Nabal and greet him in my name .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	6	And thus you shall greet him : ( K ) ‘ Peace be to you , and peace be to your house , and peace be to all that you have .

ESV	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask your young men , and they will tell you . Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes , for we come ( M ) on a feast day . Please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	9	When David 's young men came , they said all this to Nabal in the name of David , and then they waited .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	10	And Nabal answered David 's servants , ( N ) “ Who is David ? Who is the son of Jesse ? ( O ) There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	11	Shall I take ( P ) my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers and give it to ( Q ) men who come from I do not know where ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	12	So David 's young men turned away and came back and told him all this .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	13	And David said to his men , “ Every man strap on his sword ! ” And every man of them strapped on his sword . David also strapped on his sword . And ( R ) about four hundred men went up after David , ( S ) while two hundred ( T ) remained with the baggage .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	14	But one of the young men told Abigail , Nabal 's wife , “ Behold , David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master , and he railed at them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	15	Yet the men were very good to us , and we suffered no harm , ( U ) and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields , as long as we went with them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	16	They were ( V ) a wall to us both by night and by day , all the while we were with them keeping the sheep .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	17	Now therefore know this and consider what you should do , ( W ) for harm is determined against our master and against all his house , and he is such ( X ) a worthless man that one can not speak to him. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	18	Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two skins of wine and five sheep already prepared and five seahs [ a ] of parched grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs , and laid them on donkeys .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	19	And she said to her young men , “ Go on before me ; behold , I come after you. ” But she did not tell her husband Nabal .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	20	And as she rode on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain , behold , David and his men came down toward her , and she met them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	21	Now David had said , “ Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness , ( Y ) so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him , and he has ( Z ) returned me evil for good .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	22	( AA ) God do so to the enemies of David [ b ] and more also , if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	23	When Abigail saw David , she hurried ( AB ) and got down from the donkey ( AC ) and fell before David on her face and bowed to the ground .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	24	She fell at his feet and said , ( AD ) “ On me alone , my lord , be the guilt . Please let your servant speak in your ears , and hear the words of your servant .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	26	Now then , my lord , ( AF ) as the Lord lives , and as your soul lives , because ( AG ) the Lord has restrained you from bloodguilt and from ( AH ) saving with your own hand , now then ( AI ) let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	27	And now let this ( AJ ) present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	28	Please forgive the trespass of your servant . For the Lord will certainly make my lord ( AK ) a sure house , because my lord ( AL ) is fighting the battles of the Lord , and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	29	If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life , the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the Lord your God . And the lives of your enemies ( AM ) he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	30	And when the Lord has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you and has appointed you prince [ d ] over Israel ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	31	my lord shall have no cause of grief or pangs of conscience for having shed blood without cause or for my lord ( AN ) working salvation himself . And when the Lord has dealt well with my lord , then remember your servant. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	32	And David said to Abigail , ( AO ) “ Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , who sent you this day to meet me !
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	33	Blessed be your discretion , and blessed be you , ( AP ) who have kept me this day from bloodguilt ( AQ ) and from working salvation with my own hand !
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	34	For as surely ( AR ) as the Lord , the God of Israel , lives , ( AS ) who has restrained me from hurting you , unless you had hurried and come to meet me , truly by morning there had not been left to Nabal so much as one male. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	35	Then David received from her hand what she had brought him . And he said to her , ( AT ) “ Go up in peace to your house . See , I have obeyed your voice , and I have granted your petition. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	36	And Abigail came to Nabal , and behold , ( AU ) he was holding a feast in his house , like the feast of a king . And Nabal 's heart ( AV ) was merry within him , for he was very drunk . So she told him nothing ( AW ) at all until the morning light .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	37	In the morning , when the wine had gone out of Nabal , his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	38	And about ten days later ( AX ) the Lord struck Nabal , and he died .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	39	When David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , ( AY ) “ Blessed be the Lord who has ( AZ ) avenged the insult I received at the hand of Nabal , ( BA ) and has kept back his servant from wrongdoing . ( BB ) The Lord has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head. ” Then David sent and ( BC ) spoke to Abigail , to take her as his wife .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	40	When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel , they said to her , “ David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	41	And she rose ( BD ) and bowed with her face to the ground and said , “ Behold , your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	42	And Abigail hurried and rose and mounted a donkey , and her five young women attended her . She followed the messengers of David and became his wife .
ESV	1%20Samuel	25	43	David also took Ahinoam of ( BE ) Jezreel , ( BF ) and both of them became his wives .

ESV	1%20Samuel	26	1	Samuel
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	26	( A ) Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah , saying , “ Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah , which is on the east of Jeshimon ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	2	So Saul arose and went down to ( B ) the wilderness of Ziph with ( C ) three thousand chosen men of Israel to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	3	And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah , which is beside the road on the east of Jeshimon . But David remained in the wilderness . When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	4	David sent out spies and learned that Saul had indeed come .
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	5	Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped . And David saw the place where Saul lay , with ( D ) Abner the son of Ner , the commander of his army . Saul was lying within ( E ) the encampment , while the army was encamped around him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	6	Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite , and to Joab 's brother ( F ) Abishai the son of Zeruiah , ( G ) “ Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul ? ” And Abishai said , “ I will go down with you. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	7	So David and Abishai went to the army by night . And there lay Saul sleeping within ( H ) the encampment , with his spear stuck in the ground ( I ) at his head , and Abner and the army lay around him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	8	Then Abishai said to David , ( J ) “ God has given your enemy into your hand this day . Now please let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear , and I will not strike him twice. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	9	But David said to Abishai , “ Do not destroy him , for who can put out his hand ( K ) against the Lord 's anointed and be guiltless ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	10	And David said , ( L ) “ As the Lord lives , ( M ) the Lord will strike him , or ( N ) his day will come to die , ( O ) or he will go down into battle and perish .
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	11	( P ) The Lord forbid that I should put out my hand against the Lord 's anointed . But take now the spear that is ( Q ) at his head and the jar of water , and let us go. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul 's head , and they went away . No man saw it or knew it , nor did any awake , for they were all asleep , because ( R ) a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	13	Then David went over to the other side and stood far off on the top of the hill , with a great space between them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	14	And David called to the army , and to Abner the son of Ner , saying , “ Will you not answer , Abner ? ” Then Abner answered , “ Who are you who calls to the king ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	15	And David said to Abner , “ Are you not a man ? Who is like you in Israel ? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king ? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord .
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	16	This thing that you have done is not good . ( S ) As the Lord lives , you deserve to die , because you have not kept watch over your lord , the Lord 's anointed . And now see where the king 's spear is and the jar of water that was ( T ) at his head. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	17	Saul recognized David 's voice and said , ( U ) “ Is this your voice , my son David ? ” And David said , “ It is my voice , my lord , O king. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	18	And he said , ( V ) “ Why does my lord pursue after his servant ? For what have I done ? What evil is on my hands ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	19	Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant . If it is the Lord who has stirred you up against me , may he accept an offering , but if it is men , may they be cursed before the Lord , ( W ) for they have driven me out this day that I should have no share in ( X ) the heritage of the Lord , saying , ‘ Go , serve other gods. ’
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	20	Now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the Lord , for the king of Israel has come out to seek ( Y ) a single flea like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	21	Then Saul said , ( Z ) “ I have sinned . Return , my son David , for I will no more do you harm , because my life was precious in your eyes this day . Behold , I have acted foolishly , and have made a great mistake. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	22	And David answered and said , “ Here is the spear , O king ! Let one of the young men come over and take it .
ESV	1%20Samuel	26	23	( AA ) The Lord rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness , for the Lord gave you into my hand today , and I would not put out my hand against the Lord 's anointed .

ESV	1%20Samuel	26	25	Then Saul said to David , “ Blessed be you , my son David ! You will do many things and will ( AB ) succeed in them. ” So David went his way , and Saul returned to his place . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	1%20Samuel	27	27	Then David said in his heart , “ Now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul . There is nothing better for me than that I should escape to the land of the Philistines . Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel , and I shall escape out of his hand. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	2	So David arose and went over , he and ( A ) the six hundred men who were with him , ( B ) to Achish the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	3	And David lived with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , and David with ( C ) his two wives , Ahinoam of Jezreel , and Abigail of Carmel , Nabal 's widow .
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	4	And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath , he no longer sought him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	5	Then David said to Achish , “ If ( D ) I have found favor in your eyes , let a place be given me in one of the country towns , that I may dwell there . For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	6	So that day Achish gave him ( E ) Ziklag . Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day .
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	7	( F ) And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months .
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	8	Now David ( G ) and his men went up and made raids against ( H ) the Geshurites , ( I ) the Girzites , and ( J ) the Amalekites , for these were the inhabitants of the land from of old , ( K ) as far as Shur , to the land of Egypt .
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	9	And David would strike the land and would leave neither man nor woman alive , but would take away the sheep , the oxen , the donkeys , the camels , and the garments , and come back to Achish .
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	10	When Achish asked , “ Where have you ( L ) made a raid today ? ” David would say , “ Against the Negeb of Judah , ” or , “ Against the Negeb of ( M ) the Jerahmeelites , ” or , “ Against the Negeb of ( N ) the Kenites. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	11	And David would leave neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath , thinking , “ lest they should tell about us and say , ‘ So David has done. ’ ” Such was his custom all the while he lived in the country of the Philistines .
ESV	1%20Samuel	27	12	And Achish trusted David , thinking , “ He has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel ; therefore he shall always be my servant. ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	1%20Samuel	28	1	Samuel
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	28	In those days ( A ) the Philistines gathered their forces for war , to fight against Israel . And Achish said to David , “ Understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	2	David said to Achish , “ Very well , you shall know what your servant can do. ” And Achish said to David , “ Very well , I will make you my bodyguard for life. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	3	Now ( B ) Samuel had died , and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him ( C ) in Ramah , his own city . And Saul had put ( D ) the mediums and the necromancers out of the land .
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	4	The Philistines assembled and came and encamped ( E ) at Shunem . And Saul gathered all Israel , and they encamped ( F ) at Gilboa .
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	5	When Saul saw the army of the Philistines , he was afraid , and his heart trembled greatly .
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	6	And when Saul inquired of the Lord , ( G ) the Lord did not answer him , either ( H ) by dreams , or ( I ) by Urim , or by prophets .
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	7	Then Saul said to his servants , ( J ) “ Seek out for me a woman who is a medium , that I may go to her and inquire of her. ” And his servants said to him , “ Behold , there is a medium at ( K ) En-dor. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	8	So Saul ( L ) disguised himself and put on other garments and went , he and two men with him . And they came to the woman by night . And he said , ( M ) “ Divine for me by a spirit and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	9	The woman said to him , “ Surely you know what Saul has done , ( N ) how he has cut off the mediums and the necromancers from the land . Why then are you laying a trap for my life to bring about my death ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	10	But Saul swore to her by the Lord , ( O ) “ As the Lord lives , no punishment shall come upon you for this thing. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	11	Then the woman said , “ Whom shall I bring up for you ? ” He said , “ Bring up Samuel for me. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	12	When the woman saw Samuel , she cried out with a loud voice . And the woman said to Saul , “ Why have you deceived me ? You are Saul. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	13	The king said to her , “ Do not be afraid . What do you see ? ” And the woman said to Saul , “ I see a god coming up out of the earth. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	14	He said to her , “ What is his appearance ? ” And she said , “ An old man is coming up , and he is wrapped ( P ) in a robe. ” And Saul knew that it was Samuel , and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage .
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	15	Then Samuel said to Saul , “ Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up ? ” Saul answered , “ I am in great distress , for the Philistines are warring against me , and ( Q ) God has turned away from me and ( R ) answers me no more , either by prophets or by dreams . Therefore I have summoned you to tell me what I shall do. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	16	And Samuel said , “ Why then do you ask me , since the Lord has turned from you and become your enemy ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	17	The Lord has done to you as he spoke by me , for ( S ) the Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor , David .
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	18	( T ) Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek , therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day .
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	19	Moreover , the Lord will give Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines , and tomorrow you ( U ) and your sons shall be with me . The Lord will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	20	Then Saul fell at once full length on the ground , filled with fear because of the words of Samuel . And there was no strength in him , for he had eaten nothing all day and all night .
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	21	And the woman came to Saul , and when she saw that he was terrified , she said to him , “ Behold , your servant has obeyed you . ( V ) I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to what you have said to me .
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	22	Now therefore , you also obey your servant . Let me set a morsel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength when you go on your way. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	23	He refused and said , “ I will not eat. ” But his servants , together with the woman , urged him , and he listened to their words . So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed .
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	24	Now the woman had a fattened calf in the house , and she quickly killed it , and she took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread of it ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	28	25	and she put it before Saul and his servants , and they ate . Then they rose and went away that night . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	1%20Samuel	29	1	Samuel
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	29	( A ) Now the Philistines had gathered all their forces at ( B ) Aphek . And the Israelites were encamped by ( C ) the spring that is in ( D ) Jezreel .
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	2	As ( E ) the lords of the Philistines were passing on by hundreds and by thousands , and David and his men were passing on in the rear ( F ) with Achish ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	3	the commanders of the Philistines said , “ What are these Hebrews doing here ? ” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines , “ Is this not David , the servant of Saul , king of Israel , who has been with me ( G ) now for days and years , and since he deserted to me ( H ) I have found no fault in him to this day. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	4	But ( I ) the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him . And the commanders of the Philistines said to him , “ Send the man back , that he may return ( J ) to the place to which you have assigned him . He shall not go down with us to battle , ( K ) lest in the battle he become an adversary to us . For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord ? Would it not be with the heads of the men here ?
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	5	Is not this David , of whom they sing to one another in dances , ( L ) ‘ Saul has struck down his thousands , and David his ten thousands ’ ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	6	Then Achish called David and said to him , ( M ) “ As the Lord lives , you have been honest , and to me it seems right that ( N ) you should march out and in with me in the campaign . For I have found nothing wrong in you from the day of your coming to me to this day . Nevertheless , the lords do not approve of you .
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	7	So go back now ; and go peaceably , that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	8	And David said to Achish , “ But what have I done ? What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service until now , that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king ? ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	9	And Achish answered David and said , “ I know that you are as blameless in my sight ( O ) as an angel of God . Nevertheless , ( P ) the commanders of the Philistines have said , ‘ He shall not go up with us to the battle. ’
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	10	Now then rise early in the morning ( Q ) with the servants of your lord who came with you , and start early in the morning , and depart as soon as you have light. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	29	11	So David set out with his men early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines . But the Philistines went up to ( R ) Jezreel . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	1%20Samuel	30	30	in ( AA ) Hormah , in Bor-ashan , in Athach ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	2	and taken captive the women and all [ a ] who were in it , both small and great . They killed no one , but carried them off and went their way .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	3	And when David and his men came to the city , they found it burned with fire , and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	4	Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until they had no more strength to weep .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	5	David 's ( D ) two wives also had been taken captive , Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	6	And David was greatly distressed , for the people spoke ( E ) of stoning him , because all the people were bitter in soul , [ b ] each for his sons and daughters . But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	7	( F ) And David said to Abiathar the priest , the son of Ahimelech , “ Bring me the ephod. ” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	8	( G ) And David inquired of the Lord , “ Shall I pursue after this ( H ) band ? Shall I overtake them ? ” He answered him , “ Pursue , for you shall surely overtake ( I ) and shall surely rescue. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	9	So David set out , and ( J ) the six hundred men who were with him , and they came to the brook Besor , where those who were left behind stayed .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	10	But David pursued , he and four hundred men . ( K ) Two hundred stayed behind , who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	11	They found an Egyptian in the open country and brought him to David . And they gave him bread and he ate . They gave him water to drink ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	12	and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins . And when he had eaten , ( L ) his spirit revived , for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	13	And David said to him , “ To whom do you belong ? And where are you from ? ” He said , “ I am a young man of Egypt , servant to an Amalekite , and my master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	14	( M ) We had made a raid against the Negeb of ( N ) the Cherethites and against that which belongs to Judah and against the Negeb of Caleb , and we burned Ziklag with fire. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	15	And David said to him , “ Will you take me down to this band ? ” And he said , “ Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hands of my master , and I will take you down to this ( O ) band. ” David Defeats the Amalekites
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	16	And when he had taken him down , behold , they were spread abroad over all the land , eating and drinking and dancing , because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	17	And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day , and not a man of them escaped , except four hundred young men , who mounted camels and fled .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	18	( P ) David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken , and David rescued his two wives .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	19	Nothing was missing , whether small or great , sons or daughters , spoil or anything that had been taken . ( Q ) David brought back all .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	20	David also captured all the flocks and herds , and the people drove the livestock before him , [ c ] and said , “ This is David 's spoil. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	21	Then David came to ( R ) the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David , and who had been left ( S ) at the brook Besor . And they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him . And when David came near to the people he greeted them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	22	Then all the wicked and worthless fellows among the men who had gone with David said , “ Because they did not go with us , we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered , except that each man may lead away his wife and children , and depart. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	23	But David said , “ You shall not do so , my brothers , with what the Lord has given us . He has preserved us and given into our hand the band that came against us .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	24	Who would listen to you in this matter ? ( T ) For as his share is who goes down into the battle , so shall his share be who stays by the baggage . They shall share alike. ”
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	25	And he made it a statute and a rule for Israel from that day forward to this day .
ESV	1%20Samuel	30	26	When David came to Ziklag , he sent part of the spoil to his friends , the elders of Judah , saying , “ Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the Lord. ”

ESV	1%20Samuel	31	1	Samuel
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	31	( A ) Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel , and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain ( B ) on Mount Gilboa .
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	2	And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons , and the Philistines struck down ( C ) Jonathan and ( D ) Abinadab and Malchi-shua , the sons of Saul .
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	3	( E ) The battle pressed hard against Saul , and the archers found him , and he was badly wounded by the archers .
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	4	( F ) Then Saul said to his armor-bearer , “ Draw your sword , and thrust me through with it , lest these ( G ) uncircumcised come and thrust me through , and mistreat me. ” But his armor-bearer would not , ( H ) for he feared greatly . Therefore Saul took his own sword ( I ) and fell upon it .
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	5	And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead , he also fell upon his sword and died with him .
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	6	Thus Saul died , and his three sons , and his armor-bearer , and all his men , on the same day together .
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	7	And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead , they abandoned their cities and fled . And the Philistines came and lived in them .
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	8	The next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	9	So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines , ( J ) to carry the good news ( K ) to the house of their idols and to the people .
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	10	( L ) They put his armor in the temple of ( M ) Ashtaroth , and they fastened his body to the wall of ( N ) Beth-shan .
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	11	( O ) But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul ,
ESV	1%20Samuel	31	12	( P ) all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan , and they came to Jabesh ( Q ) and burned them there .

ESV	2%20Samuel	1	1	After the death of Saul , when David had returned ( A ) from striking down the Amalekites , David remained two days in Ziklag .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	3	David said to him , “ Where do you come from ? ” And he said to him , “ I have escaped from the camp of Israel. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	4	And David said to him , ( E ) “ How did it go ? Tell me. ” And he answered , “ The people fled from the battle , and also many of the people have fallen and are dead , and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	5	Then David said to the young man who told him , “ How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	6	And the young man who told him said , ( F ) “ By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa , and there was Saul leaning on his spear , and behold , the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	7	And when he looked behind him , he saw me , and called to me . And I answered , ‘ Here I am. ’
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	8	And he said to me , ‘ Who are you ? ’ I answered him , ‘ I am an Amalekite. ’
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	9	And he said to me , ( G ) ‘ Stand beside me and kill me , for anguish has seized me , and yet my life still lingers. ’
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	10	So I stood beside him and killed him , because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen . ( H ) And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm , and I have brought them here to my lord. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	11	Then David took hold of his clothes and ( I ) tore them , and so did all the men who were with him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	12	And they mourned and wept ( J ) and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the Lord and for the house of Israel , because they had fallen by the sword .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	13	And David said to the young man who told him , “ Where do you come from ? ” And he answered , “ I am the son of a sojourner , an Amalekite. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	14	David said to him , “ How is it you were not ( K ) afraid to put out your hand to destroy ( L ) the Lord 's anointed ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	15	Then ( M ) David called one of the young men and said , “ Go , execute him. ” And he struck him down so that he died .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	16	And David said to him , ( N ) “ Your blood be on your head , for your own mouth has testified against you , saying , ‘ I have killed ( O ) the Lord 's anointed. ’ ” David 's Lament for Saul and Jonathan
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	17	And David ( P ) lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son ,
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	18	and he said it [ a ] should be taught to the people of Judah ; behold , it is written in ( Q ) the Book of Jashar . [ b ] He said :
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	19	“ Your glory , O Israel , is slain on your high places ! ( R ) How the mighty have fallen !
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	20	( S ) Tell it not in Gath , ( T ) publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon , ( U ) lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , lest the daughters of ( V ) the uncircumcised exult .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	21	( W ) “ You mountains of Gilboa , let there be no dew or rain upon you , nor fields of offerings ! [ c ] For there the shield of the mighty was defiled , the shield of Saul , not ( X ) anointed with oil .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	22	“ From the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , ( Y ) the bow of Jonathan turned not back , and the sword of Saul returned not empty .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	23	“ Saul and Jonathan , beloved and lovely ! In life and in death they were not divided ; they were ( Z ) swifter than eagles ; they were ( AA ) stronger than lions .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	24	“ You daughters of Israel , weep over Saul , who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet , ( AB ) who put ornaments of gold on your apparel .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	25	( AC ) “ How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle ! “ Jonathan lies slain on your high places .
ESV	2%20Samuel	1	26	I am distressed for you , my brother Jonathan ; very pleasant have you been to me ; ( AD ) your love to me was extraordinary , surpassing the love of women .

ESV	2%20Samuel	2	3	And David brought up ( D ) his men who were with him , everyone with his household , and they lived in the towns of Hebron .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	4	And the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David ( E ) king over the house of Judah . When they told David , ( F ) “ It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul , ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	5	David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them , ( G ) “ May you be blessed by the Lord , because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord and buried him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	6	Now may the Lord show steadfast love and faithfulness to you . And I will do good to you because you have done this thing .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	7	Now therefore let your hands be strong , and be valiant , for Saul your lord is dead , and ( H ) the house of Judah has anointed me king over them. ” Ish-bosheth Made King of Israel
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	8	But ( I ) Abner the son of Ner , commander of Saul 's army , took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to ( J ) Mahanaim ,
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	9	and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	10	Ish-bosheth , Saul 's son , was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel , and he reigned two years . But the house of Judah followed David .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	11	( K ) And the time that David was king in Hebron over ( L ) the house of Judah was seven years and six months . The Battle of Gibeon
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	12	Abner the son of Ner , and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul , went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	13	And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at ( M ) the pool of Gibeon . And they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	14	And Abner said to Joab , “ Let the young men arise and compete before us. ” And Joab said , “ Let them arise. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	15	Then they arose and passed over by number , twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul , and twelve of the servants of David .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	16	And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent 's side , so they fell down together . Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim , [ a ] which is at Gibeon .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	17	And the battle was very fierce that day . And Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	18	And the ( N ) three sons of Zeruiah were there , Joab , Abishai , and Asahel . Now Asahel was ( O ) as swift of foot as a wild gazelle .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	19	And Asahel pursued Abner , and as he went , he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	20	Then Abner looked behind him and said , “ Is it you , Asahel ? ” And he answered , “ It is I. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	21	Abner said to him , “ Turn aside to your right hand or to your left , and seize one of the young men and take his spoil. ” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	22	And Abner said again to Asahel , “ Turn aside from following me . Why should I strike you to the ground ? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	23	But he refused to turn aside . Therefore Abner struck him ( P ) in the stomach with the butt of his spear , so that the spear came out at his back . And he fell there and died where he was . And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died , stood still .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	24	But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner . And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah , which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	25	And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill .
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	26	Then Abner called to Joab , “ Shall the sword devour forever ? Do you not know that the end will be bitter ? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	27	And Joab said , “ As God lives , if ( Q ) you had not spoken , surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	2	28	So Joab blew the trumpet , and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more , nor did they fight anymore .

To this day I keep showing steadfast love to the house of Saul your father , to his brothers , and to his friends , and have not given you into the hand of David . And yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman .

ESV	2%20Samuel	3	10	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah , ( L ) from Dan to Beersheba. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	11	And Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner another word , because he feared him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	12	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf , [ a ] saying , “ To whom does the land belong ? Make your covenant with me , and behold , my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	13	And he said , “ Good ; I will make a covenant with you . But one thing I require of you ; that is , ( M ) you shall not see my face unless you first bring ( N ) Michal , Saul 's daughter , when you come to see my face. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	14	Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth , Saul 's son , saying , “ Give me my wife Michal , ( O ) for whom I paid the bridal price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	15	And Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	16	But her husband went with her , weeping after her all the way to ( P ) Bahurim . Then Abner said to him , “ Go , return. ” And he returned .

ESV	2%20Samuel	3	18	Now then bring it about , ( Q ) for the Lord has promised David , saying , ‘ By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines , and from the hand of all their enemies. ’ ”

ESV	2%20Samuel	3	20	When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron , David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	21	And Abner said to David , “ I will arise and go and ( S ) will gather all Israel to my lord the king , that they may make a covenant with you , and that you may ( T ) reign over all that your heart desires. ” So David sent Abner away , and he went in peace .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	22	Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid , bringing much spoil with them . But Abner was not with David at Hebron , for he had sent him away , and he had gone in peace .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	23	When Joab and all the army that was with him came , it was told Joab , “ Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he has let him go , and he has gone in peace. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	24	Then Joab went to the king and said , “ What have you done ? Behold , Abner came to you . Why is it that you have sent him away , so that he is gone ?
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	25	You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you and to know ( U ) your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you are doing. ” Joab Murders Abner
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	26	When Joab came out from David 's presence , he sent messengers after Abner , and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah . But David did not know about it .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	27	And when Abner returned to Hebron , Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately , ( V ) and there he struck him ( W ) in the stomach , so that he died , for the blood of Asahel his brother .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	28	Afterward , when David heard of it , he said , “ I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the Lord for the blood of Abner the son of Ner .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	29	( X ) May it fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father 's house , and may the house of Joab never be without ( Y ) one who has a discharge or who is ( Z ) leprous or who holds a spindle or who falls by the sword or who lacks bread ! ”

ESV	2%20Samuel	3	31	Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him , ( AB ) “ Tear your clothes and ( AC ) put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner. ” And King David followed the bier .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	32	They buried Abner at Hebron . And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner , and all the people wept .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	33	And the king ( AD ) lamented for Abner , saying , ( AE ) “ Should Abner die ( AF ) as a fool dies ?
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	34	Your hands were not bound ; your feet were not fettered ; as one falls before the wicked you have fallen. ” And all the people wept again over him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	35	Then all the people came ( AG ) to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day . But David swore , saying , ( AH ) “ God do so to me and more also , if I taste bread or anything else ( AI ) till the sun goes down ! ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	36	And all the people took notice of it , and it pleased them , as everything that the king did pleased all the people .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	37	So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king 's will to put to death Abner the son of Ner .
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	38	And the king said to his servants , “ Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel ?
ESV	2%20Samuel	3	39	And I was gentle today , though anointed king . ( AJ ) These men , the sons of Zeruiah , are more severe than I . ( AK ) The Lord repay the evildoer according to his wickedness ! ” Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Samuel	9	9	Then the king called Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said to him , “ All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master 's grandson .
ESV	2%20Samuel	9	3	And the king said , “ Is there not still someone of the house of Saul , that I may show ( C ) the kindness of God to him ? ” Ziba said to the king , “ There is still a son of ( D ) Jonathan ; he is crippled in his feet. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	9	4	The king said to him , “ Where is he ? ” And Ziba said to the king , “ He is in the house of ( E ) Machir the son of Ammiel , at Lo-debar. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	9	5	Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , at Lo-debar .
ESV	2%20Samuel	9	6	And ( F ) Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan , son of Saul , came to David and fell on his face and paid homage . And David said , “ Mephibosheth ! ” And he answered , “ Behold , I am your servant. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	9	7	And David said to him , “ Do not fear , ( G ) for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan , and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your father , and ( H ) you shall eat at my table always. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	9	8	And he paid homage and said , “ What is your servant , that you should show regard for ( I ) a dead dog such as I ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	9	10	And you and your sons and your servants shall till the land for him and shall bring in the produce , that your master 's grandson may have bread to eat . But Mephibosheth your master 's grandson ( J ) shall always eat at my table. ” Now Ziba had ( K ) fifteen sons and twenty servants .
ESV	2%20Samuel	9	11	Then Ziba said to the king , “ According to all that my lord the king commands his servant , so will your servant do. ” So Mephibosheth ( L ) ate at David 's [ a ] table , like one of the king 's sons .
ESV	2%20Samuel	9	12	And Mephibosheth had a young son , ( M ) whose name was Mica . And all who lived in Ziba 's house became Mephibosheth 's servants .
ESV	2%20Samuel	9	13	So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem , for ( N ) he ate always at the king 's table . Now ( O ) he was lame in both his feet . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Samuel	10	10	The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother , and he arrayed them against the Ammonites .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	3	But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord , “ Do you think , because David has sent comforters to you , that he is honoring your father ? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	4	So Hanun took David 's servants and shaved off half the beard of each and cut off their garments in the middle , ( C ) at their hips , and sent them away .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	5	When it was told David , he sent to meet them , for the men were greatly ashamed . And the king said , “ Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	6	When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David , the Ammonites sent and hired the Syrians of ( D ) Beth-rehob , and ( E ) the Syrians of Zobah , 20,000 foot soldiers , and the king of ( F ) Maacah with 1,000 men , and the men of ( G ) Tob , 12,000 men .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	7	And when David heard of it , he sent Joab and all the host of ( H ) the mighty men .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	8	And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate , and ( I ) the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob and ( J ) the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	9	When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear , he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	11	And he said , “ If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me , but if the Ammonites are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	12	( K ) Be of good courage , and ( L ) let us be courageous for our people , and for the cities of our God , and ( M ) may the Lord do what seems good to him. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	13	So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Syrians , and they fled before him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	14	And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled , they likewise fled before Abishai and entered the city . Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	15	But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel , they gathered themselves together .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	16	And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond ( N ) the Euphrates . [ b ] They came to Helam , with ( O ) Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	17	And when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to Helam . The Syrians arrayed themselves against David and fought with him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	18	And the Syrians fled before Israel , and David killed of the Syrians the men of
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	700	chariots , and 40,000 horsemen , and wounded ( P ) Shobach the commander of their army , so that he died there .
ESV	2%20Samuel	10	19	And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel , they made peace with Israel ( Q ) and became subject to them . So the Syrians were afraid to save the Ammonites anymore . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Samuel	11	2	It happened , late one afternoon , when David arose from his couch and was walking on ( D ) the roof of the king 's house , that he saw from the roof a woman bathing ; and the woman was very beautiful .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	11	Uriah said to David , ( I ) “ The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths , and my lord Joab and ( J ) the servants of my lord are camping in the open field . Shall I then go to my house , to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife ? As you live , and ( K ) as your soul lives , I will not do this thing. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	3	And David sent and inquired about the woman . And one said , “ Is not this ( E ) Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of ( F ) Uriah the Hittite ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	4	So David sent messengers and took her , and she came to him , and he lay with her . ( ( G ) Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness . ) Then she returned to her house .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	5	And the woman conceived , and she sent and told David , “ I am pregnant. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	6	So David sent word to Joab , “ Send me Uriah the Hittite. ” And Joab sent Uriah to David .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	7	When Uriah came to him , David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the war was going .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	8	Then David said to Uriah , “ Go down to your house and ( H ) wash your feet. ” And Uriah went out of the king 's house , and there followed him a present from the king .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	9	But Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and did not go down to his house .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	10	When they told David , “ Uriah did not go down to his house , ” David said to Uriah , “ Have you not come from a journey ? Why did you not go down to your house ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	12	Then David said to Uriah , “ Remain here today also , and tomorrow I will send you back. ” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	13	And David invited him , and he ate in his presence and drank , ( L ) so that he made him drunk . And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with ( M ) the servants of his lord , but he did not go down to his house .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	14	In the morning David ( N ) wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	15	In the letter he wrote , “ Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting , and then draw back from him , ( O ) that he may be struck down , and die. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	16	And as Joab was besieging the city , he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	17	And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab , and some of the servants of David among the people fell . Uriah the Hittite also died .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	18	Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	19	And he instructed the messenger , “ When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king ,
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	20	then , if the king 's anger rises , and if he says to you , ‘ Why did you go so near the city to fight ? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall ?
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	21	( P ) Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth ? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall , so that he died at Thebez ? Why did you go so near the wall ? ’ then you shall say , ‘ Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	22	So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	23	The messenger said to David , “ The men gained an advantage over us and came out against us in the field , but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	24	Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall . Some of the king 's servants are dead , and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	25	David said to the messenger , “ Thus shall you say to Joab , ‘ Do not let this matter displease you , for the sword devours now one and now another . Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it. ’ And encourage him. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	26	When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead , she lamented over her husband .
ESV	2%20Samuel	11	27	And when the mourning was over , David sent and brought her to his house , and ( Q ) she became his wife and bore him a son . But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	2%20Samuel	12	12	For you did it secretly , ( J ) but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	3	but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb , which he had bought . And he brought it up , and it grew up with him and with his children . It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms , [ a ] and it was like a daughter to him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	4	Now there came a traveler to the rich man , and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him , but he took the poor man 's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	5	Then David 's anger was greatly kindled against the man , and he said to Nathan , ( C ) “ As the Lord lives , the man who has done this deserves to die ,
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	6	and he shall restore the lamb ( D ) fourfold , because he did this thing , and because he had no pity. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	7	Nathan said to David , “ You are the man ! Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , ( E ) ‘ I anointed you king over Israel , and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	8	-
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	9	( F ) Why have you despised the word of the Lord , ( G ) to do what is evil in his sight ? ( H ) You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and ( I ) have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	10	Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house , because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife. ’
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	11	Thus says the Lord , ‘ Behold , I will raise up evil against you out of your own house . And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor , and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	13	( K ) David said to Nathan , ( L ) “ I have sinned against the Lord. ” And Nathan said to David , ( M ) “ The Lord also has put away your sin ; you shall not die .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	14	Nevertheless , because by this deed you have utterly ( N ) scorned the Lord , [ b ] the child who is born to you shall die. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	15	Then Nathan went to his house . David 's Child Dies And the Lord afflicted the child that Uriah 's wife bore to David , and he became sick .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	16	David therefore sought God on behalf of the child . And David ( O ) fasted and went in ( P ) and lay all night on the ground .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	17	And the elders of his house stood beside him , to raise him from the ground , but he would not , nor did he eat food with them .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	18	On the seventh day the child died . And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead , for they said , “ Behold , while the child was yet alive , we spoke to him , and he did not listen to us . How then can we say to him the child is dead ? He may do himself some harm. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	19	But when David saw that his servants were whispering together , David understood that the child was dead . And David said to his servants , “ Is the child dead ? ” They said , “ He is dead. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	20	Then David arose from the earth ( Q ) and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes . And he went into the house of the Lord ( R ) and worshiped . He then went to his own house . And when he asked , they set food before him , and he ate .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	21	Then his servants said to him , “ What is this thing that you have done ? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive ; but when the child died , you arose and ate food. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	22	He said , “ While the child was still alive , I fasted and wept , for I said , ( S ) ‘ Who knows whether the Lord will be gracious to me , that the child may live ? ’
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	23	But now he is dead . Why should I fast ? Can I bring him back again ? I shall go to him , ( T ) but he will not return to me. ” Solomon 's Birth
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	24	Then David comforted his wife , Bathsheba , and went in to her and lay with her , and ( U ) she bore a son , and he called his name ( V ) Solomon . And the Lord loved him
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	25	and sent a message by Nathan the prophet . So he called his name Jedidiah , [ c ] because of the Lord . Rabbah Is Captured
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	26	( W ) Now Joab ( X ) fought against ( Y ) Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	27	And Joab sent messengers to David and said , “ I have fought against Rabbah ; moreover , I have taken the city of waters .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	28	Now then gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it , lest I take the city and it be called by my name. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	29	So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	30	And he took the crown of their king from his head . The weight of it was a talent [ d ] of gold , and in it was a precious stone , and it was placed on David 's head . And he brought out the spoil of the city , a very great amount .
ESV	2%20Samuel	12	31	And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them toil at [ e ] the brick kilns . And thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites . Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Samuel	13	13	As for me , where could I carry my shame ? And as for you , you would be as one of ( H ) the outrageous fools in Israel . Now therefore , please speak to the king , for he will not withhold me from you. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	3	But Amnon had a friend , whose name was Jonadab , the son of ( C ) Shimeah , David 's brother . And Jonadab was a very crafty man .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	4	And he said to him , “ O son of the king , why are you so haggard morning after morning ? Will you not tell me ? ” Amnon said to him , “ I love Tamar , my brother Absalom 's sister. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	5	Jonadab said to him , “ Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you , say to him , ‘ Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat , and prepare the food in my sight , that I may see it and eat it from her hand. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	6	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him , Amnon said to the king , “ Please let my sister Tamar come and ( D ) make a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat from her hand. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	7	Then David sent home to Tamar , saying , “ Go to your brother Amnon 's house and prepare food for him. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon 's house , where he was lying down . And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	9	And she took the pan and emptied it out before him , but he refused to eat . And Amnon said , ( E ) “ Send out everyone from me. ” So everyone went out from him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	10	Then Amnon said to Tamar , “ Bring the food into the chamber , that I may eat from your hand. ” And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	11	But when she brought them near him to eat , he took hold of her and said to her , “ Come , lie with me , my sister. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	12	She answered him , “ No , my brother , do not violate [ a ] me , for ( F ) such a thing is not done in Israel ; do not do this ( G ) outrageous thing .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	14	,
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	15	Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred , so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her . And Amnon said to her , “ Get up ! Go ! ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	16	But she said to him , “ No , my brother , for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me. ” [ b ] But he would not listen to her .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	17	He called the young man who served him and said , “ Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	18	Now she was wearing ( I ) a long robe with sleeves , [ c ] for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed . So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her .

ESV	2%20Samuel	13	20	And her brother Absalom said to her , “ Has Amnon your brother been with you ? Now hold your peace , my sister . He is your brother ; do not take this to heart. ” So Tamar lived , a desolate woman , in her brother Absalom 's house .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	21	When King David heard of all these things , he was very angry . [ d ]
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	22	,
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	23	After two full years Absalom had ( N ) sheepshearers at Baal-hazor , which is near Ephraim , and Absalom invited all the king 's sons .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	24	And Absalom came to the king and said , “ Behold , your servant has sheepshearers . Please let the king and his servants go with your servant. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	25	But the king said to Absalom , “ No , my son , let us not all go , lest we be burdensome to you. ” He pressed him , but he would not go but gave him his blessing .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	26	Then Absalom said , “ If not , please let my brother Amnon go with us. ” And the king said to him , “ Why should he go with you ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	27	But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king 's sons go with him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	28	Then Absalom commanded his servants , “ Mark when Amnon 's ( O ) heart is merry with wine , and when I say to you , ‘ Strike Amnon , ’ then kill him . Do not fear ; have I not commanded you ? Be courageous and be valiant. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	29	So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded . Then all the king 's sons arose , and each mounted his mule and fled .
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	30	While they were on the way , news came to David , “ Absalom has struck down all the king 's sons , and not one of them is left. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	13	31	Then the king arose and ( P ) tore his garments and ( Q ) lay on the earth . And all his servants who were standing by tore their garments .

ESV	2%20Samuel	14	17	And your servant thought , ‘ The word of my lord the king will set me at rest , ’ for my lord the king is ( S ) like the angel of God to discern good and evil . The Lord your God be with you ! ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	18	Then the king answered the woman , “ Do not hide from me anything I ask you. ” And the woman said , “ Let my lord the king speak. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	19	The king said , “ Is the hand of Joab with you in all this ? ” The woman answered and said , ( T ) “ As surely as you live , my lord the king , one can not turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said . It was your servant Joab who commanded me ; ( U ) it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant .
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	20	In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this . But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of ( V ) the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	21	Then the king said to Joab , “ Behold now , I grant this ; go , bring back the young man Absalom. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	22	And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage ( W ) and blessed the king . And Joab said , “ Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight , my lord the king , in that the king has granted the request of his servant. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	23	So Joab arose and went to ( X ) Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	24	And the king said , “ Let him dwell apart in his own house ; he is not to come into my presence. ” So Absalom lived apart in his own house and did not come into the king 's presence .
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	25	Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom . ( Y ) From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	26	And when he cut the hair of his head ( for at the end of every year he used to cut it ; when it was heavy on him , he ( Z ) cut it ) , he weighed the hair of his head , two hundred shekels [ a ] by the king 's weight .
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	27	There were born ( AA ) to Absalom three sons , and one daughter whose name was Tamar . She was a beautiful woman .
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	28	So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem , without coming into the king 's presence .
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	29	Then Absalom sent for Joab , to send him to the king , but Joab would not come to him . And he sent a second time , but Joab would not come .
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	30	Then he said to his servants , “ See , Joab 's field is next to mine , and he has barley there ; go and set it on fire. ” So Absalom 's servants set the field on fire . [ b ]
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	31	Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him , “ Why have your servants set my field on fire ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	32	Absalom answered Joab , “ Behold , I sent word to you , ‘ Come here , that I may send you to the king , to ask , “ Why have I come from ( AB ) Geshur ? It would be better for me to be there still. ” Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king , ( AC ) and if there is guilt in me , let him put me to death. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	14	33	Then Joab went to the king and told him , and he summoned Absalom . So he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king , and the king kissed Absalom . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Samuel	15	15	And the king 's servants said to the king , “ Behold , your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	3	Absalom would say to him , “ See , your claims are good and right , but there is no man designated by the king to hear you. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	4	Then Absalom would say , ( C ) “ Oh that I were judge in the land ! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me , and I would give him justice. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	5	And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him , he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	6	Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment . So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	7	And at the end of four [ a ] years Absalom said to the king , “ Please let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed to the Lord , in Hebron .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	8	For your servant ( D ) vowed a vow ( E ) while I lived at Geshur in Aram , saying , ‘ If the Lord will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem , then I will offer worship to [ b ] the Lord. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	9	The king said to him , ( F ) “ Go in peace. ” So he arose and went to Hebron .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	10	But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , “ As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet , then say , ‘ Absalom is king at Hebron ! ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	11	With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem ( G ) who were invited guests , and they went in their innocence and knew nothing .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	12	And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices , he sent for [ c ] ( H ) Ahithophel the Gilonite , ( I ) David 's counselor , from his city ( J ) Giloh . And the conspiracy grew strong , and the people with Absalom ( K ) kept increasing . David Flees Jerusalem
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	13	And a messenger came to David , saying , ( L ) “ The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	14	Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem , “ Arise , and let us ( M ) flee , or else there will be no escape for us from Absalom . Go quickly , lest he overtake us quickly and bring down ruin on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	16	So the king went out , and all his household after him . And the king left ( N ) ten concubines to keep the house .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	17	And the king went out , and all the people after him . And they halted at the last house .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	18	And ( O ) all his servants passed by him , and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from ( P ) Gath , passed on before the king .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	19	Then the king said to ( Q ) Ittai the Gittite , “ Why do you also go with us ? Go back and stay with the king , for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your home .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	20	You came only yesterday , and shall I today make you wander about with us , since I go ( R ) I know not where ? Go back and take your brothers with you , and may the Lord show [ d ] steadfast love and faithfulness to you. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	21	But Ittai answered the king , ( S ) “ As the Lord lives , and as my lord the king lives , ( T ) wherever my lord the king shall be , whether for death or for life , there also will your servant be. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	22	And David said to Ittai , “ Go then , pass on. ” So Ittai the Gittite passed on with all his men and all the little ones who were with him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	23	And all the land wept aloud as all the people passed by , and the king crossed ( U ) the brook ( V ) Kidron , and all the people passed on toward ( W ) the wilderness .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	24	And ( X ) Abiathar came up , and behold , ( Y ) Zadok came also with all the Levites , ( Z ) bearing the ark of the covenant of God . And they set down the ark of God until the people had all passed out of the city .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	25	Then the king said to Zadok , “ Carry the ark of God back into the city . If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord , he will ( AA ) bring me back and let me see both it and his ( AB ) dwelling place .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	26	But if he says , ‘ I have no ( AC ) pleasure in you , ’ behold , here I am , ( AD ) let him do to me what seems good to him. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	27	The king also said to Zadok the priest , “ Are you not a ( AE ) seer ? Go back [ e ] to the city in peace , with ( AF ) your two sons , Ahimaaz your son , and Jonathan the son of Abiathar .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	28	See , I will wait at ( AG ) the fords of ( AH ) the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	29	So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem , and they remained there .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	30	But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives , weeping as he went , ( AI ) barefoot and ( AJ ) with his head covered . And all the people who were with him covered their heads , and they went up , ( AK ) weeping as they went .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	31	And it was told David , “ Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. ” And David said , “ O Lord , please ( AL ) turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	32	While David was coming to the summit , where God was worshiped , behold , Hushai ( AM ) the Archite came to meet him ( AN ) with his coat torn and ( AO ) dirt on his head .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	33	David said to him , “ If you go on with me , you will be ( AP ) a burden to me .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	34	But if you return to the city and say to Absalom , ( AQ ) ‘ I will be your servant , O king ; as I have been your father 's servant in time past , so now I will be your servant , ’ then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	35	Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there ? So whatever you hear from the king 's house , ( AR ) tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	36	Behold , ( AS ) their two sons are with them there , Ahimaaz , Zadok 's son , and Jonathan , Abiathar 's son , ( AT ) and by them you shall send to me everything you hear. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	15	37	So Hushai , ( AU ) David 's friend , came into the city , ( AV ) just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Samuel	16	16	And when Hushai the Archite , ( U ) David 's friend , came to Absalom , Hushai said to Absalom , ( V ) “ Long live the king ! Long live the king ! ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	3	And the king said , “ And where is your master 's son ? ” ( F ) Ziba said to the king , “ Behold , he remains in Jerusalem , for he said , ‘ Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	4	Then the king said to Ziba , “ Behold , all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours. ” And Ziba said , “ I pay homage ; let me ever find favor in your sight , my lord the king. ” Shimei Curses David
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	5	When King David came to ( G ) Bahurim , there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul , whose name was ( H ) Shimei , the son of Gera , and as he came ( I ) he cursed continually .
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	6	And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David , and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	7	And Shimei said as he ( J ) cursed , “ Get out , get out , you man of blood , you worthless man !
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	8	The Lord ( K ) has avenged on you all ( L ) the blood of the house of Saul , in whose place you have reigned , and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom . See , your evil is on you , for you are a man of blood. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	9	Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king , “ Why should this ( M ) dead dog ( N ) curse my lord the king ? Let me go over and take off his head. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	10	But the king said , ( O ) “ What have I to do with you , ( P ) you sons of Zeruiah ? If he is cursing because the Lord has said to him , ‘ Curse David , ’ who then shall say , ‘ Why have you done so ? ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	11	And David said to Abishai and to all his servants , “ Behold , ( Q ) my own son seeks my life ; how much more now may this Benjaminite ! Leave him alone , and let him curse , for the Lord has told him to .
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	12	It may be that the Lord will look on the wrong done to me , [ a ] and that the Lord will repay me with good for his cursing today. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	13	So David and his men went on the road , while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and ( R ) cursed as he went and threw stones at him and flung dust .
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	14	And the king , and all the people who were with him , ( S ) arrived weary at the Jordan . [ b ] And there he refreshed himself . Absalom Enters Jerusalem
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	15	( T ) Now Absalom and all the people , the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	17	And Absalom said to Hushai , “ Is this your loyalty to your friend ? ( W ) Why did you not go with your friend ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	18	And Hushai said to Absalom , “ No , for whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen , his I will be , and with him I will remain .
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	19	And again , ( X ) whom should I serve ? Should it not be his son ? As I have served your father , so I will serve you. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel , “ Give your counsel . What shall we do ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	21	Ahithophel said to Absalom , “ Go in to ( Y ) your father 's concubines , whom he has left to keep the house , and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father , and ( Z ) the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom ( AA ) on the roof . And Absalom went in to his father 's concubines ( AB ) in the sight of all Israel .
ESV	2%20Samuel	16	23	Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the word of God ; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed , ( AC ) both by David and by Absalom . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Samuel	17	2	Samuel 17:28 Hebrew adds and parched grain The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	17	Now ( L ) Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at ( M ) En-rogel . A female servant was to go and tell them , and they were to go and tell King David , for they were not to be seen entering the city .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	3	and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband . You seek the life of only one man , [ a ] and all the people will be at peace. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	4	And the advice seemed right in the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	5	Then Absalom said , “ Call ( C ) Hushai the Archite also , and let us hear what he has to say. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	6	And when Hushai came to Absalom , Absalom said to him , “ Thus has Ahithophel spoken ; shall we do as he says ? If not , you speak. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	7	Then Hushai said to Absalom , “ This time the counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	8	Hushai said , “ You know that your father and his men are mighty men , and that they are enraged , [ b ] ( D ) like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field . Besides , your father is expert in war ; he will not spend the night with the people .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	9	Behold , even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits or in some other place . And as soon as some of the people fall [ c ] at the first attack , whoever hears it will say , ‘ There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom. ’
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	10	Then even the valiant man , whose heart is like the heart of a lion , will utterly ( E ) melt with fear , for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man , and that those who are with him are valiant men .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	11	But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you , ( F ) from Dan to Beersheba , ( G ) as the sand by the sea for multitude , and that you go to battle in person .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	12	So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found , and we shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground , and of him and all the men with him not one will be left .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	13	If he withdraws into a city , then all Israel will bring ropes to that city , and we shall drag it into the valley , until not even a pebble is to be found there. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	14	And Absalom and all the men of Israel said , “ The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. ” ( H ) For the Lord had ordained [ d ] to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel , so that the Lord might bring harm upon Absalom .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	15	( I ) Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests , “ Thus and so did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel , and thus and so have I counseled .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	16	Now therefore send quickly and tell David , ‘ Do not stay tonight at ( J ) the fords of the wilderness , but by all means pass over , lest the king and all the people who are with him be ( K ) swallowed up. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	18	But a young man saw them and told Absalom . So both of them went away quickly and came to the house of a man at ( N ) Bahurim , who had a well in his courtyard . And they went down into it .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	19	( O ) And the woman took and spread a covering over the well 's mouth and scattered grain on it , and nothing was known of it .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	20	When Absalom 's servants came to the woman at the house , they said , “ Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? ” And the woman said to them , “ They have gone over the brook [ e ] of water. ” And when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	21	After they had gone , the men came up out of the well , and went and told King David . They said to David , ( P ) “ Arise , and go quickly over the water , for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	22	Then David arose , and all the people who were with him , and they crossed the Jordan . By daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	23	When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his donkey and went off home to ( Q ) his own city . He ( R ) set his house in order and ( S ) hanged himself , and he died and was buried in the tomb of his father .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	24	Then David came to ( T ) Mahanaim . And Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	25	Now Absalom had set ( U ) Amasa over the army instead of Joab . Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite , [ f ] who had married Abigal the daughter of ( V ) Nahash , sister of Zeruiah , Joab 's mother .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	26	And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead .
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	27	When David came to Mahanaim , ( W ) Shobi the son of Nahash from ( X ) Rabbah of the Ammonites , and ( Y ) Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar , and ( Z ) Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim ,
ESV	2%20Samuel	17	28	brought beds , basins , and earthen vessels , wheat , barley , flour , parched grain , beans and lentils , [ g ]

ESV	2%20Samuel	18	18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself ( I ) the pillar that is in ( J ) the King 's Valley , for he said , ( K ) “ I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. ” He called the pillar after his own name , and it is called Absalom 's monument [ c ] to this day . David Hears of Absalom 's Death
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	3	( B ) But the men said , “ You shall not go out . For if we flee , they will not care about us . If half of us die , they will not care about us . But you are worth ten thousand of us . Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	4	The king said to them , “ Whatever seems best to you I will do. ” So the king stood at the side of the gate , while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	5	And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai , “ Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom. ” ( C ) And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	6	So the army went out into the field against Israel , and the battle was fought in the ( D ) forest of Ephraim .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	7	And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David , and the loss there was great on that day , twenty thousand men .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	8	The battle spread over the face of all the country , and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	9	And Absalom happened to meet the servants of David . Absalom was riding on his mule , and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak , [ a ] ( E ) and his head caught fast in the oak , and he was suspended between heaven and earth , while the mule that was under him went on .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	10	,
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	11	Joab said to the man who told him , “ What , you saw him ! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground ? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	12	But the man said to Joab , “ Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver , I would not reach out my hand against the king 's son , for ( F ) in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai , ‘ For my sake protect the young man Absalom. ’
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	13	On the other hand , if I had dealt treacherously against his life [ b ] ( and there is nothing hidden from the king ) , then you yourself would have stood aloof. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	14	-
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	15	And ten young men , Joab 's armor-bearers , surrounded Absalom and struck him and killed him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	16	Then Joab blew the trumpet , and the troops came back from pursuing Israel , for Joab restrained them .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	17	And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him ( G ) a very great heap of stones . And all Israel ( H ) fled every one to his own home .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	19	Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said , ( L ) “ Let me run and carry news to the king that ( M ) the Lord has delivered him from the hand of his enemies. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	20	And Joab said to him , “ You are not to carry news today . You may carry news another day , but today you shall carry no news , because the king 's son is dead. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	21	Then Joab said to the Cushite , “ Go , tell the king what you have seen. ” The Cushite bowed before Joab , and ran .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	22	Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab , “ Come what may , let me also run after the Cushite. ” And Joab said , “ Why will you run , my son , seeing that you will have no reward for the news ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	23	“ Come what may , ” he said , “ I will run. ” So he said to him , “ Run. ” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of ( N ) the plain , and outran the Cushite .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	24	Now David ( O ) was sitting between the two gates , and ( P ) the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall , and when he lifted up his eyes and looked , he saw a man running alone .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	25	The watchman called out and told the king . And the king said , “ If he is alone , there is news in his mouth. ” And he drew nearer and nearer .
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	26	The watchman saw another man running . And the watchman called to the gate and said , “ See , another man running alone ! ” The king said , “ He also brings news. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	27	The watchman said , “ I think the running of the first is ( Q ) like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. ” And the king said , ( R ) “ He is a good man and comes with good news. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	28	Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king , “ All is well. ” And he bowed before the king with his face to the earth and said , ( S ) “ Blessed be the Lord your God , who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	18	29	And the king said , ( T ) “ Is it well with the young man Absalom ? ” Ahimaaz answered , “ When Joab sent the king 's servant , your servant , I saw a great commotion , but I do not know what it was. ”

ESV	2%20Samuel	19	19	and said to the king , ( Q ) “ Let not my lord hold me guilty or remember how your servant ( R ) did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem . Do not let the king take it to heart .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	3	And the people stole into the city that day as people steal in who are ashamed when they flee in battle .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	4	The king ( A ) covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , ( B ) “ O my son Absalom , O Absalom , my son , my son ! ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	5	Then Joab came into the house to the king and said , “ You have today covered with shame the faces of all your servants , who have this day saved your life and the lives of your sons and your daughters and the lives of your wives and your concubines ,
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	6	because you love those who hate you and hate those who love you . For you have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing to you , for today I know that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today , then you would be pleased .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	7	Now therefore arise , go out and speak ( C ) kindly to your servants , for I swear by the Lord , if you do not go , not a man will stay with you this night , and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	8	Then the king arose and took his ( D ) seat in the gate . And the people were all told , “ Behold , the king is sitting in the gate. ” And all the people came before the king . David Returns to Jerusalem Now Israel had ( E ) fled every man to his own home .

ESV	2%20Samuel	19	10	But Absalom , whom we anointed over us , is dead in battle . Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	11	And King David sent this message to ( I ) Zadok and Abiathar the priests : “ Say to the elders of Judah , ‘ Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house , when the word of all Israel has come to the king ? [ a ]
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	12	You are my brothers ; ( J ) you are my bone and my flesh . Why then should you be the last to bring back the king ? ’
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	13	And say to Amasa , ( K ) ‘ Are you not my bone and my flesh ? ( L ) God do so to me and more also , if you are not ( M ) commander of my army from now on in place of Joab. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	14	And he swayed the heart of all the men of Judah ( N ) as one man , so that they sent word to the king , “ Return , both you and all your servants. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	15	So the king came back to the Jordan , and Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to bring the king over the Jordan . David Pardons His Enemies
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	16	And ( O ) Shimei the son of Gera , the Benjaminite , from Bahurim , hurried to come down with the men of Judah to meet King David .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	17	And with him were a thousand men from Benjamin . And ( P ) Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , with his fifteen sons and his twenty servants , rushed down to the Jordan before the king ,
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	18	and they crossed the ford to bring over the king 's household and to do his pleasure . And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king , as he was about to cross the Jordan ,
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	20	For your servant knows that I have sinned . Therefore , behold , I have come this day , the first ( S ) of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	21	Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered , “ Shall not Shimei be put to death for this , because ( T ) he cursed the Lord 's anointed ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	22	But David said , ( U ) “ What have I to do with you , you sons of Zeruiah , that you should this day be as an adversary to me ? ( V ) Shall anyone be put to death in Israel this day ? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	23	( W ) And the king said to Shimei , “ You shall not die. ” And the king gave him his oath .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	24	And ( X ) Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king . He had neither taken care of his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes , from the day the king departed until the day he came back in safety .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	25	And when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king , the king said to him , ( Y ) “ Why did you not go with me , Mephibosheth ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	26	He answered , “ My lord , O king , my servant deceived me , for your servant said to him , ‘ I will saddle a donkey for myself , [ b ] that I may ride on it and go with the king. ’ For ( Z ) your servant is lame .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	27	( AA ) He has slandered your servant to my lord the king . But my lord the king is ( AB ) like the angel of God ; do therefore what seems good to you .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	28	For all my father 's house were but men doomed to death before my lord the king , but ( AC ) you set your servant among those who eat at your table . What further right have I , then , to cry to the king ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	29	And the king said to him , “ Why speak any more of your affairs ? I have decided : you and Ziba shall divide the land. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	30	And Mephibosheth said to the king , “ Oh , let him take it all , since my lord the king has come safely home. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	31	Now ( AD ) Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim , and he went on with the king to the Jordan , to escort him over the Jordan .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	32	Barzillai was a very aged man , eighty years old . ( AE ) He had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim , for he was a very wealthy man .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	33	And the king said to Barzillai , “ Come over with me , and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	34	But Barzillai said to the king , ( AF ) “ How many years have I still to live , that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem ?
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	35	I am this day ( AG ) eighty years old . Can I discern what is pleasant and what is not ? Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks ? Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women ? Why then should your servant be ( AH ) an added burden to my lord the king ?
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	36	Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king . Why should the king repay me with such a reward ?
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	37	Please let your servant return , that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother . But here is your servant ( AI ) Chimham . Let him go over with my lord the king , and do for him whatever seems good to you. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	38	And the king answered , “ Chimham shall go over with me , and I will do for him whatever seems good to you , and all that you desire of me I will do for you. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	39	Then all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . And ( AJ ) the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him , and he returned to his own home .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	40	The king went on to Gilgal , and Chimham went on with him . All the people of Judah , and also half the people of Israel , brought the king on his way .
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	41	Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king , “ Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away and ( AK ) brought the king and his household over the Jordan , and all David 's men with him ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	42	All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel , “ Because the king is ( AL ) our close relative . Why then are you angry over this matter ? Have we eaten at all at the king 's expense ? Or has he given us any gift ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	19	43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah , “ We have ( AM ) ten shares in the king , and in David also we have more than you . Why then did you despise us ? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king ? ” ( AN ) But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Samuel	20	20	Joab answered , “ Far be it from me , far be it , that I should ( S ) swallow up or destroy !
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	3	And David came to his house at Jerusalem . And the king took ( D ) the ten concubines whom he had left to care for the house and put them in a house under guard and provided for them , but did not go in to them . So they were shut up until the day of their death , living as if in widowhood .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	4	Then the king said to ( E ) Amasa , “ Call the men of Judah together to me within three days , and be here yourself. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	5	So Amasa went to summon Judah , but he delayed beyond the set time that had been appointed him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	6	And David said to Abishai , “ Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom . Take ( F ) your lord 's servants and pursue him , lest he get himself to fortified cities and escape from us. ” [ a ]
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	7	And there went out after him Joab 's men and the ( G ) Cherethites and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men . They went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	8	When they were at the great stone that is in Gibeon , Amasa came to meet them . Now Joab was wearing a soldier 's garment , and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened on his thigh , and as he went forward it fell out .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	9	And Joab said to Amasa , “ Is it well with you , my brother ? ” And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand ( H ) to kiss him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	10	But Amasa did not observe the sword that was in Joab 's hand . ( I ) So Joab struck him with it ( J ) in the stomach and spilled his entrails to the ground without striking a second blow , and he died . Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	11	And one of Joab 's young men took his stand by Amasa and said , “ Whoever favors Joab , and whoever is for David , let him follow Joab. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	12	And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the highway . And anyone who came by , seeing him , stopped . And when the man saw that all the people stopped , he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field and threw a garment over him .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	13	When he was taken out of the highway , all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	14	And Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to ( K ) Abel of ( L ) Beth-maacah , [ b ] and all ( M ) the Bichrites [ c ] assembled and followed him in .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	15	And all the men who were with Joab came and besieged him in ( N ) Abel of Beth-maacah . ( O ) They cast up a mound against the city , and it stood against the rampart , and they were battering the wall to throw it down .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	16	Then a wise woman called from the city , “ Listen ! Listen ! Tell Joab , ‘ Come here , that I may speak to you. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	17	And he came near her , and the woman said , “ Are you Joab ? ” He answered , “ I am. ” Then she said to him , “ Listen to the words of your servant. ” And he answered , “ I am listening. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	18	Then she said , “ They used to say in former times , ‘ Let them but ask counsel at ( P ) Abel , ’ and so they settled a matter .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	19	I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel . You seek to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel . Why will you ( Q ) swallow up ( R ) the heritage of the Lord ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	21	That is not true . But a man of ( T ) the hill country of Ephraim , called Sheba the son of Bichri , has lifted up his hand against King David . Give up him alone , and I will withdraw from the city. ” And the woman said to Joab , “ Behold , his head shall be thrown to you over the wall. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	22	Then the woman went to all the people ( U ) in her wisdom . And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it out to Joab . So he blew the trumpet , and they dispersed from the city , ( V ) every man to his home . And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king .
ESV	2%20Samuel	20	23	( W ) Now Joab was in command of all the army of Israel ; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the Cherethites and the Pelethites ;

ESV	2%20Samuel	21	7	But the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Saul 's son Jonathan , because of ( F ) the oath of the Lord that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
ESV	2%20Samuel	21	8	The king took the two sons of ( G ) Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bore to Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Merab [ a ] the daughter of Saul , whom ( H ) she bore to ( I ) Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite ;

ESV	2%20Samuel	21	10	( K ) Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock , from the beginning of harvest until rain fell upon them from the heavens . And she did not allow the birds of the air to come upon them by day , or the beasts of the field by night .

ESV	2%20Samuel	21	13	And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan ; and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged .
ESV	2%20Samuel	21	14	And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin in ( N ) Zela , in the tomb of Kish his father . And they did all that the king commanded . And after that ( O ) God responded to the plea for the land . War with the Philistines

ESV	2%20Samuel	21	16	And Ishbi-benob , one of the descendants ( P ) of the giants , whose spear weighed three hundred shekels [ b ] of bronze , and who was armed with a new sword , thought to kill David .

ESV	2%20Samuel	23	5	“ For does not my house stand so with God ? ( G ) For he has made with me an everlasting covenant , ordered in all things and secure . For will he not cause to prosper all my help and my desire ?
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	6	But worthless men [ c ] are all like thorns that are thrown away , for they can not be taken with the hand ;
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	7	but the man who touches them arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear , and they are utterly consumed with fire. ” [ d ] David 's Mighty Men
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	8	( H ) These are the names of the mighty men whom David had : ( I ) Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite ; he was chief of the three . [ e ] He wielded his spear [ f ] against eight hundred whom he killed at one time .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	9	And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of ( J ) Dodo , son of ( K ) Ahohi . He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle , and the men of Israel withdrew .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	10	He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary , and his hand clung to the sword . And the Lord brought about a great victory that day , and the men returned after him only to strip the slain .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	11	And next to him was Shammah , the son of Agee the ( L ) Hararite . The Philistines gathered together at Lehi , [ g ] where there was a plot of ground full of lentils , and the men fled from the Philistines .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	12	But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines , and the Lord worked a great victory .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	13	And three of the thirty chief men went down and came about harvest time to David at the ( M ) cave of Adullam , when a band of Philistines was encamped ( N ) in the Valley of Rephaim .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	14	David was then ( O ) in the stronghold , and ( P ) the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	15	And David said longingly , “ Oh , that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate ! ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	16	Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and carried and brought it to David . But he would not drink of it . He poured it out to the Lord
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	17	and said , “ Far be it from me , O Lord , that I should do this . Shall I drink ( Q ) the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives ? ” Therefore he would not drink it . These things the three mighty men did .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	18	Now Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of the thirty . [ h ] And he wielded his spear against three hundred men [ i ] and killed them and won a name beside the three .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	19	He was the most renowned of the thirty [ j ] and became their commander , but he did not attain to ( R ) the three .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	20	And ( S ) Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man [ k ] of ( T ) Kabzeel , a doer of great deeds . He struck down two ariels [ l ] of Moab . He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	21	And he struck down an Egyptian , a handsome man . The Egyptian had a spear in his hand , but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand and killed him with his own spear .
ESV	2%20Samuel	23	22	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and won a name beside the three mighty men .

ESV	2%20Samuel	24	2	Samuel 24:24 A shekel was about 2/5 ounce or
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	24	But the king said to Araunah , “ No , but I will buy it from you for a price . I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God that cost me nothing. ” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels [ g ] of silver .
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	3	But Joab said to the king , ( E ) “ May the Lord your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are , while the eyes of my lord the king still see it , but why does my lord the king delight in this thing ? ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	4	But the king 's word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army . So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel .
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	5	They crossed the Jordan and began from ( F ) Aroer , [ b ] and from the city that is in the middle of the ( G ) valley , toward Gad and on to ( H ) Jazer .
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	6	Then they came to Gilead , and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites ; [ c ] and they came to Dan , and from Dan [ d ] they went around to ( I ) Sidon ,
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	7	and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the ( J ) Hivites and ( K ) Canaanites ; and they went out to the Negeb of Judah at Beersheba .
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	8	So when they had gone through all the land , they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	9	And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king : in Israel there were 800,000 valiant men ( L ) who drew the sword , and the men of Judah were 500,000 . The Lord 's Judgment of David 's Sin
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	10	But ( M ) David 's heart struck him after he had numbered the people . And David said to the Lord , ( N ) “ I have sinned greatly in what I have done . But now , O Lord , please take away the iniquity of your servant , for I have done ( O ) very foolishly. ”

ESV	2%20Samuel	24	12	“ Go and say to David , ‘ Thus says the Lord , Three things I offer [ e ] you . Choose one of them , that I may do it to you. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	13	So Gad came to David and told him , and said to him , “ Shall ( R ) three [ f ] years of famine come to you in your land ? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you ? Or shall there be three days ' pestilence in your land ? Now consider , and decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	14	Then David said to Gad , “ I am in great distress . Let us fall into the hand of the Lord , ( S ) for his mercy is great ; but let me not fall into the hand of man. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	15	( T ) So the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the appointed time . And there died of the people from ( U ) Dan to Beersheba 70,000 men .
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	16	And when ( V ) the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem ( W ) to destroy it , ( X ) the Lord relented from the calamity and said to the angel ( Y ) who was working destruction among the people , “ It is enough ; now stay your hand. ” And ( Z ) the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of ( AA ) Araunah the Jebusite .
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	17	Then David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel who was striking the people , and said , “ Behold , I have sinned , and I have done wickedly . But these sheep , what have they done ? Please let your hand be against me and against my father 's house. ” David Builds an Altar
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	18	And Gad came that day to David and said to him , “ Go up , raise an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of ( AB ) Araunah the Jebusite. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	19	So David went up at Gad 's word , as the Lord commanded .
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	20	And when Araunah looked down , he saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . And Araunah went out and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground .
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	21	And Araunah said , “ Why has my lord the king come to his servant ? ” David said , “ To buy the threshing floor from you , in order to build an altar to the Lord , that the plague ( AC ) may be averted from the people. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	22	Then Araunah said to David , “ Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . Here are the oxen for the burnt offering and the ( AD ) threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood .
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	23	All this , O king , Araunah gives to the king. ” And Araunah said to the king , “ May the Lord your God ( AE ) accept you. ”
ESV	2%20Samuel	24	25	And David built there an altar to the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . ( AF ) So the Lord responded to the plea for the land , and the plague was averted from Israel . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	1	1	Kings 1:48 Septuagint one of my offspring The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Kings	1	2	Therefore his servants said to him , “ Let a young woman be sought for my lord the king , and let her wait on the king and be in his service . Let her lie in your arms , [ a ] that my lord the king may be warm. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	3	So they sought for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel , and found Abishag the ( A ) Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	4	The young woman was very beautiful , and she was of service to the king and attended to him , but the king knew her not . Adonijah Sets Himself Up as King
ESV	1%20Kings	1	5	Now ( B ) Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , “ I will be king. ” ( C ) And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	6	His father had never at any time displeased him by asking , “ Why have you done thus and so ? ” He was also a very handsome man , ( D ) and he was born next after Absalom .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	7	He conferred with ( E ) Joab the son of Zeruiah and with ( F ) Abiathar the priest . And they followed Adonijah and helped him .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	8	But ( G ) Zadok the priest and ( H ) Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and ( I ) Nathan the prophet and ( J ) Shimei and Rei and ( K ) David 's mighty men were not with Adonijah .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	9	Adonijah sacrificed sheep , oxen , and fattened cattle by the Serpent 's Stone , which is beside ( L ) En-rogel , and he invited all his brothers , the king 's sons , and all the royal officials of Judah ,
ESV	1%20Kings	1	10	but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty men or ( M ) Solomon his brother . Nathan and Bathsheba Before David
ESV	1%20Kings	1	11	Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon , “ Have you not heard that ( N ) Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it ?
ESV	1%20Kings	1	12	Now therefore come , let me give you advice , that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	13	Go in at once to King David , and say to him , ‘ Did you not , my lord the king , swear to your servant , saying , ( O ) “ Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ” ? Why then is Adonijah king ? ’
ESV	1%20Kings	1	14	Then while you are still speaking with the king , I also will come in after you and confirm [ b ] your words. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	15	So Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber ( now the king was very old , and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king ) .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	16	Bathsheba bowed and paid homage to the king , and the king said , “ What do you desire ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	17	She said to him , “ My lord , you swore to your servant by the Lord your God , saying , ( P ) ‘ Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	1	18	And now , behold , Adonijah is king , although you , my lord the king , do not know it .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	19	( Q ) He has sacrificed oxen , fattened cattle , and sheep in abundance , and has invited all the sons of the king , ( R ) Abiathar the priest , and Joab the commander of the army , but ( S ) Solomon your servant he has not invited .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	20	And now , my lord the king , the eyes of all Israel are on you , to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	21	Otherwise it will come to pass , when my lord the king ( T ) sleeps with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	22	While she was still speaking with the king , Nathan the prophet came in .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	23	And they told the king , “ Here is Nathan the prophet. ” And when he came in before the king , he bowed before the king , with his face to the ground .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	24	And Nathan said , “ My lord the king , have you said , ‘ Adonijah shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ’ ?
ESV	1%20Kings	1	25	For he has gone down this day and ( U ) has sacrificed oxen , fattened cattle , and sheep in abundance , and has invited all the king 's sons , the commanders [ c ] of the army , and Abiathar the priest . And behold , they are eating and drinking before him , and saying , ( V ) ‘ Long live King Adonijah ! ’
ESV	1%20Kings	1	26	( W ) But me , your servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and your servant Solomon he has not invited .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	27	Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not told your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ? ” Solomon Anointed King
ESV	1%20Kings	1	28	Then King David answered , “ Call Bathsheba to me. ” So she came into the king 's presence and stood before the king .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	29	And the king swore , saying , ( X ) “ As the Lord lives , who has redeemed my soul out of every adversity ,
ESV	1%20Kings	1	30	( Y ) as I swore to you by the Lord , the God of Israel , saying , ‘ Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne in my place , ’ even so will I do this day. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	31	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and paid homage to the king and said , ( Z ) “ May my lord King David live forever ! ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	32	King David said , “ Call to me Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. ” So they came before the king .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	33	And the king said to them , “ Take with you ( AA ) the servants of your lord and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule , and bring him down to ( AB ) Gihon .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	34	And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet there ( AC ) anoint him king over Israel . ( AD ) Then blow the trumpet and say , ( AE ) ‘ Long live King Solomon ! ’
ESV	1%20Kings	1	35	You shall then come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my throne , for he shall be king in my place . And I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	36	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king , “ Amen ! May the Lord , the God of my lord the king , say so .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	37	( AF ) As the Lord has been with my lord the king , even so may he be with Solomon , ( AG ) and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	38	So Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , ( AH ) and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David 's mule and brought him to Gihon .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	39	There Zadok the priest took the horn of ( AI ) oil from the tent and ( AJ ) anointed Solomon . ( AK ) Then they blew the trumpet , and all the people said , ( AL ) “ Long live King Solomon ! ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	40	And all the people went up after him , playing on pipes , and rejoicing with great joy , so that the earth was split by their noise .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	41	Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting . And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet , he said , “ What does this uproar in the city mean ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	42	While he was still speaking , behold , ( AM ) Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came . And Adonijah said , “ Come in , ( AN ) for you are a worthy man and bring good news. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	43	Jonathan answered Adonijah , “ No , for our lord King David has made Solomon king ,
ESV	1%20Kings	1	44	and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the ( AO ) Cherethites and the Pelethites . And they had him ride on the king 's mule .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	45	And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at ( AP ) Gihon , and they have gone up from there rejoicing , so that the city is in an uproar . This is the noise that you have heard .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	46	( AQ ) Solomon sits on the royal throne .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	47	Moreover , the king 's servants came to congratulate our lord King David , saying , ( AR ) ‘ May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours , and make his throne greater than your throne. ’ And the king ( AS ) bowed himself on the bed .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	48	And the king also said , ‘ Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , ( AT ) who has granted someone [ d ] to sit on my throne this day , my own eyes seeing it. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	49	Then all the guests of Adonijah trembled and rose , and each went his own way .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	50	And Adonijah feared Solomon . So he arose and went ( AU ) and took hold of ( AV ) the horns of the altar .
ESV	1%20Kings	1	51	Then it was told Solomon , “ Behold , Adonijah fears King Solomon , for behold , he has laid hold of the horns of the altar , saying , ‘ Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not put his servant to death with the sword. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	52	And Solomon said , “ If he will show himself a worthy man , ( AW ) not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth , but if wickedness is found in him , he shall die. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	1	53	So King Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . And he came and paid homage to King Solomon , and Solomon said to him , “ Go to your house. ” Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	2	2	( B ) “ I am about to go the way of all the earth . ( C ) Be strong , and show yourself a man ,
ESV	1%20Kings	2	3	and keep the charge of the Lord your God , walking in his ways and keeping his statutes , his commandments , his rules , and his testimonies , as it is written in the Law of Moses , ( D ) that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn ,
ESV	1%20Kings	2	4	that the Lord may ( E ) establish his word that he spoke concerning me , saying , ( F ) ‘ If your sons pay close attention to their way , ( G ) to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul , ( H ) you shall not lack [ a ] a man on the throne of Israel. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	2	5	“ Moreover , you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah ( I ) did to me , how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel , ( J ) Abner the son of Ner , ( K ) and Amasa the son of Jether , whom he killed , avenging [ b ] in time of peace for blood that had been shed in war , and putting the blood of war [ c ] on the belt around his [ d ] waist and on the sandals on his feet .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	6	Act therefore ( L ) according to your wisdom , but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	7	But deal loyally with the sons of ( M ) Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be ( N ) among those who eat at your table , ( O ) for with such loyalty [ e ] they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	8	And there is also with you ( P ) Shimei the son of Gera , the Benjaminite from Bahurim , who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day ( Q ) when I went to Mahanaim . ( R ) But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan , I swore to him by the Lord , saying , ‘ I will not put you to death with the sword. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	2	9	Now therefore do not hold him guiltless , ( S ) for you are a wise man . You will know what you ought to do to him , and you shall ( T ) bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol. ” The Death of David
ESV	1%20Kings	2	10	( U ) Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in ( V ) the city of David .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	11	And the time that David reigned over Israel was ( W ) forty years . He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	12	( X ) So Solomon sat on the throne of David his father , and his kingdom was firmly established . Solomon 's Reign Established
ESV	1%20Kings	2	13	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon . And she said , ( Y ) “ Do you come peacefully ? ” He said , “ Peacefully. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	14	Then he said , “ I have something to say to you. ” She said , “ Speak. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	15	He said , “ You know that ( Z ) the kingdom was mine , and that all Israel fully expected me to reign . However , the kingdom has turned about and become my brother 's , ( AA ) for it was his from the Lord .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	16	And now I have one request to make of you ; do not refuse me. ” She said to him , “ Speak. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	17	And he said , “ Please ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me ( AB ) Abishag the Shunammite as my wife. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	18	Bathsheba said , “ Very well ; I will speak for you to the king. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah . And the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her . Then he sat on his throne and had a seat brought for the king 's mother , ( AC ) and she sat on his right .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	20	Then she said , “ I have one small request to make of you ; do not refuse me. ” And the king said to her , “ Make your request , my mother , for I will not refuse you. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	21	She said , “ Let ( AD ) Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	22	King Solomon answered his mother , “ And why do you ask ( AE ) Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah ? Ask for him the kingdom also , ( AF ) for he is my older brother , and on his side ( AG ) are Abiathar [ f ] the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	23	Then King Solomon swore by the Lord , saying , ( AH ) “ God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adonijah his life !
ESV	1%20Kings	2	24	Now therefore ( AI ) as the Lord lives , who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father , and who has made me a house , ( AJ ) as he promised , Adonijah shall be put to death today. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	25	So King Solomon sent ( AK ) Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and he struck him down , and he died .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	26	And to Abiathar the priest the king said , “ Go to ( AL ) Anathoth , to your estate , for you deserve death . But I will not at this time put you to death , ( AM ) because you carried the ark of the Lord God before David my father , ( AN ) and because you shared in all my father 's affliction. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	27	( AO ) So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being priest to the Lord , thus fulfilling ( AP ) the word of the Lord that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	28	When the news came to Joab—for Joab ( AQ ) had supported Adonijah although ( AR ) he had not supported Absalom—Joab fled to the tent of the Lord and caught hold of the ( AS ) horns of the altar .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	29	And when it was told King Solomon , “ Joab has fled to the tent of the Lord , and behold , he is beside the altar , ” Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , “ Go , strike him down. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	30	So Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and said to him , “ The king commands , ‘ Come out. ’ ” But he said , “ No , I will die here. ” Then Benaiah brought the king word again , saying , “ Thus said Joab , and thus he answered me. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	31	The king replied to him , ( AT ) “ Do as he has said , strike him down and bury him , ( AU ) and thus take away from me and from my father 's house the guilt for the blood that Joab shed without cause .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	32	The Lord will ( AV ) bring back his bloody deeds on his own head , because , without the knowledge of my father David , he attacked and killed with the sword two men ( AW ) more righteous and better than himself , ( AX ) Abner the son of Ner , commander of the army of Israel , and ( AY ) Amasa the son of Jether , commander of the army of Judah .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	33	( AZ ) So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever . But for David and for his descendants and for his house and for his throne there shall be peace from the Lord forevermore. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	34	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and put him to death . And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	35	( BA ) The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab , and the king put ( BB ) Zadok the priest ( BC ) in the place of Abiathar .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	36	Then the king sent and summoned ( BD ) Shimei and said to him , “ Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there , and do not go out from there to any place whatever .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	37	For on the day you go out and cross ( BE ) the brook Kidron , know for certain that you shall die . ( BF ) Your blood shall be on your own head. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	38	And Shimei said to the king , “ What you say is good ; as my lord the king has said , so will your servant do. ” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	39	But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shimei 's servants ran away to ( BG ) Achish , son of Maacah , king of Gath . And when it was told Shimei , “ Behold , your servants are in Gath , ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	40	Shimei arose and saddled a donkey and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants . Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	41	And when Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned ,
ESV	1%20Kings	2	42	the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him , “ Did I not make you swear by the Lord and solemnly warn you , saying , ‘ Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place whatever , you shall die ’ ? And you said to me , ‘ What you say is good ; I will obey. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	2	43	Why then have you not kept your oath to the Lord and the commandment with which I commanded you ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	44	The king also said to Shimei , “ You know in your own heart ( BH ) all the harm that you did to David my father . So the Lord will ( BI ) bring back your harm on your own head .
ESV	1%20Kings	2	45	But King Solomon shall be blessed , ( BJ ) and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	2	46	Then the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and he went out and struck him down , and he died . ( BK ) So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	3	3	Solomon ( G ) loved the Lord , ( H ) walking in the statutes of David his father , only he sacrificed and made offerings at the high places .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	2	( F ) The people were sacrificing at the high places , however , because no house had yet been built for the name of the Lord .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	4	And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there , ( I ) for that was the great high place . Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	5	( J ) At Gibeon ( K ) the Lord appeared to Solomon ( L ) in a dream by night , and God said , “ Ask what I shall give you. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	3	6	And Solomon said , “ You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father , because ( M ) he walked before you in faithfulness , in righteousness , and in uprightness of heart toward you . And you have kept for him this great and steadfast love and ( N ) have given him a son to sit on his throne this day .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	7	And now , O Lord my God , ( O ) you have made your servant king in place of David my father , ( P ) although I am but a little child . I do not know ( Q ) how to go out or come in .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	8	( R ) And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen , a great people , ( S ) too many to be numbered or counted for multitude .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	9	( T ) Give your servant therefore an understanding mind ( U ) to govern your people , that I may ( V ) discern between good and evil , for who is able to govern this your great people ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	3	10	It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	11	And God said to him , “ Because you have asked this , and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies , but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right ,
ESV	1%20Kings	3	12	behold , ( W ) I now do according to your word . Behold , ( X ) I give you a wise and discerning mind , so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	13	( Y ) I give you also what you have not asked , ( Z ) both riches and honor , so that no other king shall compare with you , all your days .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	14	And if you will walk in my ways , keeping my statutes and my commandments , ( AA ) as your father David walked , then ( AB ) I will lengthen your days. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	3	15	And Solomon ( AC ) awoke , and behold , it was a dream . Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings , and made a feast for all his servants . Solomon 's Wisdom

ESV	1%20Kings	3	18	Then on the third day after I gave birth , this woman also gave birth . And we were alone . There was no one else with us in the house ; only we two were in the house .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	19	And this woman 's son died in the night , because she lay on him .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	20	And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me , while your servant slept , and laid him at her breast , and laid her dead son at my breast .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	21	When I rose in the morning to nurse my child , behold , he was dead . But when I looked at him closely in the morning , behold , he was not the child that I had borne. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	3	22	But the other woman said , “ No , the living child is mine , and the dead child is yours. ” The first said , “ No , the dead child is yours , and the living child is mine. ” Thus they spoke before the king .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	23	Then the king said , “ The one says , ‘ This is my son that is alive , and your son is dead ’ ; and the other says , ‘ No ; but your son is dead , and my son is the living one. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	3	24	And the king said , “ Bring me a sword. ” So a sword was brought before the king .
ESV	1%20Kings	3	25	And the king said , “ Divide the living child in two , and give half to the one and half to the other. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	3	26	Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king , because ( AE ) her heart yearned for her son , “ Oh , my lord , give her the living child , and by no means put him to death. ” But the other said , “ He shall be neither mine nor yours ; divide him. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	3	27	Then the king answered and said , “ Give the living child to the first woman , and by no means put him to death ; she is his mother. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	3	28	And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered , and they stood in awe of the king , because they perceived that ( AF ) the wisdom of God was in him to do justice . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	1%20Kings	7	21	( P ) He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple . He set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin , and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	22	liters The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Kings	7	23	( Q ) Then he made ( R ) the sea of cast metal . It was round , ten cubits from brim to brim , and five cubits high , and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	24	Under its brim were ( S ) gourds , for ten cubits , compassing the sea all around . The gourds were in two rows , cast with it when it was cast .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	25	It stood on ( T ) twelve oxen , three facing north , three facing west , three facing south , and three facing east . The sea was set on them , and all their rear parts were inward .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	26	Its thickness was a handbreadth , [ h ] and its brim was made like the brim of a cup , like the flower of a lily . It held two thousand baths . [ i ]
ESV	1%20Kings	7	27	He also made the ( U ) ten stands of bronze . Each stand was four cubits long , four cubits wide , and three cubits high .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	28	This was the construction of the stands : they had panels , and the panels were set in the frames ,
ESV	1%20Kings	7	29	and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions , oxen , and cherubim . On the frames , both above and below the lions and oxen , there were wreaths of beveled work .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	30	Moreover , each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze , and at the four corners were supports for a basin . The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	31	Its opening was within a crown that projected upward one cubit . Its opening was round , as a pedestal is made , a cubit and a half deep . At its opening there were carvings , and its panels were square , not round .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	32	And the four wheels were underneath the panels . The axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands , and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	33	The wheels were made like a chariot wheel ; their axles , their rims , their spokes , and their hubs were all cast .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	34	There were four supports at the four corners of each stand . The supports were of one piece with the stands .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	35	And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high ; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	36	And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels , he carved cherubim , lions , and palm trees , according to the space of each , with wreaths all around .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	37	After this manner he made ( V ) the ten stands . All of them were cast alike , of the same measure and the same form .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	38	And he made ( W ) ten basins of bronze . Each basin held forty baths , each basin measured four cubits , and there was a basin for each of the ten stands .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	39	And he set the stands , five on the south side of the house , and five on the north side of the house . And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	40	( X ) Hiram also made ( Y ) the pots , the shovels , and the basins . So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the Lord :
ESV	1%20Kings	7	41	the two pillars , the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars , and the two ( Z ) latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars ;
ESV	1%20Kings	7	42	and the ( AA ) four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks , two rows of pomegranates for each latticework , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars ;
ESV	1%20Kings	7	43	the ten stands , and the ten basins on the stands ;
ESV	1%20Kings	7	44	and ( AB ) the one sea , and the twelve oxen underneath the sea .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	45	centimeters -
ESV	1%20Kings	7	46	In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them , in the clay ground between ( AD ) Succoth and ( AE ) Zarethan .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	47	And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed , because there were so many of them ; ( AF ) the weight of the bronze was not ascertained .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	48	So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the Lord : ( AG ) the golden altar , ( AH ) the golden table for ( AI ) the bread of the Presence ,
ESV	1%20Kings	7	49	( AJ ) the lampstands of pure gold , five on the south side and five on the north , before the inner sanctuary ; ( AK ) the flowers , the lamps , and the tongs , of gold ;
ESV	1%20Kings	7	50	the cups , snuffers , basins , dishes for incense , and ( AL ) fire pans , of pure gold ; and the sockets of gold , for the doors of the innermost part of the house , ( AM ) the Most Holy Place , and for the doors of the nave of the temple .
ESV	1%20Kings	7	51	Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the Lord was finished . And Solomon brought in ( AN ) the things that David his father had dedicated , the silver , the gold , and the vessels , and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the Lord . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	8	8	( L ) And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before ( M ) the inner sanctuary ; but they could not be seen from outside . And they are there to this day .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	2	And all the men of Israel assembled to King Solomon at ( E ) the feast in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	3	And all the elders of Israel came , and ( F ) the priests took up the ark .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	4	And they brought up the ark of the Lord , ( G ) the tent of meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent ; the priests and the Levites brought them up .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	5	And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel , who had assembled before him , were with him before the ark , ( H ) sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	6	( I ) Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord ( J ) to its place in ( K ) the inner sanctuary of the house , in the Most Holy Place , underneath the wings of the cherubim .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	7	For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark , so that the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	9	There was nothing in the ark except ( N ) the two tablets of stone that Moses put there at Horeb , where ( O ) the Lord made a covenant with the people of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	10	And when the priests came out of the Holy Place , ( P ) a cloud filled the house of the Lord ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	11	so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud , for the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord . Solomon Blesses the Lord
ESV	1%20Kings	8	12	( Q ) Then Solomon said , “ The Lord [ a ] has said that he would dwell ( R ) in thick darkness .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	13	( S ) I have indeed built you an exalted house , ( T ) a place for you to dwell in forever. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	8	14	Then the king turned around and ( U ) blessed all the assembly of Israel , while all the assembly of Israel stood .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	15	And he said , ( V ) “ Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , who with his hand has fulfilled ( W ) what he promised with his mouth to David my father , saying ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	16	( X ) ‘ Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt , I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house , ( Y ) that my name might be there . ( Z ) But I chose David to be over my people Israel. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	8	17	( AA ) Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord , the God of Israel .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	18	But the Lord said to David my father , ‘ Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	19	( AB ) Nevertheless , you shall not build the house , but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	8	20	Now the Lord has fulfilled his promise that he made . For I have risen in the place of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , ( AC ) as the Lord promised , and I have built the house for the name of the Lord , the God of Israel .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	21	And there I have provided a place for the ark , ( AD ) in which is the covenant of the Lord that he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. ” Solomon 's Prayer of Dedication
ESV	1%20Kings	8	22	Then Solomon ( AE ) stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and ( AF ) spread out his hands toward heaven ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	23	and said , “ O Lord , God of Israel , ( AG ) there is no God like you , in heaven above or on earth beneath , ( AH ) keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart ;
ESV	1%20Kings	8	24	you have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him . ( AI ) You spoke with your mouth , and with your hand have fulfilled it this day .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	25	Now therefore , O Lord , God of Israel , keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him , saying , ( AJ ) ‘ You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel , if only your sons pay close attention to their way , to walk before me as you have walked before me. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	8	26	( AK ) Now therefore , O God of Israel , let your word be confirmed , which you have spoken to your servant David my father .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	27	“ But will God indeed dwell on the earth ? Behold , ( AL ) heaven and the highest heaven can not contain you ; how much less this house that I have built !
ESV	1%20Kings	8	28	Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea , O Lord my God , listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you this day ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	29	( AM ) that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house , the place of which you have said , ( AN ) ‘ My name shall be there , ’ that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	30	And listen to the plea of your servant and of your people Israel , when they pray toward this place . And listen in heaven your dwelling place , and when you hear , forgive .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	31	“ If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take ( AO ) an oath and comes and swears his oath before your altar in this house ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	32	then hear in heaven and act and judge your servants , ( AP ) condemning the guilty by bringing his conduct on his own head , and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	33	( AQ ) “ When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you , and ( AR ) if they turn again to you and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this house ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	34	then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave to their fathers .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	35	( AS ) “ When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you , if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin , when you afflict them ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	36	then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants , your people Israel , when ( AT ) you teach them ( AU ) the good way in which they should walk , and grant rain upon your land , which you have given to your people as an inheritance .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	37	( AV ) “ If there is famine in the land , if there is pestilence or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar , if their enemy besieges them in the land at their gates , [ b ] whatever plague , whatever sickness there is ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	38	whatever prayer , whatever plea is made by any man or by all your people Israel , each knowing the affliction of his own heart and stretching out his hands toward this house ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	39	then hear in heaven your dwelling place and forgive and act and render to each whose heart you know , according to all his ways ( ( AW ) for you , you only , know the hearts of all the children of mankind ) ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	40	that they may fear you ( AX ) all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our fathers .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	41	“ Likewise , when a foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , comes from a far country for your name 's sake
ESV	1%20Kings	8	42	( for they shall hear of your great name ( AY ) and your mighty hand , and of your outstretched arm ) , when he comes and prays toward this house ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	43	hear in heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you , in order ( AZ ) that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and ( BA ) fear you , as do your people Israel , and that they may know that this house that I have built is called by your name .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	44	“ If your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to the Lord ( BB ) toward the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	45	then hear in heaven their prayer and their plea , and maintain their cause .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	46	“ If they sin against you— ( BC ) for there is no one who does not sin—and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy , so that they are carried away captive ( BD ) to the land of the enemy , far off or near ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	47	yet ( BE ) if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive , and repent and plead with you in the land of their captors , saying , ( BF ) ‘ We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly , ’
ESV	1%20Kings	8	48	( BG ) if they repent with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies , who carried them captive , and pray to you ( BH ) toward their land , which you gave to their fathers , the city that you have chosen , and the house that I have built for your name ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	49	then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their plea , and maintain their cause
ESV	1%20Kings	8	50	and forgive your people who have sinned against you , and all their transgressions that they have committed against you , and ( BI ) grant them compassion in the sight of those who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them
ESV	1%20Kings	8	51	( ( BJ ) for they are your people , and your heritage , which you brought out of Egypt , ( BK ) from the midst of the iron furnace ) .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	52	( BL ) Let your eyes be open to the plea of your servant and to the plea of your people Israel , giving ear to them whenever they call to you .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	53	For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be your heritage , ( BM ) as you declared through Moses your servant , when you brought our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord God. ” Solomon 's Benediction
ESV	1%20Kings	8	54	( BN ) Now as Solomon finished offering all this prayer and plea to the Lord , he arose from before the altar of the Lord , where he had ( BO ) knelt with hands outstretched toward heaven .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	55	And he stood and ( BP ) blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice , saying ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	56	“ Blessed be the Lord who has given rest to his people Israel , according to all that he promised . ( BQ ) Not one word has failed of all his good promise , which he spoke by Moses his servant .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	57	The Lord our God be with us , as he was with our fathers . ( BR ) May he not leave us or forsake us ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	58	that he may ( BS ) incline our hearts to him , to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments , his statutes , and his rules , which he commanded our fathers .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	59	Let these words of mine , with which I have pleaded before the Lord , be near to the Lord our God day and night , and may he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel , as each day requires ,
ESV	1%20Kings	8	60	that ( BT ) all the peoples of the earth may know that ( BU ) the Lord is God ; there is no other .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	61	( BV ) Let your heart therefore be wholly true to the Lord our God , walking in his statutes and keeping his commandments , as at this day. ” Solomon 's Sacrifices
ESV	1%20Kings	8	62	( BW ) Then ( BX ) the king , and all Israel with him , offered sacrifice before the Lord .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	63	Solomon offered as peace offerings to the Lord 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep . So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	64	The same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord , for there he offered the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings , because ( BY ) the bronze altar that was before the Lord was too small to receive the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings .
ESV	1%20Kings	8	65	So Solomon held ( BZ ) the feast at that time , and all Israel with him , a great assembly , from ( CA ) Lebo-hamath to ( CB ) the Brook of Egypt , before the Lord our God , seven days . [ c ]
ESV	1%20Kings	8	66	On the eighth day he sent the people away , and they blessed the king and went to their homes joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord had shown to David his servant and to Israel his people . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	9	2	( D ) the Lord appeared to Solomon a second time , as he had appeared to him at Gibeon .
ESV	1%20Kings	9	3	And the Lord said to him , “ I have heard your prayer and your plea , which you have made before me . I have consecrated this house that you have built , ( E ) by putting my name there forever . ( F ) My eyes and my heart will be there for all time .
ESV	1%20Kings	9	4	And as for you , if you will ( G ) walk before me , ( H ) as David your father walked , with integrity of heart and uprightness , doing according to all that I have commanded you , and keeping my statutes and my rules ,
ESV	1%20Kings	9	5	( I ) then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever , as I promised David your father , saying , ‘ You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	9	6	( J ) But if you turn aside from following me , you or your children , and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you , but go and serve other gods and worship them ,
ESV	1%20Kings	9	7	( K ) then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them , ( L ) and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight , ( M ) and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
ESV	1%20Kings	9	8	And this house will become a heap of ruins . [ a ] Everyone passing by it will be astonished and will hiss , and they will say , ( N ) ‘ Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house ? ’
ESV	1%20Kings	9	10	( P ) At the end of ( Q ) twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord and the king 's house ,
ESV	1%20Kings	9	11	and Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold , as much as he desired , King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
ESV	1%20Kings	9	12	But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him , they did not please him .
ESV	1%20Kings	9	13	Therefore he said , “ What kind of cities are these that you have given me , my brother ? ” So they are called the land of ( R ) Cabul to this day .

ESV	1%20Kings	10	2	She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue , with camels ( E ) bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones . And when she came to Solomon , she told him all that was on her mind .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	3	And Solomon answered all her questions ; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon , the house that he had built ,
ESV	1%20Kings	10	5	the food of his table , the seating of his officials , and the attendance of his servants , their clothing , his cupbearers , and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the Lord , there was no more breath in her .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	6	And she said to the king , “ The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom ,
ESV	1%20Kings	10	7	but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it . And behold , the half was not told me . Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	8	( F ) Happy are your men ! Happy are your servants , who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom !
ESV	1%20Kings	10	9	( G ) Blessed be the Lord your God , who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel ! ( H ) Because the Lord loved Israel forever , he has made you king , ( I ) that you may execute justice and righteousness. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	10	120	talents [ a ] of gold , and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones . Never again came such an abundance of spices as these that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon .

ESV	1%20Kings	10	12	And the king made of the almug wood supports for the house of the Lord and for the king 's house , also lyres and harps for the singers . No such almug wood has come or been seen to this day .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	13	And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired , whatever she asked besides what was given her by the bounty of King Solomon . So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants . Solomon 's Great Wealth

ESV	1%20Kings	10	16	King Solomon made

ESV	1%20Kings	10	19	The throne had six steps , and the throne had a round top , [ d ] and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests ,
ESV	1%20Kings	10	20	while twelve lions stood there , one on each end of a step on the six steps . The like of it was never made in any kingdom .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	21	All King Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of ( P ) the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold . None were of silver ; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	22	For the king had ( Q ) a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram . Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold , silver , ivory , apes , and peacocks . [ e ]
ESV	1%20Kings	10	23	( R ) Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	24	And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom , which God had put into his mind .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	25	Every one of them brought his present , articles of silver and gold , garments , myrrh , [ f ] spices , horses , and mules , so much year by year .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	26	( S ) And Solomon gathered together ( T ) chariots and horsemen . He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen , whom he stationed in the ( U ) chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	27	And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone , and he made cedar as plentiful as ( V ) the sycamore of the Shephelah .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	28	And Solomon 's ( W ) import of horses was from Egypt and Kue , and the king 's traders received them from Kue at a price .
ESV	1%20Kings	10	29	A chariot could be imported from Egypt for
ESV	1%20Kings	10	150	, and so through the king 's traders they were exported to all the kings of ( X ) the Hittites and the kings of Syria . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	11	1	Kings 11:33 Septuagint , Syriac , Vulgate he has ; twice in this verse The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Kings	11	11	Therefore the Lord said to Solomon , “ Since this has been your practice and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you , ( L ) I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	2	from the nations concerning which the Lord had said to the people of Israel , ( B ) “ You shall not enter into marriage with them , neither shall they with you , for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods. ” Solomon clung to these in love .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	3	He had
ESV	1%20Kings	11	700	wives , who were princesses , and
ESV	1%20Kings	11	300	concubines . And his wives turned away his heart .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	4	For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods , and ( C ) his heart was not wholly true to the Lord his God , ( D ) as was the heart of David his father .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	5	For Solomon went after ( E ) Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians , and after ( F ) Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	6	So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and did not wholly follow the Lord , as David his father had done .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	7	Then Solomon built a high place for ( G ) Chemosh the abomination of Moab , and for ( H ) Molech the abomination of the Ammonites , on the mountain east of Jerusalem .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	8	And so he did for all his foreign wives , who made offerings and sacrificed to their gods . The Lord Raises Adversaries
ESV	1%20Kings	11	9	And the Lord was angry with Solomon , because ( I ) his heart had turned away from the Lord , the God of Israel , ( J ) who had appeared to him twice
ESV	1%20Kings	11	10	and ( K ) had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods . But he did not keep what the Lord commanded .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	12	Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days , but I will tear it out of the hand of your son .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	13	However , ( M ) I will not tear away all the kingdom , but ( N ) I will give one tribe to your son , for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem ( O ) that I have chosen. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	11	14	And the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon , Hadad the Edomite . He was of the royal house in Edom .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	15	For ( P ) when David was in Edom , and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain , he struck down every male in Edom
ESV	1%20Kings	11	16	( for Joab and all Israel remained there six months , until he had cut off every male in Edom ) .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	17	But Hadad fled to Egypt , together with certain Edomites of his father 's servants , Hadad still being a little child .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	18	They set out from Midian and came to ( Q ) Paran and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt , to Pharaoh king of Egypt , who gave him a house and assigned him an allowance of food and gave him land .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	19	And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	20	And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh 's house . And Genubath was in Pharaoh 's house among the sons of Pharaoh .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	21	But when Hadad heard in Egypt ( R ) that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , “ Let me depart , that I may go to my own country. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	11	22	But Pharaoh said to him , “ What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country ? ” And he said to him , “ Only let me depart. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	11	23	God also raised up as an adversary to him , Rezon the son of Eliada , who had fled from his master ( S ) Hadadezer king of Zobah .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	24	And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band , ( T ) after the killing by David . And they went to Damascus and lived there and made him king in Damascus .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	25	He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon , doing harm as Hadad did . And he loathed Israel and reigned over Syria .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	26	( U ) Jeroboam the son of Nebat , ( V ) an Ephraimite of Zeredah , a servant of Solomon , whose mother 's name was Zeruah , a widow , also ( W ) lifted up his hand against the king .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	27	And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king . ( X ) Solomon built the Millo , and closed up the breach of the city of David his father .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	28	The man Jeroboam was very able , and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	29	And at that time , when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , the prophet ( Y ) Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road . Now Ahijah had dressed himself in a new garment , and the two of them were alone in the open country .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	30	Then Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him , ( Z ) and tore it into twelve pieces .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	31	And he said to Jeroboam , “ Take for yourself ten pieces , for thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , ‘ Behold , ( AA ) I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you ten tribes
ESV	1%20Kings	11	32	( but ( AB ) he shall have one tribe , for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem , ( AC ) the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel ) ,
ESV	1%20Kings	11	33	because they have [ a ] forsaken me ( AD ) and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians , Chemosh the god of Moab , and Milcom the god of the Ammonites , and they have not walked in my ways , doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my rules , as David his father did .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	34	Nevertheless , I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand , but I will make him ruler all the days of his life , for the sake of David my servant whom I chose , who kept my commandments and my statutes .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	35	( AE ) But I will take the kingdom out of his son 's hand and will give it to you , ten tribes .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	36	Yet to his son ( AF ) I will give one tribe , that David my servant may always have ( AG ) a lamp before me in Jerusalem , ( AH ) the city where I have chosen to put my name .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	37	And I will take you , and you shall reign over all that your soul desires , and you shall be king over Israel .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	38	And if you will listen to all that I command you , and will walk in my ways , and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments , as David my servant did , ( AI ) I will be with you and ( AJ ) will build you a sure house , as I built for David , and I will give Israel to you .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	39	And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this , but not forever. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	11	40	Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam . But Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt , to ( AK ) Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	41	( AL ) Now the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon ?
ESV	1%20Kings	11	42	And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years .
ESV	1%20Kings	11	43	And Solomon ( AM ) slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father . And ( AN ) Rehoboam his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	12	1	Kings 12:30 Septuagint went to the one at Bethel and to the other as far as Dan The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Kings	12	12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king said , ( H ) “ Come to me again the third day. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	12	2	Chronicles 10:2 ) ; Hebrew lived in -
ESV	1%20Kings	12	3	And they sent and called him , and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam ,
ESV	1%20Kings	12	4	( E ) “ Your father made our yoke heavy . Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us , and we will serve you. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	12	5	He said to them , ( F ) “ Go away for three days , then come again to me. ” So the people went away .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	6	Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive , saying , “ How do you advise me to answer this people ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	12	7	And they said to him , “ If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them , and speak good words to them when you answer them , then they will be your servants forever. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	12	8	But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	9	And he said to them , “ What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me , ‘ Lighten the yoke that your father put on us ’ ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	12	10	And the young men who had grown up with him said to him , “ Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you , ‘ Your father made our yoke heavy , but you lighten it for us , ’ thus shall you say to them , ‘ My little finger is thicker than my father 's thighs .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	11	And now , whereas ( G ) my father laid on you a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke . My father disciplined you with whips , but I will discipline you with scorpions. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	12	13	And the king answered the people harshly , and forsaking the counsel that the old men had given him ,
ESV	1%20Kings	12	14	he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men , saying , ( I ) “ My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add to your yoke . My father disciplined you with whips , but I will discipline you with scorpions. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	12	15	So the king did not listen to the people , for ( J ) it was a turn of affairs brought about by the Lord that he might fulfill his word , which ( K ) the Lord spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat . The Kingdom Divided
ESV	1%20Kings	12	16	And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them , the people answered the king , “ What portion do we have in David ? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse . ( L ) To your tents , O Israel ! Look now to your own house , David. ” So Israel went to their tents .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	17	But Rehoboam reigned over ( M ) the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	18	Then King Rehoboam sent ( N ) Adoram , who was taskmaster over the forced labor , and all Israel stoned him to death with stones . And King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	19	( O ) So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	20	And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned , they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel . There was none that followed the house of David but ( P ) the tribe of Judah only .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	21	( Q ) When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin , 180,000 chosen warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	22	But the word of God came to ( R ) Shemaiah the man of God :
ESV	1%20Kings	12	23	“ Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and to the ( S ) rest of the people ,
ESV	1%20Kings	12	24	‘ Thus says the Lord , You shall not go up or fight against your relatives the people of Israel . Every man return to his home , ( T ) for this thing is from me. ’ ” So they listened to the word of the Lord and went home again , according to the word of the Lord . Jeroboam 's Golden Calves
ESV	1%20Kings	12	25	Then Jeroboam ( U ) built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there . And he went out from there and ( V ) built Penuel .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	26	And Jeroboam said in his heart , “ Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	27	If this people ( W ) go up to offer sacrifices in the temple of the Lord at Jerusalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord , to Rehoboam king of Judah , and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	12	28	So the king took counsel and ( X ) made two calves of gold . And he said to the people , “ You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough . ( Y ) Behold your gods , O Israel , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	12	29	And he set one in Bethel , and the other he put in Dan .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	30	Then ( Z ) this thing became a sin , for the people went as far as Dan to be before one . [ b ]
ESV	1%20Kings	12	31	He also made ( AA ) temples on high places and ( AB ) appointed priests from among all the people , who were not of the Levites .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	32	And Jeroboam appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like ( AC ) the feast that was in Judah , and he offered sacrifices on the altar . So he did in Bethel , sacrificing to the calves that he made . And he placed in Bethel ( AD ) the priests of the high places that he had made .
ESV	1%20Kings	12	33	He went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month , in the month that he had devised from his own heart . And he instituted a feast for the people of Israel and went up to the altar ( AE ) to make offerings . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	13	1	Kings 13:29 Septuagint ; Hebrew he came to the city of the old prophet The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Kings	13	13	And he said to his sons , “ Saddle the donkey for me. ” So they saddled the donkey for him and he mounted it .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	2	( C ) And the man cried against the altar by the word of the Lord and said , “ O altar , altar , thus says the Lord : ‘ Behold , a son shall be born to the house of David , ( D ) Josiah by name , and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who make offerings on you , and human bones shall be burned on you. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	3	And he gave ( E ) a sign the same day , saying , “ This is the sign that the Lord has spoken : ‘ Behold , the altar shall be torn down , and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	4	And when the king heard the saying of the man of God , which he cried against the altar at Bethel , Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar , saying , “ Seize him. ” And his hand , which he stretched out against him , dried up , so that he could not draw it back to himself .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	5	The altar also was torn down , and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	6	And the king said to the man of God , ( F ) “ Entreat now the favor of the Lord your God , and pray for me , that my hand may be restored to me. ” And the man of God entreated the Lord , and the king 's hand was restored to him and became as it was before .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	7	And the king said to the man of God , “ Come home with me , and refresh yourself , and ( G ) I will give you a reward. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	8	And the man of God said to the king , ( H ) “ If you give me half your house , ( I ) I will not go in with you . And I will not eat bread or drink water in this place ,
ESV	1%20Kings	13	9	for so was it commanded me by the word of the Lord , saying , ‘ You shall neither eat bread nor drink water nor return by the way that you came. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	10	So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel . The Prophet 's Disobedience
ESV	1%20Kings	13	11	Now ( J ) an old prophet lived in Bethel . And his sons [ a ] came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel . They also told to their father the words that he had spoken to the king .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	12	And their father said to them , “ Which way did he go ? ” And his sons showed him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	14	And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak . And he said to him , “ Are you the man of God who came from Judah ? ” And he said , “ I am. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	15	Then he said to him , “ Come home with me and eat bread. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	16	And he said , ( K ) “ I may not return with you , or go in with you , neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place ,
ESV	1%20Kings	13	17	for it was said to me ( L ) by the word of the Lord , ‘ You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there , nor return by the way that you came. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	18	And he said to him , “ I also am a prophet as you are , and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord , saying , ‘ Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water. ’ ” But he lied to him .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	19	So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	20	And as they sat at the table , the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	21	And he cried to the man of God who came from Judah , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘ Because you have disobeyed the word of the Lord and have not kept the command that the Lord your God commanded you ,
ESV	1%20Kings	13	22	but have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you , “ Eat no bread and drink no water , ” your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	23	And after he had eaten bread and drunk , he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	24	And as he went away ( M ) a lion met him on the road and killed him . And his body was thrown in the road , and the donkey stood beside it ; the lion also stood beside the body .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	25	And behold , men passed by and saw the body thrown in the road and the lion standing by the body . And they came and told it in the city where ( N ) the old prophet lived .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	26	And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it , he said , “ It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the Lord ; therefore the Lord has given him to the lion , which has torn him and killed him , according to the word that the Lord spoke to him. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	27	And he said to his sons , “ Saddle the donkey for me. ” And they saddled it .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	28	And he went and found his body thrown in the road , and the donkey and the lion standing beside the body . The lion had not eaten the body or torn the donkey .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	29	And the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back to the city [ b ] to mourn and to bury him .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	30	And he laid the body in his own grave . And they mourned over him , saying , ( O ) “ Alas , my brother ! ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	31	And after he had buried him , he said to his sons , “ When I die , bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried ; ( P ) lay my bones beside his bones .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	32	( Q ) For the saying that he called out by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel and against ( R ) all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of ( S ) Samaria shall surely come to pass. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	13	33	After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way , but made priests for the high places again from among all the people . Any who would , he ordained to be priests of the high places .
ESV	1%20Kings	13	34	( T ) And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam , ( U ) so as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	14	14	( U ) Moreover , the Lord will raise up for himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam today . And henceforth ,
ESV	1%20Kings	14	2	And Jeroboam said to his wife , “ Arise , and disguise yourself , that it not be known that you are the wife of Jeroboam , and go to ( A ) Shiloh . Behold , Ahijah the prophet is there , ( B ) who said of me that I should be king over this people .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	3	( C ) Take with you ten loaves , some cakes , and a jar of honey , and go to him . He will tell you what shall happen to the child. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	14	4	Jeroboam 's wife did so . She arose and went to ( D ) Shiloh and came to the house of ( E ) Ahijah . Now ( F ) Ahijah could not see , for his eyes were dim because of his age .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	5	And the Lord said to ( G ) Ahijah , “ Behold , the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son , for he is sick . Thus and thus shall you say to her. ” When she came , she pretended to be another woman .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	6	But when ( H ) Ahijah heard the sound of her feet , as she came in at the door , he said , “ Come in , wife of Jeroboam . Why do you pretend to be another ? For I am charged with unbearable news for you .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	7	Go , tell Jeroboam , ‘ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : ( I ) “ Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over my people Israel
ESV	1%20Kings	14	8	and ( J ) tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you , and yet you have not been ( K ) like my servant David , who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart , doing only that which was right in my eyes ,
ESV	1%20Kings	14	9	but you have done evil above all who were before you and have gone and ( L ) made for yourself other gods and ( M ) metal images , provoking me to anger , and ( N ) have cast me behind your back ,
ESV	1%20Kings	14	10	therefore behold , I will bring harm upon the house of Jeroboam and ( O ) will cut off from Jeroboam every male , ( P ) both bond and free in Israel , and ( Q ) will burn up the house of Jeroboam , as a man burns up dung until it is all gone .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	11	( R ) Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat , and anyone who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat , for the Lord has spoken it. ” ’
ESV	1%20Kings	14	12	Arise therefore , go to your house . ( S ) When your feet enter the city , the child shall die .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	13	And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him , for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave , because in him ( T ) there is found something pleasing to the Lord , the God of Israel , in the house of Jeroboam .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	15	the Lord will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water , and ( V ) root up Israel out of ( W ) this good land that he gave to their fathers and scatter them ( X ) beyond the Euphrates , [ a ] because they have made their ( Y ) Asherim , provoking the Lord to anger .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	16	And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , which he sinned and made Israel to sin. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	14	17	Then Jeroboam 's wife arose and departed and came to ( Z ) Tirzah . And ( AA ) as she came to the threshold of the house , the child died .

ESV	1%20Kings	14	21	( AD ) Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah . Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , ( AE ) the city that the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , to put his name there . ( AF ) His mother 's name was Naamah the Ammonite .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	22	( AG ) And Judah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , and they ( AH ) provoked him to jealousy with their sins that they committed , more than all that their fathers had done .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	23	For they also built for themselves ( AI ) high places ( AJ ) and pillars and ( AK ) Asherim on every high hill and ( AL ) under every green tree ,
ESV	1%20Kings	14	24	and there were also ( AM ) male cult prostitutes in the land . They did according to all the abominations of the nations that the Lord drove out before the people of Israel .
ESV	1%20Kings	14	25	( AN ) In the fifth year of King Rehoboam , Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem .

ESV	1%20Kings	14	28	And as often as the king went into the house of the Lord , the guard carried them and brought them back to the guardroom .

ESV	1%20Kings	15	2	He reigned for three years in Jerusalem . His mother 's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	3	And he walked in all the sins that his father did before him , and ( B ) his heart was not wholly true to the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	4	Nevertheless , for David 's sake the Lord his God gave him ( C ) a lamp in Jerusalem , setting up his son after him , and establishing Jerusalem ,
ESV	1%20Kings	15	5	because ( D ) David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , ( E ) except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	6	( F ) Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	7	( G ) The rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ? ( H ) And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .

ESV	1%20Kings	15	9	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel , Asa began to reign over Judah ,
ESV	1%20Kings	15	10	and he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem . His mother 's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	11	( J ) And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord , as David his father had done .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	12	He put away the ( K ) male cult prostitutes out of the land and removed ( L ) all the idols that his fathers had made .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	13	( M ) He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother because she had made an abominable image for Asherah . And Asa cut down her image and ( N ) burned it at the brook Kidron .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	14	( O ) But the high places were not taken away . Nevertheless , ( P ) the heart of Asa was wholly true to the Lord all his days .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	16	( R ) And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	17	( S ) Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and ( T ) built Ramah , ( U ) that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold ( V ) that were left in the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king 's house and gave them into the hands of his servants . ( W ) And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon , the son of Hezion , king of Syria , ( X ) who lived in Damascus , saying ,
ESV	1%20Kings	15	19	“ Let there be ( Y ) a covenant [ a ] between me and you , as there was between my father and your father . Behold , I am sending to you a present of silver and gold . Go , break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel , that he may withdraw from me. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	15	20	And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel and conquered ( Z ) Ijon , ( AA ) Dan , ( AB ) Abel-beth-maacah , and all ( AC ) Chinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	21	And when Baasha heard of it , ( AD ) he stopped building Ramah , and he lived in ( AE ) Tirzah .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	22	Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah , none was exempt , and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber , with which Baasha had been building , and with them King Asa built ( AF ) Geba of Benjamin and ( AG ) Mizpah .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	23	( AH ) Now the rest of all the acts of Asa , all his might , and all that he did , and the cities that he built , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	24	And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father , and ( AI ) Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place . Nadab Reigns in Israel
ESV	1%20Kings	15	25	( AJ ) Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah , and he reigned over Israel two years .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	26	He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord ( AK ) and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin ( AL ) which he made Israel to sin .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	27	( AM ) Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him . And Baasha struck him down at ( AN ) Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines , for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	28	So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	29	And as soon as he was king , he killed all the house of Jeroboam . He left to the house of Jeroboam not one that breathed , until he had destroyed it , ( AO ) according to the word of the Lord that he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	30	It was for the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned and ( AP ) that he made Israel to sin , and because of the anger to which he provoked the Lord , the God of Israel .
ESV	1%20Kings	15	31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
ESV	1%20Kings	15	32	( AQ ) And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days . Baasha Reigns in Israel

ESV	1%20Kings	16	16	and the troops who were encamped heard it said , “ Zimri has conspired , and he has killed the king. ” Therefore all Israel made Omri , the commander of the army , king over Israel that day in the camp .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	2	“ Since I ( C ) exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel , and ( D ) you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made my people Israel to sin , provoking me to anger with their sins ,
ESV	1%20Kings	16	3	behold , I will utterly ( E ) sweep away ( F ) Baasha and his house , and I will make your house ( G ) like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	4	( H ) Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat , and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens shall eat. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	16	5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
ESV	1%20Kings	16	6	And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried at ( I ) Tirzah , and Elah his son reigned in his place .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	7	Moreover , the word of the Lord came by the prophet ( J ) Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house , both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord , provoking him to anger with the work of his hands , in being like the house of Jeroboam , and also because ( K ) he destroyed it . Elah Reigns in Israel
ESV	1%20Kings	16	8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah , Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah , and he reigned two years .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	9	But his servant ( L ) Zimri , commander of half his chariots , conspired against him . When he was at Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , ( M ) who was over the household in Tirzah ,
ESV	1%20Kings	16	10	Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him , in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned in his place .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	11	When he began to reign , as soon as he had seated himself on his throne , he struck down ( N ) all the house of Baasha . He ( O ) did not leave him a single male of his relatives or his friends .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	12	Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha , ( P ) according to the word of the Lord , which he spoke against Baasha by ( Q ) Jehu the prophet ,
ESV	1%20Kings	16	13	for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son , which they sinned and which they made Israel to sin , ( R ) provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their idols .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ? Zimri Reigns in Israel
ESV	1%20Kings	16	15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah , Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah . Now the troops were encamped against ( S ) Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ,
ESV	1%20Kings	16	17	So Omri went up from Gibbethon , and all Israel with him , and they besieged Tirzah .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	18	And when Zimri saw that the city was taken , he went into the citadel of the king 's house and burned the king 's house over him with fire and died ,
ESV	1%20Kings	16	19	because of his sins that he committed , doing evil in the sight of the Lord , ( T ) walking in the way of Jeroboam , and for his sin which he committed , making Israel to sin .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and the conspiracy that he made , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ? Omri Reigns in Israel
ESV	1%20Kings	16	21	Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts . Half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king , and half followed Omri .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	22	But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath . So Tibni died , and Omri became king .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	23	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah , Omri began to reign over Israel , and he reigned for twelve years ; six years he reigned in Tirzah .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	24	He bought the hill of ( U ) Samaria from Shemer for two talents [ a ] of silver , and he fortified the hill and called the name of the city that he built ( V ) Samaria , after the name of Shemer , the owner of the hill .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	25	( W ) Omri did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , and did more evil ( X ) than all who were before him .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	26	For ( Y ) he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in the sins that he made Israel to sin , ( Z ) provoking the Lord , the God of Israel , to anger by their idols .

ESV	1%20Kings	16	29	In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah , Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel , and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	30	And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord , ( AA ) more than all who were before him .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	31	And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , ( AB ) he took for his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the ( AC ) Sidonians , ( AD ) and went and served Baal and worshiped him .
ESV	1%20Kings	16	32	He erected an altar for Baal in ( AE ) the house of Baal , which he built in Samaria .

ESV	1%20Kings	17	17	After this the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , became ill. And his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him .
ESV	1%20Kings	17	2	And the word of the Lord came to him :
ESV	1%20Kings	17	3	“ Depart from here and turn eastward and hide yourself by the brook Cherith , which is east of the Jordan .
ESV	1%20Kings	17	4	You shall drink from the brook , and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	17	5	So he went and did according to the word of the Lord . He went and lived by the brook Cherith that is east of the Jordan .
ESV	1%20Kings	17	6	And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning , and bread and meat in the evening , and he drank from the brook .
ESV	1%20Kings	17	7	And after a while the brook dried up , because there was no rain in the land . The Widow of Zarephath
ESV	1%20Kings	17	8	Then the word of the Lord came to him ,

ESV	1%20Kings	17	10	So he arose and went to ( F ) Zarephath . And when he came to the gate of the city , behold , a widow was there ( G ) gathering sticks . And he called to her and said , “ Bring me a little water in a vessel , that I may drink. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	17	11	And as she was going to bring it , he called to her and said , “ Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	17	12	And she said , ( H ) “ As the Lord your God lives , I have nothing baked , only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug . And now I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son , that we may eat it and die. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	17	13	And Elijah said to her , “ Do not fear ; go and do as you have said . But first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me , and afterward make something for yourself and your son .
ESV	1%20Kings	17	14	For thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , ‘ The jar of flour shall not be spent , and the jug of oil shall not be empty , until the day that the Lord sends rain upon the earth. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	17	15	And she went and did as Elijah said . And she and he and her household ate for many days .
ESV	1%20Kings	17	16	The jar of flour was not spent , neither did the jug of oil become empty , according to the word of the Lord that he spoke by Elijah . Elijah Raises the Widow 's Son
ESV	1%20Kings	17	18	And she said to Elijah , ( I ) “ What have you against me , O ( J ) man of God ? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to cause the death of my son ! ”
ESV	1%20Kings	17	19	And he said to her , “ Give me your son. ” And he took him from her arms and carried him up into the upper chamber where he lodged , and laid him on his own bed .
ESV	1%20Kings	17	20	And he cried to the Lord , “ O Lord my God , have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn , by killing her son ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	17	21	( K ) Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the Lord , “ O Lord my God , let this child 's life [ b ] come into him again. ”

ESV	1%20Kings	18	2	So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab . Now the famine was severe in Samaria .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	3	And Ahab called Obadiah , who was ( B ) over the household . ( Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly ,
ESV	1%20Kings	18	4	and ( C ) when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord , Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water . )
ESV	1%20Kings	18	5	And Ahab said to Obadiah , “ Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys . Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive , and not lose some of the animals. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	6	So they divided the land between them to pass through it . Ahab went in one direction by himself , and Obadiah went in another direction by himself .

ESV	1%20Kings	18	8	And he answered him , “ It is I . Go , tell your lord , ‘ Behold , Elijah is here. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	9	And he said , “ How have I sinned , that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab , to kill me ?
ESV	1%20Kings	18	10	( D ) As the Lord your God lives , there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you . And when they would say , ‘ He is not here , ’ he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation , that they had not found you .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	11	And now you say , ‘ Go , tell your lord , “ Behold , Elijah is here. ” ’
ESV	1%20Kings	18	12	And as soon as I have gone from you , ( E ) the Spirit of the Lord will carry you I know not where . And so , when I come and tell Ahab and he can not find you , he will kill me , although I your servant have feared the Lord from my youth .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	13	Has it not been told my lord what I did ( F ) when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord , how I hid a hundred men of the Lord 's prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water ?
ESV	1%20Kings	18	14	And now you say , ‘ Go , tell your lord , “ Behold , Elijah is here ” ’ ; and he will kill me. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	15	And Elijah said , ( G ) “ As the Lord of hosts lives , before whom I stand , I will surely show myself to him today. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab , and told him . And Ahab went to meet Elijah .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	17	When Ahab saw Elijah , Ahab said to him , ( H ) “ Is it you , you ( I ) troubler of Israel ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	19	Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount ( L ) Carmel , and the ( M )
ESV	1%20Kings	18	450	men .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	400	prophets of Asherah , ( O ) who eat at Jezebel 's table. ” The Prophets of Baal Defeated
ESV	1%20Kings	18	20	So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	21	And Elijah came near to all the people and said , “ How long ( P ) will you go limping between two different opinions ? ( Q ) If the Lord is God , follow him ; but if Baal , then follow him. ” And the people did not answer him a word .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	22	Then Elijah said to the people , ( R ) “ I , even I only , am left a prophet of the Lord , but Baal 's prophets are ( S )
ESV	1%20Kings	18	23	Let two bulls be given to us , and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood , but put no fire to it . And I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	24	And you call upon the name of your god , and I will call upon the name of the Lord , and the God who ( T ) answers by fire , he is God. ” And all the people answered , “ It is well spoken. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , “ Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first , for you are many , and call upon the name of your god , but put no fire to it. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	26	And they took the bull that was given them , and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon , saying , “ O Baal , answer us ! ” But there was no voice , and no one answered . And they limped around the altar that they had made .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	27	And at noon Elijah mocked them , saying , “ Cry aloud , for he is a god . Either he is musing , or he is relieving himself , or he is on a journey , or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	28	And they cried aloud and ( U ) cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances , until the blood gushed out upon them .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	29	And as midday passed , they raved on until the time of ( V ) the offering of the oblation , but there was no voice . No one answered ; no one paid attention .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	30	Then Elijah said to all the people , “ Come near to me. ” And all the people came near to him . And he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been ( W ) thrown down .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	31	Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , to whom the word of the Lord came , saying , ( X ) “ Israel shall be your name , ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	32	and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord . And he made a trench about the altar , as great as would contain two seahs [ a ] of seed .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	33	( Y ) And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood . And he said , “ Fill four jars with water and ( Z ) pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	34	And he said , “ Do it a second time. ” And they did it a second time . And he said , “ Do it a third time. ” And they did it a third time .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	35	And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	36	And at the time of ( AA ) the offering of the oblation , Elijah the prophet came near and said , “ O Lord , ( AB ) God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , let it be known this day that ( AC ) you are God in Israel , and that I am your servant , and that ( AD ) I have done all these things at your word .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	37	Answer me , O Lord , answer me , that this people may know that you , O Lord , are God , and that you have turned their hearts back. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	38	( AE ) Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	39	And when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces and said , ( AF ) “ The Lord , he is God ; the Lord , he is God. ”

ESV	1%20Kings	18	41	And Elijah said to Ahab , “ Go up , eat and drink , for there is a sound of the rushing of rain. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	18	42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink . And Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel . ( AI ) And he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees .
ESV	1%20Kings	18	43	And he said to his servant , “ Go up now , look toward the sea. ” And he went up and looked and said , “ There is nothing. ” And he said , “ Go again , ” seven times .

ESV	1%20Kings	19	19	So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat , who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen in front of him , and he was with the twelfth . Elijah passed by him and cast ( Z ) his cloak upon him .
ESV	1%20Kings	19	2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah , saying , ( B ) “ So may the gods do to me and more also , if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	19	3	Then he was afraid , and he arose and ran for his life and came to ( C ) Beersheba , which belongs to Judah , and left his servant there .
ESV	1%20Kings	19	4	But he himself went a day 's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree . ( D ) And he asked that he might die , saying , “ It is enough ; now , O Lord , take away my life , for I am no better than my fathers. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	19	5	And he lay down and slept under a broom tree . And behold , an angel touched him and said to him , “ Arise and eat. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	19	6	And he looked , and behold , there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water . And he ate and drank and lay down again .
ESV	1%20Kings	19	7	And the angel of the Lord came again a second time and touched him and said , “ Arise and eat , for the journey is too great for you. ”

ESV	1%20Kings	19	10	He said , “ I have been very ( H ) jealous for the Lord , the God of hosts . For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant , ( I ) thrown down your altars , and ( J ) killed your prophets with the sword , ( K ) and I , even I only , am left , and they seek my life , to take it away. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	19	11	And he said , “ Go out and ( L ) stand on the mount before the Lord. ” And behold , the Lord passed by , and ( M ) a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord , but the Lord was not in the wind . And after the wind ( N ) an earthquake , but the Lord was not in the earthquake .
ESV	1%20Kings	19	12	And after the earthquake a fire , but the Lord was not in the fire . And after the fire the sound of a low whisper . [ a ]
ESV	1%20Kings	19	13	And when Elijah heard it , ( O ) he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave . And behold , ( P ) there came a voice to him and said , “ What are you doing here , Elijah ? ”

For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant , ( R ) thrown down your altars , and killed your prophets with the sword , and I , even I only , am left , and they seek my life , to take it away. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	19	15	And the Lord said to him , “ Go , return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus . And when you arrive , you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria .

ESV	1%20Kings	19	21	And he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh ( AB ) with the yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people , and they ate . Then he arose and went after Elijah and assisted him . Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	20	20	And each struck down his man . The Syrians fled , and Israel pursued them , but Ben-hadad king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	2	And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him , “ Thus says Ben-hadad :
ESV	1%20Kings	20	3	‘ Your silver and your gold are mine ; your best wives and children also are mine. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	4	And the king of Israel answered , “ As you say , my lord , O king , I am yours , and all that I have. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	5	The messengers came again and said , “ Thus says Ben-hadad : ‘ I sent to you , saying , “ Deliver to me your silver and your gold , your wives and your children. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	6	Nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time , and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants and lay hands on whatever pleases you and take it away. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	7	Then the king of Israel called all the ( D ) elders of the land and said , ( E ) “ Mark , now , and see how this man is seeking trouble , for he sent to me for my wives and my children , and for my silver and my gold , and I did not refuse him. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	8	And all the elders and all the people said to him , “ Do not listen or consent. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	9	So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad , “ Tell my lord the king , ‘ All that you first demanded of your servant I will do , but this thing I can not do. ’ ” And the messengers departed and brought him word again .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	10	Ben-hadad sent to him and said , ( F ) “ The gods do so to me and more also , if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people ( G ) who follow me. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	11	And the king of Israel answered , “ Tell him , ‘ Let not him who straps on his armor boast himself as he who takes it off. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	12	When Ben-hadad heard this message as ( H ) he was drinking with the kings in the booths , he said to his men , “ Take your positions. ” And they took their positions against the city . Ahab Defeats Ben-hadad
ESV	1%20Kings	20	13	And behold , a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said , “ Thus says the Lord , Have you seen all this great multitude ? Behold , ( I ) I will give it into your hand this day , ( J ) and you shall know that I am the Lord. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	14	And Ahab said , “ By whom ? ” He said , “ Thus says the Lord , By the servants of the governors of the districts. ” Then he said , “ Who shall begin the battle ? ” He answered , “ You. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	15	Then he mustered the servants of the governors of the districts , and they were
ESV	1%20Kings	20	232	. And after them he mustered all the people of Israel , seven thousand .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	16	And they went out at noon , while Ben-hadad ( K ) was drinking himself drunk in the booths , he and the thirty-two kings who helped him .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	17	The servants of the governors of the districts went out first . And Ben-hadad sent out scouts , and they reported to him , “ Men are coming out from Samaria. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	18	He said , “ If they have come out for peace , take them alive . Or if they have come out for war , take them alive. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	19	So these went out of the city , the servants of the governors of the districts and the army that followed them .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	21	And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots , and struck the Syrians with a great blow .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	22	Then ( L ) the prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him , “ Come , strengthen yourself , and consider well what you have to do , for ( M ) in the spring the king of Syria will come up against you. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	23	And the servants of the king of Syria said to him , “ Their gods are gods of the hills , and so they were stronger than we . But let us fight against them in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	24	And do this : remove the kings , each from his post , and put commanders in their places ,
ESV	1%20Kings	20	25	and muster an army like the army that you have lost , horse for horse , and chariot for chariot . Then we will fight against them in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they. ” And he listened to their voice and did so . Ahab Defeats Ben-hadad Again
ESV	1%20Kings	20	26	( N ) In the spring , Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to ( O ) Aphek to fight against Israel .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	27	And the people of Israel were mustered and were provisioned and went against them . The people of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats , but the Syrians filled the country .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	28	And a ( P ) man of God came near and said to the king of Israel , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘ Because the Syrians have said , ( Q ) “ The Lord is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys , ” therefore ( R ) I will give all this great multitude into your hand , and you shall know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	29	And they encamped opposite one another seven days . Then on the seventh day the battle was joined . And the people of Israel struck down of the Syrians 100,000 foot soldiers in one day .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	30	And the rest fled into the city of ( S ) Aphek , and the wall fell upon 27,000 men who were left . Ben-hadad also fled and entered ( T ) an inner chamber in the city .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	31	And his servants said to him , “ Behold now , we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings . Let us ( U ) put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel . Perhaps he will spare your life. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	32	So they ( V ) tied sackcloth around their waists and put ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel and said , “ Your servant Ben-hadad says , ‘ Please , let me live. ’ ” And he said , “ Does he still live ? He is my brother. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	33	Now the men were watching for a sign , and they quickly took it up from him and said , “ Yes , your brother Ben-hadad. ” Then he said , “ Go and bring him. ” Then Ben-hadad came out to him , and he caused him to come up into the chariot .

ESV	1%20Kings	20	35	And a certain man of ( Y ) the sons of the prophets said to his fellow ( Z ) at the command of the Lord , “ Strike me , please. ” But the man refused to strike him .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	36	Then he said to him , “ Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord , behold , as soon as you have gone from me , a lion shall strike you down. ” And as soon as he had departed from him , ( AA ) a lion met him and struck him down .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	37	Then he found another man and said , “ Strike me , please. ” And the man struck him—struck him and wounded him .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	38	So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way , ( AB ) disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	39	And as the king passed , he cried to the king and said , “ Your servant went out into the midst of the battle , and behold , a soldier turned and brought a man to me and said , ‘ Guard this man ; if by any means he is missing , ( AC ) your life shall be for his life , or else you shall pay a talent [ a ] of silver. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	20	40	And as your servant was busy here and there , he was gone. ” The king of Israel said to him , “ So shall your judgment be ; you yourself have decided it. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	20	41	Then he hurried to take the bandage away from his eyes , and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets .
ESV	1%20Kings	20	42	And he said to him , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘ Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction , [ b ] therefore ( AD ) your life shall be for his life , and your people for his people. ’ ”

ESV	1%20Kings	21	1	Kings 21:10 Hebrew blessed ; also verse
ESV	1%20Kings	21	21	Behold , I will bring disaster upon you . I will utterly burn you up , and ( P ) will cut off from Ahab every male , bond or free , in Israel .
ESV	1%20Kings	21	2	And after this Ahab said to Naboth , ( B ) “ Give me your vineyard , that I may have it for a vegetable garden , because it is near my house , and I will give you a better vineyard for it ; or , if it seems good to you , I will give you its value in money. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	21	3	But Naboth said to Ahab , “ The Lord forbid ( C ) that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	21	4	And Ahab ( D ) went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him , for he had said , “ I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. ” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no food .
ESV	1%20Kings	21	5	But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him , “ Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	21	6	And he said to her , “ Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him , ‘ Give me your vineyard for money , or else , if it please you , I will give you another vineyard for it. ’ And he answered , ‘ I will not give you my vineyard. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	21	7	And Jezebel his wife said to him , “ Do you now govern Israel ? Arise and eat bread and let your heart be cheerful ; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	21	8	( E ) So she wrote letters in Ahab 's name and sealed them with his seal , and she sent the letters to ( F ) the elders and the leaders who lived with Naboth in his city .
ESV	1%20Kings	21	9	And she wrote in the letters , “ Proclaim a fast , and set Naboth at the head of the people .
ESV	1%20Kings	21	10	And set two ( G ) worthless men opposite him , and let them bring a charge against him , saying , ( H ) ‘ You have cursed [ a ] God and the king. ’ Then take him out and stone him to death. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	21	11	And the men of his city , ( I ) the elders and the leaders who lived in his city , did as Jezebel had sent word to them . As it was written in the letters that she had sent to them ,
ESV	1%20Kings	21	12	( J ) they proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people .
ESV	1%20Kings	21	13	The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	1%20Kings	21	14	Then they sent to Jezebel , saying , “ Naboth has been stoned ; he is dead. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	21	15	As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead , Jezebel said to Ahab , “ Arise , take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , which he refused to give you for money , for Naboth is not alive , but dead. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	21	16	And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it . The Lord Condemns Ahab
ESV	1%20Kings	21	17	( K ) Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
ESV	1%20Kings	21	18	“ Arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who is in ( L ) Samaria ; behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , where he has gone to take possession .
ESV	1%20Kings	21	19	And you shall say to him , ‘ Thus says the Lord , “ Have you killed and also taken possession ? ” ’ And you shall say to him , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( M ) “ In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood. ” ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	21	20	Ahab said to Elijah , ( N ) “ Have you found me , O my enemy ? ” He answered , “ I have found you , because ( O ) you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the Lord .
ESV	1%20Kings	21	22	And I will make your house like ( Q ) the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like ( R ) the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the anger to which you have provoked me , and because you ( S ) have made Israel to sin .
ESV	1%20Kings	21	23	And of Jezebel the Lord also said , ( T ) ‘ The dogs shall eat Jezebel within ( U ) the walls of Jezreel. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	21	24	( V ) Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat , and anyone of his who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat. ” Ahab 's Repentance
ESV	1%20Kings	21	25	( ( W ) There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the Lord like Ahab , whom Jezebel his wife incited .
ESV	1%20Kings	21	26	He acted very abominably in going after ( X ) idols , as ( Y ) the Amorites had done , whom the Lord cast out before the people of Israel . )
ESV	1%20Kings	21	27	And when Ahab heard those words , he ( Z ) tore his clothes and ( AA ) put sackcloth on his flesh and ( AB ) fasted and lay in sackcloth and went about dejectedly .
ESV	1%20Kings	21	28	And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
ESV	1%20Kings	21	29	“ Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me ? Because he has humbled himself before me , I will not bring the disaster in his days ; ( AC ) but in his son 's days I will bring the disaster upon his house. ” Footnotes -

ESV	1%20Kings	22	22	And the Lord said to him , ‘ By what means ? ’ And he said , ‘ I will go out , and will be ( P ) a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. ’ And he said , ‘ You are to entice him , and you shall succeed ; go out and do so. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	22	2	( A ) But in the third year ( B ) Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	3	And the king of Israel said to his servants , “ Do you know that ( C ) Ramoth-gilead belongs to us , and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	4	And he said to Jehoshaphat , “ Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead ? ” And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , ( D ) “ I am as you are , my people as your people , my horses as your horses. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	5	And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , “ Inquire first for the word of the Lord. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	6	Then the king of Israel ( E ) gathered the prophets together , about four hundred men , and said to them , “ Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead , or shall I refrain ? ” And they said , “ Go up , for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	7	But ( F ) Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there not here another prophet of the Lord of whom we may inquire ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	8	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord , Micaiah the son of Imlah , but I hate him , for he never prophesies good concerning me , but evil. ” And Jehoshaphat said , “ Let not the king say so. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	9	Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said , “ Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	10	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones , arrayed in their robes , at the threshing floor ( G ) at the entrance of the gate of Samaria , and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	11	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself ( H ) horns of iron and said , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘ With these ( I ) you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	12	And all the prophets prophesied so and said , “ Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph ; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king. ” Micaiah Prophesies Against Ahab
ESV	1%20Kings	22	13	And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him , “ Behold , the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king . Let your word be like the word of one of them , and speak favorably. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	14	But Micaiah said , ( J ) “ As the Lord lives , ( K ) what the Lord says to me , that I will speak. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	15	And when he had come to the king , the king said to him , “ Micaiah , shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle , or shall we refrain ? ” And he answered him , “ Go up and triumph ; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	16	But the king said to him , “ How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	17	And he said , “ I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains , ( L ) as sheep that have no shepherd . And the Lord said , ‘ These have no master ; let each return to his home in peace. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	18	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , ( M ) “ Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me , but evil ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	19	And Micaiah said , “ Therefore hear the word of the Lord : ( N ) I saw the Lord sitting on his throne , ( O ) and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left ;
ESV	1%20Kings	22	20	and the Lord said , ‘ Who will entice Ahab , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead ? ’ And one said one thing , and another said another .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	21	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord , saying , ‘ I will entice him. ’
ESV	1%20Kings	22	23	Now therefore behold , the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets ; the Lord has declared disaster for you. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	24	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near ( Q ) and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said , “ How did the Spirit of the Lord go from me to speak to you ? ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	25	And Micaiah said , “ Behold , you shall see on that day when you go ( R ) into an inner chamber to hide yourself. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	26	And the king of Israel said , “ Seize Micaiah , and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king 's son ,
ESV	1%20Kings	22	27	and say , ‘ Thus says the king , ( S ) “ Put this fellow in prison and feed him meager rations of bread and water , ( T ) until I come in peace. ” ’ ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	28	And Micaiah said , “ If you return in peace , ( U ) the Lord has not spoken by me. ” And he said , ( V ) “ Hear , all you peoples ! ” Ahab Killed in Battle
ESV	1%20Kings	22	29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	30	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , ( W ) “ I will disguise myself and go into battle , but you wear your robes. ” And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	31	Now the king of Syria had commanded ( X ) the thirty-two captains of his chariots , “ Fight with neither small nor great , but only with the king of Israel. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	32	And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , they said , “ It is surely the king of Israel. ” So they turned to fight against him . And Jehoshaphat cried out .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	33	And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back from pursuing him .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	34	But a certain man drew his bow at random [ a ] and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate . Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot , “ Turn around and carry me out of the battle , ( Y ) for I am wounded. ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	35	And the battle continued that day , and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians , until at evening he died . And the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	36	And about sunset a cry went through the army , “ Every man to his city , and every man to his country ! ”
ESV	1%20Kings	22	37	So the king died , and was brought to Samaria . And they buried the king in Samaria .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	38	And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria , and the dogs licked up his blood , and the prostitutes washed themselves in it , ( Z ) according to the word of the Lord that he had spoken .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did , and ( AA ) the ivory house that he built and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
ESV	1%20Kings	22	40	So Ahab slept with his fathers , and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place . Jehoshaphat Reigns in Judah
ESV	1%20Kings	22	41	( AB ) Jehoshaphat the son of ( AC ) Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel .

ESV	1%20Kings	22	43	( AD ) He walked in all the way of Asa his father . He did not turn aside from it , doing what was right in the sight of the Lord . Yet ( AE ) the high places were not taken away , and the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	44	( AF ) Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he showed , and how he warred , are they not written ( AG ) in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
ESV	1%20Kings	22	46	And from the land he exterminated the remnant ( AH ) of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the days of his father Asa .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	47	( AI ) There was no king in Edom ; a deputy was king .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	48	Jehoshaphat made ( AJ ) ships of Tarshish to go to ( AK ) Ophir for gold , but they did not go , for the ships were wrecked at ( AL ) Ezion-geber .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	49	Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , “ Let my servants go with your servants in the ships , ” but Jehoshaphat was not willing .
ESV	1%20Kings	22	50	( AM ) And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father , and Jehoram his son reigned in his place . Ahaziah Reigns in Israel
ESV	1%20Kings	22	51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab ( AN ) began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and he reigned two years over Israel .

ESV	1%20Kings	22	53	( AP ) He served Baal and worshiped him and provoked the Lord , the God of Israel , to anger ( AQ ) in every way that his father had done . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Kings	1	2	Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria , and lay sick ; so he sent messengers , telling them , “ Go , inquire of ( C ) Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron , ( D ) whether I shall recover from this sickness. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	1	1	( A ) After the death of Ahab , Moab ( B ) rebelled against Israel .
ESV	2%20Kings	1	3	But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah ( E ) the Tishbite , “ Arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria , and say to them , ‘ Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of ( F ) Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron ?
ESV	2%20Kings	1	4	Now therefore thus says the Lord , ( G ) You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up , but you shall surely die. ’ ” So Elijah went .
ESV	2%20Kings	1	5	The messengers returned to the king , and he said to them , “ Why have you returned ? ”
ESV	2%20Kings	1	6	And they said to him , “ There came a man to meet us , and said to us , ‘ Go back to the king who sent you , and say to him , Thus says the Lord , Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of ( H ) Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron ? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up , but you shall surely die. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Kings	1	7	He said to them , “ What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things ? ”
ESV	2%20Kings	1	8	They answered him , ( I ) “ He wore a garment of hair , with a belt of leather about his waist. ” And he said , “ It is Elijah the Tishbite. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	1	9	Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty . He went up to Elijah , who was sitting on the top of a hill , and said to him , ( J ) “ O man of God , the king says , ‘ Come down. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Kings	1	10	But Elijah answered the captain of fifty , “ If I am a man of God , ( K ) let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty. ” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty .
ESV	2%20Kings	1	11	Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty . And he answered and said to him , “ O man of God , this is the king 's order , ‘ Come down quickly ! ’ ”
ESV	2%20Kings	1	12	But Elijah answered them , “ If I am a man of God , ( L ) let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty. ” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty .
ESV	2%20Kings	1	13	Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty . And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and entreated him , “ O man of God , please let my life , and the life of these fifty servants of yours , ( M ) be precious in your sight .
ESV	2%20Kings	1	14	Behold , fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties , but now let my life be precious in your sight. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	1	15	Then the angel of the Lord said to Elijah , “ Go down with him ; do not be afraid of him. ” So he arose and went down with him to the king
ESV	2%20Kings	1	16	and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘ Because you have sent messengers to inquire of ( N ) Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron—is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word ? —therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up , but you shall surely die. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Kings	1	17	So he died according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken . Jehoram became king in his place ( O ) in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat , king of Judah , because Ahaziah had no son .

ESV	2%20Kings	2	2	And Elijah said to Elisha , ( D ) “ Please stay here , for the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel. ” But Elisha said , ( E ) “ As the Lord lives , and as you yourself live , I will not leave you. ” So they went down to Bethel .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	3	And ( F ) the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him , “ Do you know that today the Lord will take away your master from over you ? ” And he said , “ Yes , I know it ; keep quiet. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	2	4	Elijah said to him , “ Elisha , ( G ) please stay here , for the Lord has sent me to ( H ) Jericho. ” But he said , ( I ) “ As the Lord lives , and as you yourself live , I will not leave you. ” So they came to Jericho .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	5	( J ) The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha and said to him , “ Do you know that today the Lord will take away your master from over you ? ” And he answered , “ Yes , I know it ; keep quiet. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	2	6	Then Elijah said to him , ( K ) “ Please stay here , for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan. ” But he said , “ As the Lord lives , and as you yourself live , I will not leave you. ” So the two of them went on .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	7	Fifty men of ( L ) the sons of the prophets also went and stood at some distance from them , as they both were standing by the Jordan .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	8	Then Elijah ( M ) took his cloak and rolled it up and struck the water , ( N ) and the water was parted to the one side and to the other , till the two of them could go over on dry ground .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	9	When they had crossed , Elijah said to Elisha , “ Ask what I shall do for you , before I am taken from you. ” And Elisha said , “ Please let there be a double portion of your spirit on me. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	2	10	And he said , “ You have asked a hard thing ; yet , if you see me as I am being taken from you , it shall be so for you , but if you do not see me , it shall not be so. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	2	11	And as they still went on and talked , behold , ( O ) chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them . And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	12	And Elisha saw it and he cried , “ My father , my father ! ( P ) The chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! ” And he saw him no more . Then he took hold of his own clothes ( Q ) and tore them in two pieces .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	13	And he took up the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	14	Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water , saying , “ Where is the Lord , the God of Elijah ? ” And when he had struck the water , ( R ) the water was parted to the one side and to the other , and Elisha went over . Elisha Succeeds Elijah
ESV	2%20Kings	2	15	Now when ( S ) the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him opposite them , they said , “ The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. ” And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	16	And they said to him , “ Behold now , there are with your servants fifty strong men . Please let them go and seek your master . It may be that ( T ) the Spirit of the Lord has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. ” And he said , “ You shall not send. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	2	17	But when they urged him ( U ) till he was ashamed , he said , “ Send. ” They sent therefore fifty men . And for three days they sought him but did not find him .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	18	And they came back to him while he was staying at Jericho , and he said to them , “ Did I not say to you , ‘ Do not go ’ ? ”
ESV	2%20Kings	2	19	Now the men of the city said to Elisha , “ Behold , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord sees , but the water is bad , and the land is unfruitful. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	2	20	He said , “ Bring me a new bowl , and put salt in it. ” So they brought it to him .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	21	Then he went to the spring of water and ( V ) threw salt in it and said , “ Thus says the Lord , I have healed this water ; from now on neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	2	22	So the water has been healed to this day , according to the word that Elisha spoke .
ESV	2%20Kings	2	23	He went up from there to Bethel , and while he was going up on the way , some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him , saying , “ Go up , you baldhead ! Go up , you baldhead ! ”
ESV	2%20Kings	2	24	And he turned around , and when he saw them , ( W ) he cursed them in the name of the Lord . And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys .

ESV	2%20Kings	3	3	Nevertheless , he clung to ( D ) the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , ( E ) which he made Israel to sin ; he did not depart from it .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	4	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder , ( F ) and he had to deliver to the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	5	But ( G ) when Ahab died , the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	6	So King Jehoram marched out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	7	And he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat king of Judah : “ The king of Moab has rebelled against me . Will you go with me to battle against Moab ? ” And he said , “ I will go . ( H ) I am as you are , my people as your people , my horses as your horses. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	3	8	Then he said , “ By which way shall we march ? ” Jehoram answered , “ By the way of the wilderness of Edom. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	3	9	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and ( I ) the king of Edom . And when they had made a circuitous march of seven days , there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	10	Then the king of Israel said , “ Alas ! ( J ) The Lord has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	3	11	( K ) And Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there no prophet of the Lord here , through whom we may inquire of the Lord ? ” Then one of the king of Israel 's servants answered , ( L ) “ Elisha the son of Shaphat is here , ( M ) who poured water on the hands of Elijah. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	3	12	And Jehoshaphat said , “ The word of the Lord is with him. ” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	13	And Elisha said to the king of Israel , ( N ) “ What have I to do with you ? Go to ( O ) the prophets of your father and to ( P ) the prophets of your mother. ” But the king of Israel said to him , “ No ; it is ( Q ) the Lord who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	3	14	And Elisha said , ( R ) “ As the Lord of hosts lives , before whom I stand , were it not that I have regard for Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , I would neither look at you nor see you .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	15	But now ( S ) bring me a musician. ” And when the musician played , ( T ) the hand of the Lord came upon him .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	16	And he said , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘ I will make this dry streambed full of pools. ’
ESV	2%20Kings	3	17	For thus says the Lord , ‘ You shall not see wind or rain , but that streambed shall be filled with water , so that you shall drink , you , your livestock , and your animals. ’
ESV	2%20Kings	3	18	This is a light thing in the sight of the Lord . He will also give the Moabites into your hand ,
ESV	2%20Kings	3	19	and you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree and stop up all springs of water ( U ) and ruin every good piece of land with stones. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	3	20	The next morning , about the time of ( V ) offering the sacrifice , behold , water came from the direction of Edom , till the country was filled with water .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	21	When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , all who were able to put on armor , from the youngest to the oldest , were called out and were drawn up at the border .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	22	And when they rose early in the morning and the sun shone on the water , the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	23	And they said , “ This is blood ; the kings have surely fought together and struck one another down . Now then , Moab , to the spoil ! ”
ESV	2%20Kings	3	24	But when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose and struck the Moabites , till they fled before them . And they went forward , striking the Moabites as they went . [ a ]
ESV	2%20Kings	3	25	And they overthrew the cities , and ( W ) on every good piece of land every man threw a stone until it was covered . They stopped every spring of water and felled all the good trees , till only its stones were left in ( X ) Kir-hareseth , and the slingers surrounded and attacked it .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him , he took with him
ESV	2%20Kings	3	700	( Y ) swordsmen to break through , opposite the king of Edom , but they could not .
ESV	2%20Kings	3	27	Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place ( Z ) and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall . And there came great wrath against Israel . And they withdrew from him and returned to their own land . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Kings	4	2	And Elisha said to her , “ What shall I do for you ? Tell me ; what have you in the house ? ” And she said , “ Your servant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	4	Then go in and shut the door behind yourself and your sons and pour into all these vessels . And when one is full , set it aside. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	3	Then he said , “ Go outside , borrow vessels from all your neighbors , empty vessels and not too few .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	5	So she went from him and shut the door behind herself and her sons . And as she poured they brought the vessels to her .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	6	When the vessels were full , she said to her son , “ Bring me another vessel. ” And he said to her , “ There is not another. ” Then the oil stopped flowing .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	7	She came and told the ( C ) man of God , and he said , “ Go , sell the oil and pay your debts , and you and your sons can live on the rest. ” Elisha and the Shunammite Woman
ESV	2%20Kings	4	8	One day Elisha went on to ( D ) Shunem , where a ( E ) wealthy woman lived , who urged him to eat some food . So whenever he passed that way , he would turn in there to eat food .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	9	And she said to her husband , “ Behold now , I know that this is a holy ( F ) man of God who is continually passing our way .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	10	Let us make a small room on the roof with walls and put there for him a bed , a table , a chair , and a lamp , so that whenever he comes to us , he can go in there. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	11	One day he came there , and he turned into the chamber and rested there .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	12	And he said to ( G ) Gehazi his servant , “ Call this Shunammite. ” When he had called her , she stood before him .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	13	And he said to him , “ Say now to her , ‘ See , you have taken all this trouble for us ; what is to be done for you ? Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king or to ( H ) the commander of the army ? ’ ” She answered , “ I dwell among my own people. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	14	And he said , “ What then is to be done for her ? ” Gehazi answered , “ Well , she has no son , and her husband is old. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	15	He said , “ Call her. ” And when he had called her , she stood in the doorway .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	16	And he said , “ At this season , ( I ) about this time next year , you shall embrace a son. ” And she said , “ No , my lord , ( J ) O man of God ; ( K ) do not lie to your servant. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	17	But the woman conceived , and she bore a son about that time ( L ) the following spring , as Elisha had said to her . Elisha Raises the Shunammite 's Son
ESV	2%20Kings	4	18	When the child had grown , he went out one day to his father among the reapers .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	19	And he said to his father , “ Oh , ( M ) my head , my head ! ” The father said to his servant , “ Carry him to his mother. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	20	And when he had lifted him and brought him to his mother , the child sat on her lap till noon , and then he died .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	21	And she went up ( N ) and laid him on the bed of the ( O ) man of God and shut the door behind him and went out .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	22	Then she called to her husband and said , “ Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys , that I may quickly go to ( P ) the man of God and come back again. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	23	And he said , “ Why will you go to him today ? It is neither ( Q ) new moon nor Sabbath. ” She said , “ All is well. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	24	Then she saddled the donkey , and she said to her servant , “ Urge the animal on ; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	25	So she set out and came to the man of God ( R ) at Mount Carmel . When the man of God saw her coming , he said to Gehazi his servant , “ Look , there is the Shunammite .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	26	Run at once to meet her and say to her , ‘ Is all well with you ? Is all well with your husband ? Is all well with the child ? ’ ” And she answered , “ All is well. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	27	And when she came ( S ) to the mountain to the man of God , she caught hold of his feet . And Gehazi came to push her away . But the man of God said , “ Leave her alone , for she is in bitter distress , and the Lord has hidden it from me and has not told me. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	28	Then she said , “ Did I ask my lord for a son ? ( T ) Did I not say , ‘ Do not deceive me ? ’ ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	29	He said to Gehazi , ( U ) “ Tie up your garment and ( V ) take my staff in your hand and go . If you meet anyone , ( W ) do not greet him , and if anyone greets you , do not reply . And ( X ) lay my staff on the face of the child. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	30	Then the mother of the child said , ( Y ) “ As the Lord lives and as you yourself live , I will not leave you. ” So he arose and followed her .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	31	Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the face of the child , but there was no sound or sign of life . Therefore he returned to meet him and told him , “ The child ( Z ) has not awakened. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	32	When Elisha came into the house , he saw the child lying dead on his bed .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	33	So he went in and ( AA ) shut the door behind the two of them ( AB ) and prayed to the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	34	Then he went up and lay on the child , putting his mouth on his mouth , his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands . And as ( AC ) he stretched himself upon him , the flesh of the child became warm .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	35	Then he got up again and walked once back and forth in the house , and went up ( AD ) and stretched himself upon him . The child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	36	Then he summoned Gehazi and said , “ Call this Shunammite. ” So he called her . And when she came to him , he said , “ Pick up your son. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	37	She came and fell at his feet , bowing to the ground . ( AE ) Then she picked up her son and went out . Elisha Purifies the Deadly Stew
ESV	2%20Kings	4	38	And Elisha came again to ( AF ) Gilgal when ( AG ) there was a famine in the land . And as ( AH ) the sons of the prophets ( AI ) were sitting before him , he said to his servant , ( AJ ) “ Set on the large pot , and boil stew for the sons of the prophets. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	39	One of them went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds , and came and cut them up into the pot of stew , not knowing what they were .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	40	And they poured out some for the men to eat . But while they were eating of the stew , they cried out , “ O man of God , there is death in the pot ! ” And they could not eat it .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	41	He said , “ Then bring flour. ” ( AK ) And he threw it into the pot and said , “ Pour some out for the men , that they may eat. ” And there was no harm in the pot .
ESV	2%20Kings	4	42	A man came from ( AL ) Baal-shalishah , ( AM ) bringing the man of God bread of the firstfruits , twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack . And Elisha said , ( AN ) “ Give to the men , that they may eat. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	43	But his servant said , “ How can I set this before a hundred men ? ” So he repeated , “ Give them to the men , that they may eat , for thus says the Lord , ‘ They shall eat and have some left. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Kings	4	44	So he set it before them . And they ate and had some left , according to the word of the Lord . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	2%20Kings	5	3	She said to her mistress , “ Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria ! He would cure him of his leprosy. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	5	4	So Naaman went in and told his lord , “ Thus and so spoke the girl from the land of Israel. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	5	6	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel , which read , “ When this letter reaches you , know that I have sent to you Naaman my servant , that you may cure him of his leprosy. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	5	7	And when the king of Israel read the letter , ( F ) he tore his clothes and said , ( G ) “ Am I God , to kill and to make alive , that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy ? Only ( H ) consider , and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me. ”

ESV	2%20Kings	5	16	But he said , ( Q ) “ As the Lord lives , before whom I stand , ( R ) I will receive none. ” And he urged him to take it , but he refused .
ESV	2%20Kings	5	17	Then Naaman said , “ If not , please let there be given to your servant two mule loads of earth , for from now on your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the Lord .

ESV	2%20Kings	5	21	So Gehazi followed Naaman . And when Naaman saw someone running after him , he got down from the chariot to meet him and said , ( X ) “ Is all well ? ”
ESV	2%20Kings	5	22	And he said , “ All is well . My master has sent me to say , ‘ There have just now come to me from ( Y ) the hill country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets . Please give them a talent of silver and ( Z ) two changes of clothing. ’ ”

ESV	2%20Kings	6	16	He said , “ Do not be afraid , ( D ) for those who are with us are more than those who are with them. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	6	17	Then Elisha prayed and said , “ O Lord , please ( E ) open his eyes that he may see. ” So the Lord opened the eyes of the young man , and he saw , and behold , the mountain was full of ( F ) horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha .
ESV	2%20Kings	6	18	And when the Syrians came down against him , Elisha prayed to the Lord and said , “ Please strike this people with blindness. ” ( G ) So he struck them with blindness in accordance with the prayer of Elisha .

ESV	2%20Kings	10	10	Know then that there shall ( G ) fall to the earth nothing of the word of the Lord , which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Ahab , for the Lord has done ( H ) what he said by his servant Elijah. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	10	3	select the best and fittest of your master 's sons and set him on his father 's throne and fight for your master 's house. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	10	4	But they were exceedingly afraid and said , “ Behold , the two kings could not stand before him . How then can we stand ? ”
ESV	2%20Kings	10	5	So he who was over the palace , and he who was over the city , together with the elders and the guardians , sent to Jehu , saying , ( C ) “ We are your servants , and we will do all that you tell us . We will not make anyone king . Do whatever is good in your eyes. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	10	6	Then he wrote to them a second letter , saying , “ If you are on my side , and if you are ready to obey me , take the heads of your master 's sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time. ” Now the king 's sons , seventy persons , were with the great men of the city , ( D ) who were bringing them up .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	7	And as soon as the letter came to them , they took the king 's sons ( E ) and slaughtered them , seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	8	When the messenger came and told him , “ They have brought the heads of the king 's sons , ” he said , “ Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	10	9	Then in the morning , when he went out , he stood and said to all the people , “ You are innocent . ( F ) It was I who conspired against my master and killed him , but who struck down all these ?
ESV	2%20Kings	10	11	So Jehu struck down all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , all his great men and his close friends and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	12	Then he set out and went to Samaria . On the way , when he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds ,
ESV	2%20Kings	10	13	Jehu met ( I ) the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah , and he said , “ Who are you ? ” And they answered , “ We are the relatives of Ahaziah , and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	10	14	He said , “ Take them alive. ” And they took them alive and slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked , forty-two persons , and he spared none of them .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	15	And when he departed from there , he met ( J ) Jehonadab the son of ( K ) Rechab coming to meet him . And he greeted him and said to him , “ Is your heart true to my heart as mine is to yours ? ” And Jehonadab answered , “ It is. ” Jehu said , [ c ] “ If it is , ( L ) give me your hand. ” So he gave him his hand . And Jehu took him up with him into the chariot .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	16	And he said , “ Come with me , and see ( M ) my zeal for the Lord. ” So he [ d ] had him ride in his chariot .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	17	And when he came to Samaria , ( N ) he struck down all who remained to Ahab in Samaria , till he had wiped them out , according to the word of the Lord ( O ) that he spoke to Elijah . Jehu Strikes Down the Prophets of Baal
ESV	2%20Kings	10	18	Then Jehu assembled all the people and said to them , ( P ) “ Ahab served Baal a little , but Jehu will serve him much .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	19	Now therefore call to me all the ( Q ) prophets of Baal , all his worshipers and all his priests . Let none be missing , for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal . Whoever is missing shall not live. ” But Jehu did it with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	20	And Jehu ordered , ( R ) “ Sanctify ( S ) a solemn assembly for Baal. ” So ( T ) they proclaimed it .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	21	And Jehu sent throughout all Israel , and all the worshipers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left who did not come . And they entered ( U ) the house of Baal , and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	22	He said to him who was in charge of the wardrobe , “ Bring out the vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. ” So he brought out the vestments for them .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	23	Then Jehu went into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab , and he said to the worshipers of Baal , “ Search , and see that there is no servant of the Lord here among you , but only the worshipers of Baal. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	10	24	Then they [ e ] went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings . Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and said , “ The man who allows any of those whom I give into your hands to escape ( V ) shall forfeit his life. ”

ESV	2%20Kings	10	30	And the Lord said to Jehu , “ Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in my eyes , and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart , ( AD ) your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	10	31	But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the Lord , the God of Israel , with all his heart . ( AE ) He did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam , which he made Israel to sin .

ESV	2%20Kings	10	33	from the Jordan eastward , all the land of Gilead , the Gadites , and the Reubenites , and the Manassites , from ( AH ) Aroer , which is by the Valley of the Arnon , that is , ( AI ) Gilead and Bashan .
ESV	2%20Kings	10	34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
ESV	2%20Kings	10	35	So Jehu slept with his fathers , and they buried him in Samaria . And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place .

ESV	2%20Kings	11	11	And the guards stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the south side of the house to the north side of the house , around the altar and the house on behalf of the king .

ESV	2%20Kings	11	4	( D ) But in the seventh year ( E ) Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of ( F ) the Carites and of the guards , and had them come to him in the house of the Lord . And he made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the Lord , and he showed them the king 's son .
ESV	2%20Kings	11	5	And he commanded them , “ This is the thing that you shall do : one third of you , ( G ) those who come off duty on the Sabbath and guard the king 's house
ESV	2%20Kings	11	6	( ( H ) another third being at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guards ) shall guard the palace . [ c ]
ESV	2%20Kings	11	7	And the two divisions of you , which come on duty in force on the Sabbath and guard the house of the Lord on behalf of the king ,
ESV	2%20Kings	11	8	shall surround the king , each with his weapons in his hand . And whoever approaches the ranks is to be put to death . Be with the king ( I ) when he goes out and when he comes in. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	11	9	The captains did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded , and they each brought his men who were to go off duty on the Sabbath , with those who were to come on duty on the Sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest .
ESV	2%20Kings	11	10	And the priest gave to the captains the spears and ( J ) shields that had been King David 's , which were in the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	11	12	Then he brought out the king 's son and put ( K ) the crown on him and gave him ( L ) the testimony . And they proclaimed him king and anointed him , and they clapped their hands and said , ( M ) “ Long live the king ! ”
ESV	2%20Kings	11	13	When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people , she went into the house of the Lord to the people .
ESV	2%20Kings	11	14	And when she looked , there was the king standing ( N ) by the pillar , according to the custom , and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king , and all the people of the land rejoicing and ( O ) blowing trumpets . And Athaliah ( P ) tore her clothes and cried , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
ESV	2%20Kings	11	15	Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains who were set over the army , “ Bring her out between the ranks , and put to death with the sword anyone who follows her. ” For the priest said , “ Let her not be put to death in the house of the Lord. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	11	16	So they laid hands on her ; and she went through the horses ' entrance to the king 's house , and there she was put to death .
ESV	2%20Kings	11	17	And Jehoiada ( Q ) made a covenant between the Lord and the king and people , that they should be the Lord 's people , and also ( R ) between the king and the people .
ESV	2%20Kings	11	18	Then all the people of the land went to ( S ) the house of Baal and tore it down ; ( T ) his altars and his images they broke in pieces , and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . And the priest posted watchmen over the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	11	19	And he took the captains , ( U ) the Carites , the guards , and all the people of the land , and they brought the king down from the house of the Lord , marching through ( V ) the gate of the guards to the king 's house . And he took his seat on the throne of the kings .

ESV	2%20Kings	12	2	And Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all his days , because Jehoiada the priest instructed him .
ESV	2%20Kings	12	12	and ( F ) to the masons and the stonecutters , as well as to buy timber and quarried stone for making repairs on the house of the Lord , and for any outlay for the repairs of the house .
ESV	2%20Kings	12	3	Nevertheless , ( A ) the high places were not taken away ; the people continued to sacrifice and make offerings on the high places . Jehoash Repairs the Temple
ESV	2%20Kings	12	4	Jehoash said to the priests , “ All the money of the holy things ( B ) that is brought into the house of the Lord , the money for which each man is assessed—the money from the assessment of persons—and ( C ) the money that a man 's heart prompts him to bring into the house of the Lord ,
ESV	2%20Kings	12	5	let the priests take , each from his donor , and let them repair the house wherever any need of repairs is discovered. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	12	6	But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash , the priests had made no repairs on the house .
ESV	2%20Kings	12	7	Therefore King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them , “ Why are you not repairing the house ? Now therefore take no more money from your donors , but hand it over for the repair of the house. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	12	8	So the priests agreed that they should take no more money from the people , and that they should not repair the house .
ESV	2%20Kings	12	9	Then Jehoiada the priest took ( D ) a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the house of the Lord . And the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	12	10	And whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest , the king 's secretary and the high priest came up and they bagged and counted ( E ) the money that was found in the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	12	11	Then they would give the money that was weighed out into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the Lord . And they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked on the house of the Lord ,
ESV	2%20Kings	12	13	( G ) But there were not made for the house of the Lord ( H ) basins of silver , snuffers , bowls , trumpets , or any vessels of gold , or of silver , from the money that was brought into the house of the Lord ,
ESV	2%20Kings	12	14	for that was given to the workmen who were repairing the house of the Lord with it .
ESV	2%20Kings	12	15	And ( I ) they did not ask for an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to pay out to the workmen , for they dealt honestly .
ESV	2%20Kings	12	16	The money from ( J ) the guilt offerings and the money from the ( K ) sin offerings was not brought into the house of the Lord ; ( L ) it belonged to the priests .
ESV	2%20Kings	12	17	At that time ( M ) Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath and took it . But when Hazael set his face ( N ) to go up against Jerusalem ,
ESV	2%20Kings	12	18	Jehoash king of Judah ( O ) took all the sacred gifts that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers , the kings of Judah , had dedicated , ( P ) and his own sacred gifts , and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king 's house , and sent these to Hazael king of Syria . Then Hazael went away from Jerusalem . The Death of Joash
ESV	2%20Kings	12	19	Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
ESV	2%20Kings	12	20	( Q ) His servants arose and made a conspiracy ( R ) and struck down Joash in the house of ( S ) Millo , on the way that goes down to Silla .
ESV	2%20Kings	12	21	It was ( T ) Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of ( U ) Shomer , his servants , who struck him down , so that he died . And they buried him with his fathers in the city of David , ( V ) and Amaziah his son reigned in his place . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	2%20Kings	13	2	Kings 13:10 Jehoash is an alternate spelling of Joash ( son of Jehoahaz ) as in verses
ESV	2%20Kings	13	13	So Joash slept with his fathers , and Jeroboam sat on his throne . And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel . The Death of Elisha
ESV	2%20Kings	13	3	( B ) And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and he gave them continually into the hand of ( C ) Hazael king of Syria and into the hand of ( D ) Ben-hadad the son of Hazael .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	4	Then Jehoahaz ( E ) sought the favor of the Lord , and the Lord listened to him , ( F ) for he saw the oppression of Israel , how the king of Syria oppressed them .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	5	( Therefore the Lord gave Israel ( G ) a savior , so that they escaped from the hand of the Syrians , and the people of Israel lived in ( H ) their homes as formerly .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	6	Nevertheless , they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , ( I ) which he made Israel to sin , but walked [ a ] in them ; and ( J ) the Asherah also remained in Samaria . )
ESV	2%20Kings	13	7	For there was not left to Jehoahaz an army of more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen , for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like the dust ( K ) at threshing .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
ESV	2%20Kings	13	9	, 12–14 ; also verse
ESV	2%20Kings	13	10	In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah , Jehoash [ b ] the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria , and he reigned sixteen years .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	11	He also did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , ( L ) which he made Israel to sin , but he walked in them .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	12	( M ) Now the rest of the acts of Joash ( N ) and all that he did , ( O ) and the might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
ESV	2%20Kings	13	14	Now when Elisha had fallen sick with the illness of which he was to die , Joash king of Israel went down to him and wept before him , crying , ( P ) “ My father , my father ! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! ”
ESV	2%20Kings	13	15	And Elisha said to him , “ Take a bow and arrows. ” So he took a bow and arrows .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	16	Then he said to the king of Israel , “ Draw the bow , ” and he drew it . And Elisha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	17	And he said , “ Open the window eastward , ” and he opened it . Then Elisha said , “ Shoot , ” and he shot . And he said , “ The Lord 's arrow of victory , the arrow of victory over Syria ! For you shall fight the Syrians in ( Q ) Aphek until you have made an end of them. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	13	18	And he said , “ Take the arrows , ” and he took them . And he said to the king of Israel , “ Strike the ground with them. ” And he struck three times and stopped .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	19	Then ( R ) the man of God was angry with him and said , “ You should have struck five or six times ; then you would have struck down Syria until you had made an end of it , but now you will strike down Syria only ( S ) three times. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	13	20	So Elisha died , and they buried him . Now bands of ( T ) Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	21	And as a man was being buried , behold , a marauding band was seen and the man was thrown into the grave of Elisha , and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha , he revived and stood on his feet .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	22	( U ) Now Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	23	( V ) But the Lord was gracious to them and had compassion on them , ( W ) and he turned toward them , ( X ) because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , nor has he cast them from his presence until now .
ESV	2%20Kings	13	24	When Hazael king of Syria died , Ben-hadad his son became king in his place .

ESV	2%20Kings	14	3	And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord , yet not like David his father . He did in all things as Joash his father had done .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	4	( D ) But the high places were not removed ; ( E ) the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	5	And as soon as the royal power was ( F ) firmly in his hand , he struck down his servants ( G ) who had struck down the king his father .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	6	But he did not put to death the children of the murderers , according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses , where the Lord commanded , ( H ) “ Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children , nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers . But each one shall die for his own sin. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	14	7	( I ) He struck down ten thousand Edomites in ( J ) the Valley of Salt and took ( K ) Sela by storm , and called it ( L ) Joktheel , which is its name to this day .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	8	( M ) Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash [ a ] the son of Jehoahaz , son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , “ Come , ( N ) let us look one another in the face. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	14	9	, 11–16 -
ESV	2%20Kings	14	10	You have indeed ( P ) struck down Edom , ( Q ) and your heart has lifted you up . Be content with your glory , and stay at home , for why should you provoke trouble so that you fall , you and Judah with you ? ”
ESV	2%20Kings	14	11	But Amaziah would not listen . So Jehoash king of Israel went up , and he and Amaziah king of Judah ( R ) faced one another in battle at ( S ) Beth-shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	12	And Judah was defeated by Israel , ( T ) and every man fled to his home .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	13	And Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash , son of Ahaziah , at Beth-shemesh , and came to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits , [ b ] from ( U ) the Ephraim Gate to ( V ) the Corner Gate .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	15	( X ) Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash that he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?

ESV	2%20Kings	14	17	( Y ) Amaziah the son of Joash , king of Judah , lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz , king of Israel .

ESV	2%20Kings	14	23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash , king of Judah , Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel , began to reign in Samaria , and he reigned forty-one years .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	24	And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , ( AB ) which he made Israel to sin .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	25	( AC ) He restored the border of Israel ( AD ) from Lebo-hamath as far as the Sea of ( AE ) the Arabah , according to the word of the Lord , the God of Israel , which he spoke by his servant ( AF ) Jonah the son of Amittai , the prophet , who was from ( AG ) Gath-hepher .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	26	For the Lord ( AH ) saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter , ( AI ) for there was none left , bond or free , and there was none to help Israel .
ESV	2%20Kings	14	27	( AJ ) But the Lord had not said that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven , so he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash .

ESV	2%20Kings	16	4	( D ) And he sacrificed and made offerings ( E ) on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree .

ESV	2%20Kings	17	17	( AB ) And they burned their sons and their daughters as offerings [ a ] and used ( AC ) divination and ( AD ) omens and ( AE ) sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord , provoking him to anger .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	3	( B ) Against him came up ( C ) Shalmaneser king of Assyria . And Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	4	But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea , for he had sent messengers to So , king of Egypt , and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria , as he had done year by year . Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	5	Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samaria , and for three years he besieged it . The Fall of Israel
ESV	2%20Kings	17	6	In the ninth year of Hoshea , the king of Assyria ( D ) captured Samaria , ( E ) and he carried the Israelites away to Assyria ( F ) and placed them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of ( G ) Gozan , and in the cities of ( H ) the Medes . Exile Because of Idolatry
ESV	2%20Kings	17	7	And this occurred because the people of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God , ( I ) who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods
ESV	2%20Kings	17	8	( J ) and walked in the customs of the nations whom the Lord drove out before the people of Israel , ( K ) and in the customs that the kings of Israel had practiced .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	9	And the people of Israel did secretly against the Lord their God things that were not right . They built for themselves high places in all their towns , ( L ) from watchtower to fortified city .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	10	They set up for themselves ( M ) pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree ,
ESV	2%20Kings	17	11	and there they made offerings on all the high places , as the nations did whom the Lord carried away before them . And they did wicked things , provoking the Lord to anger ,
ESV	2%20Kings	17	12	and they served idols , ( N ) of which the Lord had said to them , “ You shall not do this. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	17	13	Yet the Lord ( O ) warned Israel and Judah ( P ) by every prophet ( Q ) and every seer , saying , ( R ) “ Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes , in accordance with all the Law that I commanded your fathers , and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	17	14	But they would not listen , ( S ) but were stubborn , as their fathers had been , who did not believe in the Lord their God .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	15	They despised his statutes ( T ) and his covenant that he made with their fathers and the warnings that he gave them . They went after ( U ) false idols ( V ) and became false , and they followed the nations that were around them , concerning whom the ( W ) Lord had commanded them that they should not do like them .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	16	And they abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God , and made for themselves metal images of ( X ) two calves ; and they ( Y ) made an Asherah and ( Z ) worshiped all the host of heaven and served ( AA ) Baal .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	18	Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight . None was left but ( AF ) the tribe of Judah only .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	19	( AG ) Judah also did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God , but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	20	And the Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them ( AH ) and gave them into the hand of plunderers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	21	( AI ) When he had torn Israel from the house of David , ( AJ ) they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king . And Jeroboam drove Israel from following the Lord ( AK ) and made them commit great sin .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	22	The people of Israel walked in all the sins that Jeroboam did . They did not depart from them ,
ESV	2%20Kings	17	23	until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight , ( AL ) as he had spoken by all his servants the prophets . ( AM ) So Israel was exiled from their own land to Assyria until this day . Assyria Resettles Samaria
ESV	2%20Kings	17	24	( AN ) And the king of Assyria brought people from ( AO ) Babylon , Cuthah , ( AP ) Avva , ( AQ ) Hamath , and ( AR ) Sepharvaim , and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the people of Israel . And they took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	25	And at the beginning of their dwelling there , they did not fear the Lord . Therefore the Lord sent lions among them , which killed some of them .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	26	So the king of Assyria was told , “ The nations that you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the law of the god of the land . Therefore he has sent lions among them , and behold , they are killing them , because they do not know the law of the god of the land. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	17	27	Then the king of Assyria commanded , “ Send there one of the priests whom you carried away from there , and let him [ b ] go and dwell there and teach them the law of the god of the land. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	17	28	So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in ( AS ) Bethel and taught them how they should fear the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	29	But every nation still made gods of its own and put them ( AT ) in the shrines of the high places that the Samaritans had made , every nation in the cities in which they lived .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	30	The men of ( AU ) Babylon made Succoth-benoth , the men of Cuth made Nergal , the men of Hamath made Ashima ,
ESV	2%20Kings	17	31	and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak ; and the Sepharvites ( AV ) burned their children in the fire to ( AW ) Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of ( AX ) Sepharvaim .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	32	( AY ) They also feared the Lord ( AZ ) and appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the shrines of ( BA ) the high places .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	33	So they feared the Lord but also served their own gods , after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	34	To this day they do according to the former manner . They do not fear the Lord , and they do not follow the statutes or the rules or the law or the commandment that the Lord commanded the children of Jacob , ( BB ) whom he named Israel .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	35	The Lord made a covenant with them and commanded them , ( BC ) “ You shall not fear other gods ( BD ) or bow yourselves to them or serve them or sacrifice to them ,
ESV	2%20Kings	17	36	but ( BE ) you shall fear the Lord , ( BF ) who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and ( BG ) with an outstretched arm . You shall bow yourselves to him , and to him you shall sacrifice .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	37	And the statutes and the rules and the law and the commandment that he wrote for you , ( BH ) you shall always be careful to do . ( BI ) You shall not fear other gods ,
ESV	2%20Kings	17	38	and ( BJ ) you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you . ( BK ) You shall not fear other gods ,
ESV	2%20Kings	17	39	but ( BL ) you shall fear the Lord your God , and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	17	40	However , they would not listen , but they did according to their former manner .
ESV	2%20Kings	17	41	( BM ) So these nations feared the Lord and also served their carved images . Their children did likewise , and their children 's children—as their fathers did , so they do to this day . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Kings	18	7	( M ) And the Lord was with him ; wherever he went out , ( N ) he prospered . He rebelled against the king of Assyria and would not serve him .
ESV	2%20Kings	18	8	( O ) He struck down the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory , ( P ) from watchtower to fortified city .

ESV	2%20Kings	18	10	and at the end of three years he took it . In the sixth year of Hezekiah , which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .

ESV	2%20Kings	18	13	( U ) In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah , Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them .
ESV	2%20Kings	18	14	And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish , saying , “ I have done wrong ; withdraw from me . Whatever you impose on me I will bear. ” ( V ) And the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents [ b ] of silver and thirty talents of gold .
ESV	2%20Kings	18	15	And Hezekiah ( W ) gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king 's house .
ESV	2%20Kings	18	16	At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord and from the doorposts that Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria .
ESV	2%20Kings	18	17	And the king of Assyria sent the ( X ) Tartan , the Rab-saris , and the Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem . And they went up and came to Jerusalem . When they arrived , they came and stood by ( Y ) the conduit of the upper pool , which is on the highway to the Washer 's Field .
ESV	2%20Kings	18	19	And the Rabshakeh said to them , “ Say to Hezekiah , ‘ Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria : On what do you rest this trust of yours ?
ESV	2%20Kings	18	20	Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war ? In whom do you now trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
ESV	2%20Kings	18	21	Behold , you are trusting now in Egypt , that broken reed of ( AB ) a staff , which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it . Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him .
ESV	2%20Kings	18	22	But if you say to me , “ We trust in the Lord our God , ” is it not he ( AC ) whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed , saying to Judah and to Jerusalem , “ You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem ” ?
ESV	2%20Kings	18	23	Come now , make a wager with my master the king of Assyria : I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
ESV	2%20Kings	18	24	How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master 's servants , when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
ESV	2%20Kings	18	25	Moreover , is it without the Lord that I have come up against this place to destroy it ? The Lord said to me , “ Go up against this land and destroy it. ” ’ ”
ESV	2%20Kings	18	26	Then ( AD ) Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , and ( AE ) Shebnah , and Joah , said to the Rabshakeh , “ Please speak to your servants in ( AF ) Aramaic , for we understand it . Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	18	27	But the Rabshakeh said to them , “ Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you , and not to the men sitting on the wall , who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and to drink their own urine ? ”
ESV	2%20Kings	18	28	Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah : “ Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria !
ESV	2%20Kings	18	29	Thus says the king : ‘ Do not let Hezekiah deceive you , for he will not be able to deliver you out of my [ c ] hand .

ESV	2%20Kings	19	15	And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said : “ O Lord , the God of Israel , ( W ) enthroned above the cherubim , ( X ) you are the God , you alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth ; you have made heaven and earth .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	16	( Y ) Incline your ear , O Lord , and hear ; ( Z ) open your eyes , O Lord , and see ; and hear the words of Sennacherib , which he has sent ( AA ) to mock the living God .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	17	Truly , O Lord , the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands
ESV	2%20Kings	19	18	and have cast their gods into the fire , for they were not gods , ( AB ) but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . Therefore they were destroyed .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : Your prayer to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria ( AE ) I have heard .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	21	This is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning him : “ She despises you , she scorns you— ( AF ) the virgin daughter of Zion ; she ( AG ) wags her head behind you— the daughter of Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	22	“ Whom have you ( AH ) mocked and ( AI ) reviled ? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes to the heights ? Against ( AJ ) the Holy One of Israel !
ESV	2%20Kings	19	23	( AK ) By your messengers you have mocked the Lord , and you have said , ( AL ) ‘ With my many chariots I have gone up the heights of the mountains , to the far recesses of ( AM ) Lebanon ; I felled its tallest cedars , its choicest cypresses ; I entered its farthest lodging place , its most ( AN ) fruitful forest .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	24	I dug wells and drank foreign waters , and I dried up with the sole of my foot all the streams ( AO ) of Egypt. ’
ESV	2%20Kings	19	25	“ Have you not heard that ( AP ) I determined it long ago ? I planned from days of old what ( AQ ) now I bring to pass , that you should turn fortified cities into heaps of ruins ,
ESV	2%20Kings	19	26	while their inhabitants , shorn of strength , are dismayed and confounded , and have become ( AR ) like plants of the field and like tender grass , like grass on the housetops , blighted before it is grown .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	27	“ But I know your sitting down ( AS ) and your going out and coming in , and your raging against me .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	28	Because you have raged against me and your complacency has come into my ears , I will ( AT ) put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth , and ( AU ) I will turn you back on the way by which you came .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	29	“ And this shall be ( AV ) the sign for you : this year eat what grows of itself , and in the second year what springs of the same . Then in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards , and eat their fruit .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	30	( AW ) And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	31	For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant , and out of Mount Zion ( AX ) a band of survivors . ( AY ) The zeal of the Lord will do this .
ESV	2%20Kings	19	32	“ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria : He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there , or come before it with a shield or ( AZ ) cast up a siege mound against it .

ESV	2%20Kings	19	35	And that night ( BD ) the angel of the Lord went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians . And when people arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .

ESV	2%20Kings	20	20	( W ) The rest of the deeds of Hezekiah and all his might and how he made ( X ) the pool and the conduit ( Y ) and brought water into the city , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
ESV	2%20Kings	20	3	“ Now , O Lord , ( D ) please remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and ( E ) with a whole heart , ( F ) and have done what is good in your sight. ” ( G ) And Hezekiah wept bitterly .
ESV	2%20Kings	20	4	And before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court , the word of the Lord came to him :
ESV	2%20Kings	20	5	“ Turn back , and say to Hezekiah ( H ) the leader of my people , Thus says the Lord , the God of David your father : ( I ) I have heard your prayer ; ( J ) I have seen your tears . Behold , I will heal you . On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord ,
ESV	2%20Kings	20	6	and I will add fifteen years to your life . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria , ( K ) and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David 's sake. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	20	7	And Isaiah said , “ Bring a cake of figs . And let them take and lay it on the boil , that he may recover. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	20	8	And Hezekiah said to Isaiah , “ What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me , and that I shall go up to the house of the Lord on the third day ? ”
ESV	2%20Kings	20	9	And Isaiah said , “ This shall be ( L ) the sign to you from the Lord , that the Lord will do the thing that he has promised : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or go back ten steps ? ”
ESV	2%20Kings	20	10	And Hezekiah answered , “ It is an easy thing for the shadow ( M ) to lengthen ten steps . Rather let the shadow go back ten steps. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	20	11	And Isaiah the prophet called to the Lord , ( N ) and he brought the shadow back ten steps , by which it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz . Hezekiah and the Babylonian Envoys
ESV	2%20Kings	20	12	( O ) At that time ( P ) Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , ( Q ) sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah , for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
ESV	2%20Kings	20	13	And Hezekiah welcomed them , and he showed them ( R ) all his treasure house , the silver , the gold , the spices , the precious oil , his armory , all that was found in his storehouses . There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them .
ESV	2%20Kings	20	14	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah , and said to him , “ What did these men say ? And from where did they come to you ? ” And Hezekiah said , “ They have come from a far country , from Babylon. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	20	15	He said , “ What have they seen in your house ? ” And Hezekiah answered , “ They have seen all that is in my house ; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	20	16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Hear the word of the Lord :
ESV	2%20Kings	20	17	Behold , the days are coming , when ( S ) all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have stored up till this day , shall be carried to Babylon . Nothing shall be left , says the Lord .

ESV	2%20Kings	21	2	Kings 21:12 Or evil The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Kings	21	21	He walked in all the way in which his father walked and served ( AD ) the idols that his father served and worshiped them .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	3	For he rebuilt the high places ( C ) that Hezekiah his father had destroyed , and he erected altars for Baal and made ( D ) an Asherah , ( E ) as Ahab king of Israel had done , ( F ) and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	4	( G ) And he built altars in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord had said , ( H ) “ In Jerusalem will I put my name. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	21	5	And he built altars ( I ) for all the host of heaven in ( J ) the two courts of the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	6	( K ) And he burned his son as an offering [ a ] and ( L ) used fortune-telling and ( M ) omens and dealt ( N ) with mediums and with necromancers . He did much evil in the sight of the Lord , provoking him to anger .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	7	And the carved image of ( O ) Asherah that he had made he set in the house of which the Lord said to David and to Solomon his son , “ In this house , ( P ) and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , I will put my name forever .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	8	( Q ) And I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander anymore out of the land that I gave to their fathers , if only they will be careful to do according to all that I have commanded them , and according to all the Law that my servant Moses commanded them. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	21	9	But they did not listen , and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations had done whom the Lord destroyed before the people of Israel . Manasseh 's Idolatry Denounced
ESV	2%20Kings	21	10	And the Lord said by his servants the prophets ,
ESV	2%20Kings	21	11	( R ) “ Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations and has done things ( S ) more evil than all that the Amorites did , who were before him , ( T ) and has made Judah also to sin ( U ) with his idols ,
ESV	2%20Kings	21	12	therefore thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : Behold , I am bringing upon Jerusalem and Judah such disaster [ b ] that the ears of everyone who hears of it ( V ) will tingle .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	13	( W ) And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria , and the plumb line of the house of Ahab , and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish , wiping it and turning it upside down .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	14	And I will forsake the remnant of my heritage and give them into the hand of their enemies , and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ,
ESV	2%20Kings	21	15	because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came out of Egypt , even to this day. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	21	16	( X ) Moreover , Manasseh shed very much innocent blood , till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another , besides the sin ( Y ) that he made Judah to sin so that they did what was evil in the sight of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	17	( Z ) Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did , and the sin that he committed , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
ESV	2%20Kings	21	18	( AA ) And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his house , ( AB ) in the garden of Uzza , and Amon his son reigned in his place . Amon Reigns in Judah
ESV	2%20Kings	21	19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem . His mother 's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	20	And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , ( AC ) as Manasseh his father had done .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	22	( AE ) He abandoned the Lord , the God of his fathers , and did not walk in the way of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	23	And the servants of Amon conspired against him and put the king to death in his house .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	24	But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon , and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
ESV	2%20Kings	21	25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon that he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
ESV	2%20Kings	21	26	And he was buried in his tomb ( AF ) in the garden of Uzza , and Josiah his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Kings	22	2	And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and walked in all the way of David his father , ( C ) and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left . Josiah Repairs the Temple
ESV	2%20Kings	22	22	( A ) Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem . His mother 's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of ( B ) Bozkath .
ESV	2%20Kings	22	3	In the eighteenth year of King Josiah , the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , son of Meshullam , the secretary , to the house of the Lord , saying ,
ESV	2%20Kings	22	4	“ Go up to ( D ) Hilkiah the high priest , that he may count the money ( E ) that has been brought into the house of the Lord , which ( F ) the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people .
ESV	2%20Kings	22	5	( G ) And let it be given into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the Lord , and let them give it to the workmen who are at the house of the Lord , repairing the house
ESV	2%20Kings	22	6	( that is , to the carpenters , and to the builders , and to the masons ) , and let them use it for buying timber and quarried stone to repair the house .
ESV	2%20Kings	22	7	But ( H ) no accounting shall be asked from them for the money that is delivered into their hand , for they deal honestly. ” Hilkiah Finds the Book of the Law
ESV	2%20Kings	22	8	And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary , “ I have found ( I ) the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord. ” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
ESV	2%20Kings	22	9	And Shaphan the secretary came to the king , and reported to the king , “ Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the Lord. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	22	10	Then Shaphan the secretary told the king , “ Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. ” And Shaphan read it before the king .
ESV	2%20Kings	22	11	When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law , ( J ) he tore his clothes .
ESV	2%20Kings	22	12	And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and ( K ) Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and ( L ) Achbor the son of ( M ) Micaiah , and Shaphan the secretary , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
ESV	2%20Kings	22	13	“ Go , inquire of the Lord for me , and for the people , and for all Judah , concerning the words of this book that has been found . For great is ( N ) the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us , because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book , to do according to all that is written concerning us. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	22	14	So Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of ( O ) Tikvah , son of ( P ) Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ( now she lived in Jerusalem in ( Q ) the Second Quarter ) , and they talked with her .
ESV	2%20Kings	22	15	And she said to them , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : ‘ Tell the man who sent you to me ,
ESV	2%20Kings	22	16	Thus says the Lord , Behold , I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants , all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read .
ESV	2%20Kings	22	17	( R ) Because they have forsaken me and have made offerings to other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands , therefore ( S ) my wrath will be kindled against this place , and it will not be quenched .
ESV	2%20Kings	22	18	But to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of the Lord , thus shall you say to him , Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : Regarding the words that you have heard ,
ESV	2%20Kings	22	19	( T ) because your heart was penitent , and you ( U ) humbled yourself before the Lord , when you heard how I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants , that they should become ( V ) a desolation and ( W ) a curse , and you ( X ) have torn your clothes and wept before me , I also have heard you , declares the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	22	20	Therefore , behold , I will gather you to your fathers , and ( Y ) you shall be gathered to your grave in peace , and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place. ’ ” And they brought back word to the king .

ESV	2%20Kings	23	2	Kings 23:33 A talent was about
ESV	2%20Kings	23	23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	3	And the king stood ( D ) by the pillar and ( E ) made a covenant before the Lord , ( F ) to walk after the Lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul , to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book . And all the people joined in the covenant .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	4	And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests ( G ) of the second order and the keepers of the threshold to bring out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels made for ( H ) Baal , for ( I ) Asherah , and for all the host of heaven . ( J ) He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	5	And he deposed the priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to make offerings in the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem ; those also who burned incense to Baal , to the sun and the moon and the constellations ( K ) and all the host of the heavens .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	6	And he brought out ( L ) the Asherah from the house of the Lord , outside Jerusalem , to the brook Kidron , ( M ) and burned it at the brook Kidron ( N ) and beat it to dust and cast the dust of it upon the graves ( O ) of the common people .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	7	And he broke down the houses of ( P ) the male cult prostitutes who were in the house of the Lord , ( Q ) where the women wove hangings for ( R ) the Asherah .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	8	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah , and defiled the high places where the priests had made offerings , from ( S ) Geba to Beersheba . And he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city , which were on one 's left at the gate of the city .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	9	( T ) However , the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem , but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	10	And he defiled ( U ) Topheth , which is ( V ) in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , ( W ) that no one might burn his son or his daughter as an offering to ( X ) Molech . [ a ]
ESV	2%20Kings	23	11	And he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun , at the entrance to the house of the Lord , by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain , which was in the precincts . [ b ] And he burned the chariots of the sun with fire .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	12	And the altars ( Y ) on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz , which the kings of Judah had made , and the altars ( Z ) that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , he pulled down and broke in pieces [ c ] and cast the dust of them ( AA ) into the brook Kidron .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	13	And the king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem , to the south of ( AB ) the mount of corruption , which Solomon the king of Israel had built for ( AC ) Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians , and for ( AD ) Chemosh the abomination of Moab , and for ( AE ) Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	14	And he broke in pieces the ( AF ) pillars and cut down the Asherim and filled their places with the bones of men .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	15	Moreover , the altar at Bethel , the high place erected ( AG ) by Jeroboam the son of Nebat , ( AH ) who made Israel to sin , ( AI ) that altar with the high place he pulled down and burned , [ d ] reducing it to dust . He also burned the Asherah .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	16	And as Josiah turned , he saw the tombs there on the mount . And he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar and defiled it , ( AJ ) according to the word of the Lord that the man of God proclaimed , who had predicted these things .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	17	Then he said , “ What is that monument that I see ? ” And the men of the city told him , ( AK ) “ It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted [ e ] these things that you have done against the altar at Bethel. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	23	18	And he said , “ Let him be ; let no man move his bones. ” So they let his bones alone , with the bones ( AL ) of the prophet who came out of Samaria .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	19	And Josiah removed all the shrines also of the high places that were ( AM ) in the cities of Samaria , which kings of Israel had made , provoking the Lord to anger . He did to them according to all that he had done at Bethel .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	20	And ( AN ) he sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there , on the altars , ( AO ) and burned human bones on them . Then he returned to Jerusalem . Josiah Restores the Passover
ESV	2%20Kings	23	21	And the king commanded all the people , ( AP ) “ Keep the Passover to the Lord your God , ( AQ ) as it is written in this Book of the Covenant. ”
ESV	2%20Kings	23	22	( AR ) For no such Passover had been kept since the days of the judges who judged Israel , or during all the days of the kings of Israel or of the kings of Judah .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	24	Moreover , Josiah put away ( AS ) the mediums and the necromancers and ( AT ) the household gods and ( AU ) the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem , that he might establish ( AV ) the words of the law that were written in the book ( AW ) that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	25	( AX ) Before him there was no king like him , who turned to the Lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might , according to all the Law of Moses , nor did any like him arise after him .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	26	Still the Lord did not turn from the burning of his great wrath , by which his anger was kindled against Judah , ( AY ) because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him .
ESV	2%20Kings	23	27	And the Lord said , “ I will remove Judah also out of my sight , ( AZ ) as I have removed Israel , and I will cast off this city that I have chosen , Jerusalem , ( BA ) and the house of which I said , My name shall be there. ” Josiah 's Death in Battle

ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	21	As David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	2	So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army , “ Go , number Israel , from Beersheba to Dan , and bring me a report , that I may know their number. ”
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	3	But Joab said , “ May the Lord add to his people a hundred times as many as they are ! Are they not , my lord the king , all of them my lord 's servants ? Why then should my lord require this ? Why should it be a cause of guilt for Israel ? ”
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	4	But the king 's word prevailed against Joab . So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came back to Jerusalem .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	5	And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David . In all Israel there were ( C ) 1,100,000 men who drew the sword , and in Judah ( D ) 470,000 who drew the sword .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	6	( E ) But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering , for the king 's command was abhorrent to Joab .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	7	But God was displeased with this thing , and he struck Israel .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	8	And David said to God , “ I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing . But now , please ( F ) take away the iniquity of your servant , for I have acted very foolishly. ”
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	9	And the Lord spoke to Gad , David 's ( G ) seer , saying ,
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	10	“ Go and say to David , ‘ Thus says the Lord , Three things I offer you ; choose one of them , that I may do it to you. ’ ”
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	11	grams -

ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	13	Then David said to Gad , “ I am in great distress . Let me fall into the hand of the Lord , for his mercy is very great , but do not let me fall into the hand of man. ”
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	14	So the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel , and 70,000 men of Israel fell .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	15	And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it , but as he was about to destroy it , the Lord saw , and he ( I ) relented from the calamity . And he said to the angel who was working destruction , “ It is enough ; now stay your hand. ” And the angel of the Lord was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	16	And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and heaven , and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem . Then David and the elders , ( J ) clothed in sackcloth , fell upon their faces .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	17	And David said to God , “ Was it not I who gave command to number the people ? It is I who have sinned and done great evil . But these sheep , what have they done ? Please let your hand , O Lord my God , be against me and against my father 's house . But do not let the plague be on your people. ” David Builds an Altar
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	18	Now ( K ) the angel of the Lord had commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and raise an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	19	So David went up at Gad 's word , which he had spoken in the name of the Lord .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	20	Now Ornan was threshing wheat . He turned and saw the angel , and his four sons who were with him hid themselves .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	22	And David said to Ornan , “ Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the Lord—give it to me at its full price—that the plague may be averted from the people. ”
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	23	Then Ornan said to David , “ Take it , and let my lord the king do what seems good to him . See , I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering ; I give it all. ”
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	24	But King David said to Ornan , “ No , but I will buy them for the full price . I will not take for the Lord what is yours , nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing. ”
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	25	So David paid Ornan ( L )
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	600	shekels [ a ] of gold by weight for the site .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	26	And David built there an altar to the Lord and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the Lord , and the Lord [ b ] ( M ) answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	27	Then the Lord commanded the angel , and he put his sword back into its sheath .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	28	At that time , when David saw that the Lord had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite , he sacrificed there .
ESV	1%20Chronicles	21	29	For the tabernacle of the Lord , which Moses had made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering ( N ) were at that time in the high place at Gibeon ,

ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	7	( I ) And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord , for there he offered the burnt offering and the fat of the peace offerings , because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	3	When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the Lord on the temple , they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and gave thanks to the Lord , saying , “ For he is good , ( D ) for his steadfast love endures forever. ” The Dedication of the Temple
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	4	( E ) Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	5	King Solomon offered as a sacrifice 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep . So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	6	The priests stood at their posts ; ( F ) the Levites also , with the instruments for music to the Lord that King David had made for giving thanks to the Lord— ( G ) for his steadfast love endures forever—whenever David offered praises by their ministry ; [ a ] ( H ) opposite them the priests sounded trumpets , and all Israel stood .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	8	At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great assembly , from ( J ) Lebo-hamath to the ( K ) Brook of Egypt .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	9	And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly , for they had kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes , joyful and glad of heart for the prosperity [ b ] that the Lord had granted to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people . If My People Pray
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	11	( L ) Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the king 's house . All that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the Lord and in his own house he successfully accomplished .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	12	Then the Lord appeared to Solomon in the night and said to him : “ I have heard your prayer ( M ) and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	13	( N ) When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain , or command the locust to devour the land , or send pestilence among my people ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	14	if my people who are called by my name ( O ) humble themselves , and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	15	( P ) Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	16	( Q ) For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there forever . My eyes and my heart will be there for all time .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	17	And as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my rules ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	18	then I will establish your royal throne , as I covenanted with David your father , saying , ( R ) ‘ You shall not lack a man to rule Israel. ’
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	19	( S ) “ But if you [ c ] turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you , and go and serve other gods and worship them ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	20	( T ) then I will pluck you [ d ] up from my land that I have given you , and this house that I have consecrated for my name , I will cast out of my sight , and I will make it ( U ) a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	21	And at this house , which was exalted , everyone passing by will be astonished and say , ( V ) ‘ Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house ? ’
ESV	2%20Chronicles	7	22	Then they will say , ‘ Because they abandoned the Lord , the God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them . Therefore he has brought all this disaster on them. ’ ” Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	2	Chronicles 8:18 A talent was about
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	8	from their descendants who were left after them in the land , whom the people of Israel had not destroyed—these Solomon drafted ( F ) as forced labor , and so they are to this day .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	3	And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and took it .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	4	He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	5	He also built ( B ) Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon , ( C ) fortified cities ( D ) with walls , gates , and bars ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	6	and Baalath , and all the store cities that Solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen , and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem , in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	7	( E ) All the people who were left of the Hittites , the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	9	But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work ; they were soldiers , and his officers , the commanders of his chariots , and his horsemen .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	10	And these were the chief officers of King Solomon ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	250	, who exercised authority over the people .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	11	( G ) Solomon brought Pharaoh 's daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her , for he said , “ My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel , for the places to which the ark of the Lord has come are holy. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	12	Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of the Lord ( H ) that he had built before the vestibule ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	13	( I ) as the duty of each day required , offering ( J ) according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths , the new moons , and the ( K ) three annual feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the Feast of Weeks , and the Feast of Booths .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	14	According to the ruling of David his father , he appointed ( L ) the divisions of the priests for their service , ( M ) and the Levites for their offices of praise and ( N ) ministry before the priests ( O ) as the duty of each day required , and ( P ) the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate , for so David ( Q ) the man of God had commanded .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	15	And they did not turn aside from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	16	Thus was accomplished all the work of Solomon from [ a ] the day the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid until it was finished . So the house of the Lord was completed .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	17	Then Solomon went to ( R ) Ezion-geber and ( S ) Eloth on the shore of the sea , in the land of Edom .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	8	18	And Hiram sent to him by the hand of his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea , and they went to Ophir together with the servants of Solomon and brought from there ( T )

ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	9	Then she gave the king
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	3	And when ( C ) the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon , the house that he had built ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	4	the food of his table , the seating of his officials , and the attendance of his servants , and their clothing , his cupbearers , and their clothing , and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the Lord , there was no more breath in her .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	5	And she said to the king , “ The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	6	but I did not believe the [ a ] reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it . And behold , half the greatness of your wisdom was not told me ; you surpass the report that I heard .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	7	Happy are your wives ! [ b ] Happy are these your servants , who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom !
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	8	Blessed be the Lord your God , who has delighted in you ( D ) and set you on his throne as king for the Lord your God ! ( E ) Because your God loved Israel and would establish them forever , he has made you king over them , that you may execute justice and righteousness. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	120	talents [ c ] of gold , and a very great quantity of spices , and precious stones . There were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	10	Moreover , the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon , ( F ) who brought gold from Ophir , brought algum wood and precious stones .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	11	grams -
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	12	And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired , whatever she asked ( H ) besides what she had brought to the king . So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants . Solomon 's Wealth
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	13	( I ) Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	666	talents of gold ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	14	besides that which the explorers and merchants brought . ( J ) And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	15	King Solomon made
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	200	large shields of beaten gold ;
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	600	shekels [ d ] of beaten gold went into each shield .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	16	And he made
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	300	shekels of gold went into each shield ; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	17	The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	18	The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold , which were attached to the throne , and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	19	while twelve lions stood there , one on each end of a step on the six steps . Nothing like it was ever made for any kingdom .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	20	All King Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold . Silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	21	For the king 's ships went to ( L ) Tarshish with the servants of Hiram . Once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold , silver , ivory , apes , and peacocks . [ e ]
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	22	Thus King Solomon ( M ) excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom , which God had put into his mind .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	24	Every one of them brought his present , articles of silver and of gold , garments , myrrh , [ f ] spices , horses , and mules , so much year by year .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	25	And Solomon had ( N ) 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots , and 12,000 horsemen , whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	26	( O ) And he ruled over all the kings ( P ) from the Euphrates [ g ] to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	9	27	( Q ) And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone , and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah .

ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	10	And the young men who had grown up with him said to him , “ Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you , ‘ Your father made our yoke heavy , but you lighten it for us ’ ; thus shall you say to them , ‘ My little finger is thicker than my father 's thighs .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	3	And they sent and called him . And Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	4	( C ) “ Your father made our yoke heavy . Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us , and we will serve you. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	5	He said to them , “ Come to me again in three days. ” So the people went away .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	6	Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , [ a ] who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive , saying , “ How do you advise me to answer this people ? ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	7	And they said to him , ( D ) “ If you will be good to this people and please them and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	8	,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	9	And he said to them , “ What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me , ‘ Lighten the yoke that your father put on us ’ ? ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	11	And now , whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke . My father disciplined you with whips , but I will discipline you with scorpions. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king said , “ Come to me again the third day. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	13	-
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	14	King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men , saying , “ My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add to it . My father disciplined you with whips , but I will discipline you with scorpions. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	15	So the king did not listen to the people , for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the Lord might fulfill his word , ( E ) which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	16	And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them , the people answered the king , “ What portion have we in David ? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse . ( F ) Each of you to your tents , O Israel ! Look now to your own house , David. ” So all Israel went to their tents .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	17	But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	18	Then King Rehoboam sent ( G ) Hadoram , [ b ] who was taskmaster over the forced labor , and the people of Israel stoned him to death with stones . And King Rehoboam quickly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	10	19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	11	14	For the Levites left ( F ) their common lands and their holdings and came to Judah and Jerusalem , ( G ) because Jeroboam and his sons cast them out from serving as priests of the Lord ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	11	15	and he appointed his own ( H ) priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for ( I ) the calves that he had made .

ESV	2%20Chronicles	12	12	And when ( Q ) he humbled himself the wrath of the Lord turned from him , so as not to make a complete destruction . Moreover , ( R ) conditions were good [ a ] in Judah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	12	3	with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen . And the people were without number who came with him from Egypt— ( F ) Libyans , Sukkiim , and Ethiopians .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	12	4	And he took ( G ) the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	12	5	Then ( H ) Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah , who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said to them , “ Thus says the Lord , ( I ) ‘ You abandoned me , so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	12	6	Then the princes of ( J ) Israel and the king humbled themselves and said , ( K ) “ The Lord is righteous. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	12	7	When the Lord saw that they humbled themselves , the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah : ( L ) “ They have humbled themselves . I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliverance , ( M ) and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	12	8	Nevertheless , they shall be servants to him , ( N ) that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	12	9	( O ) So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem . He took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king 's house . He took away everything . He also took away ( P ) the shields of gold that Solomon had made ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	12	10	and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .

ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , a servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up ( J ) and rebelled against his lord ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	7	and certain ( K ) worthless scoundrels [ b ] gathered about him and defied Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was ( L ) young and irresolute [ c ] and could not withstand them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	8	“ And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of the sons of David , because you are a great multitude and have with you ( M ) the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	9	( N ) Have you not driven out the priests of the Lord , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites , and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands ? Whoever comes ( O ) for ordination [ d ] with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what are ( P ) not gods .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	10	But as for us , the Lord is our God , and we have not forsaken him . We have priests ministering to the Lord who are sons of Aaron , and Levites for their service .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	11	They offer to the Lord ( Q ) every morning and every evening burnt offerings and incense of sweet spices , set out ( R ) the showbread on the table of pure gold , ( S ) and care for the golden lampstand that its lamps may ( T ) burn every evening . For we ( U ) keep the charge of the Lord our God , but you have forsaken him .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	12	Behold , God is with us at our head , and his priests ( V ) with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you . O sons of Israel , ( W ) do not fight against the Lord , the God of your fathers , for you can not succeed. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	14	And when Judah looked , behold , the battle was in front of and behind them . ( Y ) And they cried to the Lord , and the priests ( Z ) blew the trumpets .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	15	Then the men of Judah raised the battle shout . And when the men of Judah shouted , ( AA ) God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	16	The men of Israel fled before Judah , ( AB ) and God gave them into their hand .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	17	Abijah and his people struck them with great force , so there fell slain of Israel 500,000 chosen men .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	18	Thus the men of Israel were subdued at that time , and the men of Judah prevailed , ( AC ) because they relied on the Lord , the God of their fathers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	19	And Abijah pursued Jeroboam ( AD ) and took cities from him , Bethel with its villages and Jeshanah with its villages and ( AE ) Ephron [ f ] with its villages .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	20	Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah . ( AF ) And the Lord struck him down , ( AG ) and he died .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	13	21	But Abijah grew mighty . And he took fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters .

ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	14	And they attacked all the cities around ( U ) Gerar , ( V ) for the fear of the Lord was upon them . They plundered all the cities , for there was much plunder in them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	3	He took away the foreign altars ( B ) and the high places and broke down ( C ) the pillars and cut down the ( D ) Asherim
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	4	and commanded Judah to seek the Lord , the God of their fathers , and to keep the law and the commandment .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	5	He also took out of all the cities of Judah ( E ) the high places and the ( F ) incense altars . And the kingdom had rest under him .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	6	He built ( G ) fortified cities in Judah , for the land had rest . He had no war in those years , ( H ) for the Lord gave him peace .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	7	And he said to Judah , “ Let us build these cities and surround them with ( I ) walls and towers , gates and bars . The land is still ours , because we have sought the Lord our God . We have sought him , ( J ) and he has given us peace on every side. ” So they built and prospered .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	8	And Asa had an army of ( K ) 300,000 from Judah , armed with large shields and spears , and 280,000 men from Benjamin that carried shields and drew bows . All these were mighty men of valor .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	9	Zerah ( L ) the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	300	chariots , and came as far as ( M ) Mareshah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	10	And Asa went out to meet him , and ( N ) they drew up their lines of battle in the Valley of Zephathah at ( O ) Mareshah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	11	And Asa ( P ) cried to the Lord his God , “ O Lord , there is none like you to help , between the mighty and the weak . Help us , O Lord our God , ( Q ) for we rely on you , ( R ) and in your name we have come against this multitude . O Lord , you are our God ; let not man prevail against you. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	12	( S ) So the Lord defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah , and the Ethiopians fled .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	14	13	Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as ( T ) Gerar , and the Ethiopians fell until none remained alive , for they were broken before the Lord and his army . The men of Judah [ c ] carried away very much spoil .

ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	15	And all Judah rejoiced over the oath , for they had sworn with all their heart and had sought him with their whole desire , and he was found by them , ( R ) and the Lord gave them rest all around .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	3	( E ) For a long time Israel was without the true God , and without a teaching priest and without law ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	4	( F ) but when in their distress they turned to the Lord , the God of Israel , and sought him , he was found by them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	5	In those times there was no peace ( G ) to him who went out or to him who came in , for great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	6	They were broken in pieces . Nation was crushed by nation and city by city , for God troubled them with every sort of distress .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	7	( H ) But you , take courage ! Do not let your hands be weak , ( I ) for your work shall be rewarded. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	8	As soon as Asa heard these words , ( J ) the prophecy of Azariah the son of Oded , he took courage and put away the detestable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from ( K ) the cities that he had taken in ( L ) the hill country of Ephraim , and he repaired the altar of the Lord ( M ) that was in front of the vestibule of the house of the Lord . [ b ]
ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	9	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin , ( N ) and those from Ephraim , Manasseh , and Simeon who were residing with them , for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	10	They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	11	They sacrificed to the Lord on that day ( O ) from the spoil that they had brought

ESV	2%20Chronicles	15	16	( S ) Even Maacah , ( T ) his mother , King Asa removed from being queen mother because she had made a detestable image ( U ) for Asherah . Asa cut down her image , ( V ) crushed it , and burned it at the brook Kidron .

ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	16	( A ) In the ( B ) thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa , Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah , ( C ) that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	3	“ There is a covenant [ a ] between me and you , as there was between my father and your father . Behold , I am sending to you silver and gold . Go , break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel , that he may withdraw from me. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	4	And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel , and they conquered Ijon , Dan , Abel-maim , and all the ( D ) store cities of Naphtali .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	5	And when Baasha heard of it , he stopped building Ramah and let his work cease .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	6	Then King Asa took all Judah , and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber , with which Baasha had been building , and with them he built Geba and Mizpah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	7	At that time ( E ) Hanani ( F ) the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him , ( G ) “ Because you relied on the king of Syria , and did not rely on the Lord your God , the army of the king of Syria has escaped you .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	8	Were not ( H ) the Ethiopians and ( I ) the Libyans a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen ? Yet ( J ) because you relied on the Lord , he gave them into your hand .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	9	( K ) For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth , to give strong support to those ( L ) whose heart is blameless [ b ] toward him . ( M ) You have done foolishly in this , for from now on ( N ) you will have wars. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	10	Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him ( O ) in the stocks in prison , for he was in a rage with him because of this . And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	11	( P ) The acts of Asa , from first to last , are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet , and his disease became severe . Yet even in his disease he did not seek the Lord , but sought help from physicians .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	13	And Asa slept with his fathers , dying in the forty-first year of his reign .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	16	14	They buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David . They laid him on a bier ( Q ) that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer 's art , ( R ) and they made a very great fire in his honor . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	2	He placed forces in all the ( A ) fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim ( B ) that Asa his father had captured .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	17	Of Benjamin : Eliada , a mighty man of valor , with 200,000 men ( M ) armed with bow and shield ;
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	3	The Lord was with Jehoshaphat , because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David . He did not seek the Baals ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	4	but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments , ( C ) and not according to the practices of Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	5	Therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand . And all Judah ( D ) brought tribute to Jehoshaphat , ( E ) and he had great riches and honor .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	6	His heart was courageous in the ways of the Lord . And furthermore , ( F ) he took the high places and the Asherim out of Judah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	7	In the third year of his reign he sent his officials , Ben-hail , Obadiah , Zechariah , Nethanel , and Micaiah , ( G ) to teach in the cities of Judah ;

ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	9	And ( I ) they taught in Judah , having the Book of the Law of the Lord with them . They went about through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	10	( J ) And the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah , and they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	11	Some of the Philistines ( K ) brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute , and the Arabians also brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	12	And Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater . He built in Judah fortresses and store cities ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	13	and he had large supplies in the cities of Judah . He had soldiers , mighty men of valor , in Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	17	14	This was the muster of them by fathers ' houses : Of Judah , the commanders of thousands : Adnah the commander , with 300,000 mighty men of valor ;

ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	3	Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah , “ Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead ? ” He answered him , “ I am as you are , my people as your people . We will be with you in the war. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	4	And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , “ Inquire first for the word of the Lord. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	5	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together , four hundred men , and said to them , “ Shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead , or shall I refrain ? ” And they said , “ Go up , for God will give it into the hand of the king. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	6	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there not here another prophet of the Lord of whom we may inquire ? ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	7	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord , Micaiah the son of Imlah ; but I hate him , for he never prophesies good concerning me , but always evil. ” And Jehoshaphat said , “ Let not the king say so. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	8	Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said , “ Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	9	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones , arrayed in their robes . And they were sitting at the threshing floor ( D ) at the entrance of the gate of Samaria , and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	10	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘ With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	11	And all the prophets prophesied so and said , “ Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph . The Lord will give it into the hand of the king. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	12	And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him , “ Behold , the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king . Let your word be like the word of one of them , and speak favorably. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	13	But Micaiah said , ( E ) “ As the Lord lives , ( F ) what my God says , that I will speak. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	14	And when he had come to the king , the king said to him , “ Micaiah , shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle , or shall I refrain ? ” And he answered , “ Go up and triumph ; they will be given into your hand. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	15	But the king said to him , “ How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord ? ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	16	And he said , “ I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains , ( G ) as sheep that have no shepherd . And the Lord said , ‘ These have no master ; let each return to his home in peace. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me , but evil ? ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	19	And the Lord said , ‘ Who will entice Ahab the king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead ? ’ And one said one thing , and another said another .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	20	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord , saying , ‘ I will entice him. ’ And the Lord said to him , ‘ By what means ? ’
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	21	And he said , ‘ I will go out , and will be ( I ) a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. ’ And he said , ‘ You are to entice him , and you shall succeed ; go out and do so. ’
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	22	Now therefore behold , the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets . The Lord has declared disaster concerning you. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near ( J ) and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said , “ Which way did the Spirit of the Lord go from me to speak to you ? ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	24	And Micaiah said , “ Behold , you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	25	And the king of Israel said , “ Seize Micaiah and take him back to Amon ( K ) the governor of the city and to Joash the king 's son ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	26	and say , ‘ Thus says the king , ( L ) Put this fellow in prison and feed him with meager rations of bread and water until I return in peace. ’ ”

ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	29	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ I will disguise myself and go into battle , but you wear your robes. ” And the king of Israel disguised himself , and they went into battle .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots , “ Fight with neither small nor great , but only with the king of Israel. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	31	As soon as the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , they said , “ It is the king of Israel. ” So they turned to fight against him . And Jehoshaphat cried out , and the Lord helped him ; God drew them away from him .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	32	For as soon as the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back from pursuing him .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	33	But a certain man drew his bow at random [ a ] and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate . Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot , “ Turn around and carry me out of the battle , for I am wounded. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	18	34	And the battle continued that day , and the king of Israel was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening . Then at sunset he died . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	12	O our God , will you not ( S ) execute judgment on them ? For we are powerless against this great horde that is coming against us . We do not know what to do , but ( T ) our eyes are on you. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	13	Meanwhile all Judah stood before the Lord , with their little ones , their wives , and their children .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	14	And ( U ) the Spirit of the Lord came [ d ] upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , son of Benaiah , son of Jeiel , son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph , in the midst of the assembly .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	15	And he said , “ Listen , all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat : Thus says the Lord to you , ( V ) ‘ Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed at this great horde , ( W ) for the battle is not yours but God 's .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	16	Tomorrow go down against them . Behold , they will come up by the ascent of Ziz . You will find them at the end of ( X ) the valley , east of the wilderness of Jeruel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	17	( Y ) You will not need to fight in this battle . Stand firm , hold your position , and see the salvation of the Lord on your behalf , O Judah and Jerusalem. ’ ( Z ) Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed . Tomorrow go out against them , ( AA ) and the Lord will be with you. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	18	Then Jehoshaphat ( AB ) bowed his head with his face to the ground , and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the Lord , worshiping the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	19	And the Levites , of the ( AC ) Kohathites and the ( AD ) Korahites , stood up to praise the Lord , the God of Israel , with a very loud voice .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	21	And when he had taken counsel with the people , he appointed those who were to sing to the Lord and praise him ( AG ) in holy attire , as they went before the army , and say , ( AH ) “ Give thanks to the Lord , for his steadfast love endures forever. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	22	And when they began to sing and praise , the Lord set ( AI ) an ambush against the men of ( AJ ) Ammon , Moab , and Mount Seir , who had come against Judah , so that they were routed .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	23	For the men of Ammon and Moab rose against the inhabitants of Mount Seir , devoting them to destruction , and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , ( AK ) they all helped to destroy one another . The Lord Delivers Judah
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	24	When Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness , they looked toward the horde , and behold , there [ e ] were dead bodies lying on the ground ; none had escaped .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	25	When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil , they found among them , in great numbers , goods , clothing , and precious things , which they took for themselves until they could carry no more . They were three days in taking the spoil , it was so much .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	26	On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah , [ f ] for there they blessed the Lord . Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Beracah to this day .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	27	Then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat at their head , returning to Jerusalem with joy , ( AL ) for the Lord had made them rejoice over their enemies .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	28	They came to Jerusalem with harps and lyres and trumpets , to the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	29	( AM ) And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	30	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet , ( AN ) for his God gave him rest all around .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	31	( AO ) Thus Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah . He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem . His mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	32	He walked in the way of Asa his father and did not turn aside from it , doing what was right in the sight of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	33	( AP ) The high places , however , were not taken away ; ( AQ ) the people had not yet set their hearts upon the God of their fathers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , from first to last , are written in the chronicles of ( AR ) Jehu the son of Hanani , ( AS ) which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel . The End of Jehoshaphat 's Reign
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	35	( AT ) After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined with Ahaziah king of Israel , who acted wickedly .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	36	He joined him in building ships to go to ( AU ) Tarshish , and they built the ships in Ezion-geber .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	20	37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat , saying , ( AV ) “ Because you have joined with Ahaziah , the Lord will destroy what you have made. ” And the ships were wrecked and were not able to go to Tarshish . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	21	( A ) Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David , and Jehoram his son reigned in his place .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	3	Their father gave them great gifts of silver , gold , and valuable possessions , together with ( C ) fortified cities in Judah , but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram , because he was the firstborn .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	4	When Jehoram had ascended the throne of his father and was established , he killed all his brothers with the sword , and also some of the princes of ( D ) Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	5	( E ) Jehoram was ( F ) thirty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	6	( G ) And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as the house of Ahab had done , for ( H ) the daughter of Ahab was his wife . And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	7	Yet the Lord was not willing to destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that he had made with David , and since he had promised to give ( I ) a lamp to him and to his sons forever .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	8	In his days Edom revolted from the ( J ) rule of Judah and set up a king of their own .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	9	Then Jehoram passed over with his commanders and all his chariots , and he rose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and his chariot commanders .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	10	So Edom revolted from ( K ) the rule of Judah to this day . At that time Libnah also revolted from his rule , because he had forsaken the Lord , the God of his fathers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	11	Moreover , he made high places in the hill country of Judah and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem ( L ) into whoredom and made Judah go astray .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	12	And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet , saying , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of David your father , ( M ) ‘ Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father , or ( N ) in the ways of Asa king of Judah ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	13	( O ) but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel and have enticed Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem ( P ) into whoredom , ( Q ) as the house of Ahab led Israel into whoredom , and also you ( R ) have killed your brothers , of your father 's house , who were better than you ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	14	behold , the Lord will bring a great plague on your people , your children , your wives , and all your possessions ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	15	and you yourself will have a severe sickness ( S ) with a disease of your bowels , until your bowels come out because of the disease , day by day. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	16	( T ) And the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the anger [ b ] of the Philistines and of ( U ) the Arabians who are near the Ethiopians .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	17	And they came up against Judah and invaded it and carried away all the possessions they found that belonged to the king 's house , and also his sons and his wives , so that no son was left to him except ( V ) Jehoahaz , his youngest son .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	18	And after all this the Lord struck him ( W ) in his bowels with an incurable disease .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	19	In the course of time , at the end of two years , his bowels came out because of the disease , and he died in great agony . His people made no fire in his honor , ( X ) like the fires made for his fathers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	21	20	( Y ) He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem . And he departed ( Z ) with no one 's regret . ( AA ) They buried him in the city of David , but not in the tombs of the kings . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	22	( A ) And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah , his youngest son , king in his place , for the band of men that came with ( B ) the Arabians to the camp had killed all the older sons . So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab , for his mother was his counselor in doing wickedly .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	4	He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , as the house of Ahab had done . For after the death of his father they were his counselors , to his undoing .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	5	He even followed their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead . And the Syrians wounded Joram ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	6	and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that he had received at Ramah , when he fought against Hazael king of Syria . And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel , because he was wounded .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	7	But it was ordained by [ b ] God that the downfall of Ahaziah should come about through his going to visit Joram . For when he came there , ( D ) he went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu the son of Nimshi , ( E ) whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	8	( F ) And when Jehu was ( G ) executing judgment on the house of Ahab , he met the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah 's brothers , who attended Ahaziah , and he killed them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	9	( H ) He searched for Ahaziah , and he was captured while hiding in Samaria , and he was brought to Jehu and put to death . ( I ) They buried him , for they said , “ He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat , ( J ) who sought the Lord with all his heart. ” And the house of Ahaziah had no one able to rule the kingdom . Athaliah Reigns in Judah
ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	10	( K ) Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal family of the house of Judah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	11	But Jehoshabeath , [ c ] the daughter of the king , took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king 's sons who were about to be put to death , and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom . Thus Jehoshabeath , the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the priest , because she was a sister of Ahaziah , hid him [ d ] from Athaliah , so that she did not put him to death .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	22	12	And he remained with them six years , hidden in the house of God , while Athaliah reigned over the land . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	23	( A ) But in the seventh year Jehoiada took courage and entered into a covenant with the commanders of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , Azariah the son of Obed , Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	3	And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God . And Jehoiada [ a ] said to them , “ Behold , the king 's son ! Let him reign , ( C ) as the Lord spoke concerning the sons of David .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	4	This is the thing that you shall do : ( D ) of you priests and Levites who come off duty on the Sabbath , one third shall be gatekeepers ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	5	and one third shall be at the king 's house and one third at the Gate of the Foundation . And all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	6	Let no one enter the house of the Lord except the priests ( E ) and ministering Levites . They may enter , for they are holy , but all the people shall keep the charge of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	7	The Levites shall surround the king , each with his weapons in his hand . And whoever enters the house shall be put to death . Be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	8	The Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded , and they each brought his men , who were to go off duty on the Sabbath , with those who were to come on duty on the Sabbath , for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss ( F ) the divisions .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	9	And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains the spears and the large and small shields that had been King David 's , which were in the house of God .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	10	And he set all the people as a guard for the king , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the south side of the house to the north side of the house , around the altar and the house .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	11	Then they brought out the king 's son and put the crown on him and gave him ( G ) the testimony . And they proclaimed him king , and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him , and they said , ( H ) “ Long live the king. ” Athaliah Executed
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	12	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king , she went into the house of the Lord to the people .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	13	And when she looked , there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance , and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king , and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets , and the singers with their musical instruments leading in the celebration . And Athaliah tore her clothes and cried , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	14	Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains who were set over the army , saying to them , “ Bring her out between the ranks , and anyone who follows her is to be put to death with the sword. ” For the priest said , “ Do not put her to death in the house of the Lord. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	15	So they laid hands on her , [ b ] and she went into the entrance of ( I ) the horse gate of the king 's house , and they put her to death there . Jehoiada 's Reforms
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	16	And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be the Lord 's people .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	17	Then all the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down ; his altars and his images they broke in pieces , ( J ) and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	18	And Jehoiada posted watchmen for the house of the Lord under the direction of ( K ) the Levitical priests and the Levites ( L ) whom David had organized to be in charge of the house of the Lord , to offer burnt offerings to the Lord , ( M ) as it is written in the Law of Moses , with rejoicing and with singing , ( N ) according to the order of David .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	19	He stationed ( O ) the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the Lord so that no one should enter who was in any way unclean .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	23	20	And he took the captains , the nobles , the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and they brought the king down from the house of the Lord , marching ( P ) through the upper gate to the king 's house . And they set the king on the royal throne .

ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	2	Chronicles 24:27 Or Exposition The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	24	Though the army of the Syrians had come with few men , ( Y ) the Lord delivered into their hand a very great army , ( Z ) because Judah [ d ] had forsaken the Lord , the God of their fathers . Thus they ( AA ) executed judgment on Joash .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	3	Jehoiada got for him two wives , and he had sons and daughters .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	4	After this Joash ( C ) decided to ( D ) restore the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	5	And he gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them , “ Go out to the cities of ( E ) Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year , and see that you act quickly. ” But the Levites did not act quickly .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	6	So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief and said to him , “ Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem ( F ) the tax levied by Moses , the servant of the Lord , and the congregation of Israel for ( G ) the tent of testimony ? ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	7	For ( H ) the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken into the house of God , and had also used all ( I ) the dedicated things of the house of the Lord for the Baals .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	8	So the king commanded , and they made a chest and set it outside the gate of the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	9	And ( J ) proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in for the Lord ( K ) the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought their tax and dropped it into the chest until they had finished . [ b ]
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	11	And whenever the chest was brought to the king 's officers by the Levites , when they saw that there was much money in it , the king 's secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and take it and return it to its place . Thus they did day after day , and collected money in abundance .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who had charge of the work of the house of the Lord , and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the Lord , and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	13	So those who were engaged in the work labored , and the repairing went forward in their hands , and they restored the house of God to its proper condition and strengthened it .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	14	And when they had finished , they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada , and with it ( L ) were made utensils for the house of the Lord , both for the service and for the burnt offerings , and dishes for incense and vessels of gold and silver . And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord regularly all the days of Jehoiada .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	15	But Jehoiada grew old and full of days , and died . He was
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	130	years old at his death .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	16	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , and toward God and his house .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	17	Now after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and paid homage to the king . Then the king listened to them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	18	And they abandoned the house of the Lord , the God of their fathers , and served ( M ) the Asherim and the idols . And ( N ) wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	19	( O ) Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to the Lord . ( P ) These testified against them , but they would not pay attention . Joash 's Treachery
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	20	( Q ) Then the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah ( R ) the son of Jehoiada the priest , and he stood above the people , and said to them , “ Thus says God , ( S ) ‘ Why do you break the commandments of the Lord , so that you can not prosper ? ( T ) Because you have forsaken the Lord , he has forsaken you. ’ ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	21	But ( U ) they conspired against him , ( V ) and by command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	22	Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada , Zechariah 's father , had shown him , but killed his son . And when he was dying , he said , “ May the Lord see ( W ) and avenge ! ” [ c ] Joash Assassinated
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	23	At the end of the year ( X ) the army of the Syrians came up against Joash . They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	25	When they had departed from him , leaving him ( AB ) severely wounded , ( AC ) his servants conspired against him because of the blood of ( AD ) the son [ e ] of Jehoiada the priest , and killed him on his bed . So he died , and they buried him in the city of David , ( AE ) but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	26	Those who conspired against him were Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonite , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabite .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	24	27	Accounts of his sons and of the many oracles against him and of ( AF ) the rebuilding [ f ] of the house of God are written in the ( AG ) Story [ g ] of the Book of the Kings . And Amaziah his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	2	Chronicles 25:28 Hebrew of Judah The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	25	( W ) Amaziah the son of Joash , king of Judah , lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz , king of Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	3	And as soon as the royal power was firmly his , he killed his servants who had struck down the king his father .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	4	But he did not put their children to death , according to what is written in the Law , in the Book of Moses , where the Lord commanded , ( C ) “ Fathers shall not die because of their children , nor children die because of their fathers , but each one shall die for his own sin. ” Amaziah 's Victories
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	5	Then Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and set them by fathers ' houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin . He mustered those ( D ) twenty years old and upward , and found that they were ( E ) 300,000 choice men , fit for war , ( F ) able to handle spear and shield .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	6	He hired also 100,000 mighty men of valor from Israel for
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	100	talents [ a ] of silver .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	7	But ( G ) a man of God came to him and said , “ O king , do not let the army of Israel go with you , for the Lord is not with Israel , with all these Ephraimites .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	8	But go , act , be strong for the battle . Why should you suppose that God will cast you down before the enemy ? ( H ) For God has power to help or to cast down. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	9	And Amaziah said to the man of God , “ But what shall we do about the hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel ? ” The man of God answered , “ The Lord is able to give you much more than this. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	10	Then Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim to go home again . And they became very angry with Judah and returned home in fierce anger .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	11	But Amaziah took courage and led out his people and went to the ( I ) Valley of Salt and struck down ( J ) 10,000 men of Seir .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	12	The men of Judah captured another 10,000 alive and took them to the top of a rock and threw them down from the top of the rock , and they were all dashed to pieces .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	13	But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back , not letting them go with him to battle , raided the cities of Judah , ( K ) from Samaria to Beth-horon , and struck down 3,000 people in them and took much spoil . Amaziah 's Idolatry
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	14	After Amaziah came from striking down the Edomites , ( L ) he brought the gods ( M ) of the men of Seir and set them up as his gods and worshiped them , making offerings to them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	15	Therefore the Lord was angry with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet , who said to him , “ Why have you sought the gods of a people ( N ) who did not deliver their own people from your hand ? ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	16	But as he was speaking , the king said to him , “ Have we made you a royal counselor ? Stop ! Why should you be struck down ? ” So the prophet stopped , but said , “ I know that ( O ) God has determined to destroy you , because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel. ” Israel Defeats Amaziah
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	17	( P ) Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz , son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , “ Come , let us look one another in the face. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	18	inches or
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	19	You say , ‘ See , I [ b ] have struck down Edom , ’ and ( R ) your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness . But now stay at home . Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall , you and Judah with you ? ”

ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	21	So Joash king of Israel went up , and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	22	And Judah was defeated by Israel , and every man fled to his home .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	25	23	And Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash , son of ( T ) Ahaziah , at Beth-shemesh , and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for

ESV	2%20Chronicles	26	16	But when ( N ) he was strong , ( O ) he grew proud , to his destruction . For he was unfaithful to the Lord his God and entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	26	17	But ( P ) Azariah the priest went in after him , with eighty priests of the Lord who were men of valor ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	26	18	and they withstood King Uzziah and said to him , ( Q ) “ It is not for you , Uzziah , to burn incense to the Lord , ( R ) but for the priests , the sons of Aaron , who are consecrated to burn incense . Go out of the sanctuary , for you have done wrong , and it will bring you no honor from the Lord God. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	26	19	Then Uzziah was angry . Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense , and when he became angry with the priests , ( S ) leprosy [ a ] broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the Lord , by the altar of incense .

ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	28	( A ) Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord , as his father David had done ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	3	and ( D ) he made offerings in the ( E ) Valley of the Son of Hinnom and ( F ) burned his sons as an offering , [ a ] according to ( G ) the abominations of the nations whom the Lord drove out before the people of Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	4	And he sacrificed and ( H ) made offerings on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree . Judah Defeated
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	5	( I ) Therefore the Lord his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria , who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and brought them to Damascus . He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel , who struck him with great force .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	6	For ( J ) Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 from Judah in one day , all of them men of valor , because they had forsaken the Lord , the God of their fathers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	7	And Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , killed Maaseiah the king 's son and Azrikam the commander of the palace and Elkanah the next in authority to the king .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	8	The men of Israel took captive 200,000 ( K ) of their relatives , women , sons , and daughters . They also took much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	9	But a prophet of the Lord was there , whose name was Oded , and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria and said to them , “ Behold , because the Lord , the God of your fathers , ( L ) was angry with Judah , he gave them into your hand , but you have killed them in a rage ( M ) that has reached up to heaven .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	10	And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem , male and female , as your slaves . Have you not sins of your own against the Lord your God ?
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Now hear me , and send back the captives ( N ) from your relatives whom you have taken , for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	12	Certain chiefs also of the men of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against those who were coming from the war
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	13	and said to them , “ You shall not bring the captives in here , for you propose to bring upon us guilt against the Lord in addition to our present sins and guilt . For our guilt is already great , and there is fierce wrath against Israel. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	15	And ( O ) the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the captives , and with the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them . They clothed them , gave them sandals , ( P ) provided them with food and drink , and anointed them , and carrying all the feeble among them on donkeys , they brought them to their kinsfolk at Jericho , ( Q ) the city of palm trees . Then they returned to Samaria .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	16	( R ) At that time King Ahaz sent to the king [ b ] of Assyria for help .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	17	For the Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and carried away captives .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	18	( S ) And the Philistines had made raids on ( T ) the cities in the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah , and had taken Beth-shemesh , Aijalon , Gederoth , Soco ( U ) with its villages , Timnah with its villages , and Gimzo with its villages . And they settled there .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	19	For the Lord humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel , for he had made ( V ) Judah act sinfully [ c ] and had been very unfaithful to the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	20	So ( W ) Tiglath-pileser [ d ] king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	21	( X ) For Ahaz took a portion from the house of the Lord and the house of the king and of the princes , and gave tribute to the king of Assyria , but it did not help him . Ahaz 's Idolatry
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	22	In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the Lord—this same King Ahaz .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	23	For ( Y ) he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him and said , ( Z ) “ Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them , I will sacrifice to them that they may help me. ” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	24	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and ( AA ) cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and he shut up the doors of the house of the Lord , and he made himself ( AB ) altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	25	In every city of Judah he made high places to ( AC ) make offerings to other gods , provoking to anger the Lord , the God of his fathers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	26	( AD ) Now the rest of his acts and all his ways , from first to last , behold , they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	28	27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , in Jerusalem , for ( AE ) they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel . And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	29	When the offering was finished , ( AM ) the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	3	In the first year of his reign , in the first month , he ( C ) opened the doors of the house of the Lord and repaired them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	4	He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square on the east
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	5	and said to them , “ Hear me , Levites ! Now ( D ) consecrate yourselves , and consecrate the house of the Lord , the God of your fathers , and carry out the filth [ b ] from the Holy Place .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	6	For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the sight of the Lord our God . They have forsaken him and ( E ) have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord and turned their backs .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	7	They also ( F ) shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	8	Therefore ( G ) the wrath of the Lord came on Judah and Jerusalem , and he has made them ( H ) an object of horror , of astonishment , ( I ) and of hissing , as you see with your own eyes .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	9	For behold , ( J ) our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	10	Now ( K ) it is in my heart ( L ) to make a covenant with the Lord , the God of Israel , in order that his fierce anger may turn away from us .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	11	My sons , do not now be negligent , ( M ) for the Lord has chosen you to stand in his presence , to minister to him and to be his ministers and make offerings to him. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	12	Then the Levites arose , ( N ) Mahath the son of Amasai , and Joel the son of Azariah , of the sons of ( O ) the Kohathites ; and of the sons of ( P ) Merari , Kish the son of Abdi , and Azariah the son of Jehallelel ; and of the ( Q ) Gershonites , Joah the son of Zimmah , and Eden the son of Joah ;
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	13	and of the sons of ( R ) Elizaphan , Shimri and Jeuel ; and of the sons of ( S ) Asaph , Zechariah and Mattaniah ;
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	14	and of the sons of ( T ) Heman , Jehuel and Shimei ; and of the sons of ( U ) Jeduthun , Shemaiah and Uzziel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	15	They gathered their brothers and ( V ) consecrated themselves and went in as the king had commanded , ( W ) by the words of the Lord , ( X ) to cleanse the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	16	The priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to cleanse it , and they brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord . And the Levites took it and carried it out to ( Y ) the brook Kidron .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	17	They began to consecrate ( Z ) on the first day of the first month , and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the Lord . Then for eight days they consecrated the house of the Lord , and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	18	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said , “ We have cleansed all the house of the Lord , the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils , and the table for the showbread and all its utensils .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	19	All the utensils ( AA ) that King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he was faithless , we have made ready and consecrated , and behold , they are before the altar of the Lord. ” Hezekiah Restores Temple Worship
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	20	Then Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the officials of the city and went up to the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	21	And they brought seven bulls , seven rams , seven lambs , and seven male goats ( AB ) for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah . And he commanded the priests , the sons of Aaron , to offer them on the altar of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	22	So they slaughtered the bulls , and the priests received the blood ( AC ) and threw it against the altar . And they slaughtered the rams , and their blood was thrown against the altar . And they slaughtered the lambs , and their blood was thrown against the altar .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	23	Then the goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the assembly , ( AD ) and they laid their hands on them ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	24	and the priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar , ( AE ) to make atonement for all Israel . For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	25	( AF ) And he stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals , harps , and lyres , ( AG ) according to the commandment of David and of Gad ( AH ) the king 's seer and of ( AI ) Nathan the prophet , for the commandment was from the Lord through his prophets .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	26	The Levites stood with ( AJ ) the instruments of David , ( AK ) and the priests with the trumpets .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	27	Then Hezekiah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the altar . And when the burnt offering began , ( AL ) the song to the Lord began also , and the trumpets , accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	28	The whole assembly worshiped , and the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded . All this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	30	And Hezekiah the king and the officials commanded the Levites to sing praises to the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph the seer . And they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed down and worshiped .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	31	Then Hezekiah said , ( AN ) “ You have now consecrated yourselves to [ c ] the Lord . Come near ; bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the Lord. ” And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings , and all who were ( AO ) of a willing heart brought burnt offerings .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	32	The number of the burnt offerings that the assembly brought was
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	70	bulls ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	100	rams , and
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	200	lambs ; all these were for a burnt offering to the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	33	And the consecrated offerings were
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	600	bulls and 3,000 sheep .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	34	But the priests were too few and could not flay all the burnt offerings , so until other priests had consecrated themselves , ( AP ) their brothers the Levites helped them , until the work was finished— ( AQ ) for the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in consecrating themselves .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	35	Besides the great number of burnt offerings , there was ( AR ) the fat of the peace offerings , and there were ( AS ) the drink offerings for the burnt offerings . Thus the service of the house of the Lord was restored .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	29	36	And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because God had provided for the people , for the thing came about suddenly . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	2	Chronicles 30:21 Compare
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	30	Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem to keep the Passover to the Lord , the God of Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	3	for they could not keep it ( B ) at that time ( C ) because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient number , nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem—
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	4	and the plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	5	So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel , ( D ) from Beersheba to Dan , that the people should come and keep the Passover to the Lord , the God of Israel , at Jerusalem , for they had not kept it as often as prescribed .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	6	( E ) So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his princes , as the king had commanded , saying , “ O people of Israel , ( F ) return to the Lord , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of ( G ) the kings of Assyria .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	7	( H ) Do not be like your fathers and your brothers , who were faithless to the Lord God of their fathers , so that he made them a desolation , as you see .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	8	( I ) Do not now be stiff-necked as your fathers were , but yield yourselves to the Lord and come to his sanctuary , which he has consecrated forever , and serve the Lord your God , ( J ) that his fierce anger may turn away from you .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	9	For ( K ) if you return to the Lord , your brothers and your children ( L ) will find compassion with their captors and return to this land . For ( M ) the Lord your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you , ( N ) if you return to him. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	10	( O ) So the couriers went from city to city through the country of ( P ) Ephraim and Manasseh , and as far as Zebulun , but ( Q ) they laughed them to scorn and mocked them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	11	However , ( R ) some men of Asher , of Manasseh , and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	12	The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded ( S ) by the word of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	13	And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread ( T ) in the second month , a very great assembly .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	14	They set to work and removed ( U ) the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for burning incense they took away ( V ) and threw into the brook Kidron .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	15	( W ) And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month . ( X ) And the priests and the Levites were ashamed , ( Y ) so that they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	16	( Z ) They took their accustomed posts according to the Law of Moses ( AA ) the man of God . The priests threw the blood that they received from the hand of the Levites .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	17	For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves . Therefore the Levites had to slaughter the Passover lamb for everyone who was not clean , to consecrate it to the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	18	For a majority of the people , ( AB ) many of them from Ephraim , Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun , had not cleansed themselves , yet they ate the Passover otherwise ( AC ) than as prescribed . For Hezekiah had prayed for them , saying , “ May the good Lord pardon everyone
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	19	( AD ) who sets his heart to seek God , the Lord , the God of his fathers , even though not according to the sanctuary 's rules of cleanness. ” [ a ]
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	20	And the Lord heard Hezekiah and healed the people .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	21	And the people of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept ( AE ) the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness , and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day , singing with all their might [ b ] to the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	22	And Hezekiah spoke ( AF ) encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of the Lord . So they ate the food of the festival for seven days , sacrificing ( AG ) peace offerings and giving thanks to the Lord , the God of their fathers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	23	Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the feast ( AH ) for another seven days . So they kept it for another seven days with gladness .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	24	For Hezekiah king of Judah ( AI ) gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for offerings , and the princes gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep . And the priests ( AJ ) consecrated themselves in great numbers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	25	The whole assembly of Judah , and the priests and the Levites , ( AK ) and the whole assembly that came out of Israel , and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel , and the sojourners who lived in Judah , rejoiced .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem , for ( AL ) since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	30	27	Then ( AM ) the priests and the Levites arose and ( AN ) blessed the people , and their voice was heard , and their prayer came to ( AO ) his holy habitation in heaven . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	2	And Hezekiah appointed ( D ) the divisions of the priests and of the Levites , division by division , each according to his service , the priests and the Levites , ( E ) for burnt offerings and peace offerings , to minister in the gates of the camp of the Lord and to give thanks and praise .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	31	Now when all this was finished , all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and ( A ) broke in pieces the ( B ) pillars and cut down ( C ) the Asherim and broke down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin , and in Ephraim and Manasseh , until they had destroyed them all . Then all the people of Israel returned to their cities , every man to his possession .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	3	( F ) The contribution of the king from his own possessions was for the burnt offerings : the burnt offerings of morning and evening , and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths , the new moons , and the appointed feasts , ( G ) as it is written in the Law of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	4	And he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give ( H ) the portion due to the priests and the Levites , that they might give themselves to the Law of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	5	As soon as the command was spread abroad , the people of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of grain , wine , oil , honey , and of all the produce of the field . And they brought in abundantly ( I ) the tithe of everything .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	6	And the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep , and ( J ) the tithe of the dedicated things that had been dedicated to the Lord their God , and laid them in heaps .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	7	In the third month they began to pile up the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	8	When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps , they blessed the Lord and his people Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	9	And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	10	Azariah the chief priest , who was ( K ) of the house of Zadok , answered him , “ Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the Lord , we have eaten and had enough and have plenty left , ( L ) for the Lord has blessed his people , so that we have this large amount left. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	11	Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare ( M ) chambers in the house of the Lord , and they prepared them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	12	And they faithfully brought in the contributions , the tithes , and the dedicated things . The chief officer ( N ) in charge of them was Conaniah the Levite , with ( O ) Shimei his brother as second ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	13	( P ) while Jehiel , Azaziah , Nahath , Asahel , Jerimoth , Jozabad , Eliel , Ismachiah , ( Q ) Mahath , and Benaiah were overseers assisting Conaniah and Shimei his brother , by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and ( R ) Azariah the chief officer of the house of God .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	14	And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite , keeper of the east gate , was over the freewill offerings to God , to apportion the contribution reserved for the Lord and the most holy offerings .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	15	( S ) Eden , Miniamin , Jeshua , Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shecaniah were faithfully assisting him in ( T ) the cities of the priests , to distribute the portions to their brothers , old and young alike , by divisions ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	16	except those enrolled by genealogy , males from three years old and upward—all who entered the house of the Lord ( U ) as the duty of each day required—for their service according to their offices , by their divisions .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	17	The enrollment of the priests was according to their fathers ' houses ; that of the Levites ( V ) from twenty years old and upward was according to their offices , by their divisions .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	18	They were enrolled with all their little children , their wives , their sons , and their daughters , the whole assembly , for they were faithful in keeping themselves holy .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	19	And for the sons of Aaron , the priests , who were in the fields of common land belonging to their cities , there were men in the several cities who were ( W ) designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone among the Levites who was enrolled .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	20	Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah , ( X ) and he did what was good and right and faithful before the Lord his God .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	31	21	And every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God and in accordance with the law and the commandments , seeking his God , he did with all his heart , and prospered . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	2	Chronicles 32:5 Vulgate ; Hebrew and raised upon the towers The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds , behold , they are written ( Y ) in the vision of Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , ( Z ) in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	3	he planned with his officers and his mighty men to stop the water of the springs that were outside the city ; and they helped him .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	4	A great many people were gathered , and they stopped all the springs and ( B ) the brook that flowed through the land , saying , “ Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water ? ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	5	He set to work resolutely and built up ( C ) all the wall that was broken down and raised towers upon it , [ a ] and outside it he built another wall , and he strengthened the ( D ) Millo in the city of David . He also made weapons and shields in abundance .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	6	And he set combat commanders over the people and gathered them together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke ( E ) encouragingly to them , saying ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	7	( F ) “ Be strong and courageous . ( G ) Do not be afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him , ( H ) for there are more with us than with him .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	8	With him is ( I ) an arm of flesh , ( J ) but with us is the Lord our God , to help us and to fight our battles. ” And the people took confidence from the words of Hezekiah king of Judah . Sennacherib Blasphemes
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	9	After this , Sennacherib king of Assyria , who was besieging Lachish with all his forces , sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem , saying ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	10	“ Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria , ‘ On what are you trusting , that you endure the siege in Jerusalem ?
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	11	Is not Hezekiah misleading you , that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst , when he tells you , “ The Lord our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria ” ?
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	12	( K ) Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem , “ Before one altar you shall worship , and on it you shall burn your sacrifices ” ?
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	13	Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands ? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to deliver their lands out of my hand ?
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	14	Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers devoted to destruction was able to deliver his people from my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand ?
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	15	Now , therefore , do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion , and do not believe him , for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers . How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand ! ’ ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	16	And his servants said still more against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	17	And he wrote letters to cast contempt on the Lord , the God of Israel , and to speak against him , saying , “ Like the gods of the nations of the lands who have not delivered their people from my hands , so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver his people from my hand. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	18	And they shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten and terrify them , in order that they might take the city .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	19	And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth , which are the work of men 's hands . The Lord Delivers Jerusalem
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	20	Then Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , prayed because of this and cried to heaven .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	21	And the Lord sent an angel , who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria . So he returned with ( L ) shame of face to his own land . And when he came into the house of his god , some of his own sons struck him down there with the sword .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	22	So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies , and he provided for them on every side .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	23	And many ( M ) brought gifts to the Lord to Jerusalem and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah , so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from that time onward . Hezekiah 's Pride and Achievements
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	24	( N ) In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death , and he prayed to the Lord , and he answered him and gave him a sign .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	25	But Hezekiah ( O ) did not make return according to the benefit done to him , for ( P ) his heart was proud . Therefore ( Q ) wrath came upon him and Judah and Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	26	But Hezekiah ( R ) humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	27	And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor , and he made for himself treasuries for silver , for gold , for precious stones , for spices , for shields , and for all kinds of ( S ) costly vessels ;
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	28	storehouses also for the yield of grain , wine , and oil ; and stalls for all kinds of cattle , and sheepfolds .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	29	He likewise provided cities for himself , and flocks and herds in abundance , for God had given him very great possessions .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	30	This same Hezekiah ( T ) closed the upper outlet of the waters of ( U ) Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David . And Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	31	And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon , ( V ) who had been sent to him to inquire about ( W ) the sign that had been done in the land , God left him to himself , ( X ) in order to test him and to know all that was in his heart .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	32	33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the ( AA ) upper part of the tombs of the sons of David , and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death . And Manasseh his son reigned in his place . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	2	Chronicles 33:19 One Hebrew manuscript , Septuagint ; most Hebrew manuscripts of Hozai The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	33	( A ) Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	3	For he rebuilt the high places ( C ) that his father Hezekiah had broken down , and he erected altars to the Baals , and made ( D ) Asheroth , and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	4	And he built altars in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord had said , ( E ) “ In Jerusalem shall my name be forever. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in ( F ) the two courts of the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	6	( G ) And he burned his sons as an offering ( H ) in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , and ( I ) used fortune-telling and omens and sorcery , and dealt with ( J ) mediums and with necromancers . He did much evil in the sight of the Lord , provoking him to anger .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	7	And ( K ) the carved image of the idol that he had made he set in the house of God , of which God said to David and to Solomon his son , “ In this house , and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , ( L ) I will put my name forever ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	8	and I will no more remove the foot of Israel from the land ( M ) that I appointed for your fathers , if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them , all the law , the statutes , and the rules given through Moses. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	9	Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray , to do more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the people of Israel . Manasseh 's Repentance
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	10	The Lord spoke to Manasseh and to his people , but they paid no attention .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	11	( N ) Therefore the Lord brought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria , who captured Manasseh with hooks and ( O ) bound him with chains of bronze and brought him to Babylon .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	12	And when he was in distress , he entreated the favor of the Lord his God ( P ) and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	13	He prayed to him , and ( Q ) God was moved by his entreaty and heard his plea and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom . ( R ) Then Manasseh knew that the Lord was God .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	14	Afterward he built an outer wall for the city of David west of ( S ) Gihon , in the valley , and for the entrance into ( T ) the Fish Gate , and carried it around ( U ) Ophel , and raised it to a very great height . He also put commanders of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	15	And ( V ) he took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the Lord , and all the altars that he had built on the mountain of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem , and he threw them outside of the city .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	16	He also restored the altar of the Lord and offered on it sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving , and he commanded Judah to serve the Lord , the God of Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	17	( W ) Nevertheless , the people still sacrificed at the high places , but only to the Lord their God .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and ( X ) his prayer to his God , and the words of ( Y ) the seers who spoke to him in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel , behold , they are in the ( Z ) Chronicles of the Kings of Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	19	And his prayer , and how ( AA ) God was moved by his entreaty , and all his sin and his faithlessness , and the sites ( AB ) on which he built high places and set up the ( AC ) Asherim and the images , before ( AD ) he humbled himself , behold , they are written in the Chronicles of the Seers . [ a ]
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers , and they buried him in his house , and Amon his son reigned in his place . Amon 's Reign and Death
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	21	( AE ) Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	22	And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , as Manasseh his father had done . Amon sacrificed to all the images ( AF ) that Manasseh his father had made , and served them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	23	And he did not humble himself before the Lord , ( AG ) as Manasseh his father had humbled himself , but this Amon incurred guilt more and more .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	24	And his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his house .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	33	25	But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon . And the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	2	Chronicles 34:22 Syriac , Vulgate ; Hebrew lacks had sent The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	34	( A ) Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	3	For in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet a boy , he began to seek the God of David his father , and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places , the ( B ) Asherim , and the carved and the metal images .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	4	And they chopped down the altars of the Baals in his presence , and he cut down the ( C ) incense altars that stood above them . And he broke in pieces the ( D ) Asherim and the carved and the metal images , and he made dust of them and ( E ) scattered it over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	5	( F ) He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	6	And in the ( G ) cities of Manasseh , Ephraim , and Simeon , and as far as Naphtali , in their ruins [ a ] all around ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	7	he broke down the altars and beat the ( H ) Asherim and the images ( I ) into powder and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel . Then he returned to Jerusalem . The Book of the Law Found
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	8	( J ) Now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had cleansed the land and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the ( K ) governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz , ( L ) the recorder , to repair the house of the Lord his God .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	9	They came to ( M ) Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the house of God , which the Levites , the keepers of the threshold , had collected from ( N ) Manasseh and Ephraim and from all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	10	And they gave it to the workmen who were working in the house of the Lord . And the workmen who were working in the house of the Lord gave it for repairing and restoring the house .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	11	They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone , and timber for binders and ( O ) beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had let go to ruin .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	12	And the men did the work faithfully . Over them were set Jahath and Obadiah the Levites , of the sons of Merari , and Zechariah and Meshullam , of the sons of the Kohathites , to have oversight . ( P ) The Levites , all who were skillful with instruments of music ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	13	were over ( Q ) the burden-bearers and directed all who did work in every kind of service , and some of the Levites were scribes and officials and gatekeepers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	14	While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of the Lord , ( R ) Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord given through [ b ] Moses .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	15	Then Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the secretary , “ I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord. ” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	16	Shaphan brought the book to the king , and further reported to the king , “ All that was committed to your servants they are doing .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	17	They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the Lord and have given it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	18	Then Shaphan the secretary told the king , “ Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. ” And Shaphan read from it before the king .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	19	And when the king heard the words of the Law , ( S ) he tore his clothes .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	20	And the king commanded Hilkiah , Ahikam the son of Shaphan , Abdon the son of Micah , Shaphan the secretary , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	21	“ Go , inquire of the Lord for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah , concerning the words of the book that has been found . For great is ( T ) the wrath of the Lord that is poured out on us , because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord , to do according to all that is written in this book. ” Huldah Prophesies Disaster
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	22	So Hilkiah and those whom the king had sent [ c ] went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath , son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter ) and spoke to her to that effect .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	23	And she said to them , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : ‘ Tell the man who sent you to me ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	24	Thus says the Lord , Behold , I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants , all the curses that are written in the book that was read before the king of Judah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	25	Because they have forsaken me and ( U ) have made offerings to other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands , therefore ( V ) my wrath will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	26	But to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of the Lord , thus shall you say to him , Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : Regarding the words that you have heard ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	27	because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants , and you have humbled yourself before me and have torn your clothes and wept before me , I also have heard you , declares the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	28	Behold , I will gather you to your fathers , and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace , and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants. ’ ” And they brought back word to the king .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	29	( W ) Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	30	And the king went up to the house of the Lord , with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites , all the people both great and small . And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the Lord .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	31	And the king ( X ) stood in his place ( Y ) and made a covenant before the Lord , to walk after the Lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes , with all his heart and all his soul , to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	32	Then he made all who were present in Jerusalem and in Benjamin join in it . And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	34	33	And Josiah took away ( Z ) all the abominations from all the territory that belonged to the people of Israel and made all who were present in Israel serve the Lord their God . All his days they did not turn away from following the Lord , the God of their fathers . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	2	Chronicles 35:6 Hebrew by the hand of The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	35	( A ) Josiah kept a Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem . And they slaughtered the Passover lamb ( B ) on the fourteenth day of the first month .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	3	And he said to the Levites ( D ) who taught all Israel and who were holy to the Lord , “ Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon the son of David , king of Israel , built . You need not carry it on your shoulders . Now serve the Lord your God and his people Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	4	Prepare yourselves ( E ) according to your fathers ' houses by your divisions , ( F ) as prescribed in the writing of David king of Israel ( G ) and the document of Solomon his son .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	5	And ( H ) stand in the Holy Place ( I ) according to the groupings of the fathers ' houses of your brothers the lay people , and according to the division of the Levites by fathers ' household .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	6	And slaughter the Passover lamb , and ( J ) consecrate yourselves , and prepare for your brothers , to do according to the word of the Lord by [ a ] Moses. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	7	Then Josiah contributed to the lay people , as Passover offerings for all who were present , lambs and young goats from the flock to the number of 30,000 , and 3,000 bulls ; ( K ) these were from the king 's possessions .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	8	And his officials contributed willingly to the people , to the priests , and to the Levites . ( L ) Hilkiah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , the chief officers of the house of God , gave to the priests for the Passover offerings 2,600 Passover lambs and
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	300	bulls .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	9	Conaniah also , and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers , and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad , the chiefs of the Levites , gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings 5,000 lambs and young goats and
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	500	bulls .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	10	When the service had been prepared for , the priests ( M ) stood in their place , ( N ) and the Levites in their divisions according to the king 's command .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	11	( O ) And they slaughtered the Passover lamb , and the priests ( P ) threw the blood that they received from them ( Q ) while the Levites flayed the sacrifices .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	12	And they set aside the burnt offerings that they might distribute them according to the groupings of the fathers ' houses of the lay people , to offer to the Lord , as it is written in the Book of Moses . And so they did with the bulls .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	13	( R ) And they roasted the Passover lamb with fire according to the rule ; and they ( S ) boiled the holy offerings in pots , in cauldrons , and in pans , and carried them quickly to all the lay people .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	14	And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests , because the priests , the sons of Aaron , were offering the burnt offerings and the fat parts until night ; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests , the sons of Aaron .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	15	The singers , the sons of Asaph , were in their place ( T ) according to the command of David , and Asaph , and Heman , and Jeduthun the king 's ( U ) seer ; ( V ) and the gatekeepers were at each gate . They did not need to depart from their service , for their brothers the Levites prepared for them .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	16	So all the service of the Lord was prepared that day , to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord , according to the command of King Josiah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	17	And the people of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time , ( W ) and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	18	( X ) No Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet . None of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as was kept by Josiah , and the priests and the Levites , and all Judah and Israel who were present , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept . Josiah Killed in Battle
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	20	( Y ) After all this , when Josiah had prepared the temple , Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at ( Z ) Carchemish on the Euphrates , and Josiah went out to meet him .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	21	But he sent envoys to him , saying , “ What have we to do with each other , king of Judah ? I am not coming against you this day , but against the house with which I am at war . And God has commanded me to hurry . Cease opposing God , who is with me , lest he destroy you. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	22	Nevertheless , Josiah did not turn away from him , but ( AA ) disguised himself in order to fight with him . He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God , but came to fight in the plain of ( AB ) Megiddo .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	23	And the archers shot King Josiah . And the king said to his servants , ( AC ) “ Take me away , for I am badly wounded. ”
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	24	So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem . And he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers . ( AD ) All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	25	( AE ) Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiah ; and all ( AF ) the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josiah in their laments to this day . They made these a rule in Israel ; behold , they are written in the Laments .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and his good deeds according to what is written in the Law of the Lord ,
ESV	2%20Chronicles	35	27	and his acts , first and last , behold , they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah . Footnotes -

ESV	2%20Chronicles	36	4	And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem , and changed his name to Jehoiakim . But Neco took Jehoahaz his brother and carried him to Egypt .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	36	5	( C ) Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	36	6	( D ) Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ( E ) and bound him in chains ( F ) to take him to Babylon .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	36	7	( G ) Nebuchadnezzar also carried part of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon and put them in his palace in Babylon .

ESV	2%20Chronicles	36	13	( O ) He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God . ( P ) He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the Lord , the God of Israel .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	36	14	All the officers of the priests and the people likewise were exceedingly unfaithful , following all the abominations of the nations . And they polluted the house of the Lord that he had made holy in Jerusalem .
ESV	2%20Chronicles	36	15	The Lord , the God of their fathers , ( Q ) sent persistently to them by his messengers , because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place .

ESV	2%20Chronicles	36	17	( U ) Therefore he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans , who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion on young man or virgin , old man or aged . He gave them all into his hand .

ESV	Ezra	4	13	Now be it known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished , they will not pay ( P ) tribute , custom , or toll , and the royal revenue will be impaired .
ESV	Ezra	4	14	Now because we eat the salt of the palace [ b ] and it is not fitting for us to witness the king 's dishonor , therefore we send and inform the king ,
ESV	Ezra	4	15	in order that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers . You will find in the book of the records and learn that this city is a rebellious city , hurtful to kings and provinces , and that sedition was stirred up in it from of old .

ESV	Ezra	4	16	We make known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls finished , you will then have no possession in the province Beyond the River. ” The King Orders the Work to Cease
ESV	Ezra	4	17	The king sent an answer : “ To Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River , greeting . And now
ESV	Ezra	4	18	the letter that you sent to us has been ( Q ) plainly read before me .
ESV	Ezra	4	19	And I made a decree , and search has been made , and it has been found that this city from of old has risen against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it .
ESV	Ezra	4	20	And mighty kings have been over Jerusalem , ( R ) who ruled over the whole province Beyond the River , to whom ( S ) tribute , custom , and toll were paid .
ESV	Ezra	4	21	Therefore make a decree that these men be made to cease , and that this city be not rebuilt , until a decree is made by me .

ESV	Ezra	5	13	( P ) However , in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon , Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be rebuilt .
ESV	Ezra	5	14	( Q ) And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon , these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered to one whose name was ( R ) Sheshbazzar , whom he had made governor ;
ESV	Ezra	5	15	and he said to him , “ Take these vessels , go and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site. ”
ESV	Ezra	5	16	Then this ( S ) Sheshbazzar came and ( T ) laid the foundations of the house of God that is in Jerusalem , and from that time until now it has been in building , and it is ( U ) not yet finished. ’
ESV	Ezra	5	17	Therefore , if it seems good to the king , ( V ) let search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon , to see whether a decree was issued by Cyrus the king for the rebuilding of this house of God in Jerusalem . And let the king send us his pleasure in this matter. ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Ezra	6	14	( L ) And the elders of the Jews built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo . They finished their building by decree of the God of Israel and ( M ) by decree of Cyrus and ( N ) Darius and ( O ) Artaxerxes king of Persia ;
ESV	Ezra	6	15	and this house was finished on the third day of the ( P ) month of Adar , in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king .
ESV	Ezra	6	16	And the people of Israel , the priests and the Levites , and the rest of the returned exiles , celebrated the ( Q ) dedication of this house of God with joy .

ESV	Ezra	7	8	And Ezra [ a ] came to Jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
ESV	Ezra	7	9	For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylonia , and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem , ( I ) for the good hand of his God was on him .
ESV	Ezra	7	10	For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the Lord , and to do it ( J ) and to ( K ) teach his statutes and rules in Israel .
ESV	Ezra	7	11	This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest , the scribe , a man learned in matters of the commandments of the Lord and his statutes for Israel :

ESV	Ezra	7	13	( O ) I make a decree that anyone of the people of Israel or their priests or Levites in my kingdom , who freely offers to go to Jerusalem , may go with you .
ESV	Ezra	7	14	For you are sent by the king ( P ) and his seven counselors to make inquiries about Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God , which is in your hand ,
ESV	Ezra	7	15	and also to carry the silver and gold that the king ( Q ) and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel , ( R ) whose dwelling is in Jerusalem ,
ESV	Ezra	7	16	( S ) with all the silver and gold that you shall find in the whole province of Babylonia , and ( T ) with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests , vowed willingly for the house of their God that is in Jerusalem .
ESV	Ezra	7	17	With this money , then , you shall with all diligence buy bulls , rams , and lambs , with their grain offerings and their drink offerings , and ( U ) you shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God that is in Jerusalem .
ESV	Ezra	7	18	Whatever seems good to you and your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold , you may do , according to the will of your God .
ESV	Ezra	7	19	The vessels that have been given you for the service of the house of your God , you shall deliver before the God of Jerusalem .
ESV	Ezra	7	20	And whatever else is required for the house of your God , which it falls to you to provide , you may provide it out of the king 's treasury .
ESV	Ezra	7	21	“ And I , Artaxerxes the king , make a decree to all the treasurers in the province Beyond the River : Whatever Ezra the priest , the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven , requires of you , let it be done with all diligence ,

ESV	Ezra	7	23	Whatever is decreed by the God of heaven , let it be done in full for the house of the God of heaven , lest his wrath be against the realm of the king and his sons .
ESV	Ezra	7	24	We also notify you that it shall not be lawful to impose ( V ) tribute , custom , or toll on anyone of the priests , the Levites , the singers , the doorkeepers , the temple servants , or other servants of this house of God .
ESV	Ezra	7	25	“ And you , Ezra , according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand , ( W ) appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people in the province Beyond the River , all such as know the laws of your God . ( X ) And those who do not know them , you shall teach .
ESV	Ezra	7	26	Whoever will not obey the law of your God and the law of the king , let judgment be strictly executed on him , whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of his goods or for imprisonment. ”

ESV	Ezra	8	22	For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way , since we had told the king , ( R ) “ The hand of our God is for good on ( S ) all who seek him , and the power of his wrath is against all who forsake him. ”
ESV	Ezra	8	23	So we fasted and implored our God for this , and he listened to our entreaty . Priests to Guard Offerings

ESV	Ezra	9	9	( W ) For we are slaves . Yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery , ( X ) but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia , to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God , to repair its ruins , and to give us protection [ c ] in Judea and Jerusalem .
ESV	Ezra	9	2	( D ) For they have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons , so that the ( E ) holy race [ a ] has ( F ) mixed itself with the peoples of the lands . And in this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost. ”
ESV	Ezra	9	3	As soon as I heard this , I ( G ) tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and ( H ) sat appalled .
ESV	Ezra	9	4	Then all who ( I ) trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles , gathered around me while I sat ( J ) appalled until the evening sacrifice .
ESV	Ezra	9	5	And at the ( K ) evening sacrifice I rose from my fasting , with my garment ( L ) and my cloak torn , and fell upon my knees ( M ) and spread out my hands to the Lord my God ,
ESV	Ezra	9	6	saying : “ O my God , I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to you , my God , for our iniquities ( N ) have risen higher than our heads , and our ( O ) guilt has ( P ) mounted up to the heavens .
ESV	Ezra	9	7	( Q ) From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great ( R ) guilt . And for our iniquities we , our kings , and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands , to the sword , to captivity , to plundering , ( S ) and to utter shame , as it is today .
ESV	Ezra	9	8	But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the Lord our God , to leave us a ( T ) remnant and to give us a ( U ) secure hold [ b ] within his holy place , that our God may ( V ) brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our slavery .
ESV	Ezra	9	10	“ And now , O our God , what shall we say after this ? For we have forsaken your commandments ,
ESV	Ezra	9	11	which you commanded by your servants the prophets , saying , ‘ The land that you are entering , to take possession of it , is a land impure with the impurity of the peoples of the lands , with their abominations that have filled it from end to end with ( Y ) their uncleanness .
ESV	Ezra	9	12	( Z ) Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons , neither take their daughters for your sons , and never seek their peace or prosperity , that you may be strong and eat the good of the land ( AA ) and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever. ’
ESV	Ezra	9	13	And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for ( AB ) our great guilt , seeing that you , our ( AC ) God , have punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have given us such a ( AD ) remnant as this ,
ESV	Ezra	9	14	shall we break your commandments again and ( AE ) intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations ? Would you not be angry with us ( AF ) until you consumed us , so that there should be no ( AG ) remnant , nor any to escape ?
ESV	Ezra	9	15	O Lord , the God of Israel , you are just , for we are left a ( AH ) remnant that has escaped , as it is today . Behold , we are before you in our ( AI ) guilt , ( AJ ) for none can stand before you because of this. ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Ezra	10	10	And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them , “ You have broken faith and married foreign women , and so increased the guilt of Israel .
ESV	Ezra	10	2	And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel , of the sons of Elam , addressed Ezra : ( E ) “ We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land , but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this .
ESV	Ezra	10	3	Therefore ( F ) let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and ( G ) their children , according to the counsel of my lord [ a ] and of ( H ) those who tremble at the commandment of our God , and let it be done ( I ) according to the Law .
ESV	Ezra	10	4	Arise , for it is your task , and we are with you ; ( J ) be strong and do it. ”
ESV	Ezra	10	5	Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel ( K ) take an oath that they would do as had been said . So they took the oath .
ESV	Ezra	10	6	Then Ezra withdrew ( L ) from before the house of God and went to the ( M ) chamber of ( N ) Jehohanan the son of ( O ) Eliashib , where he spent the night , [ b ] neither ( P ) eating bread nor drinking water , for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles .
ESV	Ezra	10	7	And a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem ,
ESV	Ezra	10	8	and that if anyone did not come within three days , by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited , and he himself banned from the congregation of the exiles .
ESV	Ezra	10	9	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days . It was the ninth month , on the twentieth day of the month . And all the people sat in the open square before the house of God , trembling because of this matter and because of the ( Q ) heavy rain .
ESV	Ezra	10	11	Now then ( R ) make confession to the Lord , the God of your fathers and do his will . ( S ) Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives. ”
ESV	Ezra	10	12	Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice , “ It is so ; we must do as you have said .
ESV	Ezra	10	13	But the people are many , and it is a time of heavy rain ; we can not stand in the open . Nor is this a task for one day or for two , for we have greatly transgressed in this matter .
ESV	Ezra	10	14	Let our officials stand for the whole assembly . Let all in our cities who have taken foreign wives come ( T ) at appointed times , and with them the elders and judges of every city , ( U ) until the fierce wrath of our God over this matter is turned away from us. ”
ESV	Ezra	10	15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this , and ( V ) Meshullam and ( W ) Shabbethai the Levite supported them .
ESV	Ezra	10	16	Then the returned exiles did so . Ezra the priest selected men , [ c ] heads of fathers ' houses , according to their fathers ' houses , each of them designated by name . On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to examine the matter ;

ESV	Nehemiah	1	1	The words of ( A ) Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah . Now it happened in the month of ( B ) Chislev , ( C ) in the twentieth year , as I was in ( D ) Susa the citadel ,
ESV	Nehemiah	1	2	that ( E ) Hanani , one of my brothers , came with certain men from Judah . And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped , who had survived the exile , and concerning Jerusalem .
ESV	Nehemiah	1	3	And they said to me , “ The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and ( F ) shame . ( G ) The wall of Jerusalem is broken down , ( H ) and its gates are destroyed by fire. ” Nehemiah 's Prayer
ESV	Nehemiah	1	4	As soon as I heard these words I ( I ) sat down and wept and mourned for days , and I continued fasting and praying before the ( J ) God of heaven .
ESV	Nehemiah	1	5	And I said , “ O Lord God of heaven , ( K ) the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments ,
ESV	Nehemiah	1	6	( L ) let your ear be attentive and your eyes open , to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants , ( M ) confessing the sins of the people of Israel , which we have sinned against you . Even ( N ) I and my father 's house have sinned .
ESV	Nehemiah	1	7	( O ) We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments , the statutes , and the rules ( P ) that you commanded your servant Moses .
ESV	Nehemiah	1	8	Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses , saying , ‘ If you are unfaithful , ( Q ) I will scatter you among the peoples ,
ESV	Nehemiah	1	9	( R ) but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them , ( S ) though your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven , from there I will gather them and bring them ( T ) to the place that I have chosen , to make my name dwell there. ’
ESV	Nehemiah	1	10	( U ) They are your servants and your people , whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand .
ESV	Nehemiah	1	11	O Lord , ( V ) let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant , and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name , and give success to your servant today , and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. ” Now I was ( W ) cupbearer to the king .

ESV	Nehemiah	2	2	And the king said to me , “ Why is your face sad , seeing you are not sick ? This is nothing but ( D ) sadness of the heart. ” Then I was very much afraid .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	3	I said to the king , ( E ) “ Let the king live forever ! Why should not my face be sad , ( F ) when the city , the place of my fathers ' graves , lies in ruins , and its gates have been destroyed by fire ? ”
ESV	Nehemiah	2	4	Then the king said to me , “ What are you requesting ? ” So I prayed ( G ) to the God of heaven .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	5	And I said to the king , “ If it pleases the king , and if your servant has found favor in your sight , that you send me to Judah , to the city of my fathers ' graves , that I may rebuild it. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	2	6	And the king said to me ( ( H ) the queen sitting beside him ) , “ How long will you be gone , and when will you return ? ” So it pleased the king to send me ( I ) when I had given him a time .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	7	And I said to the king , “ If it pleases the king , let letters be given me ( J ) to the governors of the province Beyond the River , that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah ,
ESV	Nehemiah	2	8	and a letter to Asaph , the keeper of the king 's forest , that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of ( K ) the fortress of the temple , and for the wall of the city , and for the house that I shall occupy. ” And the king granted me what I asked , ( L ) for the good hand of my God was upon me . Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem 's Walls
ESV	Nehemiah	2	9	Then I came to ( M ) the governors of the province Beyond the River and gave them the king 's letters . Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	10	But when ( N ) Sanballat the Horonite and ( O ) Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard this , it displeased them greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the people of Israel .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	11	( P ) So I went to Jerusalem and was there three days .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	12	Then I arose in the night , I and a few men with me . And I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem . There was no animal with me but the one on which I rode .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	13	I went out by night by ( Q ) the Valley Gate to the Dragon Spring and to ( R ) the Dung Gate , and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem ( S ) that were broken down ( T ) and its gates that had been destroyed by fire .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	14	Then I went on to ( U ) the Fountain Gate and to ( V ) the King 's Pool , but there was no room for the animal that was under me to pass .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	15	Then I went up in the night ( W ) by the valley and inspected the wall , and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate , and so returned .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	16	And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing , and I had not yet told the Jews , the priests , the nobles , the officials , and the rest who were to do the work .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	17	Then I said to them , “ You see the trouble we are in , ( X ) how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned . Come , let us build the wall of Jerusalem , that we may no longer ( Y ) suffer derision. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	2	18	And I told them ( Z ) of the hand of my God that had been upon me for good , and also of the words that the king had spoken to me . And they said , “ Let us rise up and build. ” ( AA ) So they strengthened their hands for the good work .
ESV	Nehemiah	2	19	But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and ( AB ) Geshem the Arab heard of it , ( AC ) they jeered at us and despised us and said , “ What is this thing that you are doing ? ( AD ) Are you rebelling against the king ? ”
ESV	Nehemiah	2	20	Then I replied to them , ( AE ) “ The God of heaven will make us prosper , and we his servants will arise and build , but you have no portion or right or claim [ a ] in Jerusalem. ” Footnotes - Nehemiah 2:20 Or memorial The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Nehemiah	4	4	( E ) Hear , O our God , for we are despised . ( F ) Turn back their taunt on their own heads and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are captives .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	2	And he said in the presence of his brothers and of the army of ( B ) Samaria , “ What are these feeble Jews doing ? Will they restore it for themselves ? [ b ] Will they sacrifice ? Will they finish up in a day ? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish , and burned ones at that ? ”
ESV	Nehemiah	4	3	( C ) Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him , and he said , “ Yes , what they are building— ( D ) if a fox goes up on it he will break down their stone wall ! ”
ESV	Nehemiah	4	5	( G ) Do not cover their guilt , and let not their sin be blotted out from your sight , for they have provoked you to anger in the presence of the builders .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	6	So we built the wall . And all the wall was joined together to half its height , for the people had a mind to work .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	7	[ c ] But when ( H ) Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and that the breaches were beginning to be closed , they were very angry .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	8	( I ) And they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	9	And we prayed to our God and set a guard as a protection against them day and night .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	10	In Judah it was said , [ d ] “ The strength of those who bear the burdens is failing . There is too much rubble . By ourselves we will not be able to rebuild the wall. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	4	11	And our enemies said , “ They will not know or see till we come among them and kill them and stop the work. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	4	12	At that time the Jews who lived near them came from all directions and said to us ten times , “ You must return to us. ” [ e ]
ESV	Nehemiah	4	13	So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , in open places , I stationed the people by their clans , with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	14	And I looked and arose and said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people , ( J ) “ Do not be afraid of them . Remember the Lord , ( K ) who is great and awesome , ( L ) and fight for your brothers , your sons , your daughters , your wives , and your homes. ” The Work Resumes
ESV	Nehemiah	4	15	When our enemies heard that it was known to us ( M ) and that God had frustrated their plan , we all returned to the wall , each to his work .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	16	From that day on , half of my servants worked on construction , and half held the spears , shields , bows , and ( N ) coats of mail . And the leaders stood behind the whole house of Judah ,
ESV	Nehemiah	4	17	who were building on the wall . Those who carried burdens were loaded in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held his weapon with the other .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	18	And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built . The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	19	And I said to ( O ) the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people , “ The work is great and widely spread , and we are separated on the wall , far from one another .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	20	In the place where you hear the sound of the trumpet , rally to us there . ( P ) Our God will fight for us. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	4	21	So we labored at the work , and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out .
ESV	Nehemiah	4	22	I also said to the people at that time , “ Let every man and his servant pass the night within Jerusalem , that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	4	23	So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me , none of us took off our clothes ; ( Q ) each kept his weapon at his right hand .

ESV	Nehemiah	5	5	Now ( D ) our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers , our children are as their children . Yet ( E ) we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves , and some of our daughters have already been enslaved , but it is not in our power to help it , for other men have our fields and our vineyards. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	5	2	For there were those who said , “ With our sons and our daughters , we are many . So let us get grain , that we may eat and keep alive. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	5	3	There were also those who said , “ We are mortgaging our fields , our vineyards , and our houses to get grain because of the famine. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	5	4	And there were those who said , “ We have borrowed money for ( C ) the king 's tax on our fields and our vineyards .
ESV	Nehemiah	5	6	I was very angry when I heard ( F ) their outcry and these words .
ESV	Nehemiah	5	7	I took counsel with myself , and I brought charges against the nobles and the officials . I said to them , ( G ) “ You are exacting interest , each from his brother. ” And I held a great assembly against them
ESV	Nehemiah	5	8	and said to them , “ We , as far as we are able , ( H ) have bought back our Jewish brothers who have been sold to the nations , but you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us ! ” They were silent and could not find a word to say .
ESV	Nehemiah	5	9	So I said , “ The thing that you are doing is not good . Ought you not to walk ( I ) in the fear of our God ( J ) to prevent the taunts of the nations our enemies ?
ESV	Nehemiah	5	10	Moreover , I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain . Let us abandon this exacting of interest .

ESV	Nehemiah	5	12	Then they said , “ We will restore these and ( K ) require nothing from them . We will do as you say. ” And I called the priests and ( L ) made them swear ( M ) to do as they had promised .
ESV	Nehemiah	5	13	( N ) I also shook out the fold [ a ] of my garment and said , “ So may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not keep this promise . So may he be shaken out and emptied. ” ( O ) And all the assembly said “ Amen ” and praised the Lord . And the people did as they had promised . Nehemiah 's Generosity
ESV	Nehemiah	5	14	Moreover , from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah , from ( P ) the twentieth year to ( Q ) the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king , twelve years , ( R ) neither I nor my brothers ate the food allowance of the governor .
ESV	Nehemiah	5	15	The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people and took from them for their daily ration [ b ] forty shekels [ c ] of silver . Even their servants lorded it over the people . But I did not do so , ( S ) because of the fear of God .
ESV	Nehemiah	5	16	I also persevered in the work on this wall , and we acquired no land , and all my servants were gathered there for the work .
ESV	Nehemiah	5	17	Moreover , there were ( T ) at my table
ESV	Nehemiah	5	150	men , Jews and officials , besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us .
ESV	Nehemiah	5	18	( U ) Now what was prepared at my expense [ d ] for each day was one ox and six choice sheep and birds , and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance . Yet for all this ( V ) I did not demand the food allowance of the governor , because the service was too heavy on this people .
ESV	Nehemiah	5	19	( W ) Remember for my good , O my God , all that I have done for this people . Footnotes - Nehemiah 5:13 Hebrew bosom - Nehemiah 5:15 Compare Vulgate ; Hebrew took from them for food and wine after - Nehemiah 5:15 A shekel was about 2/5 ounce or

ESV	Nehemiah	6	6	In it was written , “ It is reported among the nations , and Geshem [ a ] also says it , that you and ( E ) the Jews intend to rebel ; that is why you are building the wall . And according to these reports you wish to become their king .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	2	Sanballat and Geshem sent to me , saying , “ Come and let us meet together at Hakkephirim in the plain of ( D ) Ono. ” But they intended to do me harm .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	3	And I sent messengers to them , saying , “ I am doing a great work and I can not come down . Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you ? ”
ESV	Nehemiah	6	4	And they sent to me four times in this way , and I answered them in the same manner .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	5	In the same way Sanballat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	7	And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem , ‘ There is a king in Judah. ’ And now the king will hear of these reports . So now come and let us take counsel together. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	6	8	Then I sent to him , saying , “ No such things as you say have been done , for you are inventing them out of your own mind. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	6	9	For they all wanted to frighten us , thinking , “ Their hands will drop from the work , and it will not be done. ” But now , O God , [ b ] strengthen my hands .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	10	Now when I went into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah , son of Mehetabel , who was ( F ) confined to his home , he said , “ Let us meet together in the house of God , within the temple . Let us close the doors of the temple , for they are coming to kill you . They are coming to kill you by night. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	6	11	But I said , “ Should such a man as I run away ? And what man such as I could go into the temple and live ? [ c ] I will not go in. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	6	12	And I understood and saw that God had not sent him , ( G ) but he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	13	For this purpose he was hired , that I should be afraid and act in this way and sin , and so they could give me a bad name in order to taunt me .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	14	( H ) Remember Tobiah and Sanballat , O my God , according to these things that they did , and also ( I ) the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who wanted to make me afraid . The Wall Is Finished
ESV	Nehemiah	6	15	So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul , in fifty-two days .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	16	And ( J ) when all our enemies heard of it , all the nations around us were afraid and fell greatly in their own esteem , ( K ) for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	17	Moreover , in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah , and Tobiah 's letters came to them .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	18	For many in Judah were bound by oath to him , because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of ( L ) Arah : and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of ( M ) Meshullam the son of Berechiah as his wife .
ESV	Nehemiah	6	19	Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him . And Tobiah sent letters to make me afraid .

ESV	Nehemiah	7	3	And I said to them , “ Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot . And while they are still standing guard , let them shut and bar the doors .

ESV	Nehemiah	7	4	The city was wide and large , but the people within it were few , and no houses had been rebuilt . Lists of Returned Exiles

ESV	Nehemiah	12	23	As for the sons of Levi , their heads of fathers ' houses ( H ) were written in the Book of the Chronicles until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .

ESV	Nehemiah	12	27	And at ( Q ) the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites in all their places , to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness , with thanksgivings and with singing , ( R ) with cymbals , harps , and lyres .
ESV	Nehemiah	12	28	And the sons of the singers gathered together from the district surrounding Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites ;
ESV	Nehemiah	12	29	also from Beth-gilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth , for the singers had built for themselves villages around Jerusalem .
ESV	Nehemiah	12	30	And the priests and the Levites ( S ) purified themselves , and they purified the people and the gates and the wall .
ESV	Nehemiah	12	31	Then I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall and appointed two great choirs that gave thanks . ( T ) One went to the south on the wall to ( U ) the Dung Gate .
ESV	Nehemiah	12	32	And after them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah ,

ESV	Nehemiah	12	37	At ( Y ) the Fountain Gate they went up straight before them by ( Z ) the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , to ( AA ) the Water Gate on the east .
ESV	Nehemiah	12	38	( AB ) The other choir of those who gave thanks went to the north , and I followed them with half of the people , on the wall , above ( AC ) the Tower of the Ovens , to ( AD ) the Broad Wall ,
ESV	Nehemiah	12	39	and above ( AE ) the Gate of Ephraim , and by ( AF ) the Gate of Yeshanah , [ a ] and by ( AG ) the Fish Gate and ( AH ) the Tower of Hananel and ( AI ) the Tower of the Hundred , to ( AJ ) the Sheep Gate ; and they came to a halt at ( AK ) the Gate of the Guard .

ESV	Nehemiah	12	44	( AM ) On that day men were appointed over the storerooms , the contributions , the firstfruits , and the tithes , to gather into them the portions required by the Law for the priests and for the Levites according to the fields of the towns , for Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who ministered .

ESV	Nehemiah	13	13	And ( R ) I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest , Zadok the scribe , and Pedaiah of the Levites , and as their assistant Hanan the son of Zaccur , son of Mattaniah , ( S ) for they were considered reliable , and their duty was to distribute to their brothers .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	2	for they did not meet the people of Israel with bread and water , but hired Balaam against them to curse them—yet our God turned the curse into a blessing .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	3	As soon as the people heard the law , ( C ) they separated from Israel all ( D ) those of foreign descent .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	4	Now before this , ( E ) Eliashib the priest , who ( F ) was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God , and who was related to ( G ) Tobiah ,
ESV	Nehemiah	13	5	prepared for Tobiah a large chamber where they had previously put the grain offering , the frankincense , the vessels , and the tithes of grain , wine , and oil , ( H ) which were given by commandment to the Levites , singers , and gatekeepers , and the contributions for the priests .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	6	While this was taking place , I was not in Jerusalem , for ( I ) in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes ( J ) king of Babylon I went to the king . And after some time I asked leave of the king
ESV	Nehemiah	13	7	and came to Jerusalem , and I then discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah , ( K ) preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	8	And I was very angry , and I threw all the household furniture of Tobiah out of the chamber .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	9	Then I gave orders , and they ( L ) cleansed the chambers , and I brought back there the vessels of the house of God , with the grain offering and the frankincense .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	10	I also found out that ( M ) the portions of the Levites had not been given to them , so that the Levites and the singers , who did the work , had fled each ( N ) to his field .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	11	( O ) So I confronted the officials and said , ( P ) “ Why is the house of God forsaken ? ” And I gathered them together and set them in their stations .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	12	Then all Judah brought ( Q ) the tithe of the grain , wine , and oil into the storehouses .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	14	( T ) Remember me , O my God , concerning this , and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days I saw in Judah people treading winepresses ( U ) on the Sabbath , and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys , and also wine , grapes , figs , and all kinds of loads , ( V ) which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day . And ( W ) I warned them on the day when they sold food .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	16	Tyrians also , who lived in the city , brought in fish and all kinds of goods and sold them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah , in Jerusalem itself !
ESV	Nehemiah	13	17	( X ) Then I confronted the nobles of Judah and said to them , “ What is this evil thing that you are doing , ( Y ) profaning the Sabbath day ?
ESV	Nehemiah	13	18	( Z ) Did not your fathers act in this way , and did not our God bring all this disaster [ a ] on us and on this city ? Now you are bringing more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath. ”
ESV	Nehemiah	13	19	As soon as it ( AA ) began to grow dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath , I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath . And I stationed some of my servants at the gates , that no load might be brought in on the Sabbath day .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	20	Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	21	( AB ) But I warned them and said to them , “ Why do you lodge outside the wall ? If you do so again , I will lay hands on you. ” From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	22	Then I commanded the Levites ( AC ) that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates , to keep the Sabbath day holy . ( AD ) Remember this also in my favor , O my God , and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast love .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	23	In those days also I saw the Jews ( AE ) who had married women ( AF ) of Ashdod , ( AG ) Ammon , and ( AH ) Moab .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	24	And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod , and they could not speak the language of Judah , but only the language of each people .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	25	( AI ) And I confronted them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair . ( AJ ) And I made them take an oath in the name of God , saying , “ You shall not give your daughters to their sons , or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	26	( AK ) Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women ? ( AL ) Among the many nations there was no king like him , and he was ( AM ) beloved by his God , and God made him king over all Israel . Nevertheless , foreign women made even him to sin .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	27	Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and ( AN ) act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women ? ”
ESV	Nehemiah	13	28	And one of the sons of ( AO ) Jehoiada , the son of ( AP ) Eliashib the high priest , was the son-in-law of ( AQ ) Sanballat the Horonite . Therefore I chased him from me .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	29	( AR ) Remember them , O my God , because they have desecrated the priesthood ( AS ) and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites .
ESV	Nehemiah	13	30	( AT ) Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign , and I established the duties of the priests and Levites , each in his work ;
ESV	Nehemiah	13	31	and I provided ( AU ) for the wood offering ( AV ) at appointed times , and for the firstfruits . ( AW ) Remember me , O my God , for good .

ESV	Esther	1	1	Now in the days of Ahasuerus , the Ahasuerus who reigned ( A ) from India to Ethiopia over ( B )
ESV	Esther	1	127	provinces ,
ESV	Esther	1	2	in those days when King Ahasuerus ( C ) sat on his royal throne in ( D ) Susa , the citadel ,
ESV	Esther	1	3	in the third year of his reign ( E ) he gave a feast for all his officials and servants . The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces were before him ,
ESV	Esther	1	4	while he showed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his greatness for many days ,
ESV	Esther	1	180	days .
ESV	Esther	1	5	And when these days were completed , the king gave for all the people present in Susa the citadel , both great and small , a feast lasting for seven days in the court of ( F ) the garden of the king 's palace .
ESV	Esther	1	6	There were white cotton curtains and violet hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rods [ a ] and marble pillars , and also ( G ) couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry , marble , mother-of-pearl , and precious stones .
ESV	Esther	1	7	Drinks were served in golden vessels , vessels of different kinds , and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king .
ESV	Esther	1	8	And drinking was according to this edict : “ There is no compulsion. ” For the king had given orders to all the staff of his palace to do as each man desired .
ESV	Esther	1	9	Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the palace that belonged to King Ahasuerus . Queen Vashti 's Refusal
ESV	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day , ( H ) when the heart of the king was merry with wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , ( I ) Harbona , ( J ) Bigtha and Abagtha , Zethar and Carkas , the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus ,
ESV	Esther	1	11	to bring Queen Vashti before the king with ( K ) her royal crown , [ b ] in order to show the peoples and the princes her beauty , for she was lovely to look at .
ESV	Esther	1	12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king 's command delivered by the eunuchs . At this the king became enraged , and his anger burned within him .
ESV	Esther	1	13	Then the king said to ( L ) the wise men ( M ) who knew the times ( for this was the king 's procedure toward all who were versed in law and judgment ,
ESV	Esther	1	14	the men next to him being Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , and ( N ) Memucan , ( O ) the seven princes of Persia and Media , ( P ) who saw the king 's face , and sat first in the kingdom ) :
ESV	Esther	1	15	“ According to the law , what is to be done to Queen Vashti , because she has not performed the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs ? ”
ESV	Esther	1	16	Then Memucan said in the presence of the king and the officials , “ Not only against the king has Queen Vashti done wrong , but also against all the officials and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus .
ESV	Esther	1	17	For the queen 's behavior will be made known to all women , causing them to look at their husbands with contempt , [ c ] since they will say , ‘ King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him , and she did not come. ’
ESV	Esther	1	18	This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen 's behavior will say the same to all the king 's officials , and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty .
ESV	Esther	1	19	If it please the king , let a royal order go out from him , and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so ( Q ) that it may not be repealed , that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus . And let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she .
ESV	Esther	1	20	So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom , for it is vast , ( R ) all women will give honor to their husbands , high and low alike. ”
ESV	Esther	1	21	This advice pleased the king and the princes , and the king did as Memucan proposed .
ESV	Esther	1	22	He sent letters to all the royal provinces , ( S ) to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language , that every man be master in his own household and speak according to the language of his people .

ESV	Esther	2	2	Then the king 's young men who attended him said , “ Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king .
ESV	Esther	2	3	And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in Susa the citadel , under custody of ( C ) Hegai , the king 's eunuch , who is in charge of the women . ( D ) Let their cosmetics be given them .
ESV	Esther	2	4	And let the young woman who pleases the king [ a ] be queen instead of Vashti. ” This pleased the king , and he did so .
ESV	Esther	2	5	Now there was a Jew in Susa the citadel whose name was ( E ) Mordecai , the son of Jair , son of Shimei , son of Kish , a Benjaminite ,
ESV	Esther	2	6	( F ) who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away .
ESV	Esther	2	7	He was bringing up Hadassah , that is Esther , ( G ) the daughter of his uncle , for she had neither father nor mother . The young woman had a beautiful figure and was lovely to look at , and when her father and her mother died , Mordecai took her as his own daughter .
ESV	Esther	2	8	So when the king 's order and his edict were proclaimed , and ( H ) when many young women were gathered in Susa the citadel in custody of ( I ) Hegai , Esther also was taken into the king 's palace and put in custody of Hegai , who had charge of the women .
ESV	Esther	2	9	And the young woman pleased him and won his favor . And he quickly provided her ( J ) with her cosmetics and her portion of food , and with seven chosen young women from the king 's palace , and advanced her and her young women to the best place in the harem .
ESV	Esther	2	10	( K ) Esther had not made known her people or kindred , for Mordecai had commanded her not to make it known .
ESV	Esther	2	11	And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her .
ESV	Esther	2	12	Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus , after being twelve months under the regulations for the women , since this was the regular period of their beautifying , six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women—
ESV	Esther	2	13	when the young woman went in to the king in this way , she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king 's palace .
ESV	Esther	2	14	In the evening she would go in , and in the morning she would return to the second harem in custody of Shaashgaz , the king 's eunuch , who was in charge of the concubines . She would not go in to the king again , unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name .
ESV	Esther	2	15	When the turn came for Esther ( L ) the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai , who had taken her as his own daughter , to go in to the king , she asked for nothing except what ( M ) Hegai the king 's eunuch , who had charge of the women , advised . Now Esther was winning favor in the eyes of all who saw her .
ESV	Esther	2	16	And when Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus , into his royal palace , in the tenth month , which is the month of Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign ,
ESV	Esther	2	17	the king loved Esther more than all the women , and she won grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins , so that he set ( N ) the royal crown [ b ] on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti .
ESV	Esther	2	18	Then the king ( O ) gave a great feast for all his officials and servants ; it was Esther 's feast . He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces and gave gifts with royal generosity . Mordecai Discovers a Plot
ESV	Esther	2	19	Now when the virgins were gathered together ( P ) the second time , Mordecai was sitting ( Q ) at the king 's gate .
ESV	Esther	2	20	( R ) Esther had not made known her kindred or her people , as Mordecai had commanded her , for Esther obeyed Mordecai just ( S ) as when she was brought up by him .
ESV	Esther	2	21	In those days , as Mordecai was sitting at the king 's gate , ( T ) Bigthan and ( U ) Teresh , two of the king 's eunuchs , who guarded the threshold , became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus .
ESV	Esther	2	22	And this came to the knowledge of Mordecai , ( V ) and he told it to Queen Esther , and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai .
ESV	Esther	2	23	When the affair was investigated and found to be so , the men were both hanged on the gallows .

ESV	Esther	3	3	Then the king 's servants who were ( E ) at the king 's gate said to Mordecai , “ Why do you transgress ( F ) the king 's command ? ”
ESV	Esther	3	2	And all the king 's servants who were at the king 's gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman , for the king had so commanded concerning him . ( D ) But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage .
ESV	Esther	3	4	And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them , they told Haman , in order to see whether Mordecai 's words would stand , for he had told them that he was a Jew .
ESV	Esther	3	5	And when Haman saw that ( G ) Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him , Haman was ( H ) filled with fury .
ESV	Esther	3	6	But he disdained [ a ] to lay hands on Mordecai alone . So , as they had made known to him the people of Mordecai , Haman sought to destroy [ b ] all the Jews , the people of Mordecai , throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus .
ESV	Esther	3	7	In the first month , which is the month of Nisan , in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus , ( I ) they cast Pur ( that is , they cast lots ) before Haman day after day ; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month , which is ( J ) the month of Adar .
ESV	Esther	3	8	Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus , “ There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom . ( K ) Their laws are different from those of every other people , and they do not keep the king 's laws , so that it is not to the king 's profit to tolerate them .
ESV	Esther	3	9	If it please the king , let it be decreed that they be destroyed , and I will pay 10,000 talents [ c ] of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king 's business , that they may put it into the king 's treasuries. ”
ESV	Esther	3	10	( L ) So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman ( M ) the Agagite , the son of Hammedatha , ( N ) the enemy of the Jews .
ESV	Esther	3	11	And the king said to Haman , “ The money is given to you , the people also , to do with them as it seems good to you. ”
ESV	Esther	3	12	( O ) Then the king 's scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month , and an edict , according to all that Haman commanded , was written to the king 's ( P ) satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples , ( Q ) to every province in its own script and every people in its own language . It was written ( R ) in the name of King Ahasuerus ( S ) and sealed with the king 's signet ring .
ESV	Esther	3	13	Letters were sent ( T ) by couriers to all the king 's provinces with instruction ( U ) to destroy , to kill , and to annihilate all Jews , young and old , women and children , ( V ) in one day , the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month of Adar , ( W ) and to plunder their goods .
ESV	Esther	3	14	( X ) A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day .
ESV	Esther	3	15	( Y ) The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king , and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel .

ESV	Esther	4	4	When Esther 's young women and her eunuchs came and told her , the queen was deeply distressed . She sent garments to clothe Mordecai , so that he might take off his sackcloth , but he would not accept them .
ESV	Esther	4	2	He went up to the entrance of the king 's gate , for no one was allowed to enter the king 's gate clothed in sackcloth .
ESV	Esther	4	3	And in every province , wherever the king 's command and his decree reached , there was great mourning among the Jews , ( B ) with fasting and weeping and lamenting , and many of them ( C ) lay in sackcloth and ashes .
ESV	Esther	4	5	Then Esther called for Hathach , one of the king 's eunuchs , who had been appointed to attend her , and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was .
ESV	Esther	4	6	Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king 's gate ,
ESV	Esther	4	7	and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him , ( D ) and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king 's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews .
ESV	Esther	4	8	Mordecai also gave him ( E ) a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction , [ a ] that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and command her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him [ b ] on behalf of her people .
ESV	Esther	4	9	And Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said .
ESV	Esther	4	10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai and say ,
ESV	Esther	4	11	“ All the king 's servants and the people of the king 's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside ( F ) the inner court without being called , ( G ) there is but one law—to be put to death , except the one ( H ) to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live . But as for me , I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days. ”
ESV	Esther	4	12	And they told Mordecai what Esther had said .
ESV	Esther	4	13	Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther , “ Do not think to yourself that in the king 's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews .
ESV	Esther	4	14	For if you keep silent at this time , relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place , but you and your father 's house will perish . And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this ? ”
ESV	Esther	4	15	Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai ,
ESV	Esther	4	16	“ Go , gather all the Jews to be found in Susa , and hold a fast on my behalf , and do not eat or drink for ( I ) three days , night or day . I and my young women will also fast as you do . Then I will go to the king , though it is against the law , ( J ) and if I perish , I perish. ” [ c ]
ESV	Esther	4	17	Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him .

ESV	Esther	5	5	Then the king said , “ Bring Haman quickly , so that we may do as Esther has asked. ” So the king and Haman came to the feast that Esther had prepared .
ESV	Esther	5	2	And when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court , ( C ) she won favor in his sight , ( D ) and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand . Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter .
ESV	Esther	5	3	And the king said to her , “ What is it , Queen Esther ? What is your request ? It shall be given you , even ( E ) to the half of my kingdom. ”
ESV	Esther	5	4	And Esther said , “ If it please the king , [ a ] let the king and Haman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the king. ”
ESV	Esther	5	6	( F ) And as they were drinking wine after the feast , the king said to Esther , ( G ) “ What is your wish ? It shall be granted you . And what is your request ? ( H ) Even to the half of my kingdom , it shall be fulfilled. ” [ b ]
ESV	Esther	5	7	Then Esther answered , “ My wish and my request is :
ESV	Esther	5	8	( I ) If I have found favor in the sight of the king , and if it please the king [ c ] to grant my wish and fulfill my request , let the king and Haman come to ( J ) the feast that I will prepare for them , and tomorrow I will do as the king has said. ” Haman Plans to Hang Mordecai
ESV	Esther	5	9	And Haman went out that day ( K ) joyful and glad of heart . But when Haman saw Mordecai ( L ) in the king 's gate , ( M ) that he neither rose nor trembled before him , he was filled with wrath against Mordecai .
ESV	Esther	5	10	Nevertheless , Haman restrained himself and went home , and he sent and brought his friends and ( N ) his wife Zeresh .
ESV	Esther	5	11	And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches , ( O ) the number of his sons , all the promotions with which ( P ) the king had honored him , and how he had advanced him above the officials and the servants of the king .
ESV	Esther	5	12	Then Haman said , “ Even Queen Esther let no one but me come with the king to the feast she prepared . And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king .
ESV	Esther	5	13	Yet all this is worth nothing to me , so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting ( Q ) at the king 's gate. ”
ESV	Esther	5	14	Then ( R ) his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him , ( S ) “ Let a gallows [ d ] fifty cubits [ e ] high be made , and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged upon it . Then go joyfully with the king to the feast. ” This idea pleased Haman , and he had the gallows made .

ESV	Esther	6	6	So Haman came in , and the king said to him , “ What should be done to the man ( G ) whom the king delights to honor ? ” And Haman said to himself , “ Whom would the king delight to honor more than me ? ”
ESV	Esther	6	2	And it was found written how ( B ) Mordecai had told about ( C ) Bigthana [ a ] and ( D ) Teresh , two of the king 's eunuchs , who guarded the threshold , and who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus .
ESV	Esther	6	3	And the king said , “ What honor or distinction has been bestowed on Mordecai for this ? ” The king 's young men who attended him said , “ Nothing has been done for him. ”
ESV	Esther	6	4	And the king said , “ Who is in the court ? ” Now Haman had just entered ( E ) the outer court of the king 's palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on ( F ) the gallows [ b ] that he had prepared for him .
ESV	Esther	6	5	And the king 's young men told him , “ Haman is there , standing in the court. ” And the king said , “ Let him come in. ”
ESV	Esther	6	7	And Haman said to the king , “ For the man whom the king delights to honor ,
ESV	Esther	6	8	let royal robes be brought , which the king has worn , ( H ) and the horse that the king has ridden , and on whose head ( I ) a royal crown [ c ] is set .
ESV	Esther	6	9	And let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king 's most noble officials . Let them dress the man whom the king delights to honor , and let them lead him on the horse through the square of the city , ( J ) proclaiming before him : ‘ Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor. ’ ”
ESV	Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman , “ Hurry ; take the robes and the horse , as you have said , and do so to Mordecai the Jew , who sits ( K ) at the king 's gate . Leave out nothing that you have mentioned. ”
ESV	Esther	6	11	So Haman took the robes and the horse , and he dressed Mordecai and led him through the square of the city , proclaiming before him , “ Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor. ”
ESV	Esther	6	12	Then Mordecai returned to the king 's gate . But Haman hurried to his house , mourning ( L ) and with his head covered .
ESV	Esther	6	13	And Haman told ( M ) his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him . Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him , “ If Mordecai , before whom you have begun to fall , is of the Jewish people , you will not overcome him but will surely fall before him. ” Esther Reveals Haman 's Plot
ESV	Esther	6	14	While they were yet talking with him , the king 's eunuchs arrived and hurried to bring Haman ( N ) to the feast that Esther had prepared .

ESV	Esther	7	7	And the king arose in his wrath from the wine-drinking and went into ( G ) the palace garden , but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther , for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king .
ESV	Esther	7	2	And on the second day , as they were drinking wine after the feast , the king again said to Esther , ( A ) “ What is your wish , Queen Esther ? It shall be granted you . And what is your request ? ( B ) Even to the half of my kingdom , it shall be fulfilled. ”
ESV	Esther	7	3	Then Queen Esther answered , ( C ) “ If I have found favor in your sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be granted me for my wish , and my people for my request .
ESV	Esther	7	4	( D ) For we have been sold , I and my people , ( E ) to be destroyed , to be killed , and to be annihilated . If we had been sold merely as slaves , men and women , I would have been silent , for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king. ”
ESV	Esther	7	5	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther , “ Who is he , and where is he , who has dared [ a ] to do this ? ”
ESV	Esther	7	6	And Esther said , ( F ) “ A foe and enemy ! This wicked Haman ! ” Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen . Haman Is Hanged
ESV	Esther	7	8	And the king returned from ( H ) the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine , as Haman was falling on ( I ) the couch where Esther was . And the king said , “ Will he even assault the queen in my presence , in my own house ? ” As the word left the mouth of the king , they covered Haman 's face .
ESV	Esther	7	9	Then ( J ) Harbona , one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king , said , “ Moreover , ( K ) the gallows [ b ] that Haman has prepared for Mordecai , ( L ) whose word saved the king , is standing at Haman 's house , fifty cubits [ c ] high. ” And the king said , “ Hang him on that. ”

ESV	Esther	8	8	But you may write as you please with regard to the Jews , in the name of the king , ( K ) and seal it with the king 's ring , for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king 's ring ( L ) can not be revoked. ”
ESV	Esther	8	2	( C ) And the king took off his signet ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it to Mordecai . And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman .
ESV	Esther	8	3	Then Esther spoke again to the king . She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman ( D ) the Agagite and the plot that he had devised against the Jews .
ESV	Esther	8	4	( E ) When the king held out the golden scepter to Esther , Esther rose and stood before the king .
ESV	Esther	8	5	And she said , “ If it please the king , ( F ) and if I have found favor in his sight , and if the thing seems right before the king , and I am pleasing in his eyes , let an order be written to revoke ( G ) the letters devised by Haman ( H ) the Agagite , the son of Hammedatha , which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king .
ESV	Esther	8	6	For how can I bear ( I ) to see the calamity that is coming to my people ? Or how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred ? ”
ESV	Esther	8	7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew , “ Behold , ( J ) I have given Esther the house of Haman , and they have hanged him on the gallows , [ a ] because he intended to lay hands on the Jews .
ESV	Esther	8	9	( M ) The king 's scribes were summoned at that time , in the third month , which is the month of Sivan , on the twenty-third day . And an edict was written , according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews , to ( N ) the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces ( O ) from India to Ethiopia , ( P )
ESV	Esther	8	127	provinces , ( Q ) to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language , and also to the Jews in their script and their language .
ESV	Esther	8	10	( R ) And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus ( S ) and sealed it with the king 's signet ring . Then he sent the letters by mounted couriers riding on ( T ) swift horses that were used in the king 's service , bred from the royal stud ,
ESV	Esther	8	11	saying that the king allowed the Jews who were in every city ( U ) to gather and defend their lives , ( V ) to destroy , to kill , and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them , children and women included , ( W ) and to plunder their goods ,
ESV	Esther	8	12	( X ) on one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus , on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month of Adar .
ESV	Esther	8	13	( Y ) A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province , being publicly displayed to all peoples , and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies .
ESV	Esther	8	14	So the couriers , mounted on their ( Z ) swift horses that were used in the king 's service , rode out hurriedly , urged by the king 's command . And the decree was issued in Susa the citadel .
ESV	Esther	8	15	Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king ( AA ) in royal robes of blue and white , with a great golden crown [ b ] and ( AB ) a robe of fine linen and purple , ( AC ) and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced .
ESV	Esther	8	16	The Jews had ( AD ) light and gladness and joy and honor .
ESV	Esther	8	17	And in every province and in every city , wherever the king 's command and his edict reached , there was gladness and joy among the Jews , a feast and ( AE ) a holiday . ( AF ) And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews , ( AG ) for fear of the Jews had fallen on them .

ESV	Esther	9	9	and Parmashta and Arisai and Aridai and Vaizatha ,
ESV	Esther	9	2	( E ) The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm . And no one could stand against them , ( F ) for the fear of them had fallen on all peoples .
ESV	Esther	9	3	All the officials of the provinces and ( G ) the satraps and the governors and the royal agents also helped the Jews , for the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them .
ESV	Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the king 's house , and his fame spread throughout all the provinces , for the man Mordecai grew ( H ) more and more powerful .
ESV	Esther	9	5	The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword , killing and destroying them , and did as they pleased to those who hated them .
ESV	Esther	9	6	In Susa the citadel itself the Jews killed and destroyed
ESV	Esther	9	500	men and also the ten sons of Haman . What then have they done in the rest of the king 's provinces ! ( L ) Now what is your wish ? It shall be granted you . And what further is your request ? It shall be fulfilled. ”
ESV	Esther	9	7	and also killed Parshandatha and Dalphon and Aspatha
ESV	Esther	9	8	and Poratha and Adalia and Aridatha
ESV	Esther	9	10	( I ) the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha , ( J ) the enemy of the Jews , ( K ) but they laid no hand on the plunder .
ESV	Esther	9	11	That very day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was reported to the king .
ESV	Esther	9	12	And the king said to Queen Esther , “ In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed
ESV	Esther	9	13	And Esther said , “ If it please the king , let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed ( M ) tomorrow also to do according to this day 's edict . And let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows. ” [ a ]
ESV	Esther	9	14	So the king commanded this to be done . A decree was issued in Susa , and the ten sons of Haman were hanged .
ESV	Esther	9	15	The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed
ESV	Esther	9	300	men in Susa , but they laid no hands on the plunder .
ESV	Esther	9	16	( N ) Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king 's provinces also ( O ) gathered to defend their lives , and got relief from their enemies and killed 75,000 of those who hated them , but they laid no hands on the plunder .
ESV	Esther	9	17	This was ( P ) on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar , and on the fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness .
ESV	Esther	9	18	But the Jews who were in Susa gathered ( Q ) on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth , and rested ( R ) on the fifteenth day , making that a day of feasting and gladness .
ESV	Esther	9	19	Therefore the Jews of the villages , who live in ( S ) the rural towns , hold the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and feasting , as ( T ) a holiday , and ( U ) as a day on which they send gifts of food to one another . The Feast of Purim Inaugurated
ESV	Esther	9	20	And Mordecai recorded these things and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus , both near and far ,
ESV	Esther	9	21	obliging them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same , year by year ,
ESV	Esther	9	22	as the days on which the Jews got relief from their enemies , and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into ( V ) a holiday ; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness , days for sending gifts of food to one another and gifts to the poor .
ESV	Esther	9	23	So the Jews accepted what they had started to do , and what Mordecai had written to them .
ESV	Esther	9	24	For Haman the Agagite , the son of Hammedatha , ( W ) the enemy of all the Jews , ( X ) had plotted against the Jews to destroy them , and ( Y ) had cast Pur ( that is , cast lots ) , to crush and to destroy them .
ESV	Esther	9	25	( see note on 2:23 ) The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	Esther	9	26	Therefore they called these days Purim , after the term ( AB ) Pur . Therefore , because of all that was written in ( AC ) this letter , and of what they had faced in this matter , and of what had happened to them ,
ESV	Esther	9	27	the Jews firmly obligated themselves and their offspring and ( AD ) all who joined them , that without fail they would keep ( AE ) these two days according to what was written and at the time appointed every year ,
ESV	Esther	9	28	that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation , in every clan , province , and city , and that these days of Purim should never fall into disuse among the Jews , nor should the commemoration of these days cease among their descendants .
ESV	Esther	9	29	Then Queen Esther , ( AF ) the daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the Jew gave full written authority , confirming ( AG ) this second letter about Purim .
ESV	Esther	9	30	Letters were sent to all the Jews , ( AH ) to the
ESV	Esther	9	127	provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , in words of peace and truth ,
ESV	Esther	9	31	that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed seasons , as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther obligated them , and as they had obligated themselves and their offspring , with regard to ( AI ) their fasts and their lamenting .

ESV	Job	1	1	There was a man in the land of ( A ) Uz whose name was ( B ) Job , and that man was ( C ) blameless and upright , one who ( D ) feared God and ( E ) turned away from evil .
ESV	Job	1	2	There were born to him ( F ) seven sons and three daughters .
ESV	Job	1	3	He possessed 7,000 sheep , 3,000 camels ,
ESV	Job	1	500	female donkeys , and very many servants , so that this man was the greatest of all ( G ) the people of the east .
ESV	Job	1	4	His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day , and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them .
ESV	Job	1	5	And when the days of the feast had run their course , Job would send and ( H ) consecrate them , and he would rise early in the morning and ( I ) offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all . For Job said , “ It may be that my children have sinned , and ( J ) cursed [ a ] God in their hearts. ” Thus Job did continually . Satan Allowed to Test Job
ESV	Job	1	6	Now there was a day when ( K ) the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and ( L ) Satan [ b ] also came among them .
ESV	Job	1	7	The Lord said to Satan , “ From where have you come ? ” Satan answered the Lord and said , “ From ( M ) going to and fro on the earth , and from walking up and down on it. ”
ESV	Job	1	8	And the Lord said to Satan , “ Have you ( N ) considered my ( O ) servant Job , that there is none like him on the earth , ( P ) a blameless and upright man , who fears God and turns away from evil ? ”
ESV	Job	1	9	Then Satan answered the Lord and said , “ Does Job fear God for no reason ?
ESV	Job	1	10	Have you not put ( Q ) a hedge around him and his house and all that he has , on every side ? You have ( R ) blessed the work of his hands , and his possessions have increased in the land .
ESV	Job	1	11	But ( S ) stretch out your hand and ( T ) touch all that he has , and he will ( U ) curse you ( V ) to your face. ”
ESV	Job	1	12	And the Lord said to Satan , “ Behold , all that he has is in your hand . Only against him do not stretch out your hand. ” So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord . Satan Takes Job 's Property and Children
ESV	Job	1	13	Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother 's house ,
ESV	Job	1	14	and there came a messenger to Job and said , “ The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them ,
ESV	Job	1	15	and ( W ) the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants [ c ] with the edge of the sword , and I alone have escaped to tell you. ”
ESV	Job	1	16	While he was yet speaking , there came another and said , ( X ) “ The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them , and I alone have escaped to tell you. ”
ESV	Job	1	17	While he was yet speaking , there came another and said , ( Y ) “ The Chaldeans formed ( Z ) three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword , and I alone have escaped to tell you. ”
ESV	Job	1	18	While he was yet speaking , there came another and said , ( AA ) “ Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother 's house ,
ESV	Job	1	19	and behold , a great wind came across ( AB ) the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house , and it fell upon the young people , and they are dead , and I alone have escaped to tell you. ”
ESV	Job	1	20	Then Job arose and ( AC ) tore his ( AD ) robe and ( AE ) shaved his head ( AF ) and fell on the ground and worshiped .
ESV	Job	1	21	And he said , ( AG ) “ Naked I came from my mother 's womb , and naked shall I ( AH ) return . The Lord ( AI ) gave , and the Lord has taken away ; ( AJ ) blessed be the name of the Lord. ”

ESV	Job	2	3	And the Lord said to Satan , “ Have you considered my servant Job , that there is none like him on the earth , a blameless and upright man , who fears God and turns away from evil ? He still ( B ) holds fast his integrity , although you incited me against him to destroy him ( C ) without reason. ”
ESV	Job	2	4	Then Satan answered the Lord and said , “ Skin for skin ! All that a man has he will give for his life .
ESV	Job	2	5	But ( D ) stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will ( E ) curse you to your face. ”

ESV	Job	2	12	And when they saw him from a distance , they did not recognize him . And they raised their voices and wept , and they ( T ) tore their robes and sprinkled ( U ) dust on their heads toward heaven .

ESV	Job	3	3	( B ) “ Let the day perish on which I was born , and the night that said , ‘ A man is conceived. ’
ESV	Job	3	2	And Job said :
ESV	Job	3	4	Let that day be darkness ! May God above not seek it , nor light shine upon it .
ESV	Job	3	5	Let gloom and ( C ) deep darkness claim it . Let clouds dwell upon it ; let the blackness of the day terrify it .
ESV	Job	3	6	That night—let thick darkness seize it ! Let it not rejoice among the days of the year ; let it not come into the number of the months .
ESV	Job	3	7	Behold , let that night be barren ; let no joyful cry enter it .
ESV	Job	3	8	Let those curse it who curse the day , who are ready to rouse up ( D ) Leviathan .
ESV	Job	3	9	Let the stars of its dawn be dark ; let it hope for light , but have none , nor see ( E ) the eyelids of the morning ,
ESV	Job	3	10	because it did not shut the doors of my mother 's womb , nor hide trouble from my eyes .
ESV	Job	3	11	“ Why ( F ) did I not die at birth , come out from the womb and expire ?
ESV	Job	3	12	Why did ( G ) the knees receive me ? Or why the breasts , that I should nurse ?
ESV	Job	3	13	For then I would have lain down and been quiet ; I would have slept ; then I would have been at rest ,
ESV	Job	3	14	with kings and counselors of the earth who ( H ) rebuilt ruins for themselves ,
ESV	Job	3	15	or with princes who had gold , who filled their houses with silver .
ESV	Job	3	16	Or why was I not as a hidden ( I ) stillborn child , as infants who never see the light ?
ESV	Job	3	17	There the wicked cease from troubling , and there the weary are at ( J ) rest .
ESV	Job	3	18	There the prisoners are at ease together ; they hear not the voice of ( K ) the taskmaster .
ESV	Job	3	19	The small and the great are there , and the slave is free from his master .
ESV	Job	3	20	“ Why is light given to him who is in misery , and life to ( L ) the bitter in soul ,
ESV	Job	3	21	who ( M ) long for death , but it comes not , and dig for it more than for ( N ) hidden treasures ,
ESV	Job	3	22	who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they find the grave ?
ESV	Job	3	23	Why is light given to a man whose ( O ) way is hidden , whom God has ( P ) hedged in ?
ESV	Job	3	24	For my sighing comes ( Q ) instead of [ a ] my bread , and my ( R ) groanings are poured out like water .
ESV	Job	3	25	( S ) For the thing that I fear comes upon me , and what I dread befalls me .

ESV	Job	20	15	He swallows down riches and vomits them up again ; God casts them out of his belly .
ESV	Job	20	16	He will suck the poison of cobras ; ( O ) the tongue of a viper will kill him .
ESV	Job	20	17	He will not look upon ( P ) the rivers , the streams flowing with ( Q ) honey and ( R ) curds .
ESV	Job	20	18	He will ( S ) give back the fruit of his toil and will not ( T ) swallow it down ; from the profit of his trading he will get no enjoyment .
ESV	Job	20	19	For he has crushed and abandoned the poor ; he has seized a house that he did not build .
ESV	Job	20	21	There was nothing left after he had eaten ; therefore his prosperity will not endure .
ESV	Job	20	22	In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in distress ; the hand of everyone in misery will come against him .
ESV	Job	20	23	To fill his belly to the full , God [ a ] will send his burning anger against him and rain it upon him ( X ) into his body .
ESV	Job	20	24	( Y ) He will flee from an iron weapon ; ( Z ) a bronze arrow will strike ( AA ) him through .

ESV	Job	20	26	Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures ; ( AF ) a fire not fanned will devour him ; what is left in his tent will be consumed .
ESV	Job	20	27	( AG ) The heavens will reveal his iniquity , and the earth will rise up against him .
ESV	Job	20	28	The possessions of his house will be carried away , dragged off in the day of God 's [ b ] wrath .

ESV	Job	21	21	For what do they care for their houses after them , when ( AB ) the number of their months is cut off ?
ESV	Job	21	2	( A ) “ Keep listening to my words , and let this be your comfort .
ESV	Job	21	3	Bear with me , and I will speak , and after I have spoken , ( B ) mock on .
ESV	Job	21	4	As for me , is my ( C ) complaint against man ? Why should I not be impatient ?
ESV	Job	21	5	Look at me and be appalled , and ( D ) lay your hand over your mouth .
ESV	Job	21	6	When I remember , I am dismayed , and shuddering seizes my flesh .
ESV	Job	21	7	( E ) Why do the wicked live , reach old age , and grow mighty in power ?
ESV	Job	21	8	Their ( F ) offspring are established in their presence , and their descendants before their eyes .
ESV	Job	21	9	Their houses are ( G ) safe from fear , and ( H ) no rod of God is upon them .
ESV	Job	21	10	Their bull breeds without fail ; their cow calves and ( I ) does not miscarry .
ESV	Job	21	11	They send out their ( J ) little boys like a flock , and their children dance .
ESV	Job	21	12	They sing to ( K ) the tambourine and ( L ) the lyre and rejoice to the sound of ( M ) the pipe .
ESV	Job	21	13	They ( N ) spend their days in prosperity , and in ( O ) peace they go down to ( P ) Sheol .
ESV	Job	21	14	They say to God , ( Q ) ‘ Depart from us ! We do not desire the knowledge of your ways .
ESV	Job	21	15	( R ) What is the Almighty , that we should serve him ? And what ( S ) profit do we get if we pray to him ? ’
ESV	Job	21	16	Behold , is not their prosperity in their hand ? ( T ) The counsel of the wicked is far from me .
ESV	Job	21	17	“ How often is it that ( U ) the lamp of the wicked is put out ? That their calamity comes upon them ? That God [ a ] distributes pains in his anger ?
ESV	Job	21	18	That they are like ( V ) straw before the wind , and like ( W ) chaff that the storm carries away ?
ESV	Job	21	19	You say , ‘ God ( X ) stores up their iniquity for their ( Y ) children. ’ Let him pay it out to them , that they may ( Z ) know it .
ESV	Job	21	20	Let their own eyes see their destruction , and let them ( AA ) drink of the wrath of the Almighty .
ESV	Job	21	22	( AC ) Will any teach God knowledge , seeing that he ( AD ) judges those who are on high ?
ESV	Job	21	23	One dies in his full vigor , being wholly at ease and secure ,
ESV	Job	21	24	his pails [ b ] full of milk and ( AE ) the marrow of his bones moist .
ESV	Job	21	25	Another dies in ( AF ) bitterness of soul , never having tasted of prosperity .
ESV	Job	21	26	They ( AG ) lie down alike in the dust , and ( AH ) the worms cover them .
ESV	Job	21	27	“ Behold , I know your thoughts and your schemes to wrong me .
ESV	Job	21	28	For you say , ( AI ) ‘ Where is the house of the prince ? Where is ( AJ ) the tent in which the wicked lived ? ’
ESV	Job	21	29	Have you not asked those who travel the roads , and do you not accept their testimony
ESV	Job	21	30	that ( AK ) the evil man is spared in the day of calamity , that he is rescued in the day of wrath ?
ESV	Job	21	31	Who declares his way ( AL ) to his face , and who ( AM ) repays him for what he has done ?
ESV	Job	21	32	When he is ( AN ) carried to the grave , watch is kept over his tomb .
ESV	Job	21	33	( AO ) The clods of the valley are sweet to him ; ( AP ) all mankind follows after him , and those who go before him are innumerable .

ESV	Job	22	22	Receive instruction from ( AD ) his mouth , and ( AE ) lay up his words in your heart .
ESV	Job	22	2	( B ) “ Can a man be profitable to God ? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself .
ESV	Job	22	3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right , or is it gain to him if you ( C ) make your ways blameless ?
ESV	Job	22	4	Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you and ( D ) enters into judgment with you ?
ESV	Job	22	5	Is not your evil abundant ? There is no end to your iniquities .
ESV	Job	22	6	For you have ( E ) exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing ( F ) and stripped the naked of their clothing .
ESV	Job	22	7	You have given no water to the weary to drink , and you have ( G ) withheld bread from the hungry .
ESV	Job	22	8	( H ) The man with power possessed the land , and ( I ) the favored man lived in it .
ESV	Job	22	9	You have ( J ) sent widows away empty , and ( K ) the arms of ( L ) the fatherless were crushed .
ESV	Job	22	10	Therefore ( M ) snares are all around you , and sudden terror overwhelms you ,
ESV	Job	22	11	or ( N ) darkness , so that you can not see , and a ( O ) flood of ( P ) water covers you .
ESV	Job	22	12	“ Is not God high in the heavens ? See ( Q ) the highest stars , how lofty they are !
ESV	Job	22	13	But you say , ( R ) ‘ What does God know ? Can he judge through ( S ) the deep darkness ?
ESV	Job	22	14	( T ) Thick clouds veil him , so that he does not see , and he walks on the vault of heaven. ’
ESV	Job	22	15	Will you keep to the old way that wicked men have trod ?
ESV	Job	22	16	They were snatched away ( U ) before their time ; their foundation was washed away . [ a ]
ESV	Job	22	17	They said to God , ( V ) ‘ Depart from us , ’ and ( W ) ‘ What can the Almighty do to us ? ’ [ b ]
ESV	Job	22	18	Yet he filled their houses with good things— but ( X ) the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
ESV	Job	22	19	( Y ) The righteous see it and are glad ; the innocent one ( Z ) mocks at them ,
ESV	Job	22	20	saying , ‘ Surely our adversaries are cut off , and what they left ( AA ) the fire has consumed. ’
ESV	Job	22	21	( AB ) “ Agree with God , and ( AC ) be at peace ; thereby good will come to you .
ESV	Job	22	23	If you ( AF ) return to the Almighty you will be ( AG ) built up ; if you ( AH ) remove injustice far from your tents ,
ESV	Job	22	24	if you lay gold in ( AI ) the dust , and gold of ( AJ ) Ophir among the stones of the torrent-bed ,
ESV	Job	22	25	then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver .
ESV	Job	22	26	For then you ( AK ) will delight yourself in the Almighty and ( AL ) lift up your face to God .
ESV	Job	22	27	You will ( AM ) make your prayer to him , and he will hear you , and you will ( AN ) pay your vows .
ESV	Job	22	28	You will decide on a matter , and it will be established for you , and ( AO ) light will shine on your ways .
ESV	Job	22	29	For when they are humbled you say , ‘ It is because of pride ’ ; [ c ] but he saves ( AP ) the lowly .

ESV	Job	23	3	Oh , ( C ) that I knew where I might find him , that I might come even to his ( D ) seat !
ESV	Job	23	4	I would ( E ) lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments .
ESV	Job	23	5	I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me .
ESV	Job	23	6	Would he ( F ) contend with me in the greatness of his power ? No ; he would pay attention to me .
ESV	Job	23	7	There an upright man could argue with him , and I would be acquitted forever by my judge .
ESV	Job	23	8	“ Behold , ( G ) I go forward , but he is not there , and backward , but I do not perceive him ;
ESV	Job	23	9	on the left hand when he is working , I do not behold him ; he turns to the right hand , but I do not see him .
ESV	Job	23	10	But he ( H ) knows ( I ) the way that I ( J ) take ; when he has ( K ) tried me , I shall come out as gold .
ESV	Job	23	11	My foot ( L ) has held fast to his steps ; I have kept his way and have ( M ) not turned aside .
ESV	Job	23	12	I have not departed from the commandment of his lips ; I have ( N ) treasured the words of his mouth more than my ( O ) portion of food .
ESV	Job	23	13	But he is unchangeable , [ b ] and ( P ) who can turn him back ? What he ( Q ) desires , that he does .
ESV	Job	23	14	For he will complete what he ( R ) appoints for me , and many such things are ( S ) in his mind .
ESV	Job	23	15	Therefore I am terrified at his presence ; when I consider , I am in dread of him .

ESV	Job	24	24	They are exalted ( Z ) a little while , and then ( AA ) are gone ; they are brought low and gathered up like all others ; they are ( AB ) cut off like the heads of grain .
ESV	Job	24	2	Some move ( D ) landmarks ; they seize flocks and pasture them .
ESV	Job	24	3	They drive away the donkey of the fatherless ; they ( E ) take the widow 's ox for a pledge .
ESV	Job	24	4	They ( F ) thrust the poor off the road ; the poor of the earth ( G ) all hide themselves .
ESV	Job	24	5	Behold , like wild donkeys in the desert the poor [ a ] ( H ) go out to their toil , ( I ) seeking game ; the wasteland yields food for their children .
ESV	Job	24	6	They gather their [ b ] fodder in the field , and they glean the vineyard of the wicked man .
ESV	Job	24	7	They ( J ) lie all night naked , without clothing , and have no covering in the cold .
ESV	Job	24	8	They are wet with the rain of the mountains and ( K ) cling to the rock for lack of shelter .

ESV	Job	24	10	They go about naked , without clothing ; hungry , they ( L ) carry the sheaves ;

ESV	Job	24	13	“ There are those who rebel ( O ) against the light , who are not acquainted with its ways , and do not stay in its paths .
ESV	Job	24	14	The murderer rises before it is light , that he ( P ) may kill the poor and needy , and in the night he is like a thief .
ESV	Job	24	15	The eye of the adulterer also waits for ( Q ) the twilight , saying , ‘ No ( R ) eye will see me ’ ; and he veils his face .
ESV	Job	24	16	In the dark they ( S ) dig through houses ; by day they shut themselves up ; they do not know the light .
ESV	Job	24	17	For ( T ) deep darkness is morning to all of them ; for they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness .

ESV	Job	24	19	Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters ; so does ( V ) Sheol those who have sinned .
ESV	Job	24	20	The womb forgets them ; the worm finds them sweet ; they are ( W ) no longer remembered , so wickedness is broken like ( X ) a tree. ’
ESV	Job	24	21	“ They wrong the barren , childless woman , and do no good to the widow .
ESV	Job	24	22	Yet God [ e ] prolongs the life of the mighty by his power ; they rise up when they despair of life .

ESV	Job	27	10	Will he ( M ) take delight in the Almighty ? Will he call upon God at all times ?

ESV	Job	34	5	For Job has said , ‘ I am ( C ) in the right , and ( D ) God has taken away my right ;
ESV	Job	34	6	in spite of my right I am counted a liar ; my wound is incurable , though I am ( E ) without transgression. ’
ESV	Job	34	7	What man is like Job , who ( F ) drinks up scoffing like water ,
ESV	Job	34	8	who travels in company with evildoers and walks ( G ) with wicked men ?
ESV	Job	34	9	For ( H ) he has said , ‘ It profits a man nothing that he should take delight in God. ’
ESV	Job	34	10	“ Therefore , hear me , you men of understanding : far be it from God that he should ( I ) do wickedness , and from the Almighty that he should do wrong .
ESV	Job	34	11	For according to ( J ) the work of a man he will repay him , and ( K ) according to his ways he will make it befall him .
ESV	Job	34	12	Of a truth , God will not do wickedly , and ( L ) the Almighty will not pervert justice .
ESV	Job	34	13	Who gave him charge over the earth , and who ( M ) laid on him [ a ] the whole world ?
ESV	Job	34	14	If he should ( N ) set his heart to it and ( O ) gather to himself his ( P ) spirit and his breath ,
ESV	Job	34	15	all flesh would perish together , and man would ( Q ) return to dust .
ESV	Job	34	16	“ If you have understanding , hear this ; listen to what I say .
ESV	Job	34	17	( R ) Shall one who hates justice govern ? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty ,
ESV	Job	34	18	who ( S ) says to a king , ‘ Worthless one , ’ and to nobles , ‘ Wicked man , ’
ESV	Job	34	19	who ( T ) shows no partiality to princes , nor regards the rich ( U ) more than the poor , for ( V ) they are all the work of his hands ?
ESV	Job	34	20	In a moment ( W ) they die ; at ( X ) midnight the people are shaken and pass away , and the mighty are taken away by ( Y ) no human hand .
ESV	Job	34	21	“ For his eyes are on ( Z ) the ways of a man , and he sees all his ( AA ) steps .
ESV	Job	34	22	There is no ( AB ) gloom or ( AC ) deep darkness where evildoers may hide themselves .
ESV	Job	34	23	For God [ b ] has no need to consider a man further , that he should go before God in ( AD ) judgment .
ESV	Job	34	24	He ( AE ) shatters the mighty without investigation and sets ( AF ) others in their place .
ESV	Job	34	25	Thus , knowing their works , he ( AG ) overturns them in the night , and they are crushed .
ESV	Job	34	26	He strikes them for their wickedness in a place for all to see ,
ESV	Job	34	27	because they turned aside from ( AH ) following him and had no regard for any of his ways ,
ESV	Job	34	28	so that they ( AI ) caused the cry of the poor to come to him , and he ( AJ ) heard the cry of the afflicted—
ESV	Job	34	29	When he is quiet , who can condemn ? When he hides his face , who can behold him , whether it be a nation or a man ? —
ESV	Job	34	30	that a godless man should not reign , that he should not ensnare the people .
ESV	Job	34	31	“ For has anyone said to God , ‘ I have borne punishment ; I will not offend any more ;
ESV	Job	34	32	( AK ) teach me what I do not see ; if I have done iniquity , I will do it no more ’ ?
ESV	Job	34	33	Will he then make repayment to suit you , because you reject it ? For you must choose , and not I ; therefore ( AL ) declare what you know . [ c ]
ESV	Job	34	35	‘ Job ( AM ) speaks without knowledge ; his words are without insight. ’
ESV	Job	34	36	Would that Job were tried to the end , because he answers like wicked men .

ESV	Job	35	12	There they ( N ) cry out , but he does not answer , because of the pride of evil men .
ESV	Job	35	13	Surely God does not hear an empty cry , nor does the Almighty regard it .
ESV	Job	35	14	How much less when you say that you ( O ) do not see him , that the case is before him , and you are ( P ) waiting for him !
ESV	Job	35	15	And now , because ( Q ) his anger does not punish , and he does not take much note of transgression , [ b ]

ESV	Job	36	5	“ Behold , God is mighty , and ( E ) does not despise any ; he is ( F ) mighty in strength of understanding .
ESV	Job	36	6	He does not keep the wicked alive , but gives ( G ) the afflicted their right .
ESV	Job	36	7	He does not withdraw his ( H ) eyes from the righteous , but with ( I ) kings on the throne he sets them forever , and they are ( J ) exalted .
ESV	Job	36	8	And if they are ( K ) bound in chains and caught in the cords of affliction ,
ESV	Job	36	9	then he declares to them their work and their transgressions , that they are ( L ) behaving arrogantly .
ESV	Job	36	10	He ( M ) opens their ears to instruction and commands that they ( N ) return from iniquity .
ESV	Job	36	11	( O ) If they listen and serve him , they ( P ) complete their days in prosperity , and their years in pleasantness .
ESV	Job	36	12	But if they do not listen , they ( Q ) perish by the sword and die ( R ) without knowledge .

ESV	Job	36	14	They ( U ) die in youth , and their life ends among the cult prostitutes .
ESV	Job	36	15	He delivers ( V ) the afflicted by their affliction and ( W ) opens their ear by adversity .
ESV	Job	36	16	He also allured you out of distress into ( X ) a broad place where there was no cramping , and what was set on your ( Y ) table was full of ( Z ) fatness .

ESV	Job	41	23	The folds of his flesh ( J ) stick together , firmly cast on him and immovable .
ESV	Job	41	24	His heart is hard as a stone , hard as the lower millstone .
ESV	Job	41	25	When he raises himself up , the mighty [ e ] are afraid ; at the crashing they are beside themselves .
ESV	Job	41	26	Though the sword reaches him , it does not avail , nor the spear , the dart , or the javelin .
ESV	Job	41	27	He counts iron as straw , and bronze as rotten wood .
ESV	Job	41	28	The arrow can not make him flee ; for him , sling stones are turned to stubble .
ESV	Job	41	29	Clubs are counted as stubble ; he laughs at the rattle of javelins .
ESV	Job	41	30	His underparts are like sharp ( K ) potsherds ; he spreads himself like ( L ) a threshing sledge on the mire .
ESV	Job	41	31	He makes the deep boil like a pot ; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment .

ESV	Job	42	42	Then Job answered the Lord and said :
ESV	Job	42	2	“ I know that you can ( A ) do all things , and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted .
ESV	Job	42	3	( B ) ‘ Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge ? ’ Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand , things ( C ) too wonderful for me , which I did not know .
ESV	Job	42	4	‘ Hear , and I will speak ; ( D ) I will question you , and you make it known to me. ’
ESV	Job	42	5	I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear , but now my eye sees you ;
ESV	Job	42	6	therefore I despise myself , and repent [ a ] in ( E ) dust and ashes. ” The Lord Rebukes Job 's Friends
ESV	Job	42	7	After the Lord had spoken these words to Job , the Lord said to Eliphaz ( F ) the Temanite : “ My anger burns against you and against your two friends , for you have not spoken of me what is right , as my servant Job has .
ESV	Job	42	8	Now therefore take ( G ) seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and ( H ) offer up a burnt offering for yourselves . And my servant Job shall ( I ) pray for you , for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly . For you have not spoken of me what is right , as my servant Job has. ”
ESV	Job	42	9	( J ) So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the Lord had told them , and the Lord accepted Job 's prayer . The Lord Restores Job 's Fortunes
ESV	Job	42	10	And the Lord ( K ) restored the fortunes of Job , when he had prayed for his friends . And the Lord gave Job ( L ) twice as much as he had before .
ESV	Job	42	11	Then came to him all his ( M ) brothers and sisters and all who had ( N ) known him before , and ate bread with him in his house . And they ( O ) showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil [ b ] that the Lord had brought upon him . And each of them gave him ( P ) a piece of money [ c ] and ( Q ) a ring of gold .
ESV	Job	42	12	And the Lord blessed ( R ) the latter days of Job more than his beginning . And he had ( S ) 14,000 sheep , 6,000 camels , 1,000 yoke of oxen , and 1,000 female donkeys .
ESV	Job	42	13	He had also ( T ) seven sons and three daughters .
ESV	Job	42	14	And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah , and the name of the second Keziah , and the name of the third Keren-happuch .
ESV	Job	42	15	And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job 's daughters . And their father gave them an inheritance ( U ) among their brothers .
ESV	Job	42	16	And after this Job lived
ESV	Job	42	140	years , and ( V ) saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , four generations .

ESV	Psalms	10	10	The helpless are crushed , sink down , and fall by his might .
ESV	Psalms	10	2	In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor ; let them ( D ) be caught in the schemes that they have devised .
ESV	Psalms	10	3	For the wicked ( E ) boasts of the desires of his soul , and the one greedy for gain ( F ) curses [ a ] and ( G ) renounces the Lord .
ESV	Psalms	10	4	In the pride of his face [ b ] the wicked does not ( H ) seek him ; [ c ] all his thoughts are , ( I ) “ There is no God. ”
ESV	Psalms	10	5	His ways prosper at all times ; your judgments are on high , ( J ) out of his sight ; as for all his foes , he ( K ) puffs at them .

ESV	Psalms	73	73	Truly God is good to ( B ) Israel , to those who are ( C ) pure in heart .
ESV	Psalms	73	2	But as for me , my feet had almost stumbled , my steps had nearly slipped .
ESV	Psalms	73	3	( D ) For I was ( E ) envious of the arrogant when I saw the ( F ) prosperity of the wicked .
ESV	Psalms	73	4	For they have no pangs until death ; their bodies are fat and sleek .
ESV	Psalms	73	5	They are not in trouble as others are ; they are not ( G ) stricken like the rest of mankind .
ESV	Psalms	73	6	Therefore pride is ( H ) their necklace ; violence covers them as ( I ) a garment .
ESV	Psalms	73	7	Their ( J ) eyes swell out through fatness ; their hearts overflow with follies .
ESV	Psalms	73	8	They scoff and ( K ) speak with malice ; loftily they threaten oppression .
ESV	Psalms	73	9	They set their mouths against the heavens , and their tongue struts through the earth .
ESV	Psalms	73	10	Therefore his people turn back to them , and find ( L ) no fault in them . [ a ]
ESV	Psalms	73	11	And they say , ( M ) “ How can God know ? Is there knowledge in the Most High ? ”

ESV	Psalms	73	14	For all the day long I have been ( Q ) stricken and ( R ) rebuked ( S ) every morning .
ESV	Psalms	73	15	If I had said , “ I will speak thus , ” I would have betrayed ( T ) the generation of your children .
ESV	Psalms	73	16	But when I thought how to understand this , it seemed to me ( U ) a wearisome task ,
ESV	Psalms	73	17	until I went into ( V ) the sanctuary of God ; then I discerned their ( W ) end .
ESV	Psalms	73	18	Truly you set them in ( X ) slippery places ; you make them fall to ruin .
ESV	Psalms	73	19	How they are destroyed ( Y ) in a moment , swept away utterly by ( Z ) terrors !
ESV	Psalms	73	20	Like ( AA ) a dream when one awakes , O Lord , when ( AB ) you rouse yourself , you despise them as phantoms .
ESV	Psalms	73	21	When my soul was embittered , when I was pricked in heart ,

ESV	Psalms	74	12	Yet ( Y ) God my King is from of old , working salvation in the midst of the earth .

ESV	Psalms	78	78	( B ) Give ear , O my people , to my teaching ; incline your ears to the words of my mouth !
ESV	Psalms	78	2	( C ) I will open my mouth ( D ) in a parable ; I will utter dark sayings from of old ,
ESV	Psalms	78	3	things that we have heard and known , that our ( E ) fathers have told us .
ESV	Psalms	78	4	We will not ( F ) hide them from their children , but ( G ) tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord , and his might , and ( H ) the wonders that he has done .
ESV	Psalms	78	5	He established ( I ) a testimony in ( J ) Jacob and appointed a law in ( K ) Israel , which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children ,
ESV	Psalms	78	6	that ( L ) the next generation might know them , the children yet unborn , and arise and tell them to their children ,
ESV	Psalms	78	7	so that they should set their hope in God and not forget ( M ) the works of God , but ( N ) keep his commandments ;
ESV	Psalms	78	8	and that they should not be ( O ) like their fathers , ( P ) a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation ( Q ) whose heart was not steadfast , whose spirit was not faithful to God .
ESV	Psalms	78	9	The Ephraimites , armed with [ b ] the bow , ( R ) turned back on the day of battle .
ESV	Psalms	78	10	They ( S ) did not keep God 's covenant , but refused to walk according to his law .
ESV	Psalms	78	11	They ( T ) forgot his works and ( U ) the wonders that he had shown them .
ESV	Psalms	78	12	In the sight of their fathers ( V ) he performed wonders in the land of Egypt , in ( W ) the fields of Zoan .
ESV	Psalms	78	13	He ( X ) divided the sea and let them pass through it , and made the waters ( Y ) stand like a heap .
ESV	Psalms	78	14	( Z ) In the daytime he led them with a cloud , and all the night with a fiery light .
ESV	Psalms	78	15	He ( AA ) split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep .
ESV	Psalms	78	16	He made streams come out of ( AB ) the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers .
ESV	Psalms	78	17	Yet they sinned still more against him , ( AC ) rebelling against the Most High in the desert .
ESV	Psalms	78	18	They ( AD ) tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved .
ESV	Psalms	78	19	They spoke against God , saying , ( AE ) “ Can God ( AF ) spread a table in the wilderness ?
ESV	Psalms	78	20	( AG ) He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed . Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people ? ”
ESV	Psalms	78	21	Therefore , when the Lord heard , he was full of wrath ; ( AH ) a fire was kindled against Jacob ; his anger rose against Israel ,
ESV	Psalms	78	22	because they ( AI ) did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power .
ESV	Psalms	78	23	Yet he commanded the skies above and ( AJ ) opened the doors of heaven ,
ESV	Psalms	78	24	and he ( AK ) rained down on them manna to eat and gave them ( AL ) the grain of heaven .
ESV	Psalms	78	25	Man ate of the bread of ( AM ) the angels ; he sent them food ( AN ) in abundance .
ESV	Psalms	78	26	He ( AO ) caused the east wind to blow in the heavens , and by his power he led out the south wind ;
ESV	Psalms	78	27	he rained meat on them like ( AP ) dust , winged birds like ( AQ ) the sand of the seas ;
ESV	Psalms	78	28	he ( AR ) let them fall in the midst of their camp , all around their dwellings .
ESV	Psalms	78	29	And they ( AS ) ate and were well filled , for he gave them what they ( AT ) craved .
ESV	Psalms	78	30	But before they had satisfied their craving , ( AU ) while the food was still in their mouths ,
ESV	Psalms	78	31	the anger of God rose against them , and he killed ( AV ) the strongest of them and laid low ( AW ) the young men of Israel .
ESV	Psalms	78	32	In spite of all this , they ( AX ) still sinned ; ( AY ) despite his wonders , they did not believe .
ESV	Psalms	78	33	So he made ( AZ ) their days ( BA ) vanish like [ c ] a breath , [ d ] and their years in terror .
ESV	Psalms	78	34	When he killed them , they ( BB ) sought him ; they repented and sought God earnestly .
ESV	Psalms	78	35	They remembered that God was their ( BC ) rock , the Most High God their ( BD ) redeemer .
ESV	Psalms	78	36	But they ( BE ) flattered him with their mouths ; they ( BF ) lied to him with their tongues .
ESV	Psalms	78	37	Their ( BG ) heart was not ( BH ) steadfast toward him ; they were not faithful to his covenant .
ESV	Psalms	78	38	Yet he , being ( BI ) compassionate , ( BJ ) atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them ; he restrained his anger often and did not stir up all his wrath .
ESV	Psalms	78	39	He ( BK ) remembered that they were but ( BL ) flesh , ( BM ) a wind that passes and comes not again .
ESV	Psalms	78	40	How often they ( BN ) rebelled against him in the wilderness and ( BO ) grieved him in ( BP ) the desert !
ESV	Psalms	78	41	They ( BQ ) tested God again and again and provoked ( BR ) the Holy One of Israel .
ESV	Psalms	78	42	They ( BS ) did not remember his power [ e ] or the day when he redeemed them from the foe ,
ESV	Psalms	78	43	( BT ) when he performed his ( BU ) signs in Egypt and his ( BV ) marvels in ( BW ) the fields of Zoan .
ESV	Psalms	78	44	He ( BX ) turned their rivers to blood , so that they could not drink of their streams .
ESV	Psalms	78	45	He sent among them swarms of ( BY ) flies , which devoured them , and ( BZ ) frogs , which destroyed them .
ESV	Psalms	78	46	He gave their crops to ( CA ) the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust .
ESV	Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with ( CB ) hail and their sycamores with frost .
ESV	Psalms	78	48	He gave over their ( CC ) cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts .
ESV	Psalms	78	49	He let loose on them his burning anger , wrath , indignation , and distress , a company of ( CD ) destroying angels .
ESV	Psalms	78	50	He made a path for his anger ; he did not spare them from death , but gave their lives over to the plague .
ESV	Psalms	78	51	He struck down every ( CE ) firstborn in Egypt , the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of ( CF ) Ham .
ESV	Psalms	78	52	Then he led out his people ( CG ) like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock .
ESV	Psalms	78	53	( CH ) He led them in safety , so that they ( CI ) were not afraid , but ( CJ ) the sea overwhelmed their enemies .
ESV	Psalms	78	54	And he brought them to his ( CK ) holy land , ( CL ) to the mountain which his right hand had ( CM ) won .
ESV	Psalms	78	55	He ( CN ) drove out nations before them ; he ( CO ) apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents .
ESV	Psalms	78	56	Yet they ( CP ) tested and ( CQ ) rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies ,
ESV	Psalms	78	57	but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers ; they twisted like ( CR ) a deceitful bow .
ESV	Psalms	78	58	For they ( CS ) provoked him to anger with their ( CT ) high places ; they ( CU ) moved him to jealousy with their ( CV ) idols .
ESV	Psalms	78	59	When God heard , he was full of ( CW ) wrath , and he utterly rejected Israel .
ESV	Psalms	78	60	He ( CX ) forsook his dwelling at ( CY ) Shiloh , the tent where he dwelt among mankind ,
ESV	Psalms	78	61	and delivered his ( CZ ) power to captivity , his ( DA ) glory to the hand of the foe .
ESV	Psalms	78	62	He ( DB ) gave his people over to the sword and ( DC ) vented his wrath on his heritage .
ESV	Psalms	78	63	( DD ) Fire devoured their young men , and their young women had no ( DE ) marriage song .
ESV	Psalms	78	64	Their ( DF ) priests fell by the sword , and their ( DG ) widows made no lamentation .
ESV	Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord ( DH ) awoke as from sleep , like a strong man shouting because of wine .
ESV	Psalms	78	66	And he ( DI ) put his adversaries to rout ; he put them to everlasting shame .
ESV	Psalms	78	67	He rejected the tent of ( DJ ) Joseph ; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim ,
ESV	Psalms	78	68	but he chose the tribe of Judah , Mount Zion , which he ( DK ) loves .
ESV	Psalms	78	69	He ( DL ) built his sanctuary like the high heavens , like the earth , which he has founded forever .
ESV	Psalms	78	70	He ( DM ) chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds ;
ESV	Psalms	78	71	from ( DN ) following the nursing ewes he brought him to ( DO ) shepherd Jacob his people , Israel his ( DP ) inheritance .

ESV	Psalms	106	2	Who can utter the mighty deeds of the Lord , or declare all his praise ?
ESV	Psalms	106	3	Blessed are they who observe justice , who ( E ) do righteousness at all times !
ESV	Psalms	106	4	( F ) Remember me , O Lord , when you show favor to your people ; help me when you save them , [ a ]
ESV	Psalms	106	5	that I may look upon the prosperity of your ( G ) chosen ones , that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation , that I may glory with your inheritance .
ESV	Psalms	106	6	( H ) Both we and ( I ) our fathers have sinned ; we have committed iniquity ; we have done wickedness .
ESV	Psalms	106	7	Our fathers , when they were in Egypt , did not consider your wondrous works ; they ( J ) did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love , but ( K ) rebelled by the sea , at the Red Sea .
ESV	Psalms	106	8	Yet he saved them ( L ) for his name 's sake , ( M ) that he might make known his mighty power .
ESV	Psalms	106	9	He ( N ) rebuked the Red Sea , and it ( O ) became dry , and he ( P ) led them through the deep as through a desert .
ESV	Psalms	106	10	So he ( Q ) saved them from the hand of the foe and ( R ) redeemed them from the power of the enemy .
ESV	Psalms	106	11	And ( S ) the waters covered their adversaries ; not one of them was left .
ESV	Psalms	106	12	Then ( T ) they believed his words ; they ( U ) sang his praise .
ESV	Psalms	106	13	But they soon ( V ) forgot his works ; they did not wait for ( W ) his counsel .
ESV	Psalms	106	14	But they had ( X ) a wanton craving in the wilderness , and ( Y ) put God to the test in the desert ;
ESV	Psalms	106	15	he ( Z ) gave them what they asked , but sent ( AA ) a wasting disease among them .
ESV	Psalms	106	16	When men in the camp ( AB ) were jealous of Moses and Aaron , ( AC ) the holy one of the Lord ,
ESV	Psalms	106	17	( AD ) the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan , and covered the company of Abiram .
ESV	Psalms	106	18	( AE ) Fire also broke out in their company ; the flame burned up the wicked .
ESV	Psalms	106	19	They ( AF ) made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image .
ESV	Psalms	106	20	They ( AG ) exchanged the glory of God [ b ] for the image of an ox that eats grass .
ESV	Psalms	106	21	They ( AH ) forgot God , their Savior , who had done great things in Egypt ,
ESV	Psalms	106	22	wondrous works in ( AI ) the land of Ham , and awesome deeds by the Red Sea .
ESV	Psalms	106	23	Therefore ( AJ ) he said he would destroy them— had not Moses , his ( AK ) chosen one , ( AL ) stood in the breach before him , to turn away his wrath from destroying them .
ESV	Psalms	106	24	Then they ( AM ) despised ( AN ) the pleasant land , having ( AO ) no faith in his promise .
ESV	Psalms	106	25	They ( AP ) murmured in their tents , and did not obey the voice of the Lord .
ESV	Psalms	106	26	Therefore he ( AQ ) raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness ,
ESV	Psalms	106	27	and would make their offspring fall among the nations , ( AR ) scattering them among the lands .
ESV	Psalms	106	28	Then they ( AS ) yoked themselves to the ( AT ) Baal of Peor , and ate sacrifices offered to ( AU ) the dead ;
ESV	Psalms	106	29	they provoked the Lord to anger with their deeds , and a plague broke out among them .
ESV	Psalms	106	30	Then ( AV ) Phinehas stood up and intervened , and the plague was stayed .
ESV	Psalms	106	31	And that was ( AW ) counted to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever .
ESV	Psalms	106	32	They ( AX ) angered him at the waters of Meribah , and it went ill with Moses on their account ,
ESV	Psalms	106	33	for they ( AY ) made his spirit bitter , [ c ] and he ( AZ ) spoke rashly with his lips .
ESV	Psalms	106	34	They did not ( BA ) destroy the peoples , ( BB ) as the Lord commanded them ,
ESV	Psalms	106	35	but they ( BC ) mixed with the nations and learned to do as they did .
ESV	Psalms	106	36	They served their idols , which became ( BD ) a snare to them .
ESV	Psalms	106	37	They ( BE ) sacrificed their sons and their daughters to ( BF ) the demons ;
ESV	Psalms	106	38	they poured out innocent blood , the blood of their sons and daughters , whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan , and the land was ( BG ) polluted with blood .
ESV	Psalms	106	39	Thus they ( BH ) became unclean by their acts , and ( BI ) played the whore in their deeds .
ESV	Psalms	106	40	Then ( BJ ) the anger of the Lord was kindled against ( BK ) his people , and he abhorred his ( BL ) heritage ;
ESV	Psalms	106	41	he ( BM ) gave them into the hand of the nations , so that those who hated them ruled over them .
ESV	Psalms	106	42	Their enemies ( BN ) oppressed them , and they were brought into subjection under their power .
ESV	Psalms	106	43	( BO ) Many times he delivered them , but they were rebellious in their ( BP ) purposes and were ( BQ ) brought low through their iniquity .
ESV	Psalms	106	44	Nevertheless , he looked upon their distress , when he ( BR ) heard their cry .
ESV	Psalms	106	45	For their sake he ( BS ) remembered his covenant , and ( BT ) relented according to ( BU ) the abundance of his steadfast love .
ESV	Psalms	106	46	He caused them to be ( BV ) pitied by all those who held them captive .
ESV	Psalms	106	47	( BW ) Save us , O Lord our God , and ( BX ) gather us from among the nations , that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise .

ESV	Proverbs	1	1	( A ) The proverbs of Solomon , son of David , king of Israel :
ESV	Proverbs	1	2	To know wisdom and instruction , to understand words of insight ,
ESV	Proverbs	1	3	to receive instruction in wise dealing , in ( B ) righteousness , justice , and equity ;
ESV	Proverbs	1	4	to give prudence to ( C ) the simple , knowledge and ( D ) discretion to the youth—
ESV	Proverbs	1	5	Let the wise hear and ( E ) increase in learning , and the one who understands obtain guidance ,
ESV	Proverbs	1	6	to understand a proverb and a saying , ( F ) the words of the wise and their ( G ) riddles .
ESV	Proverbs	1	7	( H ) The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge ; fools despise wisdom and instruction . The Enticement of Sinners
ESV	Proverbs	1	8	( I ) Hear , my son , your father 's instruction , and forsake not your mother 's teaching ,
ESV	Proverbs	1	9	for they are ( J ) a graceful garland for your head and ( K ) pendants for your neck .
ESV	Proverbs	1	10	My son , if sinners ( L ) entice you , do not consent .
ESV	Proverbs	1	11	If they say , “ Come with us , ( M ) let us lie in wait for blood ; ( N ) let us ambush the innocent without reason ;
ESV	Proverbs	1	12	like Sheol let us ( O ) swallow them alive , and whole , like ( P ) those who go down to the pit ;
ESV	Proverbs	1	13	we shall find all precious goods , we shall fill our houses with plunder ;
ESV	Proverbs	1	14	throw in your lot among us ; we will all have one purse ” —
ESV	Proverbs	1	15	my son , ( Q ) do not walk in the way with them ; ( R ) hold back your foot from their paths ,
ESV	Proverbs	1	16	for ( S ) their feet run to evil , and they make haste to shed blood .
ESV	Proverbs	1	17	( T ) For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird ,
ESV	Proverbs	1	18	but these men ( U ) lie in wait for their own blood ; they ( V ) set an ambush for their own lives .
ESV	Proverbs	1	19	( W ) Such are the ways of everyone who is ( X ) greedy for unjust gain ; ( Y ) it takes away the life of its possessors . The Call of Wisdom
ESV	Proverbs	1	20	( Z ) Wisdom cries aloud in the street , in the markets she raises her voice ;
ESV	Proverbs	1	21	at the head of the noisy streets she cries out ; at ( AA ) the entrance of the city gates she speaks :
ESV	Proverbs	1	22	“ How long , O ( AB ) simple ones , will you love being simple ? How long will ( AC ) scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools ( AD ) hate knowledge ?
ESV	Proverbs	1	23	If you turn at my reproof , [ a ] behold , I will ( AE ) pour out my spirit to you ; I will make my words known to you .
ESV	Proverbs	1	24	( AF ) Because I have called and ( AG ) you refused to listen , have ( AH ) stretched out my hand and no one has heeded ,
ESV	Proverbs	1	25	because you have ( AI ) ignored all my counsel and ( AJ ) would have none of my reproof ,
ESV	Proverbs	1	26	I also ( AK ) will laugh at your calamity ; I will mock when ( AL ) terror strikes you ,
ESV	Proverbs	1	27	when terror strikes you like ( AM ) a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind , when distress and anguish come upon you .
ESV	Proverbs	1	28	( AN ) Then they will call upon me , but I will not answer ; they will seek me diligently but will not find me .
ESV	Proverbs	1	29	Because they ( AO ) hated knowledge and ( AP ) did not choose the fear of the Lord ,
ESV	Proverbs	1	30	( AQ ) would have none of my counsel and ( AR ) despised all my reproof ,
ESV	Proverbs	1	31	therefore they shall eat ( AS ) the fruit of their way , and have ( AT ) their fill of their own devices .
ESV	Proverbs	1	32	For the simple are killed by ( AU ) their turning away , and ( AV ) the complacency of fools destroys them ;
ESV	Proverbs	1	33	but ( AW ) whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be ( AX ) at ease , without dread of disaster. ” Footnotes - Proverbs 1:23 Or Will you turn away at my reproof ? The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Ecclesiastes	8	10	Then I saw the wicked buried . They used to go in and out of ( M ) the holy place and were ( N ) praised [ e ] in the city where they had done such things . This also is vanity . [ f ]
ESV	Ecclesiastes	8	11	Because ( O ) the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily , ( P ) the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil .
ESV	Ecclesiastes	8	12	Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and ( Q ) prolongs his life , yet I know that ( R ) it will be well with ( S ) those who fear God , because they fear before him .

As the good one is , so is the sinner , and he who ( E ) swears is as he who shuns an oath .
ESV	Ecclesiastes	9	3	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun , that ( F ) the same event happens to all . Also , the hearts of the children of man are full of evil , and ( G ) madness is in their hearts while they live , and after that they go to the dead .

ESV	Ecclesiastes	9	11	( Q ) Again I saw that under the sun ( R ) the race is not to the swift , nor ( S ) the battle to the strong , nor bread to the wise , nor riches to the intelligent , nor favor to those with knowledge , but time and ( T ) chance ( U ) happen to them all .
ESV	Ecclesiastes	9	12	For man ( V ) does not know his time . Like fish that are taken in an evil net , and ( W ) like birds that are caught in a snare , so the children of man are ( X ) snared at an evil time , when it suddenly falls upon them .
ESV	Ecclesiastes	9	13	I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun , and it seemed great to me .
ESV	Ecclesiastes	9	14	There was a little city with few men in it , and a great king came against it and besieged it , building great siegeworks against it .
ESV	Ecclesiastes	9	15	But there was found in it ( Y ) a poor , wise man , and he by his ( Z ) wisdom delivered the city . Yet no one remembered that poor man .

ESV	Isaiah	10	10	As my hand has reached to ( T ) the kingdoms of the idols , whose carved images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria ,
ESV	Isaiah	10	2	to turn aside the needy from justice and ( C ) to rob the poor of my people of their right , that widows may be their spoil , and that they may make the fatherless their prey !
ESV	Isaiah	10	3	What will you do on ( D ) the day of punishment , in the ruin that will come ( E ) from afar ? To whom will you flee for help , and where will you leave your wealth ?

ESV	Isaiah	10	5	Woe to Assyria , ( G ) the rod of my anger ; the staff in their hands is my fury !
ESV	Isaiah	10	6	Against a ( H ) godless nation I send him , and against the people of my wrath I command him , to take ( I ) spoil and seize plunder , and to ( J ) tread them down like the mire of the streets .
ESV	Isaiah	10	7	But he ( K ) does not so intend , and his heart does not so think ; but it is in his heart to destroy , and to cut off nations not a few ;
ESV	Isaiah	10	8	for he says : ( L ) “ Are not my commanders all kings ?
ESV	Isaiah	10	9	( M ) Is not ( N ) Calno like ( O ) Carchemish ? Is not ( P ) Hamath like ( Q ) Arpad ? ( R ) Is not ( S ) Samaria like Damascus ?
ESV	Isaiah	10	11	shall I not do to Jerusalem and ( U ) her idols ( V ) as I have done to Samaria and her images ? ”
ESV	Isaiah	10	12	( W ) When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem , ( X ) he [ a ] will punish the speech [ b ] of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes .
ESV	Isaiah	10	13	( Y ) For he says : “ By the strength of my hand I have done it , and by my wisdom , for I have understanding ; I remove the boundaries of peoples , and plunder their treasures ; like a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones .
ESV	Isaiah	10	14	My hand has found like a nest the wealth of the peoples ; and as one gathers eggs that have been forsaken , so I have gathered all the earth ; and there was none that moved a wing or opened the mouth or chirped. ”
ESV	Isaiah	10	15	Shall ( Z ) the axe boast over him who hews with it , or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it ? As if a rod should wield him who lifts it , or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood !
ESV	Isaiah	10	16	Therefore the Lord God of hosts will send wasting sickness among his ( AA ) stout warriors , and under his glory ( AB ) a burning will be kindled , like the burning of fire .
ESV	Isaiah	10	17	( AC ) The light of Israel will become a fire , and ( AD ) his Holy One a flame , and ( AE ) it will burn and devour his thorns and briers ( AF ) in one day .
ESV	Isaiah	10	18	The glory of ( AG ) his forest and of his ( AH ) fruitful land the Lord will destroy , both soul and body , and it will be as when a sick man wastes away .
ESV	Isaiah	10	19	The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down . The Remnant of Israel Will Return
ESV	Isaiah	10	20	( AI ) In that day ( AJ ) the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more ( AK ) lean on him who struck them , but ( AL ) will lean on the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
ESV	Isaiah	10	21	A remnant will return , the remnant of Jacob , ( AM ) to the mighty God .
ESV	Isaiah	10	22	( AN ) For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea , ( AO ) only a remnant of them will return . ( AP ) Destruction is decreed , overflowing with righteousness .
ESV	Isaiah	10	23	For the Lord God of hosts will make a full end , as decreed , in the midst of all the earth .
ESV	Isaiah	10	24	Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts : “ O my people , ( AQ ) who dwell in Zion , ( AR ) be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you as ( AS ) the Egyptians did .
ESV	Isaiah	10	25	For ( AT ) in a very little while my fury will come to an end , and my anger will be directed to their destruction .
ESV	Isaiah	10	26	And ( AU ) the Lord of hosts will wield against them a whip , as when he struck ( AV ) Midian ( AW ) at the rock of Oreb . And his staff will be over the sea , and he will lift it ( AX ) as he did in Egypt .
ESV	Isaiah	10	27	And in that day ( AY ) his burden will depart from your shoulder , and ( AZ ) his yoke from your neck ; and the yoke will be broken because of the fat. ” [ c ]
ESV	Isaiah	10	28	He has come to Aiath ; he has passed through ( BA ) Migron ; at Michmash he stores ( BB ) his baggage ;
ESV	Isaiah	10	29	they have crossed over ( BC ) the pass ; at ( BD ) Geba they lodge for the night ; ( BE ) Ramah trembles ; ( BF ) Gibeah of Saul has fled .
ESV	Isaiah	10	30	Cry aloud , O daughter of ( BG ) Gallim ! Give attention , O Laishah ! O poor ( BH ) Anathoth !
ESV	Isaiah	10	31	Madmenah is in flight ; the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety .
ESV	Isaiah	10	32	This very day he will halt at ( BI ) Nob ; he will shake his fist at the mount of ( BJ ) the daughter of Zion , the hill of Jerusalem .
ESV	Isaiah	10	33	Behold , the Lord God of hosts ( BK ) will lop ( BL ) the boughs with terrifying power ; the great in height will be hewn down , and the lofty will be brought low .

ESV	Isaiah	27	27	In that day the Lord with his hard and great and strong ( A ) sword will punish ( B ) Leviathan the fleeing serpent , ( C ) Leviathan the twisting serpent , and he will slay ( D ) the dragon that is in the sea .
ESV	Isaiah	27	2	In that day , ( E ) “ A pleasant vineyard , [ a ] ( F ) sing of it !
ESV	Isaiah	27	3	I , the Lord , am its keeper ; every moment I water it . Lest anyone punish it , I keep it night and day ;
ESV	Isaiah	27	4	I have no wrath . ( G ) Would that I had thorns and briers to battle ! I would march against them , I would burn them up together .

ESV	Isaiah	27	7	( I ) Has he struck them ( J ) as he struck those who struck them ? Or have they been slain ( K ) as their slayers were slain ?
ESV	Isaiah	27	8	( L ) Measure by measure , [ c ] by exile you contended with them ; ( M ) he removed them with his fierce breath [ d ] in the day of the east wind .
ESV	Isaiah	27	9	Therefore by this ( N ) the guilt of Jacob will be atoned for , and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin : [ e ] ( O ) when he makes all the stones of the altars like chalkstones crushed to pieces , no ( P ) Asherim or incense altars will remain standing .
ESV	Isaiah	27	10	( Q ) For the fortified city is solitary , a habitation deserted and forsaken , like the wilderness ; there the calf grazes ; there it lies down and strips its branches .
ESV	Isaiah	27	11	When its boughs are dry , they are broken ; women come and make a fire of them . ( R ) For this is a people without discernment ; therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them ; he who formed them will show them no favor .

ESV	Isaiah	28	28	Does one crush grain for bread ? No , he does not thresh it forever ; [ f ] when he drives his cart wheel over it with his horses , he does not crush it .
ESV	Isaiah	28	2	Behold , the Lord has ( B ) one who is mighty and strong ; like a storm of hail , a destroying tempest , like ( C ) a storm of mighty , overflowing waters , he casts down to the earth with his hand .
ESV	Isaiah	28	3	( D ) The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden underfoot ;
ESV	Isaiah	28	4	( E ) and the fading flower of its glorious beauty , which is on the head of the rich valley , will be like ( F ) a first-ripe fig [ a ] before the summer : when someone sees it , he swallows it as soon as it is in his hand .
ESV	Isaiah	28	5	( G ) In that day the Lord of hosts will be a crown of glory , [ b ] and a diadem of beauty , to the remnant of his people ,
ESV	Isaiah	28	6	and ( H ) a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment , and ( I ) strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate .
ESV	Isaiah	28	7	( J ) These also reel with wine and ( K ) stagger with strong drink ; the priest and ( L ) the prophet reel with strong drink , they are swallowed by [ c ] wine , they stagger with strong drink , they reel in vision , they stumble in giving judgment .
ESV	Isaiah	28	8	For all tables are full of filthy vomit , with no space left .
ESV	Isaiah	28	9	( M ) “ To whom will he teach knowledge , and to whom will he explain the message ? Those who are weaned from the milk , those taken from the breast ?
ESV	Isaiah	28	10	For it is precept upon precept , precept upon precept , line upon line , line upon line , here a little , there a little. ”
ESV	Isaiah	28	11	( N ) For by people of strange lips and with a foreign tongue the Lord will speak to this people ,
ESV	Isaiah	28	12	to whom he has said , ( O ) “ This is rest ; give rest to the weary ; and this is repose ” ; yet they would not hear .
ESV	Isaiah	28	13	And the word of the Lord will be to them precept upon precept , precept upon precept , line upon line , line upon line , here a little , there a little , ( P ) that they may go , and fall backward , and be broken , and snared , and taken . A Cornerstone in Zion
ESV	Isaiah	28	14	Therefore hear the word of the Lord , you ( Q ) scoffers , who rule this people in Jerusalem !
ESV	Isaiah	28	15	Because you have said , “ We have made a covenant with death , and with Sheol we have an agreement , when the ( R ) overwhelming whip passes through it will not come to us , for we have made ( S ) lies our refuge , and in falsehood we have taken shelter ” ;
ESV	Isaiah	28	16	therefore thus says the Lord God , ( T ) “ Behold , I am the one who has laid [ d ] as a foundation ( U ) in Zion , a stone , a tested stone , a precious cornerstone , of a sure foundation : ‘ Whoever believes will not be in haste. ’
ESV	Isaiah	28	17	And I will make justice ( V ) the line , and righteousness ( W ) the plumb line ; and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies , and waters will overwhelm the shelter. ”
ESV	Isaiah	28	18	Then ( X ) your covenant with death will be annulled , and your agreement with Sheol will not stand ; when the overwhelming scourge passes through , you will be beaten down by it .
ESV	Isaiah	28	19	As often as it passes through it will take you ; ( Y ) for morning by morning it will pass through , by day and by night ; and it will be ( Z ) sheer terror to understand the message .
ESV	Isaiah	28	20	For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on , and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in .
ESV	Isaiah	28	21	For the Lord will rise up ( AA ) as on Mount Perazim ; ( AB ) as in the Valley of ( AC ) Gibeon he will be roused ; to do his deed—strange is his deed ! and to work his work—alien is his work !
ESV	Isaiah	28	22	Now therefore do not ( AD ) scoff , lest your bonds be made strong ; for I have heard ( AE ) a decree of destruction from the Lord God of hosts against the whole land .
ESV	Isaiah	28	23	Give ear , and hear my voice ; give attention , and hear my speech .
ESV	Isaiah	28	24	Does he who plows for sowing plow continually ? Does he continually open and harrow his ground ?
ESV	Isaiah	28	25	( AF ) When he has leveled its surface , does he not scatter dill , sow cumin , and put in wheat in rows and barley in its proper place , and emmer [ e ] as the border ?
ESV	Isaiah	28	26	( AG ) For he is rightly instructed ; his God teaches him .
ESV	Isaiah	28	27	Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge , nor is a cart wheel rolled over cumin , but dill is beaten out with a stick , and cumin with a rod .

ESV	Isaiah	29	9	Astonish yourselves [ b ] and be astonished ; blind yourselves and be blind ! Be drunk , [ c ] but not with wine ; ( L ) stagger , [ d ] but not with strong drink !
ESV	Isaiah	29	10	( M ) For the Lord has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep , and has closed your eyes ( the prophets ) , and covered your heads ( the seers ) .
ESV	Isaiah	29	11	And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is ( N ) sealed . When men give it to one who can read , saying , “ Read this , ” he says , “ I can not , for it is sealed. ”
ESV	Isaiah	29	12	And when they give the book to one who can not read , saying , “ Read this , ” he says , “ I can not read. ”
ESV	Isaiah	29	13	And the Lord said : “ Because ( O ) this people ( P ) draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips , while their hearts are far from me , and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men ,
ESV	Isaiah	29	14	therefore , behold , ( Q ) I will again do wonderful things with this people , with wonder upon wonder ; and ( R ) the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hidden. ”
ESV	Isaiah	29	15	Ah , ( S ) you who hide deep from the Lord your counsel , whose deeds are ( T ) in the dark , and who say , “ Who sees us ? Who knows us ? ”
ESV	Isaiah	29	16	( U ) You turn things upside down ! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay , that the thing made should say of its maker , “ He did not make me ” ; or the thing formed say of him who formed it , “ He has no understanding ” ?
ESV	Isaiah	29	17	Is it not yet a very little while ( V ) until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest ?
ESV	Isaiah	29	18	In that day ( W ) the deaf shall hear ( X ) the words of a book , and out of their gloom and darkness ( Y ) the eyes of the blind shall see .
ESV	Isaiah	29	19	( Z ) The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the Lord , and the poor among mankind shall exult in the Holy One of Israel .
ESV	Isaiah	29	20	For the ruthless shall come to nothing and ( AA ) the scoffer cease , and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off ,

ESV	Isaiah	30	2	( D ) who set out to go down to Egypt , without asking for my direction , to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt !
ESV	Isaiah	30	3	( E ) Therefore shall the protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame , and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your humiliation .
ESV	Isaiah	30	4	For though his officials are at ( F ) Zoan and ( G ) his envoys reach ( H ) Hanes ,
ESV	Isaiah	30	5	everyone comes to shame through ( I ) a people that can not profit them , that brings neither help nor profit , but shame and disgrace. ”
ESV	Isaiah	30	6	An ( J ) oracle on ( K ) the beasts of ( L ) the Negeb . Through a land of trouble and anguish , from where come the lioness and the lion , the adder and the ( M ) flying fiery serpent , they carry their riches on the backs of donkeys , and their treasures on the humps of camels , to a people that can not profit them .
ESV	Isaiah	30	7	Egypt 's ( N ) help is worthless and empty ; therefore I have called her ( O ) “ Rahab who sits still. ” A Rebellious People
ESV	Isaiah	30	8	And now , go , ( P ) write it before them on a tablet and inscribe it in a book , that it may be for the time to come as a witness forever . [ b ]
ESV	Isaiah	30	9	( Q ) For they are a rebellious people , lying children , children unwilling to hear the instruction of the Lord ;
ESV	Isaiah	30	10	( R ) who say to ( S ) the seers , “ Do not see , ” and to the prophets , “ Do not prophesy to us what is right ; speak to us ( T ) smooth things , prophesy illusions ,
ESV	Isaiah	30	11	leave the way , turn aside from the path , let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel. ”
ESV	Isaiah	30	12	Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel , “ Because you despise this word and trust in ( U ) oppression and perverseness and rely on them ,
ESV	Isaiah	30	13	therefore this iniquity shall be to you ( V ) like a breach in a high wall , bulging out and about to collapse , whose breaking comes suddenly , in an instant ;
ESV	Isaiah	30	14	and its breaking is ( W ) like that of a potter 's vessel that is smashed so ruthlessly that among its fragments not a shard is found with which to take fire from the hearth , or to dip up water out of the cistern. ”
ESV	Isaiah	30	15	For thus said the Lord God , the Holy One of Israel , “ In ( X ) returning [ c ] and ( Y ) rest you shall be saved ; in quietness and in trust shall be your strength. ” But you were unwilling ,
ESV	Isaiah	30	16	and you said , “ No ! We will flee upon ( Z ) horses ” ; therefore you shall flee away ; and , “ We will ride upon swift steeds ” ; therefore your pursuers shall be swift .
ESV	Isaiah	30	17	( AA ) A thousand shall flee at the threat of one ; at the threat of five you shall flee , till you are left like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain , like a signal on a hill . The Lord Will Be Gracious
ESV	Isaiah	30	18	Therefore the Lord ( AB ) waits to be gracious to you , and therefore he ( AC ) exalts himself to show mercy to you . For the Lord is a God of justice ; ( AD ) blessed are all those who wait for him .
ESV	Isaiah	30	19	For a people shall dwell ( AE ) in Zion , in Jerusalem ; you shall weep no more . He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry . As soon as he hears it , he answers you .
ESV	Isaiah	30	20	And though the Lord give you the ( AF ) bread of adversity and the ( AG ) water of affliction , ( AH ) yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore , but your eyes shall see your Teacher .
ESV	Isaiah	30	21	( AI ) And your ears shall hear a word behind you , saying , “ This is ( AJ ) the way , walk in it , ” when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left .

ESV	Isaiah	30	23	( AL ) And he will give ( AM ) rain for the seed with which you sow the ground , and bread , the produce of the ground , which will be rich and plenteous . ( AN ) In that day your livestock will graze in large pastures ,
ESV	Isaiah	30	24	and ( AO ) the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned fodder , which has been winnowed with shovel and fork .
ESV	Isaiah	30	25	And ( AP ) on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water , in the day of the great slaughter , ( AQ ) when the towers fall .
ESV	Isaiah	30	26	( AR ) Moreover , the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun will be sevenfold , as the light of seven days , in the day when ( AS ) the Lord binds up ( AT ) the brokenness of his people , and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow .

ESV	Isaiah	30	28	( AU ) his breath is ( AV ) like an overflowing stream that reaches up to the neck ; to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction , and to place on the jaws of the peoples ( AW ) a bridle that leads astray .
ESV	Isaiah	30	29	You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept , and gladness of heart , ( AX ) as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to ( AY ) the mountain of the Lord , to ( AZ ) the Rock of Israel .
ESV	Isaiah	30	31	The Assyrians will be terror-stricken at the voice of the Lord , ( BD ) when he strikes with his rod .
ESV	Isaiah	30	32	And every stroke of the appointed staff that the Lord lays on them ( BE ) will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres . ( BF ) Battling with brandished arm , he will fight with them .
ESV	Isaiah	30	33	For ( BG ) a burning place [ e ] has long been prepared ; indeed , for the king it is made ready , ( BH ) its pyre made deep and wide , with fire and wood in abundance ; ( BI ) the breath of the Lord , like a stream of sulfur , kindles it .

ESV	Isaiah	36	36	( A ) In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah , ( B ) Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them .
ESV	Isaiah	36	2	( C ) And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh [ a ] from ( D ) Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem , with a great army . And he stood ( E ) by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer 's Field .
ESV	Isaiah	36	3	And there came out to him ( F ) Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and ( G ) Shebna the secretary , and Joah the son of Asaph , the recorder .
ESV	Isaiah	36	4	And the Rabshakeh said to them , “ Say to Hezekiah , ‘ Thus says the ( H ) great king , the king of Assyria : On what do you rest this trust of yours ?
ESV	Isaiah	36	5	Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war ? In whom do you now trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
ESV	Isaiah	36	6	( I ) Behold , you are trusting in Egypt , that broken reed of a staff , which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it . Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him .
ESV	Isaiah	36	7	But if you say to me , “ We trust in the Lord our God , ” is it not he ( J ) whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed , saying to Judah and to Jerusalem , “ You shall worship before this altar ” ?
ESV	Isaiah	36	8	Come now , make a wager with my master the king of Assyria : I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
ESV	Isaiah	36	9	How then can you repulse ( K ) a single captain among the least of my master 's servants , when ( L ) you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
ESV	Isaiah	36	10	Moreover , is it without the Lord that I have come up against this land to destroy it ? ( M ) The Lord said to me , “ Go up against this land and destroy it. ” ’ ”
ESV	Isaiah	36	11	Then Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah said to the Rabshakeh , “ Please speak to your servants ( N ) in Aramaic , for we understand it . Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall. ”
ESV	Isaiah	36	12	But the Rabshakeh said , “ Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you , and not to the men sitting on the wall , who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine ? ”
ESV	Isaiah	36	13	Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah : “ Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
ESV	Isaiah	36	14	Thus says the king : ( O ) ‘ Do not let Hezekiah deceive you , for he will not be able to deliver you .
ESV	Isaiah	36	15	Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord by saying , “ The Lord will surely deliver us . This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. ”
ESV	Isaiah	36	16	Do not listen to Hezekiah . For thus says the king of Assyria : Make your peace with me [ b ] and come out to me . Then each one of you will eat of his own vine , and each one of his own fig tree , and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern ,
ESV	Isaiah	36	17	until ( P ) I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of grain and wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
ESV	Isaiah	36	18	Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying , “ The Lord will deliver us. ” Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
ESV	Isaiah	36	19	( Q ) Where are the gods of ( R ) Hamath and ( S ) Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? ( T ) Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?

ESV	Isaiah	36	21	But they were silent and answered him not a word , for the king 's command was , “ Do not answer him. ”
ESV	Isaiah	36	22	( V ) Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the secretary , and Joah the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of the Rabshakeh .

ESV	Isaiah	42	21	The Lord was pleased , for his righteousness ' sake , to magnify his law and make it glorious .
ESV	Isaiah	42	22	But this is a people plundered and looted ; they are all of them trapped in holes ( AH ) and hidden in prisons ; they have become plunder with none to rescue , spoil with none to say , “ Restore ! ”
ESV	Isaiah	42	23	Who among you will give ear to this , will attend and listen for the time to come ?
ESV	Isaiah	42	24	Who gave up Jacob to the looter , and Israel to the plunderers ? Was it not the Lord , against whom we have sinned , in whose ways they would not walk , and whose law they would not obey ?

ESV	Isaiah	57	2	( B ) he enters into peace ; they rest ( C ) in their beds who walk in their uprightness .

ESV	Isaiah	57	8	Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your memorial ; for , deserting me , ( L ) you have uncovered your bed , you have gone up to it , ( M ) you have made it wide ; and you have made a covenant for yourself with them , you have loved their bed , you have looked on nakedness .

ESV	Isaiah	57	9	You journeyed to the king with oil and multiplied your perfumes ; ( N ) you sent your envoys far off , and sent down even to Sheol .

ESV	Isaiah	58	2	( C ) Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways , as if they were a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the judgment of their God ; they ask of me righteous judgments ; they delight to draw near to God .
ESV	Isaiah	58	3	( D ) ‘ Why have we fasted , and you see it not ? Why have we humbled ourselves , and you take no knowledge of it ? ’ Behold , in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure , [ a ] ( E ) and oppress all your workers .
ESV	Isaiah	58	4	Behold , you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with a wicked fist . Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high .
ESV	Isaiah	58	5	( F ) Is such the fast that I choose , ( G ) a day for a person to humble himself ? Is it to bow down his head like a reed , and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him ? Will you call this a fast , and a day acceptable to the Lord ?
ESV	Isaiah	58	6	“ Is not this the fast that I choose : ( H ) to loose the bonds of wickedness , to undo the straps ( I ) of the yoke , to let the oppressed [ b ] go free , and to break every yoke ?

ESV	Isaiah	59	59	Behold , ( A ) the Lord 's hand is not shortened , that it can not save , or his ear dull , that it can not hear ;
ESV	Isaiah	59	2	( B ) but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God , and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear .
ESV	Isaiah	59	3	( C ) For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity ; your lips have spoken lies ; your tongue mutters wickedness .
ESV	Isaiah	59	4	( D ) No one enters suit justly ; no one goes to law honestly ; they rely on empty pleas , they speak lies , ( E ) they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity .
ESV	Isaiah	59	5	They hatch adders ' eggs ; they weave the spider 's web ; he who eats their eggs dies , and from one that is crushed a viper is hatched .
ESV	Isaiah	59	6	( F ) Their webs will not serve as clothing ; men will not cover themselves with what they make . Their works are works of iniquity , and deeds of violence are in their hands .
ESV	Isaiah	59	7	( G ) Their feet run to evil , and they are swift to shed innocent blood ; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity ; desolation and destruction are in their highways .
ESV	Isaiah	59	8	The way of peace they do not know , and there is no justice in their paths ; they have made their roads crooked ; ( H ) no one who treads on them knows peace .

ESV	Isaiah	59	14	( O ) Justice is turned back , and righteousness stands far away ; for truth has stumbled in the public squares , and uprightness can not enter .
ESV	Isaiah	59	15	Truth is lacking , and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey . The Lord saw it , and it displeased him [ a ] that there was no justice .
ESV	Isaiah	59	16	( P ) He saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no one to intercede ; then his own arm brought him salvation , and his righteousness upheld him .
ESV	Isaiah	59	17	( Q ) He put on righteousness as a breastplate , and a helmet of salvation on his head ; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing , and wrapped himself in ( R ) zeal as a cloak .
ESV	Isaiah	59	18	( S ) According to their deeds , so will he repay , wrath to his adversaries , repayment to his enemies ; ( T ) to the coastlands he will render repayment .

ESV	Jeremiah	2	27	who say to a tree , ‘ You are my father , ’ and to a stone , ‘ You gave me birth. ’ For they have turned their back to me , and not their face . But ( BI ) in the time of their trouble they say , ‘ Arise and save us ! ’
ESV	Jeremiah	2	28	But ( BJ ) where are your gods that you made for yourself ? Let them arise , ( BK ) if they can save you , in your time of trouble ; for ( BL ) as many as your cities are your gods , O Judah .
ESV	Jeremiah	2	29	“ Why do you contend with me ? You have all transgressed against me , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	2	30	In vain have I ( BM ) struck your children ; they took no correction ; ( BN ) your own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion .

ESV	Jeremiah	3	3	( G ) Therefore the showers have been withheld , and the spring rain has not come ; yet you have ( H ) the forehead of a whore ; you refuse to be ashamed .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	2	Lift up your eyes to ( D ) the bare heights , and see ! Where have you not been ravished ? ( E ) By the waysides you have sat awaiting lovers like an Arab in the wilderness . ( F ) You have polluted the land with your vile whoredom .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	4	Have you not just now ( I ) called to me , ‘ My father , you are the friend of my youth—
ESV	Jeremiah	3	5	( J ) will he be angry forever , will he be indignant to the end ? ’ Behold , you have spoken , but you have done all the evil that you could. ” Faithless Israel Called to Repentance
ESV	Jeremiah	3	6	The Lord said to me in the days of ( K ) King Josiah : “ Have you seen what she did , that faithless one , Israel , ( L ) how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree , and there ( M ) played the whore ?
ESV	Jeremiah	3	7	And I thought , ‘ After she has done all this she will return to me , ’ but she did not return , and her treacherous ( N ) sister Judah saw it .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	8	She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one , Israel , ( O ) I had sent her away with ( P ) a decree of divorce . ( Q ) Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear , but she too went ( R ) and played the whore .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	9	Because she took her whoredom lightly , she polluted the land , committing adultery with ( S ) stone and tree .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	10	Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me ( T ) with her whole heart , but in pretense , declares the Lord. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	3	11	And the Lord said to me , ( U ) “ Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	12	Go , and proclaim these words toward ( V ) the north , and say , ( W ) “ ‘ Return , faithless Israel , declares the Lord . I will not look on you in anger , for ( X ) I am merciful , declares the Lord ; ( Y ) I will not be angry forever .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	13	( Z ) Only acknowledge your guilt , that you rebelled against the Lord your God and scattered your favors among foreigners under ( AA ) every green tree , and that you have not obeyed my voice , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	14	( AB ) Return , O faithless children , declares the Lord ; ( AC ) for I am your master ; I will take you , one from a city and two from a family , and I will bring you to Zion .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	15	“ ‘ And ( AD ) I will give you shepherds after my own heart , ( AE ) who will feed you with knowledge and understanding .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	16	And when you have multiplied and been fruitful in the land , in those days , declares the Lord , they shall no more say , “ The ark of the covenant of the Lord. ” It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed ; it shall not be made again .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	17	At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the Lord , ( AF ) and all nations shall gather to it , ( AG ) to the presence of the Lord in Jerusalem , and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	18	( AH ) In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel , and together they shall come from the land ( AI ) of the north to ( AJ ) the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	19	“ ‘ I said , How I would set you among my sons , and give you a pleasant land , a heritage most beautiful of all nations . And I thought you would ( AK ) call me , My Father , and would not turn from following me .
ESV	Jeremiah	3	20	( AL ) Surely , as a treacherous wife leaves her husband , so have you been treacherous to me , O house of Israel , declares the Lord. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	3	21	A voice on the ( AM ) bare heights is heard , ( AN ) the weeping and pleading of Israel 's sons because they have perverted their way ; they have forgotten the Lord their God .

ESV	Jeremiah	4	4	( H ) Circumcise yourselves to the Lord ; remove the foreskin of your hearts , O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem ; ( I ) lest my wrath go forth like fire , and burn with none to quench it , ( J ) because of the evil of your deeds. ” Disaster from the North
ESV	Jeremiah	4	2	( C ) and if you swear , ‘ As the Lord lives , ’ in truth , in justice , and in righteousness , then ( D ) nations shall bless themselves in him , ( E ) and in him shall they glory. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	4	3	For thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem : ( F ) “ Break up your fallow ground , and ( G ) sow not among thorns .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	5	Declare in Judah , and proclaim in Jerusalem , and say , ( K ) “ Blow the trumpet through the land ; cry aloud and say , ( L ) ‘ Assemble , and let us go into the fortified cities ! ’
ESV	Jeremiah	4	6	( M ) Raise a standard toward Zion , flee for safety , stay not , for I bring disaster from ( N ) the north , ( O ) and great destruction .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	7	( P ) A lion has gone up from his thicket , a destroyer of nations has set out ; he has gone out from his place to make your land a waste ; your cities will be ruins ( Q ) without inhabitant .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	8	For this ( R ) put on sackcloth , lament and wail , for ( S ) the fierce anger of the Lord has not turned back from us. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	4	9	“ In that day , declares the Lord , ( T ) courage shall fail both king and officials . The priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	4	10	Then I said , “ Ah , Lord God , ( U ) surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem , saying , ‘ It shall be well with you , ’ whereas the sword has reached their very life. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	4	11	At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem , “ A hot wind from ( V ) the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people , not to winnow or cleanse ,
ESV	Jeremiah	4	12	a wind too full for this comes for me . Now it is I who ( W ) speak in judgment upon them. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	4	13	Behold , he comes up like clouds ; ( X ) his chariots like the whirlwind ; his horses are ( Y ) swifter than eagles— woe to us , ( Z ) for we are ruined !
ESV	Jeremiah	4	14	O Jerusalem , ( AA ) wash your heart from evil , that you may be saved . How long shall your wicked thoughts lodge within you ?
ESV	Jeremiah	4	15	For a voice ( AB ) declares from Dan and proclaims trouble from ( AC ) Mount Ephraim .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	16	Warn the nations that he is coming ; announce to Jerusalem , “ Besiegers come ( AD ) from a distant land ; they shout against the cities of Judah .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	17	Like keepers of a field ( AE ) are they against her all around , because she has rebelled against me , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	18	Your ways and your deeds have brought this upon you . This is your doom , and ( AF ) it is bitter ; it has reached your very heart. ” Anguish over Judah 's Desolation
ESV	Jeremiah	4	19	( AG ) My anguish , my anguish ! I writhe in pain ! Oh the walls of my heart ! My heart is beating wildly ; I can not keep silent , for I hear the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	20	( AH ) Crash follows hard on crash ; the whole land is laid waste . ( AI ) Suddenly my tents are laid waste , my curtains in a moment .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	21	How long must I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet ?
ESV	Jeremiah	4	22	“ For ( AJ ) my people are foolish ; they know me not ; they are stupid children ; they have no understanding . ( AK ) They are ‘ wise ’ —in doing evil ! But how to do good they know not. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	4	23	I looked on the earth , and behold , it was ( AL ) without form and void ; ( AM ) and to the heavens , and they had no light .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	24	I looked on ( AN ) the mountains , and behold , they were quaking , and all the hills moved to and fro .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	25	( AO ) I looked , and behold , there was no man , and all the birds of the air had fled .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	26	I looked , and behold , the ( AP ) fruitful land was a desert , and all its cities were laid in ruins before the Lord , before ( AQ ) his fierce anger .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	27	For thus says the Lord , “ The whole land shall be a desolation ; ( AR ) yet I will not make a full end .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	28	( AS ) “ For this the earth shall mourn , ( AT ) and the heavens above be dark ; for I have spoken ; I have purposed ; ( AU ) I have not relented , nor will I turn back. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	4	29	At the noise of horseman and archer every city takes to flight ; they enter thickets ; they climb among rocks ; all the cities are forsaken , and ( AV ) no man dwells in them .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	30	And you , O desolate one , what do you mean that you dress in scarlet , ( AW ) that you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold , ( AX ) that you enlarge your eyes with paint ? In vain you beautify yourself . ( AY ) Your lovers despise you ; they seek your life .
ESV	Jeremiah	4	31	For I heard ( AZ ) a cry as of a woman in labor , anguish as of one giving birth to her first child , the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath , ( BA ) stretching out her hands , “ Woe is me ! I am fainting before murderers. ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Jeremiah	5	5	I will go to the great and will speak to them , for they know the way of the Lord , the justice of their God. ” ( I ) But they all alike had broken the yoke ; they had burst the bonds .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	2	( D ) Though they say , “ As the Lord lives , ” ( E ) yet they swear falsely .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	3	O Lord , do not your eyes look for truth ? ( F ) You have struck them down , but they felt no anguish ; you have consumed them , but they refused to take correction . ( G ) They have made their faces harder than rock ; they have refused to repent .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	4	Then I said , “ These are only the poor ; they have no sense ; ( H ) for they do not know the way of the Lord , the justice of their God .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	6	Therefore ( J ) a lion from the forest shall strike them down ; a ( K ) wolf from the desert shall devastate them . ( L ) A leopard is watching their cities ; everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces , because their transgressions are many , their ( M ) apostasies are great .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	7	( N ) “ How can I pardon you ? Your children have forsaken me ( O ) and have sworn by those who are no gods . ( P ) When I fed them to the full , ( Q ) they committed adultery ( R ) and trooped to the houses of whores .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	8	They were well-fed , lusty stallions , ( S ) each neighing ( T ) for his neighbor 's wife .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	9	( U ) Shall I not punish them for these things ? declares the Lord ; and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this ?
ESV	Jeremiah	5	10	( V ) “ Go up through her vine rows and destroy , ( W ) but make not a full end ; strip away her branches , for they are not the Lord 's .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	11	( X ) For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly treacherous to me , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	12	They have spoken falsely of the Lord and have said , ‘ He will do nothing ; ( Y ) no disaster will come upon us , ( Z ) nor shall we see sword or famine .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	13	The prophets will become wind ; the word is not in them . Thus shall it be done to them ! ’ ” The Lord Proclaims Judgment
ESV	Jeremiah	5	14	Therefore thus says the Lord , the God of hosts : “ Because you have spoken this word , behold , ( AA ) I am making my words in your mouth ( AB ) a fire , and this people wood , and the fire shall consume them .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	15	( AC ) Behold , I am bringing against you a nation from afar , O house of Israel , declares the Lord . It is an enduring nation ; it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language you do not know , ( AD ) nor can you understand what they say .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	16	( AE ) Their quiver is like ( AF ) an open tomb ; they are all mighty warriors .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	17	( AG ) They shall eat up your harvest and your food ; they shall eat up your sons and your daughters ; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds ; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees ; your ( AH ) fortified cities in which you trust they shall beat down with the sword. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	5	18	“ But even in those days , declares the Lord , ( AI ) I will not make a full end of you .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	19	And when your people say , ( AJ ) ‘ Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us ? ’ you shall say to them , ‘ As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land , ( AK ) so you shall serve foreigners in a land that is not yours. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	5	20	Declare this in the house of Jacob ; proclaim it in Judah :
ESV	Jeremiah	5	21	“ Hear this , ( AL ) O foolish and senseless people , ( AM ) who have eyes , but see not , who have ears , but hear not .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	22	( AN ) Do you not fear me ? declares the Lord . Do you not tremble before me ? I placed the sand ( AO ) as the boundary for the sea , a perpetual barrier that it can not pass ; though the waves toss , they can not prevail ; though ( AP ) they roar , they can not pass over it .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	23	( AQ ) But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart ; they have turned aside and gone away .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	24	They do not say in their hearts , ‘ Let us fear the Lord our God , ( AR ) who gives the rain in its season , the autumn rain and the spring rain , and keeps for us ( AS ) the weeks appointed for the harvest. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	5	25	( AT ) Your iniquities have turned these away , and your sins have kept good from you .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	26	For wicked men are found among my people ; ( AU ) they lurk like fowlers lying in wait . [ a ] ( AV ) They set a trap ; they catch men .
ESV	Jeremiah	5	27	Like a cage full of birds , their houses are full of deceit ; therefore they have become great and rich ;
ESV	Jeremiah	5	28	( AW ) they have grown fat and sleek . They know no bounds in deeds of evil ; ( AX ) they judge not with justice the cause of the fatherless , to make it prosper , and they do not defend the rights of the needy .

ESV	Jeremiah	8	2	And they shall be spread ( A ) before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven , which they have loved and served , which they have gone after , and which they have sought and worshiped .

ESV	Jeremiah	8	4	“ You shall say to them , Thus says the Lord : ( F ) When men fall , do they not rise again ? If one turns away , does he not return ?
ESV	Jeremiah	8	5	Why then has this people ( G ) turned away in perpetual ( H ) backsliding ? ( I ) They hold fast to deceit ; they refuse to return .
ESV	Jeremiah	8	6	( J ) I have paid attention and listened , but they have not spoken rightly ; no man relents of his evil , saying , ‘ What have I done ? ’ Everyone turns to his own course , ( K ) like a horse plunging headlong into battle .
ESV	Jeremiah	8	7	Even the stork in the heavens knows her times , and ( L ) the turtledove , ( M ) swallow , and crane [ a ] keep the time of their coming , ( N ) but my people know not the rules [ b ] of the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	8	9	( P ) The wise men shall be put to shame ; they shall be dismayed ( Q ) and taken ; behold , they have rejected the word of the Lord , so what wisdom is in them ?
ESV	Jeremiah	8	10	( R ) Therefore I will give their wives to others and their fields to conquerors , because from the least to the greatest everyone ( S ) is greedy for unjust gain ; from prophet to priest , everyone deals falsely .
ESV	Jeremiah	8	11	They have healed ( T ) the wound of my people lightly , saying , ‘ Peace , peace , ’ when there is no peace .
ESV	Jeremiah	8	12	Were they ashamed when they committed abomination ? No , ( U ) they were not at all ashamed ; they did not know how to blush . ( V ) Therefore they shall fall among the fallen ; when I punish them , they shall be overthrown , says the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	8	13	When I would gather them , declares the Lord , there are ( W ) no grapes on the vine , ( X ) nor figs on the fig tree ; ( Y ) even the leaves are withered , and what I gave them has passed away from them. ” [ c ]
ESV	Jeremiah	8	14	Why do we sit still ? ( Z ) Gather together ; ( AA ) let us go into the fortified cities and perish there , for the Lord our God has doomed us to perish and has ( AB ) given us ( AC ) poisoned water to drink , because we have sinned against the Lord .

ESV	Jeremiah	9	2	[ b ] Oh that I had in the desert a travelers ' lodging place , that I might leave my people and go away from them ! For they are all ( C ) adulterers , a company of ( D ) treacherous men .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	3	( E ) They bend their tongue like a bow ; falsehood and not truth has grown strong [ c ] in the land ; for they proceed from evil to evil , ( F ) and they do not know me , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	4	( G ) Let everyone beware of his neighbor , and put no trust in any brother , for every ( H ) brother is a deceiver , and every neighbor ( I ) goes about as a slanderer .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	5	Everyone deceives his neighbor , and no one speaks the truth ; they have taught their tongue to speak lies ; they weary themselves committing iniquity .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	6	Heaping oppression upon oppression , and deceit upon deceit , ( J ) they refuse to know me , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	7	Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts : “ Behold , ( K ) I will refine them and ( L ) test them , for what else can I do , ( M ) because of my people ?
ESV	Jeremiah	9	8	( N ) Their tongue is a deadly arrow ; ( O ) it speaks deceitfully ; with his mouth ( P ) each speaks peace to his neighbor , but in his heart ( Q ) he plans an ambush for him .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	10	“ I will take up weeping and wailing for the mountains , and a lamentation for ( S ) the pastures of the wilderness , ( T ) because they are laid waste so that no one passes through , and the lowing of cattle is not heard ; ( U ) both the birds of the air and the beasts have fled and are gone .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	11	( V ) I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins , ( W ) a lair of jackals , ( X ) and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation , without inhabitant. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	9	12	( Y ) Who is the man so wise that he can understand this ? To whom has the mouth of the Lord spoken , that he may declare it ? Why is the land ruined ( Z ) and laid waste like a wilderness , so that no one passes through ?
ESV	Jeremiah	9	13	And the Lord says : ( AA ) “ Because they have forsaken my law that I set before them , and have not obeyed my voice or walked in accord with it ,
ESV	Jeremiah	9	14	but ( AB ) have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals , as their fathers taught them .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	15	Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ( AC ) Behold , I will feed this people with bitter food , and give them ( AD ) poisonous water to drink .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	16	( AE ) I will scatter them among the nations ( AF ) whom neither they nor their fathers have known , and I will ( AG ) send the sword after them , until I have consumed them. ”

ESV	Jeremiah	9	18	let them make haste ( AI ) and raise a wailing over us , ( AJ ) that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids flow with water .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	19	For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion : ( AK ) ‘ How we are ruined ! We are utterly shamed , because we have left the land , because they have cast down our dwellings. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	9	20	Hear , O women , the word of the Lord , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth ; teach to your daughters a lament , and each to her neighbor a dirge .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	21	For death has come up into our windows ; it has entered our palaces , ( AL ) cutting off the children from the streets and the young men from the squares .
ESV	Jeremiah	9	22	Speak : “ Thus declares the Lord , ( AM ) ‘ The dead bodies of men shall fall like dung upon the open field , ( AN ) like sheaves after the reaper , and none shall gather them. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	9	23	Thus says the Lord : ( AO ) “ Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom , let not the mighty man boast in his might , let not the rich man boast in his riches ,

ESV	Jeremiah	10	10	( Q ) But the Lord is the true God ; ( R ) he is the living God and the everlasting King . At his wrath the earth quakes , and the nations can not endure his indignation .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	2	Thus says the Lord : “ Learn not the way of the nations , nor be dismayed at the signs of the heavens because the nations are dismayed at them ,
ESV	Jeremiah	10	3	( A ) for the customs of the peoples are vanity . [ a ] ( B ) A tree from the forest is cut down and worked with an axe by the hands of a craftsman .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	4	( C ) They decorate it with silver and gold ; ( D ) they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it can not move .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	5	Their idols [ b ] are like scarecrows in a cucumber field , and ( E ) they can not speak ; ( F ) they have to be carried , for they can not walk . Do not be afraid of them , ( G ) for they can not do evil , neither is it in them to do good. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	10	6	( H ) There is none like you , O Lord ; you are great , and your name is great in might .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	7	( I ) Who would not fear you , O King of the nations ? For this is your due ; for among all the wise ones of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like you .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	8	( J ) They are both ( K ) stupid and foolish ; the instruction of idols is but wood !
ESV	Jeremiah	10	9	( L ) Beaten silver is brought from ( M ) Tarshish , and gold from ( N ) Uphaz . ( O ) They are the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith ; their clothing is violet and purple ; ( P ) they are all the work of skilled men .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	11	Thus shall you say to them : ( S ) “ The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth ( T ) shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens. ” [ c ]
ESV	Jeremiah	10	12	( U ) It is he who ( V ) made the earth by his power , ( W ) who established the world by his wisdom , and ( X ) by his understanding stretched out the heavens .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	13	( Y ) When he utters his voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens , ( Z ) and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth . ( AA ) He makes lightning ( AB ) for the rain , ( AC ) and he brings forth the wind ( AD ) from his storehouses .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	14	( AE ) Every man is stupid and without knowledge ; ( AF ) every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols , for his images are false , ( AG ) and there is no breath in them .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	15	They are worthless , a work of delusion ; at the time of their punishment they shall perish .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	16	Not like these is he who is ( AH ) the portion of Jacob , for he is the one who formed all things , ( AI ) and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance ; ( AJ ) the Lord of hosts is his name .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	17	( AK ) Gather up your bundle from the ground , O you who dwell under siege !
ESV	Jeremiah	10	18	For thus says the Lord : ( AL ) “ Behold , I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land at this time , ( AM ) and I will bring distress on them , that they may feel it. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	10	19	Woe is me because of my hurt ! ( AN ) My wound is grievous . But I said , “ Truly this is an affliction , and I must bear it. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	10	20	( AO ) My tent is destroyed , and all my cords are broken ; my children have gone from me , ( AP ) and they are not ; there is no one to spread my tent again and ( AQ ) to set up my curtains .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	21	( AR ) For the shepherds ( AS ) are stupid and do not inquire of the Lord ; therefore they have not prospered , ( AT ) and all their flock is scattered .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	22	A voice , a rumor ! Behold , it comes ! — ( AU ) a great commotion out of the north country to make ( AV ) the cities of Judah a desolation , ( AW ) a lair of jackals .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	23	( AX ) I know , O Lord , that the way of man is not in himself , that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	24	( AY ) Correct me , O Lord , but in justice ; not in your anger , lest you bring me to nothing .
ESV	Jeremiah	10	25	( AZ ) Pour out your wrath on the nations that know you not , and on the peoples that call not on your name , ( BA ) for they have devoured Jacob ; they have devoured him and consumed him , and have laid waste his habitation .

ESV	Jeremiah	11	11	Therefore , thus says the Lord , Behold , I am bringing disaster upon them that they can not escape . ( S ) Though they cry to me , I will not listen to them .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	2	( A ) “ Hear the words of this covenant , and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	3	You shall say to them , Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : ( B ) Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant
ESV	Jeremiah	11	4	that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt , ( C ) from the iron furnace , saying , ( D ) Listen to my voice , and do all that I command you . ( E ) So shall you be my people , and I will be your God ,
ESV	Jeremiah	11	5	( F ) that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers , ( G ) to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as at this day. ” Then I answered , “ So be it , Lord. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	11	6	And the Lord said to me , ( H ) “ Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem : ( I ) Hear the words of this covenant and do them .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	7	For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , ( J ) warning them persistently , even to this day , saying , ( K ) Obey my voice .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	8	( L ) Yet they did not obey or incline their ear , ( M ) but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart . Therefore I brought upon them all ( N ) the words of this covenant , which I commanded them to do , but they did not. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	11	9	Again the Lord said to me , ( O ) “ A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	10	They have turned back to ( P ) the iniquities of their forefathers , who refused to hear my words . ( Q ) They have gone after other gods to serve them . ( R ) The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their fathers .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	12	Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem ( T ) will go and cry to the gods to whom they make offerings , ( U ) but they can not save them in the time of their trouble .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	13	( V ) For your gods have become as many as your cities , O Judah , and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame , ( W ) altars to make offerings to Baal .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	14	“ Therefore ( X ) do not pray for this people , or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf , ( Y ) for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	15	( Z ) What right has my beloved in my house , ( AA ) when she has done many vile deeds ? Can even sacrificial flesh avert your doom ? ( AB ) Can you then exult ?
ESV	Jeremiah	11	16	The Lord once called you ( AC ) ‘ a green olive tree , beautiful with good fruit. ’ But ( AD ) with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it , and ( AE ) its branches will be consumed .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	17	The Lord of hosts , ( AF ) who planted you , has decreed disaster against you , because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done , ( AG ) provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	11	18	The Lord made it known to me and I knew ; then you showed me their deeds .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	19	But I was ( AH ) like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter . I did not know ( AI ) it was against me they devised schemes , saying , “ Let us destroy the tree with its fruit , ( AJ ) let us cut him off from ( AK ) the land of the living , that his name be remembered no more. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	11	20	But , O Lord of hosts , who judges righteously , who ( AL ) tests ( AM ) the heart and the mind , ( AN ) let me see your vengeance upon them , for to you have I committed my cause .
ESV	Jeremiah	11	21	Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the men of ( AO ) Anathoth , ( AP ) who seek your life , and say , ( AQ ) “ Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord , or you will die by our hand ” —

ESV	Jeremiah	13	2	So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the Lord , and put it around my waist .
ESV	Jeremiah	13	3	And the word of the Lord came to me a second time ,
ESV	Jeremiah	13	4	“ Take the loincloth that you have bought , which is around your waist , and arise , ( B ) go to the Euphrates and hide it there in ( C ) a cleft of the rock. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates , as the Lord commanded me .
ESV	Jeremiah	13	6	And after many days the Lord said to me , “ Arise , go to the Euphrates , and take from there ( D ) the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there. ”

ESV	Jeremiah	14	2	( B ) “ Judah mourns , and ( C ) her gates languish ; her people lament on the ground , and ( D ) the cry of Jerusalem goes up .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	3	Her nobles send their servants for water ; they come to the cisterns ; they find no water ; they return with their vessels empty ; they are ( E ) ashamed and confounded and ( F ) cover their heads .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	4	Because of the ground that is dismayed , since there is ( G ) no rain on the land , the farmers are ashamed ; they cover their heads .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	5	Even ( H ) the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn because there is no grass .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	6	( I ) The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights ; they pant for air like jackals ; their eyes fail because there is no vegetation .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	7	“ Though our iniquities testify against us , act , O Lord , ( J ) for your name 's sake ; ( K ) for our backslidings are many ; ( L ) we have sinned against you .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	8	( M ) O you hope of Israel , its savior in time of trouble , why should you be like a stranger in the land , like a traveler who turns aside to tarry for a night ?
ESV	Jeremiah	14	9	Why should you be like a man confused , ( N ) like a mighty warrior who can not save ? Yet ( O ) you , O Lord , are in the midst of us , and ( P ) we are called by your name ; ( Q ) do not leave us. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	14	10	Thus says the Lord concerning this people : “ They have loved to wander thus ; they have not restrained their feet ; ( R ) therefore the Lord does not accept them ; ( S ) now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	14	11	The Lord said to me : ( T ) “ Do not pray for the welfare of this people .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	12	Though they fast , I will not hear their cry , ( U ) and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering , I will not accept them . But I will consume them ( V ) by the sword , by famine , and by pestilence. ” Lying Prophets
ESV	Jeremiah	14	13	Then I said : “ Ah , Lord God , behold , the prophets ( W ) say to them , ‘ You shall not see the sword , nor shall you have famine , but I will give you assured peace in this place. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	14	15	Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although ( AB ) I did not send them , and who say , ( AC ) ‘ Sword and famine shall not come upon this land ’ : ( AD ) By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem , victims of famine and sword , ( AE ) with none to bury them—them , their wives , their sons , and their daughters . For I will pour out their evil upon them .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	17	“ You shall say to them this word : ( AF ) ‘ Let my eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease , for the virgin ( AG ) daughter of my people is shattered with a great wound , ( AH ) with a very grievous blow .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	18	( AI ) If I go out into the field , behold , those pierced by the sword ! ( AJ ) And if I enter the city , behold , the diseases of famine ! ( AK ) For both prophet and priest ply their trade through the land and have no knowledge. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	14	19	( AL ) Have you utterly rejected Judah ? Does your soul loathe Zion ? Why have you struck us down ( AM ) so that there is no healing for us ? ( AN ) We looked for peace , but no good came ; ( AO ) for a time of healing , but behold , terror .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	20	( AP ) We acknowledge our wickedness , O Lord , and the iniquity of our fathers , ( AQ ) for we have sinned against you .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	21	Do not spurn us , ( AR ) for your name 's sake ; do not dishonor your glorious throne ; ( AS ) remember and do not break your covenant with us .
ESV	Jeremiah	14	22	Are there any among ( AT ) the false gods of the nations ( AU ) that can bring rain ? Or can the heavens give showers ? Are you not he , O Lord our God ? We set our hope on you , ( AV ) for you do all these things . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Jeremiah	15	15	( AD ) O Lord , you know ; ( AE ) remember me and visit me , ( AF ) ( AG ) and take vengeance for me on my persecutors . In your forbearance take me not away ; ( AH ) know that ( AI ) for your sake I bear reproach .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	2	And when they ask you , ‘ Where shall we go ? ’ you shall say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( E ) “ ‘ Those who are for pestilence , to pestilence , and those who are for the sword , to the sword ; those who are for famine , to famine , and those who are for captivity , to captivity. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	15	3	( F ) I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers , declares the Lord : the sword to kill , the dogs to tear , and ( G ) the birds of the air ( H ) and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	4	( I ) And I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what ( J ) Manasseh the son of Hezekiah , king of Judah , did in Jerusalem .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	5	( K ) “ Who will have pity on you , O Jerusalem , ( L ) or who will grieve for you ? Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare ?
ESV	Jeremiah	15	6	( M ) You have rejected me , declares the Lord ; ( N ) you keep going backward , so I have stretched out my hand against you and destroyed you— ( O ) I am weary of relenting .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	7	( P ) I have winnowed them with ( Q ) a winnowing fork in the gates of the land ; I have bereaved them ; I have destroyed my people ; ( R ) they did not turn from their ways .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	8	I have made their widows more in number than ( S ) the sand of the seas ; I have brought against the mothers of young men a destroyer at noonday ; I have made anguish and terror fall upon them suddenly .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	9	( T ) She who bore seven has grown feeble ; ( U ) she has fainted away ; ( V ) her sun went down while it was yet day ; she has been shamed and disgraced . And the rest of them I will give to the sword before their enemies , declares the Lord. ” Jeremiah 's Complaint
ESV	Jeremiah	15	10	( W ) Woe is me , my mother , that you bore me , a man of strife and contention to the whole land ! ( X ) I have not lent , nor have I borrowed , yet all of them curse me .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	11	The Lord said , “ Have I not [ a ] set you free for their good ? Have I not pleaded for you before the enemy in the time of trouble and in the time of distress ?
ESV	Jeremiah	15	12	Can one break iron , iron ( Y ) from the north , and bronze ?
ESV	Jeremiah	15	13	( Z ) “ Your wealth and your treasures I will give as ( AA ) spoil , without price , for all your sins , throughout all your territory .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	14	I will make you serve your enemies ( AB ) in a land that you do not know , ( AC ) for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	15	16	Your words were found , ( AJ ) and I ate them , and ( AK ) your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart , ( AL ) for I am called by your name , O Lord , God of hosts .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	17	( AM ) I did not sit in the company of revelers , nor did I rejoice ; ( AN ) I sat alone , because your hand was upon me , for you had filled me with indignation .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	18	Why is my pain unceasing , ( AO ) my wound incurable , refusing to be healed ? Will you be to me ( AP ) like a deceitful brook , like waters that fail ?
ESV	Jeremiah	15	19	Therefore thus says the Lord : ( AQ ) “ If you return , I will restore you , and you shall ( AR ) stand before me . If you utter what is precious , and not what is worthless , you shall be as my mouth . They shall turn to you , but you shall not turn to them .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	20	( AS ) And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze ; they will fight against you , ( AT ) but they shall not prevail over you , ( AU ) for I am with you to save you and deliver you , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	15	21	( AV ) I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked , and redeem you from the grasp of ( AW ) the ruthless. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 15:11 The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Jeremiah	16	16	“ Behold , ( Y ) I am sending for many fishers , declares the Lord , and they shall catch them . And afterward I will send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill , and out ( Z ) of the clefts of the rocks .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	2	“ You shall not take a wife , nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	3	For thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place , and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who fathered them in this land :
ESV	Jeremiah	16	4	( A ) They shall die of deadly diseases . ( B ) They shall not be lamented , nor shall they be buried . ( C ) They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground . ( D ) They shall perish by the sword and by famine , ( E ) and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	5	“ For thus says the Lord : ( F ) Do not enter the house of mourning , or go to lament or grieve for them , for I have taken away my peace from this people , my steadfast love and mercy , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	6	Both great and small shall die in this land . ( G ) They shall not be buried , and no one shall lament for them or ( H ) cut himself ( I ) or make himself bald for them .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	7	No one shall ( J ) break bread for the mourner , to comfort him for the dead , nor shall anyone give him the cup of consolation to drink for his father or his mother .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	8	You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them , to eat and drink .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	9	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ( K ) Behold , I will silence in this place , before your eyes and in your days , the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	10	“ And when you tell this people all these words , and they say to you , ( L ) ‘ Why has the Lord pronounced all this great evil against us ? What is our iniquity ? What is the sin that we have committed against the Lord our God ? ’
ESV	Jeremiah	16	11	then you shall say to them : ( M ) ‘ Because your fathers have forsaken me , declares the Lord , and ( N ) have gone after other gods and have served and worshiped them , and have forsaken me and have not kept my law ,
ESV	Jeremiah	16	12	and because ( O ) you have done worse than your fathers , for behold , ( P ) every one of you follows his stubborn , evil will , refusing to listen to me .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	13	Therefore ( Q ) I will hurl you out of this land into ( R ) a land that neither you nor your fathers have known , ( S ) and there you shall serve other gods day and night , for I will show you no favor. ’ The Lord Will Restore Israel
ESV	Jeremiah	16	14	( T ) “ Therefore , behold , the days are coming , declares the Lord , when it shall no longer be said , ( U ) ‘ As the Lord lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt , ’
ESV	Jeremiah	16	15	but ( V ) ‘ As the Lord lives who brought up the people of Israel ( W ) out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them. ’ For ( X ) I will bring them back to their own land that I gave to their fathers .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	17	For ( AA ) my eyes are on all their ways . ( AB ) They are not hidden from me , ( AC ) nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	18	But first ( AD ) I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin , because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable idols , and ( AE ) have filled my inheritance with their abominations. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	16	19	( AF ) O Lord , my strength and my stronghold , ( AG ) my refuge in the day of trouble , ( AH ) to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth and say : “ Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies , ( AI ) worthless things in which there is no profit .
ESV	Jeremiah	16	20	Can man make for himself ( AJ ) gods ? Such are not gods ! ”

ESV	Jeremiah	17	2	while ( D ) their children remember their altars and their ( E ) Asherim , ( F ) beside every green tree and on the high hills ,

ESV	Jeremiah	17	4	You shall loosen your hand from your heritage that I gave to you , ( I ) and I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know , ( J ) for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	17	5	Thus says the Lord : “ Cursed is the man ( K ) who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength , [ a ] whose heart turns away from the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	6	( L ) He is like a shrub in the desert , ( M ) and shall not see any good come . He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness , in ( N ) an uninhabited salt land .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	7	( O ) “ Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord , ( P ) whose trust is the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	8	( Q ) He is like a tree planted by water , that sends out its roots by the stream , and does not fear when heat comes , for its leaves remain green , and is not anxious in the year of drought , for it does not cease to bear fruit. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	17	9	The heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately sick ; who can understand it ?
ESV	Jeremiah	17	10	( R ) “ I the Lord search the heart ( S ) and test the mind , [ b ] ( T ) to give every man according to his ways , according to the fruit of his deeds. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	17	11	Like the ( U ) partridge that gathers a brood that she did not hatch , so is ( V ) he who gets riches but not by justice ; ( W ) in the midst of his days they will leave him , ( X ) and at his end he will be a fool .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	12	A glorious throne set on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	13	O Lord , ( Y ) the hope of Israel , ( Z ) all who forsake you shall be put to shame ; those who turn away from you [ c ] ( AA ) shall be written in the earth , for ( AB ) they have forsaken ( AC ) the Lord , the fountain of living water . Jeremiah Prays for Deliverance
ESV	Jeremiah	17	14	( AD ) Heal me , O Lord , and I shall be healed ; save me , and I shall be saved , for ( AE ) you are my praise .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	15	( AF ) Behold , they say to me , “ Where is the word of the Lord ? Let it come ! ”
ESV	Jeremiah	17	16	I have not run away from being your shepherd , nor have I desired the day of sickness . ( AG ) You know ( AH ) what came out of my lips ; it was before your face .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	18	( AJ ) Let those be put to shame who persecute me , but let me not be put to shame ; ( AK ) let them be dismayed , but let me not be dismayed ; ( AL ) bring upon them the day of disaster ; destroy them with double destruction ! Keep the Sabbath Holy
ESV	Jeremiah	17	19	Thus said the Lord to me : “ Go and stand in the People 's Gate , by which ( AM ) the kings of Judah enter and by which they go out , and in all the gates of Jerusalem ,
ESV	Jeremiah	17	20	and say : ‘ Hear the word of the Lord , ( AN ) you kings of Judah , and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , who enter by these gates .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	21	Thus says the Lord : Take care for the sake of your lives , and ( AO ) do not bear a burden on the Sabbath day or bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	22	And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath ( AP ) or do any work , but ( AQ ) keep the Sabbath day holy , as I commanded your fathers .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	23	Yet ( AR ) they did not listen or incline their ear , ( AS ) but stiffened their neck , that they ( AT ) might not hear and receive instruction .
ESV	Jeremiah	17	24	“ ‘ But if you listen to me , declares the Lord , and ( AU ) bring in no burden by the gates of this city on the Sabbath day , but ( AV ) keep the Sabbath day holy and do no work on it ,
ESV	Jeremiah	17	25	then ( AW ) there shall enter by the gates of this city kings and princes who sit on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , they and their officials , the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem . And this city shall be inhabited forever .

ESV	Jeremiah	17	27	But if you do not listen to me , to ( BF ) keep the Sabbath day holy , ( BG ) and not to bear a burden and enter by the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day , then I will ( BH ) kindle a fire in its gates , and it shall ( BI ) devour the palaces of Jerusalem and ( BJ ) shall not be quenched. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 17:5 Hebrew arm - Jeremiah 17:10 Hebrew kidneys - Jeremiah 17:13 Hebrew me The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Jeremiah	18	18	Then they said , ( AB ) “ Come , let us make plots against Jeremiah , ( AC ) for the law shall not perish from the priest , nor counsel from the wise , nor the word from the prophet . ( AD ) Come , let us strike him with the tongue , and let us not pay attention to any of his words. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	18	2	“ Arise , and go down to ( A ) the potter 's house , and there I will let you hear [ a ] my words. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	18	3	So I went down to ( B ) the potter 's house , and there he was working at his wheel .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	4	And the vessel he was making of clay was ( C ) spoiled in the potter 's hand , and ( D ) he reworked it into another vessel , as it seemed good to the potter to do .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	5	Then the word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Jeremiah	18	6	“ O house of Israel , ( E ) can I not do with you as this potter has done ? declares the Lord . ( F ) Behold , like the clay in the potter 's hand , so are you in my hand , O house of Israel .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	7	If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom , that I will ( G ) pluck up and break down and destroy it ,
ESV	Jeremiah	18	8	and if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , ( H ) turns from its evil , ( I ) I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	9	And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will ( J ) build and plant it ,
ESV	Jeremiah	18	10	and if it does evil in my sight , not listening to my voice , then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	11	Now , therefore , say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem : ‘ Thus says the Lord , Behold , I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you . ( K ) Return , every one from his evil way , and ( L ) amend your ways and your deeds. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	18	12	“ But they say , ( M ) ‘ That is in vain ! We will follow our own plans , and will every one act according to ( N ) the stubbornness of his evil heart. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	18	13	“ Therefore thus says the Lord : ( O ) Ask among the nations , Who has heard the like of this ? The virgin Israel has done ( P ) a very horrible thing .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	14	Does the snow of Lebanon leave the crags of Sirion ? [ b ] Do the mountain waters run dry , [ c ] the cold flowing streams ?
ESV	Jeremiah	18	15	( Q ) But my people have forgotten me ; they make offerings to ( R ) false gods ; they made them stumble in their ways , ( S ) in the ancient roads , and to walk into side roads , ( T ) not the highway ,
ESV	Jeremiah	18	16	making their land ( U ) a horror , a thing ( V ) to be hissed at forever . ( W ) Everyone who passes by it is horrified ( X ) and shakes his head .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	17	( Y ) Like the east wind ( Z ) I will scatter them before the enemy . ( AA ) I will show them my back , not my face , in the day of their calamity. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	18	19	Hear me , O Lord , and ( AE ) listen to the voice of my adversaries .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	20	( AF ) Should good be repaid with evil ? Yet ( AG ) they have dug a pit for my life . ( AH ) Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them , to turn away your wrath from them .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	21	Therefore ( AI ) deliver up their children to famine ; give them over to the power of the sword ; let their wives become childless ( AJ ) and widowed . May their men meet death by pestilence , their youths be struck down by the sword in battle .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	22	( AK ) May a cry be heard from their houses , when you bring the plunderer suddenly upon them ! For ( AL ) they have dug a pit to take me ( AM ) and laid snares for my feet .
ESV	Jeremiah	18	23	Yet ( AN ) you , O Lord , know all their plotting to kill me . ( AO ) Forgive not their iniquity , nor blot out their sin from your sight .

ESV	Jeremiah	19	19	Thus says the Lord , “ Go , buy ( A ) a potter 's earthenware ( B ) flask , and take some of ( C ) the elders of the people and some of ( D ) the elders of the priests ,
ESV	Jeremiah	19	2	and go out ( E ) to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate , and proclaim there the words that I tell you .
ESV	Jeremiah	19	3	You shall say , ( F ) ‘ Hear the word of the Lord , ( G ) O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem . Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I am bringing such disaster upon this place that ( H ) the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle .
ESV	Jeremiah	19	4	( I ) Because the people have forsaken me and have profaned this place by making offerings in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have known ; ( J ) and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents ,
ESV	Jeremiah	19	5	( K ) and have built the high places of Baal ( L ) to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal , ( M ) which I did not command or decree , nor did it come into my mind—
ESV	Jeremiah	19	6	therefore , ( N ) behold , days are coming , declares the Lord , when this place shall no more be called Topheth , or ( O ) the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , but the Valley of Slaughter .
ESV	Jeremiah	19	7	And in this place ( P ) I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem , ( Q ) and will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies , and by the hand of those who seek their life . ( R ) I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth .
ESV	Jeremiah	19	8	And I will make this city ( S ) a horror , ( T ) a thing to be hissed at . Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its wounds .
ESV	Jeremiah	19	9	( U ) And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters , and everyone shall eat the flesh of his neighbor ( V ) in the siege and in the distress , with which their enemies and those who seek their life afflict them. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	19	10	“ Then ( W ) you shall break ( X ) the flask in the sight of the men who go with you ,
ESV	Jeremiah	19	11	and shall say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts : So will I break this people and this city , ( Y ) as one breaks a potter 's vessel , ( Z ) so that it can never be mended . ( AA ) Men shall bury in Topheth because there will be no place else to bury .
ESV	Jeremiah	19	12	Thus will I do to this place , declares the Lord , and to its inhabitants , making this city ( AB ) like Topheth .
ESV	Jeremiah	19	13	The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah— ( AC ) all the houses on whose ( AD ) roofs offerings have been offered ( AE ) to all the host of heaven , and ( AF ) drink offerings have been poured out to other gods—shall be defiled ( AG ) like the place of Topheth. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	19	14	Then Jeremiah came from ( AH ) Topheth , where the Lord had sent him to prophesy , ( AI ) and he stood in the court of the Lord 's house and said to all the people :

ESV	Jeremiah	20	20	Now ( A ) Pashhur the priest , the son of ( B ) Immer , who was ( C ) chief officer in the house of the Lord , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things .
ESV	Jeremiah	20	2	Then ( D ) Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet , and put him ( E ) in the stocks that were in the upper ( F ) Benjamin Gate of the house of the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	20	3	The next day , when ( G ) Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks , Jeremiah said to him , “ The Lord does not call your name ( H ) Pashhur , but Terror on Every Side .
ESV	Jeremiah	20	4	For thus says the Lord : Behold , I will make you ( I ) a terror to yourself and to all your friends . They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on . And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon . He shall carry them captive to Babylon , and shall strike them down with the sword .
ESV	Jeremiah	20	5	Moreover , ( J ) I will give all the wealth of the city , all its gains , all its ( K ) prized belongings , and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies , who shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon .
ESV	Jeremiah	20	6	And you , ( L ) Pashhur , and all who dwell in your house , shall go into captivity . To Babylon you shall go , and there you shall die , and there you shall be buried , you and all your friends , ( M ) to whom you have prophesied falsely. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	20	7	O Lord , ( N ) you have deceived me , and I was deceived ; ( O ) you are stronger than I , and you have prevailed . ( P ) I have become a laughingstock all the day ; everyone mocks me .
ESV	Jeremiah	20	8	For whenever I speak , I cry out , I shout , ( Q ) “ Violence and destruction ! ” For ( R ) the word of the Lord has become for me ( S ) a reproach and ( T ) derision all day long .
ESV	Jeremiah	20	9	If I say , “ I will not mention him , or speak any more in his name , ” ( U ) there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones , and ( V ) I am weary with holding it in , and I can not .

ESV	Jeremiah	20	11	But ( AD ) the Lord is with me as a dread warrior ; therefore my persecutors will stumble ; ( AE ) they will not overcome me . ( AF ) They will be greatly shamed , for they will not succeed . Their ( AG ) eternal dishonor will never be forgotten .

ESV	Jeremiah	21	21	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , when King Zedekiah sent to him ( A ) Pashhur the son of Malchiah and ( B ) Zephaniah the priest , the son of ( C ) Maaseiah , saying ,
ESV	Jeremiah	21	2	( D ) “ Inquire of the Lord for us , ( E ) for Nebuchadnezzar [ a ] king of Babylon is making war against us . Perhaps the Lord will deal with us according to ( F ) all his wonderful deeds and will make him withdraw from us. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	21	3	Then Jeremiah said to them : “ Thus you shall say to Zedekiah ,
ESV	Jeremiah	21	4	‘ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : ( G ) Behold , I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls . ( H ) And I will bring them together into the midst of this city .
ESV	Jeremiah	21	5	I myself will fight against you ( I ) with outstretched hand and strong arm , ( J ) in anger and in fury and in great wrath .
ESV	Jeremiah	21	6	And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast . They shall die of a great pestilence .
ESV	Jeremiah	21	7	Afterward , declares the Lord , ( K ) I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people in this city who survive the pestilence , sword , and famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of their enemies , into the hand of those who seek their lives . He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword . ( L ) He shall not pity them or spare them or have compassion. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	21	8	“ And to this people you shall say : ( M ) ‘ Thus says the Lord : Behold , ( N ) I set before you the way of life and the way of death .
ESV	Jeremiah	21	9	He who stays in this city shall die ( O ) by the sword , by famine , and by pestilence , but he who goes out and ( P ) surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live ( Q ) and shall have his life as a prize of war .
ESV	Jeremiah	21	10	For ( R ) I have set my face against this city for harm and ( S ) not for good , declares the Lord : ( T ) it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire. ’ Message to the House of David
ESV	Jeremiah	21	11	“ And to the house of the king of Judah say , ‘ Hear the word of the Lord ,
ESV	Jeremiah	21	12	O house of David ! Thus says the Lord : ( U ) “ ‘ Execute justice ( V ) in the morning , and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed , ( W ) lest my wrath go forth like fire , and burn with none to quench it , because of your evil deeds. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	21	13	( X ) “ Behold , I am against you , O inhabitant of the valley , O rock of the plain , declares the Lord ; you who say , ( Y ) ‘ Who shall come down against us , or who shall enter our habitations ? ’

ESV	Jeremiah	22	22	( AL ) The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds , and ( AM ) your lovers shall go into captivity ; ( AN ) then you will be ashamed and confounded because of all your evil .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	2	and say , ( A ) ‘ Hear the word of the Lord , O king of Judah , who sits on the throne of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter these gates .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	3	Thus says the Lord : ( B ) Do justice and righteousness , and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed . And ( C ) do no wrong or violence ( D ) to the resident alien , ( E ) the fatherless , and the widow , nor ( F ) shed innocent blood in this place .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	4	For if you will indeed obey this word , ( G ) then there shall enter the gates of this house kings who sit on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , they and their servants and their people .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	5	But if you will not obey these words , I ( H ) swear by myself , declares the Lord , that ( I ) this house shall become a desolation .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	6	For thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah : “ ‘ You are like Gilead to me , like the summit of ( J ) Lebanon , yet surely I will make you a desert , ( K ) an uninhabited city . [ a ]
ESV	Jeremiah	22	7	( L ) I will prepare destroyers against you , each with his weapons , ( M ) and they shall cut down your choicest cedars and cast them into the fire .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	8	“ ‘ And many nations will pass by this city , and every man will say to his neighbor , ( N ) “ Why has the Lord dealt thus with this great city ? ”
ESV	Jeremiah	22	9	( O ) And they will answer , “ Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God and worshiped other gods and served them. ” ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	22	10	( P ) Weep not for him who is dead , nor grieve for him , ( Q ) but weep bitterly for him who goes away , for he shall return no more to see his native land . Message to the Sons of Josiah
ESV	Jeremiah	22	11	For thus says the Lord concerning Shallum the son of Josiah , king of Judah , who reigned instead of Josiah his father , and ( R ) who went away from this place : “ He shall return here no more ,
ESV	Jeremiah	22	12	but ( S ) in the place where they have carried him captive , there shall he die , and he shall never see this land again. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	22	13	( T ) “ Woe to him who builds his house by ( U ) unrighteousness , and his upper rooms by injustice , ( V ) who makes his neighbor serve him for nothing and does not give him his wages ,
ESV	Jeremiah	22	14	who says , ‘ I will build myself a great house with spacious upper rooms , ’ who cuts out windows for it , paneling it with cedar and ( W ) painting it with vermilion .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	15	Do you think you are a king because you compete in cedar ? Did not your father eat and drink and ( X ) do justice and righteousness ? ( Y ) Then it was well with him .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	16	( Z ) He judged the cause of the poor and needy ; ( AA ) then it was well . Is not this ( AB ) to know me ? declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	17	But you have eyes and heart only for your dishonest gain , ( AC ) for shedding innocent blood , and for practicing oppression and violence. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	22	18	Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah : ( AD ) “ They shall not lament for him , saying , ( AE ) ‘ Ah , my brother ! ’ or ‘ Ah , sister ! ’ They shall not lament for him , saying , ( AF ) ‘ Ah , lord ! ’ or ‘ Ah , his majesty ! ’
ESV	Jeremiah	22	19	With the burial of a donkey ( AG ) he shall be buried , dragged and dumped beyond the gates of Jerusalem. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	22	20	“ Go up to Lebanon , and cry out , and lift up your voice in Bashan ; cry out from ( AH ) Abarim , for all ( AI ) your lovers are destroyed .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	21	I spoke to you in your prosperity , but you said , ‘ I will not listen. ’ ( AJ ) This has been your way from ( AK ) your youth , that you have not obeyed my voice .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	23	O inhabitant of ( AO ) Lebanon , nested among the cedars , how you will be pitied when pangs come upon you , ( AP ) pain as of a woman in labor ! ”
ESV	Jeremiah	22	24	( AQ ) “ As I live , declares the Lord , though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , were ( AR ) the signet ring on my right hand , yet I would tear you off
ESV	Jeremiah	22	25	and ( AS ) give you ( AT ) into the hand of those who seek your life , into the hand of those of whom you are afraid , even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	26	( AU ) I will hurl you and ( AV ) the mother who bore you into another country , where you were not born , and there you shall die .
ESV	Jeremiah	22	27	But to the land to which they will long to return , there they shall not return. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	22	28	Is this man ( AW ) Coniah a despised , broken pot , a ( AX ) vessel no one cares for ? Why are he and his children hurled and cast into a ( AY ) land that they do not know ?

ESV	Jeremiah	23	23	( BA ) “ Am I a God at hand , declares the Lord , and not a God far away ?
ESV	Jeremiah	23	2	Therefore thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , concerning ( B ) the shepherds who care for my people : “ You have scattered my flock and have driven them away , and you have not attended to them . ( C ) Behold , I will attend to you for your evil deeds , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	3	( D ) Then I will gather the remnant of my flock ( E ) out of all the countries where I have driven them , and I will bring them back to their fold , ( F ) and they shall be fruitful and multiply .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	4	( G ) I will set shepherds over them who will care for them , and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall any be missing , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	5	( H ) “ Behold , the days are coming , declares the Lord , when I will raise up for David a righteous ( I ) Branch , and ( J ) he shall reign as king and deal wisely , and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	6	In his days Judah will be saved , and ( K ) Israel will ( L ) dwell securely . And this is the name by which he will be called : ( M ) ‘ The Lord is our righteousness. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	23	7	( N ) “ Therefore , behold , the days are coming , declares the Lord , when they shall no longer say , ‘ As the Lord lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt , ’
ESV	Jeremiah	23	8	but ‘ As the Lord lives who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he [ a ] had driven them. ’ Then they shall dwell in their own land. ” Lying Prophets
ESV	Jeremiah	23	9	Concerning the prophets : ( O ) My heart is broken within me ; ( P ) all my bones shake ; I am like a drunken man , like a man overcome by wine , because of the Lord and because of his holy words .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	10	( Q ) For the land is full of adulterers ; ( R ) because of the curse ( S ) the land mourns , and ( T ) the pastures of the wilderness are dried up . ( U ) Their course is evil , and their might is not right .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	11	( V ) “ Both prophet and priest are ungodly ; even ( W ) in my house I have found their evil , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	12	( X ) Therefore their way shall be to them like slippery paths ( Y ) in the darkness , into which they shall be driven and fall , for I will bring disaster upon them ( Z ) in the year of their punishment , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	13	In the prophets of ( AA ) Samaria ( AB ) I saw an unsavory thing : ( AC ) they prophesied by Baal ( AD ) and led my people Israel astray .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	14	But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing : ( AE ) they commit adultery and walk in lies ; ( AF ) they strengthen the hands of evildoers , so that no one turns from his evil ; ( AG ) all of them have become like Sodom to me , ( AH ) and its inhabitants like Gomorrah. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	23	15	Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets : ( AI ) “ Behold , I will feed them with bitter food ( AJ ) and give them ( AK ) poisoned water to drink , for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	23	16	Thus says the Lord of hosts : “ Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you , ( AL ) filling you with vain hopes . ( AM ) They speak visions of their own minds , not from the mouth of the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	17	They say continually to those who despise the word of the Lord , ( AN ) ‘ It shall be well with you ’ ; and to everyone who ( AO ) stubbornly follows his own heart , they say , ( AP ) ‘ No disaster shall come upon you. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	23	18	For ( AQ ) who among them has stood in the council of the Lord to see and to hear his word , or who has paid attention to his word and listened ?
ESV	Jeremiah	23	19	( AR ) Behold , the storm of the Lord ! Wrath has gone forth , ( AS ) a whirling tempest ; it will burst upon the head of the wicked .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	20	( AT ) The anger of the Lord will not turn back until he has executed and ( AU ) accomplished the intents of his heart . ( AV ) In the latter days you will understand it clearly .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	21	( AW ) “ I did not send the prophets , yet they ran ; I did not speak to them , yet they prophesied .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	22	( AX ) But if they had stood in my council , then they would have proclaimed my words to my people , ( AY ) and they would have turned them from their evil way , and ( AZ ) from the evil of their deeds .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	24	( BB ) Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I can not see him ? declares the Lord . ( BC ) Do I not fill heaven and earth ? declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	25	I have heard what the prophets have said ( BD ) who prophesy lies in my name , saying , ( BE ) ‘ I have dreamed , I have dreamed ! ’
ESV	Jeremiah	23	26	How long shall there be lies in the heart of ( BF ) the prophets who prophesy lies , and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart ,
ESV	Jeremiah	23	27	who think to make my people forget my name ( BG ) by their dreams that they tell one another , even as their ( BH ) fathers forgot my name for Baal ?
ESV	Jeremiah	23	28	( BI ) Let the prophet who has a dream ( BJ ) tell the dream , but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully . ( BK ) What has straw in common with wheat ? declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	29	( BL ) Is not my word like fire , declares the Lord , and ( BM ) like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces ?
ESV	Jeremiah	23	30	( BN ) Therefore , behold , I am against the prophets , declares the Lord , who steal my words from one another .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	31	Behold , I am against the prophets , declares the Lord , who use their tongues and declare , ‘ declares the Lord. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	23	32	Behold , I am against those who prophesy lying dreams , declares the Lord , and who tell them and ( BO ) lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness , when ( BP ) I did not send them or charge them . So they do not profit this people at all , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	33	( BQ ) “ When one of this people , or a prophet or a priest asks you , ‘ What is the burden of the Lord ? ’ you shall say to them , ‘ You are the burden , [ b ] and ( BR ) I will cast you off , declares the Lord. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	23	34	And as for the prophet , priest , or one of the people who says , ‘ The burden of the Lord , ’ ( BS ) I will punish that man and his household .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	35	Thus shall you say , every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother , ‘ What has the Lord answered ? ’ or ‘ What has the Lord spoken ? ’
ESV	Jeremiah	23	36	But ‘ the burden of the Lord ’ you shall mention no more , for the burden is every man 's own word , and ( BT ) you pervert the words of ( BU ) the living God , the Lord of hosts , our God .
ESV	Jeremiah	23	37	Thus you shall say to the prophet , ‘ What has the Lord answered you ? ’ or ‘ What has the Lord spoken ? ’
ESV	Jeremiah	23	38	But if you say , ‘ The burden of the Lord , ’ thus says the Lord , ‘ Because you have said these words , “ The burden of the Lord , ” when I sent to you , saying , “ You shall not say , ‘ The burden of the Lord , ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	23	39	therefore , behold , I will surely lift you up [ c ] and ( BV ) cast you away from my presence , you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers .

ESV	Jeremiah	24	24	( A ) After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem ( B ) Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , together with ( C ) the officials of Judah , the craftsmen , and the metal workers , and had brought them to Babylon , the Lord showed me this vision : behold , ( D ) two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	24	2	One basket had very good figs , ( E ) like first-ripe figs , but the other basket had ( F ) very bad figs , so bad that they could not be eaten .
ESV	Jeremiah	24	3	And the Lord said to me , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” I said , “ Figs , the good figs very good , and the bad figs very bad , so bad that they can not be eaten. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	24	4	Then the word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Jeremiah	24	5	“ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : Like these good figs , so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah , ( G ) whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans .
ESV	Jeremiah	24	6	( H ) I will set my eyes on them for good , and I will bring them back to this land . ( I ) I will build them up , and not tear them down ; ( J ) I will plant them , and not pluck them up .
ESV	Jeremiah	24	7	( K ) I will give them a heart to know that I am the Lord , ( L ) and they shall be my people ( M ) and I will be their God , ( N ) for they shall return to me with their whole heart .
ESV	Jeremiah	24	8	“ But thus says the Lord : Like ( O ) the bad figs that are so bad they can not be eaten , so will I treat ( P ) Zedekiah the king of Judah , his officials , the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land , and those who ( Q ) dwell in the land of Egypt .
ESV	Jeremiah	24	9	I will make them ( R ) a horror [ a ] to all the kingdoms of the earth , to be ( S ) a reproach , ( T ) a byword , ( U ) a taunt , and ( V ) a curse in all the places where I shall drive them .

I will devote them to destruction , ( R ) and make them a horror , a hissing , and an everlasting desolation .
ESV	Jeremiah	25	10	Moreover , ( S ) I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , ( T ) the grinding of the millstones and ( U ) the light of the lamp .

ESV	Jeremiah	26	26	( A ) In the beginning of the reign of ( B ) Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , this word came from the Lord :
ESV	Jeremiah	26	2	“ Thus says the Lord : ( C ) Stand in the court of the Lord 's house , and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the Lord ( D ) all the words that I command you to speak to them ; ( E ) do not hold back a word .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	3	( F ) It may be they will listen , and every one turn from his evil way , ( G ) that I may relent of the disaster that I intend to do to them ( H ) because of their evil deeds .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	4	You shall say to them , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( I ) If you will not listen to me , to walk in my law that I have set before you ,
ESV	Jeremiah	26	5	( J ) and to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you ( K ) urgently , ( L ) though you have not listened ,
ESV	Jeremiah	26	6	then I will make this house ( M ) like Shiloh , and I will make this city ( N ) a curse for all the nations of the earth. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	26	7	( O ) The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	8	And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people , then ( P ) the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him , saying , “ You shall die !
ESV	Jeremiah	26	9	Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord , saying , ‘ This house shall be ( Q ) like Shiloh , and this city shall be desolate , ( R ) without inhabitant ’ ? ” And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	10	When ( S ) the officials of Judah heard these things , they came up from the king 's house to the house of the Lord and took their seat in the ( T ) entry of the New Gate of the house of the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	11	Then ( U ) the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people , ( V ) “ This man deserves the sentence of death , because he has prophesied against this city , as you have heard with your own ears. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	26	12	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people , saying , “ The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	13	Now therefore ( W ) mend your ways and your deeds , ( X ) and obey the voice of the Lord your God , ( Y ) and the Lord will relent of the disaster that he has pronounced against you .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	14	( Z ) But as for me , behold , I am in your hands . Do with me as seems good and right to you .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	15	Only know for certain that if you put me to death , ( AA ) you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants , for in truth the Lord sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears. ” Jeremiah Spared from Death
ESV	Jeremiah	26	16	( AB ) Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets , ( AC ) “ This man does not deserve the sentence of death , for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	26	17	( AD ) And certain of ( AE ) the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled people , saying ,
ESV	Jeremiah	26	18	“ Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah , and said to all the people of Judah : ‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts , ( AF ) “ ‘ Zion shall be plowed as a field ; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins , and the mountain of the house a wooded height. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	26	19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death ? ( AG ) Did he not fear the Lord and entreat the favor of the Lord , ( AH ) and did not the Lord relent of the disaster that he had pronounced against them ? ( AI ) But we are about to bring great disaster upon ourselves. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	26	20	There was another man who prophesied in the name of the Lord , Uriah the son of Shemaiah from ( AJ ) Kiriath-jearim . He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like those of Jeremiah .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	21	And when ( AK ) King Jehoiakim , with all his warriors and all the officials , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death . But when Uriah heard of it , he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	22	Then ( AL ) King Jehoiakim sent to Egypt certain men , ( AM ) Elnathan the son of ( AN ) Achbor and others with him ,
ESV	Jeremiah	26	23	and they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim , ( AO ) who struck him down with the sword and dumped his dead body into the burial place of the common people .
ESV	Jeremiah	26	24	But the hand of ( AP ) Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over to the people to be put to death . The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Jeremiah	27	27	In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah [ a ] the son of Josiah , king of Judah , this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	2	Thus the Lord said to me : ( A ) “ Make yourself straps and ( B ) yoke-bars , and put them on your neck .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	3	Send word [ b ] to the king of ( C ) Edom , the king of ( D ) Moab , the king of the sons of ( E ) Ammon , the king of ( F ) Tyre , and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	4	Give them this charge for their masters : ‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : This is what you shall say to your masters :
ESV	Jeremiah	27	5	“ It is I who ( G ) by my great power and my outstretched arm ( H ) have made the earth , with the men and animals that are on the earth , ( I ) and I give it to whomever it seems right to me .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	6	( J ) Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , ( K ) my servant , ( L ) and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	7	( M ) All the nations shall serve him and ( N ) his son and ( O ) his grandson , ( P ) until the time of his own land comes . ( Q ) Then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	8	“ ‘ “ But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , ( R ) and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon , I will punish that nation ( S ) with the sword , with famine , and with pestilence , declares the Lord , until I have consumed it by his hand .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	9	So ( T ) do not listen to your ( U ) prophets , your diviners , your dreamers , your ( V ) fortune-tellers , or your sorcerers , who are saying to you , ‘ You shall not serve the king of Babylon. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	27	10	( W ) For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you , with the result that you will be removed far from your land , and I will drive you out , and you will perish .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	11	( X ) But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him , I will leave on its own land , to work it and dwell there , declares the Lord. ” ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	27	12	To ( Y ) Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner : ( Z ) “ Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon , and ( AA ) serve him and his people and live .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	13	( AB ) Why will you and your people die ( AC ) by the sword , by famine , and by pestilence , ( AD ) as the Lord has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
ESV	Jeremiah	27	14	( AE ) Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you , ‘ You shall not serve the king of Babylon , ’ ( AF ) for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	15	I have not sent them , declares the Lord , but ( AG ) they are prophesying falsely in my name , with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish , you and the prophets who are prophesying to you. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	27	16	Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people , saying , “ Thus says the Lord : ( AH ) Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you , saying , ( AI ) ‘ Behold , the vessels of the Lord 's house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon , ’ ( AJ ) for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	17	( AK ) Do not listen to them ; ( AL ) serve the king of Babylon and live . Why should this city ( AM ) become a desolation ?
ESV	Jeremiah	27	18	If they are prophets , and if the word of the Lord is with them , then ( AN ) let them intercede with the Lord of hosts , ( AO ) that the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord , in the house of the king of Judah , and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon .
ESV	Jeremiah	27	19	( AP ) For thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars , the sea , the stands , and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city ,
ESV	Jeremiah	27	20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away , ( AQ ) when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—
ESV	Jeremiah	27	21	thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , ( AR ) concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord , in the house of the king of Judah , and in Jerusalem :
ESV	Jeremiah	27	22	( AS ) They shall be carried to Babylon ( AT ) and remain there ( AU ) until the day when I visit them , declares the Lord . ( AV ) Then I will bring them back ( AW ) and restore them to this place. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 27:1 Or Jehoiakim - Jeremiah 27:3 Hebrew Send them The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Jeremiah	28	28	In that same year , at the beginning of the reign of ( A ) Zedekiah king of Judah , in the fifth month of the fourth year , Hananiah the son of ( B ) Azzur , the prophet from ( C ) Gibeon , spoke to me in the house of the Lord , in the presence of the priests and all the people , saying ,
ESV	Jeremiah	28	2	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ( D ) I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon .
ESV	Jeremiah	28	3	( E ) Within ( F ) two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon .
ESV	Jeremiah	28	4	I will also bring back to this place ( G ) Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon , declares the Lord , ( H ) for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	28	5	Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord ,
ESV	Jeremiah	28	6	and the prophet Jeremiah said , ( I ) “ Amen ! May the Lord do so ; may the Lord make the words that you have prophesied come true , and bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the house of the Lord , and all the exiles .
ESV	Jeremiah	28	7	Yet hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people .
ESV	Jeremiah	28	8	( J ) The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war , famine , and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms .
ESV	Jeremiah	28	9	( K ) As for the prophet who prophesies peace , when the word of that prophet comes to pass , then it will be known that the Lord has truly sent the prophet. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	28	10	Then the prophet Hananiah took the ( L ) yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke them .
ESV	Jeremiah	28	11	And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people , saying , ( M ) “ Thus says the Lord : ( N ) Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of ( O ) all the nations within two years. ” But Jeremiah the prophet went his way .
ESV	Jeremiah	28	12	Sometime after the prophet ( P ) Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet , the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ESV	Jeremiah	28	13	“ Go , tell Hananiah , ‘ Thus says the Lord : You have broken wooden bars , but you have made in their place bars of iron .
ESV	Jeremiah	28	14	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : I have put upon the neck of all these nations ( Q ) an iron yoke to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , ( R ) and they shall serve him , ( S ) for I have given to him even the beasts of the field. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	28	15	And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah , “ Listen , Hananiah , ( T ) the Lord has not sent you , ( U ) and you have made this people trust in a lie .
ESV	Jeremiah	28	16	Therefore thus says the Lord : ‘ Behold , I will remove you from the face of the earth . This year you shall die , ( V ) because you have uttered rebellion against the Lord. ’ ”

ESV	Jeremiah	29	29	( AZ ) Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	2	This was after ( E ) King Jeconiah and the queen mother , the eunuchs , the officials of Judah and Jerusalem , the craftsmen , and the metal workers had departed from Jerusalem .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	3	The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of ( F ) Shaphan and Gemariah the son of ( G ) Hilkiah , whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . It said :
ESV	Jeremiah	29	4	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon :
ESV	Jeremiah	29	5	( H ) Build houses and live in them ; plant gardens and eat their produce .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	6	Take wives and have sons and daughters ; take wives for your sons , and give your daughters in marriage , that they may bear sons and daughters ; multiply there , and do not decrease .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	7	But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile , and ( I ) pray to the Lord on its behalf , for in its welfare you will find your welfare .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	8	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ( J ) Do not let your prophets and ( K ) your diviners who are among you deceive you , and do not listen to the dreams that they dream , [ a ]
ESV	Jeremiah	29	9	for ( L ) it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name ; ( M ) I did not send them , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	10	“ For thus says the Lord : ( N ) When seventy years are completed for Babylon , ( O ) I will visit you , ( P ) and I will fulfill to you my promise ( Q ) and bring you back to this place .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	11	( R ) For I know the plans I have for you , declares the Lord , plans for welfare [ b ] and not for evil , ( S ) to give you a future and a hope .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	12	( T ) Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me , ( U ) and I will hear you .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	13	( V ) You will seek me and find me , when you seek me ( W ) with all your heart .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	14	I will be found by you , declares the Lord , ( X ) and I will restore your fortunes and ( Y ) gather you from all the nations and all the places ( Z ) where I have driven you , declares the Lord , and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	15	“ Because you have said , ‘ The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon , ’
ESV	Jeremiah	29	16	thus says the Lord concerning ( AA ) the king who sits on the throne of David , and concerning all the people who dwell in this city , your kinsmen who did not go out with you into exile :
ESV	Jeremiah	29	17	‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts , behold , I am sending on them ( AB ) sword , famine , and pestilence , and I will make them like ( AC ) vile figs that are so rotten they can not be eaten .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	18	I will pursue them with ( AD ) sword , famine , and pestilence , ( AE ) and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth , ( AF ) to be a curse , a terror , a hissing , and a reproach among all the nations ( AG ) where I have driven them ,
ESV	Jeremiah	29	19	because they did not pay attention to my words , declares the Lord , ( AH ) that I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets , but you would not listen , declares the Lord. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	29	20	Hear the word of the Lord , all you exiles ( AI ) whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon :
ESV	Jeremiah	29	21	‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah , ( AJ ) who are prophesying a lie to you in my name : Behold , I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he shall strike them down before your eyes .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	22	( AK ) Because of them ( AL ) this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon : “ The Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab , ( AM ) whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire , ”
ESV	Jeremiah	29	23	because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel , ( AN ) they have committed adultery with their neighbors ' wives , and ( AO ) they have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them . ( AP ) I am the one who knows , ( AQ ) and I am witness , declares the Lord. ’ ” Shemaiah 's False Prophecy
ESV	Jeremiah	29	24	To ( AR ) Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say :
ESV	Jeremiah	29	25	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem , and to ( AS ) Zephaniah the son of ( AT ) Maaseiah the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
ESV	Jeremiah	29	26	‘ The Lord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest , to have ( AU ) charge in the house of the Lord ( AV ) over every madman who prophesies , to put him in ( AW ) the stocks and neck irons .
ESV	Jeremiah	29	27	Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah ( AX ) of Anathoth who is prophesying to you ?
ESV	Jeremiah	29	28	For he has sent to us in Babylon , saying , “ Your exile will be long ; ( AY ) build houses and live in them , and plant gardens and eat their produce. ” ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	29	30	( BA ) Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ESV	Jeremiah	29	31	“ Send to all the exiles , saying , ‘ Thus says the Lord concerning ( BB ) Shemaiah of Nehelam : Because ( BC ) Shemaiah had prophesied to you ( BD ) when I did not send him , and has made you trust in a lie ,
ESV	Jeremiah	29	32	therefore thus says the Lord : Behold , I will punish ( BE ) Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants . He shall not have anyone living among this people , ( BF ) and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people , declares the Lord , ( BG ) for he has spoken rebellion against the Lord. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 29:8 Hebrew your dreams , which you cause to dream - Jeremiah 29:11 Or peace The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Jeremiah	30	30	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord :
ESV	Jeremiah	30	2	“ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : ( A ) Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	3	( B ) For behold , days are coming , declares the Lord , ( C ) when I will restore ( D ) the fortunes of my people , ( E ) Israel and Judah , says the Lord , ( F ) and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers , and they shall take possession of it. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	30	4	These are the words that the Lord spoke concerning ( G ) Israel and Judah :
ESV	Jeremiah	30	5	“ Thus says the Lord : We have heard a cry of panic , of terror , and no peace .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	6	Ask now , and see , can a man bear a child ? ( H ) Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach ( I ) like a woman in labor ? ( J ) Why has every face turned pale ?
ESV	Jeremiah	30	7	Alas ! ( K ) That day is so great ( L ) there is none like it ; it is a time of distress for Jacob ; yet he shall be saved out of it .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	8	“ And it shall come to pass in that day , declares the Lord of hosts , that I will ( M ) break his ( N ) yoke from off your neck , and I will ( O ) burst your bonds , ( P ) and foreigners shall no more make a servant of him . [ a ]
ESV	Jeremiah	30	9	But they shall serve the Lord their God and ( Q ) David their king , whom I will raise up for them .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	10	( R ) “ Then fear not , ( S ) O Jacob my servant , declares the Lord , nor be dismayed , O Israel ; for behold , ( T ) I will save you from far away , ( U ) and your offspring from the land of their captivity . ( V ) Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease , and none shall make him afraid .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	11	( W ) For I am with you to save you , declares the Lord ; ( X ) I will make a full end of all the nations among whom I scattered you , but of you I will not make a full end . ( Y ) I will ( Z ) discipline you in just measure , and I will by no means leave you unpunished .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	12	“ For thus says the Lord : ( AA ) Your hurt is incurable , ( AB ) and your wound is grievous .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	13	There is none to uphold your cause , no medicine for your wound , ( AC ) no healing for you .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	14	( AD ) All your lovers have forgotten you ; they care nothing for you ; for I have dealt you the blow of ( AE ) an enemy , the punishment ( AF ) of a merciless foe , because your guilt is great , ( AG ) because your sins are flagrant .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	15	( AH ) Why do you cry out over your hurt ? ( AI ) Your pain is incurable . Because your guilt is great , ( AJ ) because your sins are flagrant , I have done these things to you .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	16	( AK ) Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured , and ( AL ) all your foes , every one of them , shall go into captivity ; ( AM ) those who plunder you shall be plundered , ( AN ) and all who prey on you I will make a prey .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	17	( AO ) For I will restore ( AP ) health to you , and ( AQ ) your wounds I will heal , declares the Lord , because ( AR ) they have called you an outcast : ( AS ) ‘ It is Zion , for whom no one cares ! ’
ESV	Jeremiah	30	18	“ Thus says the Lord : Behold , ( AT ) I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and have compassion on his dwellings ; the city shall be rebuilt on ( AU ) its mound , and the palace shall stand where it used to be .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	19	( AV ) Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving , and the voices of those who celebrate . ( AW ) I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will make them honored , and they shall not be small .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	20	( AX ) Their children shall be as they were of old , and their congregation shall be established before me , and I will punish all who oppress them .
ESV	Jeremiah	30	21	( AY ) Their prince shall be one of themselves ; ( AZ ) their ruler shall come out from their midst ; ( BA ) I will make him draw near , and he shall approach me , ( BB ) for who would dare of himself to approach me ? declares the Lord .

ESV	Jeremiah	30	23	( BD ) Behold ( BE ) the storm of the Lord ! Wrath has gone forth , a whirling tempest ; it will burst upon the head of the wicked .

ESV	Jeremiah	31	3	the Lord appeared to him [ a ] from far away . ( D ) I have loved you with an everlasting love ; therefore ( E ) I have continued ( F ) my faithfulness to you .

ESV	Jeremiah	31	7	For thus says the Lord : ( M ) “ Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob , and raise shouts for ( N ) the chief of the nations ; proclaim , give praise , and say , ( O ) ‘ O Lord , save your people , the remnant of Israel. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	31	8	Behold , I will bring them ( P ) from the north country and ( Q ) gather them from ( R ) the farthest parts of the earth , among them ( S ) the blind and the lame , the pregnant woman and she who is in labor , together ; a great company , they shall return here .
ESV	Jeremiah	31	9	( T ) With weeping they shall come , ( U ) and with pleas for mercy I will lead them back , I will make them ( V ) walk by brooks of water , ( W ) in a straight path in which they shall not stumble , for ( X ) I am a father to Israel , and Ephraim is ( Y ) my firstborn .
ESV	Jeremiah	31	10	“ Hear the word of the Lord , O nations , and declare it in the coastlands far away ; say , ‘ He who scattered Israel will ( Z ) gather him , and will keep him ( AA ) as a shepherd keeps his flock. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	31	11	( AB ) For the Lord has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from ( AC ) hands too strong for him .
ESV	Jeremiah	31	12	They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion , ( AD ) and they shall be radiant ( AE ) over the goodness of the Lord , ( AF ) over the grain , the wine , and the oil , and over the young of the flock and the herd ; ( AG ) their life shall be like a watered garden , ( AH ) and they shall languish no more .
ESV	Jeremiah	31	13	( AI ) Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance , and the young men and the old shall be merry . ( AJ ) I will turn their mourning into joy ; I will comfort them , and give them gladness for sorrow .

ESV	Jeremiah	31	15	Thus says the Lord : ( AL ) “ A voice is heard in ( AM ) Ramah , lamentation and bitter weeping . ( AN ) Rachel is weeping for her children ; she refuses to be comforted for her children , ( AO ) because they are no more. ”

ESV	Jeremiah	31	22	( BC ) How long will you waver , ( BD ) O faithless daughter ? For the Lord has created a new thing on the earth : a woman encircles a man. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	31	23	Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Once more they shall use these words in the land of Judah and in its cities , ( BE ) when I restore their fortunes :
ESV	Jeremiah	31	24	( BI ) And Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together , and ( BJ ) the farmers and those who wander with their flocks .
ESV	Jeremiah	31	25	For I will ( BK ) satisfy the weary soul , and every languishing soul I will replenish. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	31	26	At this I awoke and looked , and my sleep was pleasant to me .
ESV	Jeremiah	31	27	( BL ) “ Behold , the days are coming , declares the Lord , when ( BM ) I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with ( BN ) the seed of man and the seed of beast .

ESV	Jeremiah	31	29	In those days they shall no longer say : ( BS ) “ ‘ The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	31	30	( BT ) But everyone shall die for his own iniquity . Each man who eats sour grapes , his teeth shall be set on edge . The New Covenant
ESV	Jeremiah	31	32	not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when ( BW ) I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt , my covenant that they broke , ( BX ) though I was their husband , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	31	33	( BY ) For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , declares the Lord : ( BZ ) I will put my law within them , and I will write it ( CA ) on their hearts . ( CB ) And I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
ESV	Jeremiah	31	34	And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother , saying , ‘ Know the Lord , ’ ( CC ) for they shall all know me , ( CD ) from the least of them to the greatest , declares the Lord . For ( CE ) I will forgive their iniquity , and ( CF ) I will remember their sin no more. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	31	35	Thus says the Lord , who ( CG ) gives the sun for light by day and ( CH ) the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night , who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar— ( CI ) the Lord of hosts is his name :
ESV	Jeremiah	31	36	( CJ ) “ If this fixed order departs from before me , declares the Lord , then shall the offspring of Israel cease from being a nation before me forever. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	31	37	Thus says the Lord : “ If the heavens above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth below can be explored , ( CK ) then I will cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done , declares the Lord. ”

ESV	Jeremiah	32	2	At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem , and Jeremiah the prophet ( C ) was shut up in ( D ) the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him , saying , “ Why do you prophesy and say , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( E ) Behold , I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall capture it ;

ESV	Jeremiah	32	6	Jeremiah said , “ The word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Jeremiah	32	7	Behold , Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say , ( J ) ‘ Buy my field that is at ( K ) Anathoth , ( L ) for the right of redemption by purchase is yours. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	32	8	Then Hanamel my cousin came to me in ( M ) the court of the guard , in accordance with the word of the Lord , and said to me , ‘ Buy my field that is at ( N ) Anathoth in the land of Benjamin , for the right of possession and redemption is yours ; buy it for yourself. ’ Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	9	“ And I bought the field at ( O ) Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin , and ( P ) weighed out the money to him , seventeen shekels of silver .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	10	( Q ) I signed the deed , ( R ) sealed it , ( S ) got witnesses , and ( T ) weighed the money on scales .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	11	Then I took the sealed deed of purchase , containing the terms and conditions and the open copy .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	12	And I gave the deed of purchase to ( U ) Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah , in the presence of Hanamel my cousin , in the presence of ( V ) the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase , and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in ( W ) the court of the guard .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	13	I charged ( X ) Baruch in their presence , saying ,
ESV	Jeremiah	32	14	‘ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Take these deeds , both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed , and put them in an earthenware vessel , that they may last for a long time .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	15	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Houses and ( Y ) fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land. ’ Jeremiah Prays for Understanding
ESV	Jeremiah	32	16	“ After I had given the deed of purchase to ( Z ) Baruch the son of Neriah , I prayed to the Lord , saying :

ESV	Jeremiah	32	19	( AI ) great in counsel and ( AJ ) mighty in deed , ( AK ) whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of man , ( AL ) rewarding each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	20	You have shown ( AM ) signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , and to this day in Israel and among all mankind , ( AN ) and have made a name for yourself , as at this day .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	21	( AO ) You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders , with a strong hand and ( AP ) outstretched arm , ( AQ ) and with great terror .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	22	And you gave them this land , ( AR ) which you swore to their fathers to give them , ( AS ) a land flowing with milk and honey .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	23	And they entered and took possession of it . ( AT ) But they did not obey your voice or walk in your law . They did nothing of all you commanded them to do . Therefore you have made all this disaster come upon them .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	24	Behold , ( AU ) the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it , and ( AV ) because of sword and famine and pestilence ( AW ) the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it . What you spoke has come to pass , and behold , you see it .

ESV	Jeremiah	32	30	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight ( BH ) from their youth . The children of Israel have done nothing but ( BI ) provoke me to anger ( BJ ) by the work of their hands , declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	31	This city has aroused my anger and wrath , from the day it was built to this day , ( BK ) so that I will remove it from my sight
ESV	Jeremiah	32	33	( BM ) They have turned to me their back and not their face . And though I have taught them ( BN ) persistently , they have not listened ( BO ) to receive instruction .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	34	They set up ( BP ) their abominations in the house that is called by my name , to defile it .
ESV	Jeremiah	32	35	They built the high places of Baal ( BQ ) in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , ( BR ) to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech , ( BS ) though I did not command them , nor did it enter into my mind , that they should do ( BT ) this abomination , ( BU ) to cause Judah to sin .

ESV	Jeremiah	33	33	The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time , while he was still ( A ) shut up in the court of the guard :
ESV	Jeremiah	33	2	“ Thus says ( B ) the Lord who made the earth , [ a ] the Lord who formed it to establish it— ( C ) the Lord is his name :
ESV	Jeremiah	33	3	( D ) Call to me and I will answer you , ( E ) and will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known .
ESV	Jeremiah	33	4	For thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to make a defense against ( F ) the siege mounds and against the sword :
ESV	Jeremiah	33	5	They are coming in ( G ) to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill them [ b ] with the dead bodies of men whom I shall strike down ( H ) in my anger and my wrath , ( I ) for I have hidden my face from this city because of all their evil .
ESV	Jeremiah	33	6	( J ) Behold , I will bring to it health and healing , and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security .
ESV	Jeremiah	33	7	( K ) I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel , ( L ) and rebuild them as they were ( M ) at first .
ESV	Jeremiah	33	8	( N ) I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me , ( O ) and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me .
ESV	Jeremiah	33	9	( P ) And this city [ c ] shall be to me a name of joy , a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for them . They shall ( Q ) fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it .
ESV	Jeremiah	33	10	“ Thus says the Lord : In this place ( R ) of which you say , ‘ It is a waste without man or beast , ’ in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate , without man or inhabitant or beast , there shall be heard again

ESV	Jeremiah	33	12	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts : ( W ) In this place that is waste , without man or beast , and in all of its cities , there shall again be ( X ) habitations of shepherds ( Y ) resting their flocks .
ESV	Jeremiah	33	13	( Z ) In the cities of the hill country , ( AA ) in the cities of the Shephelah , ( AB ) and in the cities of the Negeb , in the land of Benjamin , ( AC ) the places about Jerusalem , ( AD ) and in the cities of Judah , ( AE ) flocks shall again pass under the hands ( AF ) of the one who counts them , says the Lord .

ESV	Jeremiah	33	18	( AM ) and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings , to burn grain offerings , and to make sacrifices forever. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	33	19	The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ESV	Jeremiah	33	20	( AN ) “ Thus says the Lord : ( AO ) If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night , ( AP ) so that day and night will not come at their appointed time ,
ESV	Jeremiah	33	21	( AQ ) then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken , so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne , and my covenant with the Levitical priests my ministers .
ESV	Jeremiah	33	22	As ( AR ) the host of heaven can not be numbered and ( AS ) the sands of the sea can not be measured , so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant , and the Levitical priests who minister to me. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	33	23	The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ESV	Jeremiah	33	24	“ Have you not observed that these people are saying , ‘ The Lord has rejected the two clans that he chose ’ ? Thus they have despised my people so that they are no longer a nation in their sight .
ESV	Jeremiah	33	25	Thus says the Lord : ( AT ) If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the fixed order of heaven and earth ,

ESV	Jeremiah	34	34	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , when ( A ) Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army ( B ) and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities :
ESV	Jeremiah	34	2	“ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel : Go and speak to ( C ) Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him , ‘ Thus says the Lord : ( D ) Behold , I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .

ESV	Jeremiah	34	5	You shall die in peace . ( I ) And as spices were burned for your fathers , the former kings who were before you , so people shall ( J ) burn spices for you ( K ) and lament for you , saying , “ Alas , lord ! ” ’ For I have spoken the word , declares the Lord. ”

ESV	Jeremiah	34	11	But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves ( T ) they had set free , and brought them into subjection as slaves .
ESV	Jeremiah	34	12	The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord :

ESV	Jeremiah	34	15	You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes ( Y ) by proclaiming liberty , each to his neighbor , and ( Z ) you made a covenant before me in the ( AA ) house that is called by my name ,
ESV	Jeremiah	34	16	but then you turned around ( AB ) and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves , ( AC ) whom you had set free according to their desire , and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves .
ESV	Jeremiah	34	17	“ Therefore , thus says the Lord : You have not obeyed me ( AD ) by proclaiming liberty , every one to his brother and to his neighbor ; ( AE ) behold , I proclaim to you liberty ( AF ) to the sword , to pestilence , and to famine , declares the Lord .

ESV	Jeremiah	34	18	And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of ( AH ) the covenant that they made before me , I will make them like [ a ] ( AI ) the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts—
ESV	Jeremiah	34	19	the officials of Judah , the officials of Jerusalem , ( AJ ) the eunuchs , the priests , and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf .

ESV	Jeremiah	35	35	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of ( A ) Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah :
ESV	Jeremiah	35	2	“ Go to the house of the ( B ) Rechabites and speak with them and bring them to the house of the Lord , into one of ( C ) the chambers ; then offer them wine to drink. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	35	3	So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites .
ESV	Jeremiah	35	4	I brought them to the house of the Lord into ( D ) the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah , ( E ) the man of God , which was near ( F ) the chamber of the officials , above ( G ) the chamber of ( H ) Maaseiah the son of Shallum , ( I ) keeper of the threshold .
ESV	Jeremiah	35	5	Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine , and cups , and I said to them , “ Drink wine. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	35	6	But they answered , “ We will drink no wine , for ( J ) Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , commanded us , ‘ You shall not drink wine , neither you nor your sons forever .
ESV	Jeremiah	35	7	You shall not build a house ; you shall not sow seed ; you shall not plant or have a vineyard ; but you shall live in tents all your days , ( K ) that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	35	8	We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , in all that he commanded us , to drink no wine all our days , ourselves , our wives , our sons , or our daughters ,
ESV	Jeremiah	35	9	and not to build houses to dwell in . We have no vineyard or field or seed ,
ESV	Jeremiah	35	10	but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us .
ESV	Jeremiah	35	11	But ( L ) when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land , we said , ‘ Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of ( M ) the army of the Chaldeans and ( N ) the army of the Syrians. ’ ( O ) So we are living in Jerusalem. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	35	12	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ESV	Jeremiah	35	13	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , ( P ) Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words ? declares the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	35	14	The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons , to drink no wine , has been kept , and they drink none to this day , for they have obeyed their father 's command . I have spoken to you ( Q ) persistently , but you have not listened to me .
ESV	Jeremiah	35	15	I have sent to you all my servants the prophets , sending them ( R ) persistently , saying , ( S ) ‘ Turn now every one of you from his evil way , and amend your deeds , and ( T ) do not go after other gods to serve them , and then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to you and your fathers. ’ ( U ) But you did not incline your ear or listen to me .
ESV	Jeremiah	35	16	The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their father gave them , but this people has not obeyed me .
ESV	Jeremiah	35	17	Therefore , thus says the Lord , the God of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them , ( V ) because I have spoken to them and they have not listened , ( W ) I have called to them and they have not answered. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	35	18	But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said , “ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you ,

ESV	Jeremiah	36	8	And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the Lord in the Lord 's house .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	9	( R ) In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , ( S ) in the ninth month , all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem ( T ) proclaimed a fast before the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	10	Then , in the hearing of all the people , Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll , in the house of the Lord , in ( U ) the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary , which was in the upper court , at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord 's house .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	11	When Micaiah the son of Gemariah , son of ( V ) Shaphan , heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll ,
ESV	Jeremiah	36	12	he went down to the king 's house , into the secretary 's chamber , and ( W ) all the officials were sitting there : ( X ) Elishama the secretary , ( Y ) Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , ( Z ) Elnathan ( AA ) the son of Achbor , ( AB ) Gemariah the son of ( AC ) Shaphan , Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the officials .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	13	And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	14	Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah , son of ( AD ) Shelemiah , son of Cushi , to say to Baruch , “ Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people , and come. ” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	15	And they said to him , “ Sit down and read it. ” So Baruch read it to them .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	16	When they heard all the words , they turned one to another in fear . And they said to Baruch , ( AE ) “ We must report all these words to the king. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	36	17	Then they asked Baruch , “ Tell us , please , how did you write all these words ? Was it at his dictation ? ”
ESV	Jeremiah	36	18	Baruch answered them , “ He dictated all these words to me , ( AF ) while I wrote them with ink on the scroll. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	36	19	Then the officials said to Baruch , “ Go and hide , you and Jeremiah , and let no one know where you are. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	36	20	So they went into the court to the king , having put the scroll in ( AG ) the chamber of Elishama the secretary , and they reported all the words to the king .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	21	Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll , and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary . And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	22	It was ( AH ) the ninth month , and the king was sitting in ( AI ) the winter house , and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	23	As Jehudi read three or four columns , the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot , until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	24	Yet ( AJ ) neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid , ( AK ) nor did they tear their garments .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	25	Even when ( AL ) Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah ( AM ) urged the king not to burn the scroll , he would not listen to them .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the ( AN ) king 's son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and ( AO ) Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize ( AP ) Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet , but the Lord hid them .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	27	Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah 's dictation , the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ESV	Jeremiah	36	28	“ Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll , which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	29	And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say , ‘ Thus says the Lord , You have burned this scroll , saying , ( AQ ) “ Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land , and will cut off from it man and beast ? ”
ESV	Jeremiah	36	30	Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah : ( AR ) He shall have none ( AS ) to sit on the throne of David , ( AT ) and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night .
ESV	Jeremiah	36	31	( AU ) And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity . I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them , but they would not hear. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	36	32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to ( AV ) Baruch the scribe , the son of Neriah , who ( AW ) wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire .

ESV	Jeremiah	37	37	( A ) Zedekiah the son of Josiah , ( B ) whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah , reigned instead of ( C ) Coniah the son of Jehoiakim .
ESV	Jeremiah	37	2	( D ) But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the Lord that he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet .
ESV	Jeremiah	37	3	King Zedekiah sent ( E ) Jehucal the son of ( F ) Shelemiah , and ( G ) Zephaniah the priest , the son of ( H ) Maaseiah , to Jeremiah the prophet , saying , “ Please ( I ) pray for us to the Lord our God. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	37	4	( J ) Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people , ( K ) for he had not yet been put in prison .
ESV	Jeremiah	37	5	( L ) The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt . And when ( M ) the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news about them , ( N ) they withdrew from Jerusalem .
ESV	Jeremiah	37	6	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet :
ESV	Jeremiah	37	7	“ Thus says the Lord , God of Israel : Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who ( O ) sent you to me to inquire of me , ‘ Behold , ( P ) Pharaoh 's army that came to help you is about to ( Q ) return to Egypt , to its own land .
ESV	Jeremiah	37	8	And ( R ) the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city . ( S ) They shall capture it and burn it with fire .
ESV	Jeremiah	37	9	Thus says the Lord , Do not deceive yourselves , saying , “ The Chaldeans will surely go away from us , ” for they will not go away .
ESV	Jeremiah	37	10	( T ) For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you , and there remained of them only wounded men , every man in his tent , they would rise up and ( U ) burn this city with fire. ’ ” Jeremiah Imprisoned
ESV	Jeremiah	37	11	Now when ( V ) the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh 's army ,
ESV	Jeremiah	37	12	Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to ( W ) the land of Benjamin ( X ) to receive his portion there ( Y ) among the people .
ESV	Jeremiah	37	13	When he was at ( Z ) the Benjamin Gate , a sentry there named Irijah the son of ( AA ) Shelemiah , son of Hananiah , seized Jeremiah the prophet , saying , ( AB ) “ You are deserting to the Chaldeans. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	37	14	And Jeremiah said , “ It is a lie ; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans. ” But Irijah would not listen to him , and seized Jeremiah and brought him to ( AC ) the officials .
ESV	Jeremiah	37	15	And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah , and they beat him ( AD ) and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary , for it had been made a prison .
ESV	Jeremiah	37	16	( AE ) When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days ,
ESV	Jeremiah	37	17	King Zedekiah sent for him and received him . The king questioned him ( AF ) secretly in his house and said , “ Is there any word from the Lord ? ” Jeremiah said , “ There is. ” Then he said , ( AG ) “ You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	37	18	Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah , “ What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people , ( AH ) that you have put me in prison ?
ESV	Jeremiah	37	19	( AI ) Where are your prophets who prophesied to you , saying , ‘ The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land ’ ?
ESV	Jeremiah	37	20	Now hear , please , O my lord the king : ( AJ ) let my humble plea come before you and ( AK ) do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary , lest I die there. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	37	21	So King Zedekiah gave orders , and they committed Jeremiah to ( AL ) the court of the guard . And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers ' street , ( AM ) until all the bread of the city was gone . So Jeremiah remained in ( AN ) the court of the guard .

ESV	Jeremiah	38	38	Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan , Gedaliah the son of Pashhur , ( A ) Jucal the son of Shelemiah , and ( B ) Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people :
ESV	Jeremiah	38	2	“ Thus says the Lord : ( C ) He who stays in this city shall die by the sword , by famine , and by pestilence , ( D ) but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live . He shall have his life as a prize of war , and live .
ESV	Jeremiah	38	3	Thus says the Lord : ( E ) This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	4	Then the officials said to the king , ( F ) “ Let this man be put to death , ( G ) for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city , and the hands of all the people , by speaking such words to them . For this man is not seeking ( H ) the welfare of this people , but their harm. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	5	King Zedekiah said , “ Behold , he is in your hands , ( I ) for the king can do nothing against you. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	6	So they took Jeremiah ( J ) and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah , the king 's son , which was in ( K ) the court of the guard , letting Jeremiah down ( L ) by ropes . ( M ) And there was no water in the cistern , but only mud , and ( N ) Jeremiah sank in the mud . Jeremiah Rescued from the Cistern
ESV	Jeremiah	38	7	When ( O ) Ebed-melech ( P ) the Ethiopian , ( Q ) a eunuch who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern—the king was sitting ( R ) in the Benjamin Gate—
ESV	Jeremiah	38	8	( S ) Ebed-melech went from the king 's house and said to the king ,
ESV	Jeremiah	38	9	“ My lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern , and he will die there of ( T ) hunger , ( U ) for there is no bread left in the city. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	10	Then the king commanded ( V ) Ebed-melech the Ethiopian , “ Take thirty men with you from here , and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	11	So ( W ) Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king , to a wardrobe in the storehouse , and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes , which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern ( X ) by ropes .
ESV	Jeremiah	38	12	Then ( Y ) Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah , “ Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and ( Z ) the ropes. ” Jeremiah did so .
ESV	Jeremiah	38	13	Then they drew Jeremiah up with ( AA ) ropes and lifted him out of the cistern . And Jeremiah remained in the ( AB ) court of the guard . Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah Again
ESV	Jeremiah	38	14	King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the Lord . The king said to Jeremiah , “ I will ask you a question ; hide nothing from me. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ If I tell you , will you not surely put me to death ? And if I give you counsel , you will not listen to me. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	16	Then King Zedekiah swore ( AC ) secretly to Jeremiah , ( AD ) “ As the Lord lives , ( AE ) who made our souls , I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of ( AF ) these men who seek your life. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of hosts , the God of Israel : ( AG ) If you will surrender to ( AH ) the officials of the king of Babylon , ( AI ) then your life shall be spared , and this city shall not be burned with fire , and you and your house shall live .
ESV	Jeremiah	38	18	But if you do not surrender to ( AJ ) the officials of the king of Babylon , ( AK ) then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , ( AL ) and they shall burn it with fire , and you shall not escape from their hand. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	19	King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ I am afraid of the Judeans ( AM ) who have deserted to the Chaldeans , lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	20	Jeremiah said , “ You shall not be given to them . Obey now the voice of the Lord in what I say to you , ( AN ) and it shall be well with you , and your life shall be spared .
ESV	Jeremiah	38	21	But if you refuse to ( AO ) surrender , this is the vision which the Lord has shown to me :
ESV	Jeremiah	38	22	Behold , all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying , ( AP ) “ ‘ Your trusted friends have deceived you and prevailed against you ; now that your feet are sunk in the mud , they turn away from you. ’
ESV	Jeremiah	38	23	All your wives and ( AQ ) your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans , and you yourself shall not escape from their hand , but shall be seized by the king of Babylon , and this city shall be burned with fire. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ Let no one know of these words , and you shall not die .
ESV	Jeremiah	38	25	If ( AR ) the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you , ‘ Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you ; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death , ’
ESV	Jeremiah	38	26	then you shall say to them , ( AS ) ‘ I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there. ’ ”
ESV	Jeremiah	38	27	Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him , and he answered them as the king had instructed him . So they stopped speaking with him , for the conversation had not been overheard .

ESV	Jeremiah	39	39	( A ) In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it .
ESV	Jeremiah	39	2	In the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , on the ninth day of the month , a breach was made in the city .
ESV	Jeremiah	39	3	Then all ( B ) the officials of the king of Babylon came ( C ) and sat in the middle gate : Nergal-sar-ezer of Samgar , Nebu-sar-sekim ( D ) the Rab-saris , Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag , with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon .
ESV	Jeremiah	39	4	When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them , they fled , going out of the city at night by way of the king 's garden through the gate between the two walls ; and they went toward ( E ) the Arabah .
ESV	Jeremiah	39	5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in ( F ) the plains of Jericho . And when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , at ( G ) Riblah , in the land of Hamath ; ( H ) and he passed sentence on him .
ESV	Jeremiah	39	6	The king of Babylon ( I ) slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at ( J ) Riblah before his eyes , and the king of Babylon ( K ) slaughtered all the nobles of Judah .
ESV	Jeremiah	39	7	( L ) He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon .
ESV	Jeremiah	39	8	( M ) The Chaldeans burned the king 's house and the house of the people , ( N ) and broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
ESV	Jeremiah	39	9	Then ( O ) Nebuzaradan , the ( P ) captain of the guard , carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city , ( Q ) those who had deserted to him , and the people who remained .
ESV	Jeremiah	39	10	Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , ( R ) left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time . The Lord Delivers Jeremiah
ESV	Jeremiah	39	11	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , saying ,
ESV	Jeremiah	39	12	( S ) “ Take him , look after him well , and do him no harm , but deal with him as he tells you. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	39	13	So ( T ) Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , Nebushazban the Rab-saris , Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag , ( U ) and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon
ESV	Jeremiah	39	14	sent and took Jeremiah from ( V ) the court of the guard . They entrusted him to ( W ) Gedaliah the son of ( X ) Ahikam , son of ( Y ) Shaphan , that he should take him home . So ( Z ) he lived among the people .
ESV	Jeremiah	39	15	The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah ( AA ) while he was shut up in the court of the guard :

ESV	Jeremiah	40	40	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord ( A ) after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ( B ) Ramah , when he took him ( C ) bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon .
ESV	Jeremiah	40	2	The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him , ( D ) “ The Lord your God pronounced this disaster against this place .
ESV	Jeremiah	40	3	The Lord has brought it about , and has done as he said . ( E ) Because you sinned against the Lord and did not obey his voice , this thing has come upon you .
ESV	Jeremiah	40	4	Now , behold , I release you today from ( F ) the chains on your hands . ( G ) If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon , come , and I will look after you well , ( H ) but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon , do not come . ( I ) See , the whole land is before you ; go wherever you think it good and right to go .
ESV	Jeremiah	40	5	If you remain , [ a ] then return to ( J ) Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , son of Shaphan , ( K ) whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah , and dwell with him among the people . Or go wherever you think it right to go. ” So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present , and let him go .
ESV	Jeremiah	40	6	Then Jeremiah went to ( L ) Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , at ( M ) Mizpah , and lived with him ( N ) among the people ( O ) who were left in the land .
ESV	Jeremiah	40	7	( P ) When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that ( Q ) the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men , women , and children , those of ( R ) the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon ,
ESV	Jeremiah	40	8	they went to Gedaliah at ( S ) Mizpah— ( T ) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , ( U ) Johanan the son of Kareah , Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , ( V ) Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite , they and their men .
ESV	Jeremiah	40	9	Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , son of Shaphan , swore to them and their men , saying , “ Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans . Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon , ( W ) and it shall be well with you .

ESV	Jeremiah	40	11	Likewise , when all the Judeans who were in ( Z ) Moab and among ( AA ) the Ammonites and in ( AB ) Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , son of Shaphan , as governor over them ,
ESV	Jeremiah	40	12	( AC ) then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah at Mizpah . And they ( AD ) gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance .

ESV	Jeremiah	40	14	and said to him , “ Do you know that Baalis the king of ( AG ) the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life ? ” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them .

ESV	Jeremiah	41	41	( A ) In the seventh month , Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , son of Elishama , of the royal family , one of the chief officers of the king , came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , at ( B ) Mizpah . As they ( C ) ate bread together there at Mizpah ,
ESV	Jeremiah	41	2	( D ) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , son of Shaphan , with the sword , and killed him , ( E ) whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	3	Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at ( F ) Mizpah , and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	4	On the day after the murder of Gedaliah , before anyone knew of it ,
ESV	Jeremiah	41	5	eighty men arrived from ( G ) Shechem and ( H ) Shiloh and ( I ) Samaria , with ( J ) their beards shaved and ( K ) their clothes torn , and ( L ) their bodies gashed , ( M ) bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the Lord .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	6	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from ( N ) Mizpah to meet them , weeping as he came . As he met them , he said to them , “ Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	41	7	When they came into the city , Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	8	But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael , “ Do not put us to death , for we have ( O ) stores of wheat , barley , oil , and honey hidden in the fields. ” So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	9	Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with [ a ] Gedaliah was the large cistern that ( P ) King Asa had made for defense against ( Q ) Baasha king of Israel ; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	10	Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah , ( R ) the king 's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah , whom ( S ) Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam . Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to ( T ) the Ammonites .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	11	But when ( U ) Johanan the son of Kareah and ( V ) all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
ESV	Jeremiah	41	12	they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah . They came upon him at ( W ) the great pool that is in ( X ) Gibeon .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	13	And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and ( Y ) all the leaders of the forces with him , they rejoiced .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	14	( Z ) So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back , and went to Johanan the son of Kareah .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men , and went to ( AA ) the Ammonites .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah and ( AB ) all the leaders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—soldiers , ( AC ) women , children , and eunuchs , whom Johanan brought back from ( AD ) Gibeon .
ESV	Jeremiah	41	17	And they went and stayed at Geruth ( AE ) Chimham near ( AF ) Bethlehem , intending to go to Egypt
ESV	Jeremiah	41	18	because of the Chaldeans . For they were afraid of them , because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , ( AG ) whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .

ESV	Jeremiah	43	2	Azariah the son of ( A ) Hoshaiah and ( B ) Johanan the son of Kareah and ( C ) all the insolent men said to Jeremiah , “ You are telling a lie . The Lord our God did not send you to say , ( D ) ‘ Do not go to Egypt to live there , ’
ESV	Jeremiah	43	3	but ( E ) Baruch the son of Neriah ( F ) has set you against us , ( G ) to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	43	4	So ( H ) Johanan the son of Kareah and all ( I ) the commanders of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the Lord , to remain in the land of Judah .
ESV	Jeremiah	43	5	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took ( J ) all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven—
ESV	Jeremiah	43	6	( K ) the men , the women , the children , ( L ) the princesses , and every person whom ( M ) Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with ( N ) Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , son of Shaphan ; also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah .

ESV	Jeremiah	44	2	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : You have seen all the disaster that I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah . Behold , this day ( D ) they are a desolation , and no one dwells in them ,
ESV	Jeremiah	44	3	because of the evil that they committed , ( E ) provoking me to anger , ( F ) in that they went to make offerings ( G ) and serve other gods that they knew not , neither they , nor you , nor your fathers .
ESV	Jeremiah	44	4	( H ) Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets , saying , ‘ Oh , do not do this abomination that I hate ! ’
ESV	Jeremiah	44	5	( I ) But they did not listen ( J ) or incline their ear , to turn from their evil and make no offerings to other gods .
ESV	Jeremiah	44	6	( K ) Therefore my wrath and my anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem , ( L ) and they became a waste and a desolation , as at this day .
ESV	Jeremiah	44	7	And now thus says the Lord God of hosts , the God of Israel : Why do you commit this great evil ( M ) against yourselves , to cut off from you ( N ) man and woman , ( O ) infant and child , from the midst of Judah , leaving you no remnant ?
ESV	Jeremiah	44	8	( P ) Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands , ( Q ) making offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live , so that you may be cut off and become ( R ) a curse and a taunt among all the nations of the earth ?
ESV	Jeremiah	44	9	Have you forgotten the evil of your fathers , ( S ) the evil of the kings of Judah , ( T ) the evil of their [ a ] wives , your own evil , ( U ) and the evil of your wives , which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
ESV	Jeremiah	44	10	They have not humbled themselves even to this day , ( V ) nor have they feared , nor walked in my law and my statutes that I set before you and before your fathers .
ESV	Jeremiah	44	11	“ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ( W ) Behold , I will set my face against you for harm , to cut off all Judah .
ESV	Jeremiah	44	12	I will take the remnant of Judah who have ( X ) set their faces to come to the land of Egypt to live , and they shall all be consumed . ( Y ) In the land of Egypt they shall fall ; by the sword and by famine ( Z ) they shall be consumed . ( AA ) From the least to the greatest , they shall die by the sword and by famine , ( AB ) and they shall become an oath , a horror , ( AC ) a curse , and a taunt .
ESV	Jeremiah	44	13	( AD ) I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , with the sword , with famine , and with pestilence ,
ESV	Jeremiah	44	14	( AE ) so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to live in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive ( AF ) or return to the land of Judah , to which they desire to return to dwell there . For they shall not return , ( AG ) except some fugitives. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	44	15	Then all the men who knew that ( AH ) their wives had made offerings to other gods , and all the women who stood by , a great assembly , all the people who lived in ( AI ) Pathros in the land of Egypt , answered Jeremiah :
ESV	Jeremiah	44	16	“ As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord , ( AJ ) we will not listen to you .
ESV	Jeremiah	44	17	( AK ) But we will do everything that we have vowed , make offerings to ( AL ) the queen of heaven ( AM ) and pour out drink offerings to her , ( AN ) as we did , both we and our fathers , our kings and our officials , in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . For then we had plenty of food , and prospered , and saw no disaster .
ESV	Jeremiah	44	18	But since we left off making offerings to ( AO ) the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her , we have lacked everything ( AP ) and have been consumed by the sword and by famine. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	44	19	And the women said , [ b ] “ When we made offerings to the queen of heaven ( AQ ) and poured out drink offerings to her , was it ( AR ) without our husbands ' approval that we made cakes for her bearing her image and poured out drink offerings to her ? ”
ESV	Jeremiah	44	20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people , ( AS ) men and women , all the people who had given him this answer :
ESV	Jeremiah	44	21	( AT ) “ As for the offerings that you offered in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem , you and your fathers , your kings and your officials , and the people of the land , ( AU ) did not the Lord remember them ? Did it not come into his mind ?
ESV	Jeremiah	44	22	( AV ) The Lord could no longer bear your evil deeds and ( AW ) the abominations that you committed . ( AX ) Therefore your land has become ( AY ) a desolation and a waste and a curse , ( AZ ) without inhabitant , as it is this day .
ESV	Jeremiah	44	23	It is because you made offerings ( BA ) and because you sinned against the Lord and did not obey the voice of the Lord or walk in his law and in his statutes and in his testimonies ( BB ) that this disaster has happened to you , as at this day. ”
ESV	Jeremiah	44	24	Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women , “ Hear the word of the Lord , ( BC ) all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt .
ESV	Jeremiah	44	25	Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ( BD ) You and your wives have declared with your mouths , and have fulfilled it with your hands , saying , ‘ We will surely perform our vows that we have made , ( BE ) to make offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her. ’ Then confirm your vows and perform your vows !
ESV	Jeremiah	44	26	Therefore hear the word of the Lord , ( BF ) all you of Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt : ( BG ) Behold , I have sworn by my great name , says the Lord , ( BH ) that my name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt , ( BI ) saying , ‘ As the Lord God lives. ’

ESV	Jeremiah	44	29	This shall be the sign to you , declares the Lord , that I will punish you in this place , in order that you may know that ( BO ) my words will surely stand against you for harm :

ESV	Jeremiah	52	52	( A ) Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . His mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	2	And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , ( B ) according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	3	For because of the anger of the Lord it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence . And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	4	( C ) And in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , on the tenth day of the month , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem , and laid siege to it . And they built siegeworks all around it .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	5	So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	6	On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	7	Then a breach was made in the city , and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls , by the king 's garden , and the Chaldeans were around the city . And they went in the direction of the Arabah .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho , and all his army was scattered from him .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	9	Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath , and he passed sentence on him .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	10	The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at ( D ) Riblah .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	11	( E ) He put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him in chains , and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon , and put him in prison ( F ) till the day of his death . The Temple Burned
ESV	Jeremiah	52	12	( G ) In the fifth month , on ( H ) the tenth day of the month—that was ( I ) the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard , who ( J ) served the king of Babylon , entered Jerusalem .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	13	And he burned the house of the Lord , and the king 's house and all the houses of Jerusalem ; every great house he burned down .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	14	And all the army of the Chaldeans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down all the walls around Jerusalem .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	15	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and ( K ) the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon , together with the rest of the artisans .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	17	And the ( L ) pillars of bronze that were in the house of the Lord , and the stands and the ( M ) bronze sea that were in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans broke in pieces , and ( N ) carried all the bronze to Babylon .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	18	inches or
ESV	Jeremiah	52	19	( P ) also the small bowls and the fire pans and the basins and the pots and ( Q ) the lampstands and ( R ) the dishes for incense ( S ) and the bowls for drink offerings . What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold , and what was of silver , as silver .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	20	As for the two pillars , the one sea , ( T ) the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea , [ a ] and the stands , which Solomon the king had made for the house of the Lord , the bronze of all these things was beyond weight .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	21	As for the pillars , the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits , [ b ] ( U ) its circumference was twelve cubits , and its thickness was four fingers , and it was hollow .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	22	On it was a capital of bronze . The height of the one capital was ( V ) five cubits . A network and pomegranates , all of bronze , were around the capital . And the second pillar had the same , with pomegranates .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides ; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network all around . The People Exiled to Babylon
ESV	Jeremiah	52	24	And the captain of the guard took ( W ) Seraiah the chief priest , and ( X ) Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the threshold ;
ESV	Jeremiah	52	25	and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war , and ( Y ) seven men of the king 's council , who were found in the city ; and the secretary of the commander of the army , who mustered the people of the land ; and sixty men of the people of the land , who were found in the midst of the city .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	26	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at ( Z ) Riblah .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	27	And the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at ( AA ) Riblah in the land of Hamath . So Judah was taken into exile out of its land .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	28	This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive : ( AB ) in the seventh year , 3,023 Judeans ;
ESV	Jeremiah	52	29	( AC ) in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem
ESV	Jeremiah	52	832	persons ;
ESV	Jeremiah	52	30	in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Judeans
ESV	Jeremiah	52	745	persons ; all the persons were 4,600 . Jehoiachin Released from Prison
ESV	Jeremiah	52	31	( AD ) And in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the twenty-fifth day of the month , Evil-merodach king of Babylon , in the year that he began to reign , graciously freed [ c ] ( AE ) Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	32	And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat above the seats of ( AF ) the kings who were with him in Babylon .
ESV	Jeremiah	52	33	So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments . And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king 's table ,
ESV	Jeremiah	52	34	and for his allowance , a regular allowance was given him by the king , according to his daily needs , until the day of his death , as long as he lived . Footnotes - Jeremiah 52:20 Hebrew lacks the sea - Jeremiah 52:21 A cubit was about

ESV	Lamentations	1	1	( A ) How lonely sits the city that was full of people ! How like ( B ) a widow has she become , she who was great among the nations ! She who was ( C ) a princess among the provinces has become ( D ) a slave .
ESV	Lamentations	1	2	( E ) She weeps bitterly in the night , with tears on her cheeks ; ( F ) among all her lovers she has ( G ) none to comfort her ; ( H ) all her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they have become her enemies .
ESV	Lamentations	1	3	( I ) Judah has gone into exile because of affliction [ a ] and hard servitude ; ( J ) she dwells now among the nations , ( K ) but finds no resting place ; her pursuers have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress . [ b ]
ESV	Lamentations	1	4	The roads to Zion mourn , for none come to ( L ) the festival ; ( M ) all her gates are desolate ; her priests ( N ) groan ; her virgins have been afflicted , [ c ] and she herself suffers bitterly .
ESV	Lamentations	1	5	( O ) Her foes have become the head ; her ( P ) enemies prosper , because ( Q ) the Lord has afflicted her ( R ) for the multitude of her transgressions ; ( S ) her children have gone away , captives before the foe .
ESV	Lamentations	1	6	From the daughter of Zion all her majesty has departed . Her princes have become like deer ( T ) that find no pasture ; they fled without strength before the pursuer .
ESV	Lamentations	1	7	Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and wandering ( U ) all the precious things that were hers from ( V ) days of old . When her people fell into the hand of the foe , and there was none to help her , her foes gloated over her ; they ( W ) mocked at her downfall .
ESV	Lamentations	1	8	( X ) Jerusalem sinned grievously ; therefore she became filthy ; all who honored her despise her , ( Y ) for they have seen her nakedness ; she herself ( Z ) groans and turns her face away .
ESV	Lamentations	1	9	Her uncleanness was ( AA ) in her skirts ; ( AB ) she took no thought of her future ; [ d ] therefore her fall is terrible ; ( AC ) she has no comforter . “ O Lord , behold my affliction , for the enemy has ( AD ) triumphed ! ”
ESV	Lamentations	1	10	The enemy has stretched out his hands over all her ( AE ) precious things ; for she has seen ( AF ) the nations enter her sanctuary , those whom you ( AG ) forbade to enter your congregation .
ESV	Lamentations	1	11	All her people ( AH ) groan as ( AI ) they search for bread ; they trade their ( AJ ) treasures for ( AK ) food to revive their strength . “ Look , O Lord , and see , for I am despised. ”
ESV	Lamentations	1	12	“ Is it nothing to you , all ( AL ) you who pass by ? ( AM ) Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow , which was brought upon me , which ( AN ) the Lord inflicted on ( AO ) the day of his fierce anger .
ESV	Lamentations	1	13	“ From on high he ( AP ) sent fire ; into my bones [ e ] he made it descend ; ( AQ ) he spread a net for my feet ; he turned me back ; ( AR ) he has left me stunned , faint all the day long .
ESV	Lamentations	1	14	“ My transgressions were bound [ f ] into ( AS ) a yoke ; by his hand they were fastened together ; they were set upon my neck ; he caused my strength to fail ; the Lord gave me into the hands of those whom I can not withstand .
ESV	Lamentations	1	15	“ The Lord rejected all my mighty men in my midst ; he summoned an assembly against me to crush my young men ; ( AT ) the Lord has trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah .
ESV	Lamentations	1	16	“ For these things ( AU ) I weep ; my eyes flow with tears ; for ( AV ) a comforter is far from me , one to ( AW ) revive my spirit ; my children are desolate , for the enemy has prevailed. ”
ESV	Lamentations	1	17	( AX ) Zion stretches out her hands , but ( AY ) there is none to comfort her ; the Lord has commanded against Jacob that his neighbors should be his foes ; Jerusalem has become a filthy thing among them .
ESV	Lamentations	1	18	( AZ ) “ The Lord is in the right , ( BA ) for I have rebelled against his word ; but hear , all you peoples , and see my suffering ; ( BB ) my young women and my young men have gone into captivity .
ESV	Lamentations	1	19	“ I called to ( BC ) my lovers , but they deceived me ; my priests and elders perished in the city , while ( BD ) they sought food to revive their strength .
ESV	Lamentations	1	20	“ Look , O Lord , for I am in distress ; ( BE ) my stomach churns ; my heart is wrung within me , because I have been very rebellious . ( BF ) In the street the sword bereaves ; in the house it is like death .
ESV	Lamentations	1	21	“ They heard [ g ] ( BG ) my groaning , yet ( BH ) there is no one to comfort me . All my enemies have heard of my trouble ; ( BI ) they are glad that you have done it . You have brought [ h ] the day you announced ; ( BJ ) now let them be as I am .
ESV	Lamentations	1	22	( BK ) “ Let all their evildoing come before you , and deal with them as ( BL ) you have dealt with me because of all my transgressions ; for ( BM ) my groans are many , and ( BN ) my heart is faint. ” Footnotes - Lamentations 1:3 Or under affliction - Lamentations 1:3 Or in the narrow passes - Lamentations 1:4 Septuagint , Old Latin dragged away - Lamentations 1:9 Or end - Lamentations 1:13 Septuagint ; Hebrew bones and - Lamentations 1:14 The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain - Lamentations 1:21 Septuagint , Syriac Hear - Lamentations 1:21 Syriac Bring The Holy Bible , English Standard Version .

ESV	Lamentations	2	2	The Lord ( D ) has swallowed up ( E ) without mercy all the habitations of Jacob ; in his wrath ( F ) he has broken down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah ; he has brought ( G ) down to the ground ( H ) in dishonor the kingdom ( I ) and its rulers .
ESV	Lamentations	2	3	He has cut down in ( J ) fierce anger all ( K ) the might of Israel ; ( L ) he has withdrawn from them his right hand in the face of the enemy ; ( M ) he has burned like a flaming fire in Jacob , consuming all around .
ESV	Lamentations	2	4	( N ) He has bent his bow like an enemy , with his right hand set ( O ) like a foe ; and he has killed all who were delightful in our eyes in the tent of the daughter of Zion ; he has poured out his fury like fire .
ESV	Lamentations	2	5	( P ) The Lord has become like an enemy ; ( Q ) he has swallowed up Israel ; ( R ) he has swallowed up all its palaces ; he has laid in ruins its strongholds , and he has multiplied in the daughter of Judah ( S ) mourning and lamentation .
ESV	Lamentations	2	6	He has laid waste his booth like a garden , laid in ruins ( T ) his meeting place ; ( U ) the Lord has made Zion forget festival and ( V ) Sabbath , and in his fierce indignation has spurned king and priest .
ESV	Lamentations	2	7	( W ) The Lord has scorned his altar , ( X ) disowned his sanctuary ; ( Y ) he has delivered into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces ; ( Z ) they raised a clamor in the house of the Lord as on the day of festival .
ESV	Lamentations	2	8	( AA ) The Lord determined to lay in ruins ( AB ) the wall of the daughter of Zion ; ( AC ) he stretched out the measuring line ; he did not restrain his hand from destroying ; ( AD ) he caused rampart and wall to lament ; ( AE ) they languished together .
ESV	Lamentations	2	9	Her gates have sunk into the ground ; ( AF ) he has ruined ( AG ) and broken her bars ; ( AH ) her king and princes are among the nations ; the law is no more , and ( AI ) her prophets find no vision from the Lord .
ESV	Lamentations	2	10	The elders of the daughter of Zion ( AJ ) sit on the ground ( AK ) in silence ; ( AL ) they have thrown dust on their heads and ( AM ) put on sackcloth ; the young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground .
ESV	Lamentations	2	11	( AN ) My eyes are spent with weeping ; ( AO ) my stomach churns ; ( AP ) my bile is poured out to the ground ( AQ ) because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , ( AR ) because infants and babies ( AS ) faint in the streets of the city .
ESV	Lamentations	2	12	They cry to their mothers , ( AT ) “ Where is bread and wine ? ” ( AU ) as they faint like a wounded man in the streets of the city , as their life is poured out on their mothers ' bosom .
ESV	Lamentations	2	13	What can I say for you , ( AV ) to what compare you , O daughter of Jerusalem ? ( AW ) What can I liken to you , that I may comfort you , O virgin daughter of Zion ? ( AX ) For your ruin is vast as the sea ; who can heal you ?
ESV	Lamentations	2	14	( AY ) Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions ; ( AZ ) they have not exposed your iniquity to ( BA ) restore your fortunes , ( BB ) but have seen for you ( BC ) oracles that are false and misleading .
ESV	Lamentations	2	15	All who pass along the way clap their hands at you ; ( BD ) they hiss and wag their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem : “ Is this the city that was called ( BE ) the perfection of beauty , ( BF ) the joy of all the earth ? ”
ESV	Lamentations	2	16	( BG ) All your enemies rail against you ; they hiss , they gnash their teeth , they cry : “ We ( BH ) have swallowed her ! Ah , this is the day we longed for ; now we have it ; ( BI ) we see it ! ”
ESV	Lamentations	2	17	The Lord has done what he purposed ; he has carried out ( BJ ) his word , which he commanded ( BK ) long ago ; ( BL ) he has thrown down ( BM ) without pity ; ( BN ) he has made the enemy rejoice over you and exalted the ( BO ) might of your foes .
ESV	Lamentations	2	18	Their heart cried to the Lord . O ( BP ) wall of the daughter of Zion , ( BQ ) let tears stream down like a torrent ( BR ) day and night ! ( BS ) Give yourself no rest , ( BT ) your eyes no respite !
ESV	Lamentations	2	19	“ Arise , ( BU ) cry out in the night , at the beginning of the night watches ! ( BV ) Pour out your heart like water before the presence of the Lord ! ( BW ) Lift your hands to him for the lives of your children , ( BX ) who faint for hunger at the head of every street. ”
ESV	Lamentations	2	20	Look , O Lord , and see ! ( BY ) With whom have you dealt thus ? ( BZ ) Should women eat the fruit of their womb , the children of ( CA ) their tender care ? Should ( CB ) priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
ESV	Lamentations	2	21	In the dust of the streets ( CC ) lie the young and the old ; ( CD ) my young women and my young men have fallen by the sword ; ( CE ) you have killed them in the day of your anger , slaughtering ( CF ) without pity .

ESV	Lamentations	3	17	my soul is bereft of peace ; I have forgotten what happiness [ a ] is ;
ESV	Lamentations	3	18	( Y ) so I say , “ My endurance has perished ; so has my hope from the Lord. ”

ESV	Lamentations	3	20	My soul continually remembers it ( AC ) and is bowed down within me .

ESV	Ezekiel	1	5	And from the midst of it came the likeness of ( N ) four living creatures . ( O ) And this was their appearance : they had a human likeness ,
ESV	Ezekiel	1	6	( P ) but each had four faces , and each of them had four wings .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	7	Their legs were straight , and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf 's foot . And they sparkled ( Q ) like burnished bronze .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	8	Under their wings ( R ) on their four sides ( S ) they had human hands . And the four had their faces and their wings thus :
ESV	Ezekiel	1	9	their wings touched one another . ( T ) Each one of them went straight forward , ( U ) without turning as they went .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	10	As for the likeness of their faces , ( V ) each had a human face . The four had the face of a lion on the right side , the four had the face of an ox on the left side , and the four had the face of an eagle .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	11	Such were their faces . And their wings were spread out above . Each creature had two wings , each of which touched the wing of another , while ( W ) two covered their bodies .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	12	( X ) And each went straight forward . ( Y ) Wherever the spirit [ c ] would go , they went , without turning as they went .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	13	As for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was ( Z ) like burning coals of fire , ( AA ) like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures . ( AB ) And the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	14	And the living creatures ( AC ) darted to and fro , ( AD ) like the appearance of a flash of lightning .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	15	( AE ) Now as I looked at the living creatures , I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures , one for each of the four of them . [ d ]
ESV	Ezekiel	1	16	( AF ) As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction : their appearance was like ( AG ) the gleaming of beryl . ( AH ) And the four had the same likeness , their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	17	( AI ) When they went , they went ( AJ ) in any of their four directions [ e ] ( AK ) without turning as they went .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	18	And their rims were tall and awesome , ( AL ) and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around .

ESV	Ezekiel	1	23	And under the expanse their wings were ( AV ) stretched out straight , one toward another . ( AW ) And each creature had two wings covering its body .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	24	And when they went , I heard the sound of their wings ( AX ) like the sound of many waters , like ( AY ) the sound of the ( AZ ) Almighty , a sound of tumult ( BA ) like the sound of an army . When they stood still , they let down their wings .
ESV	Ezekiel	1	25	And there came a voice from above ( BB ) the expanse over their heads . When they stood still , they let down their wings .

ESV	Ezekiel	8	2	Then I looked , and behold , ( E ) a form that had the appearance of a man . [ a ] ( F ) Below what appeared to be his waist was fire , and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness , like ( G ) gleaming metal . [ b ]
ESV	Ezekiel	8	3	He ( H ) put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head , and the Spirit lifted me up ( I ) between earth and heaven and ( J ) brought me in ( K ) visions of God to Jerusalem , ( L ) to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north , ( M ) where was the seat of the ( N ) image of jealousy , ( O ) which provokes to jealousy .
ESV	Ezekiel	8	4	And behold , ( P ) the glory of the God of Israel was there , like the vision that I saw ( Q ) in the valley .
ESV	Ezekiel	8	5	Then he said to me , ( R ) “ Son of man , lift up your eyes now toward the north. ” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north , and behold , north of ( S ) the altar gate , in the entrance , was this ( T ) image of jealousy .
ESV	Ezekiel	8	6	And he said to me , “ Son of man , ( U ) do you see what they are doing , ( V ) the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here , ( W ) to drive me far from my sanctuary ? But you will see still greater abominations. ”

ESV	Ezekiel	8	10	So I went in and saw . And there , ( Z ) engraved on the wall all around , was ( AA ) every form of ( AB ) creeping things and loathsome beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel .
ESV	Ezekiel	8	11	And before them stood ( AC ) seventy men of ( AD ) the elders of the house of Israel , with Jaazaniah the son of ( AE ) Shaphan standing among them . Each had his censer in his hand , and ( AF ) the smoke of the cloud of incense went up .

ESV	Ezekiel	13	13	Therefore thus says the Lord God : ( N ) I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath , ( O ) and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger , and great hailstones in wrath to make a full end .
ESV	Ezekiel	13	2	( A ) “ Son of man , prophesy against the prophets of Israel , who are prophesying , and say to those ( B ) who prophesy from their own hearts : ‘ Hear the word of the Lord ! ’
ESV	Ezekiel	13	3	Thus says the Lord God , Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit , and have seen nothing !
ESV	Ezekiel	13	4	Your prophets have been like jackals among ruins , O Israel .
ESV	Ezekiel	13	5	( C ) You have not gone up into the breaches , or built up a wall for the house of Israel , that it might stand in battle in the day of the Lord .
ESV	Ezekiel	13	6	( D ) They have seen false visions and lying divinations . They say , ‘ Declares the Lord , ’ ( E ) when the Lord has not sent them , and yet they expect him to fulfill their word .
ESV	Ezekiel	13	7	Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination , ( F ) whenever you have said , ‘ Declares the Lord , ’ although I have not spoken ? ”
ESV	Ezekiel	13	8	Therefore thus says the Lord God : “ Because you have uttered falsehood and seen lying visions , therefore behold , ( G ) I am against you , declares the Lord God .
ESV	Ezekiel	13	9	My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who give lying divinations . They shall not be in the council of my people , ( H ) nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel , ( I ) nor shall they enter the land of Israel . ( J ) And you shall know that I am the Lord God .
ESV	Ezekiel	13	10	Precisely because they have misled my people , ( K ) saying , ‘ Peace , ’ when there is no peace , and because , when the people build a wall , ( L ) these prophets smear it with whitewash , [ a ]
ESV	Ezekiel	13	11	,
ESV	Ezekiel	13	12	And when the wall falls , will it not be said to you , ‘ Where is the coating with which you smeared it ? ’

ESV	Ezekiel	13	18	and say , Thus says the Lord God : Woe to the women ( U ) who sew magic bands upon all wrists , and ( V ) make veils for the heads of persons of every stature , in ( W ) the hunt for souls ! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive ?
ESV	Ezekiel	13	19	You have profaned me among my people ( X ) for handfuls of barley ( Y ) and for pieces of bread , putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live , by your lying to my people , who listen to lies .
ESV	Ezekiel	13	20	“ Therefore thus says the Lord God : Behold , ( Z ) I am against ( AA ) your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds , and I will tear them from your arms , and I will let the souls whom you hunt go free , the souls like birds .
ESV	Ezekiel	13	21	Your veils also I will tear off and ( AB ) deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand as prey , ( AC ) and you shall know that I am the Lord .
ESV	Ezekiel	13	22	( AD ) Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely , although I have not grieved him , and ( AE ) you have encouraged the wicked , that ( AF ) he should not turn from his evil way to save his life ,
ESV	Ezekiel	13	23	( AG ) therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination . I will deliver my people out of your hand . And you shall know that I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 13:10 Or plaster ; also verses

ESV	Ezekiel	14	3	( C ) “ Son of man , these men have taken their idols into their hearts , and set ( D ) the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces . ( E ) Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them ?
ESV	Ezekiel	14	4	Therefore speak to them and say to them , Thus says the Lord God : Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face , and yet comes to the prophet , ( F ) I the Lord will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols ,

ESV	Ezekiel	14	9	And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word , ( P ) I , the Lord , have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
ESV	Ezekiel	14	10	And they shall bear their punishment [ a ] —the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike—

ESV	Ezekiel	16	2	( A ) “ Son of man , ( B ) make known to Jerusalem her abominations ,
ESV	Ezekiel	16	3	and say , Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem : Your origin and your birth are of the land of the Canaanites ; your father was an ( C ) Amorite and your mother a ( D ) Hittite .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	4	And as for your birth , ( E ) on the day you were born your cord was not cut , nor were you washed with water to cleanse you , nor rubbed with salt , nor wrapped in swaddling cloths .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	5	No eye pitied you , to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you , ( F ) but you were cast out on the open field , for you were abhorred , ( G ) on the day that you were born .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	6	“ And when I passed by you and saw you wallowing ( H ) in your blood , I said to you ( I ) in your blood , ‘ Live ! ’ I said to you ( J ) in your blood , ‘ Live ! ’
ESV	Ezekiel	16	7	( K ) I made you flourish like a plant of the field . And you grew up and became tall ( L ) and arrived at full adornment . Your breasts were formed , and your hair had grown ; yet ( M ) you were naked and bare .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	8	“ When I passed by you again and saw you , behold , you were at the age for love , and ( N ) I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness ; I made my vow to you ( O ) and entered into a covenant with you , declares the Lord God , ( P ) and you became mine .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	9	Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you and ( Q ) anointed you with oil .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	10	( R ) I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with fine leather . I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk . [ a ]
ESV	Ezekiel	16	11	( S ) And I adorned you with ornaments and ( T ) put bracelets on your wrists and a chain on your neck .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	12	And I put a ring on your nose and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	13	Thus you were adorned with gold and silver , and your clothing was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth . ( U ) You ate fine flour and honey and oil . ( V ) You grew exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	14	And ( W ) your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty , for it was perfect through the splendor that I had bestowed on you , declares the Lord God .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	15	( X ) “ But you trusted in your beauty ( Y ) and played the whore [ b ] because of your renown ( Z ) and lavished your whorings [ c ] on any passerby ; your beauty [ d ] became his .

ESV	Ezekiel	16	44	“ Behold , everyone ( CA ) who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you : ‘ Like mother , like daughter. ’
ESV	Ezekiel	16	45	You are the daughter of your mother , who loathed her husband and her children ; and you are the sister of ( CB ) your sisters , who loathed their husbands and their children . ( CC ) Your mother was a Hittite and ( CD ) your father an Amorite .

ESV	Ezekiel	16	47	( CG ) Not only did you walk in their ways and do according to their abominations ; within a very little time ( CH ) you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	48	( CI ) As I live , declares the Lord God , your sister ( CJ ) Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	49	Behold , this was the guilt of your sister Sodom : she and her daughters had pride , ( CK ) excess of food , and prosperous ease , but did not aid the poor and needy .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	50	They were haughty and ( CL ) did an abomination before me . So ( CM ) I removed them , when I saw it .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	51	( CN ) Samaria has not committed half your sins . You have committed more abominations than they , and ( CO ) have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations that you have committed .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	52	( CP ) Bear your disgrace , you also , for you have intervened on behalf of your sisters . Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they , they are more in the right than you . So be ashamed , you also , and bear your disgrace , for you have made your sisters appear righteous .
ESV	Ezekiel	16	53	( CQ ) “ I will restore their fortunes , both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters , and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters , and I will restore your own fortunes in their midst ,
ESV	Ezekiel	16	54	that you may bear your disgrace ( CR ) and be ashamed of all that you have done , ( CS ) becoming a consolation to them .

ESV	Ezekiel	16	56	Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth ( CX ) in the day of your pride ,
ESV	Ezekiel	16	57	before your wickedness was uncovered ? Now you have become ( CY ) an object of reproach for the daughters of Syria [ h ] and all those around her , and for ( CZ ) the daughters of the Philistines , ( DA ) those all around who despise you .

ESV	Ezekiel	17	3	say , Thus says the Lord God : ( C ) A great eagle ( D ) with great wings and long pinions , ( E ) rich in plumage of many colors , came ( F ) to Lebanon ( G ) and took the top of the cedar .
ESV	Ezekiel	17	4	He broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade and set it in a city of merchants .
ESV	Ezekiel	17	5	Then he took of the seed of the land ( H ) and planted it in fertile soil . [ a ] He placed it beside abundant waters . ( I ) He set it like a willow twig ,
ESV	Ezekiel	17	6	and it sprouted and became a ( J ) low ( K ) spreading vine , and its branches turned toward him , and its roots remained where it stood . So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs .
ESV	Ezekiel	17	7	( L ) “ And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage , ( M ) and behold , this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from ( N ) the bed where it was planted , that he might water it .
ESV	Ezekiel	17	8	( O ) It had been planted on good soil by abundant waters , that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine .
ESV	Ezekiel	17	9	“ Say , Thus says the Lord God : ( P ) Will it thrive ? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit , so that it withers , so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither ? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots .
ESV	Ezekiel	17	10	Behold , it is planted ; will it thrive ? ( Q ) Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it—wither away on the bed where it sprouted ? ”
ESV	Ezekiel	17	11	Then the word of the Lord came to me :

ESV	Ezekiel	17	15	( Y ) But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors ( Z ) to Egypt , that they might give him horses and a large army . ( AA ) Will he thrive ? Can one escape who does such things ? Can he ( AB ) break the covenant and yet escape ?
ESV	Ezekiel	17	16	( AC ) “ As I live , declares the Lord God , surely ( AD ) in the place where the king dwells ( AE ) who made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose covenant with him he broke , in Babylon he shall die .
ESV	Ezekiel	17	18	He despised the oath in breaking the covenant , and behold , he gave his hand and did all these things ; he shall not escape .
ESV	Ezekiel	17	19	Therefore thus says the Lord God : As I live , surely it is my oath that he despised , and my covenant that he broke . I will return it upon his head .

ESV	Ezekiel	17	23	( AP ) On the mountain height of Israel will I plant it , that it may bear branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar . ( AQ ) And under it will dwell every kind of bird ; in the shade of its branches birds of every sort will nest .

ESV	Ezekiel	19	2	and say : What was your mother ? ( B ) A lioness ! Among lions she crouched ; in the midst of young lions she reared her cubs .
ESV	Ezekiel	19	3	And she brought up one of her cubs ; ( C ) he became a young lion , ( D ) and he learned to catch prey ; he devoured men .
ESV	Ezekiel	19	4	The nations heard about him ; ( E ) he was caught in their pit , ( F ) and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt .
ESV	Ezekiel	19	5	When she saw that she waited in vain , that her hope was lost , ( G ) she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion .
ESV	Ezekiel	19	6	He prowled among the lions ; he became a young lion , and he learned to catch prey ; he devoured men ,
ESV	Ezekiel	19	7	and seized [ a ] their widows . He laid waste their cities , and the land was appalled and all who were in it at the sound of his roaring .
ESV	Ezekiel	19	8	( H ) Then the nations set against him from provinces on every side ; ( I ) they spread their net over him ; ( J ) he was taken in their pit .
ESV	Ezekiel	19	9	With hooks ( K ) they put him in a cage [ b ] and ( L ) brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into custody , that his voice should no more be heard on ( M ) the mountains of Israel .

ESV	Ezekiel	19	14	( S ) And fire has gone out from the stem of its shoots , has consumed its fruit , ( T ) so that there remains in it no strong stem , no scepter for ruling .

ESV	Ezekiel	20	6	,

ESV	Ezekiel	20	10	( AA ) So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness .
ESV	Ezekiel	20	11	( AB ) I gave them my statutes and made known to them my rules , ( AC ) by which , if a person does them , he shall live .
ESV	Ezekiel	20	12	Moreover , I gave them ( AD ) my Sabbaths , as a sign between me and them , ( AE ) that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them .
ESV	Ezekiel	20	13	( AF ) But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness . ( AG ) They did not walk in my statutes but rejected my rules , by which , if a person does them , he shall live ; ( AH ) and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned .

ESV	Ezekiel	20	24	because they had not obeyed my rules , but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths , ( BI ) and their eyes were set on their fathers ' idols .
ESV	Ezekiel	20	25	( BJ ) Moreover , I gave them statutes that were not good and rules by which they could not have life ,

ESV	Ezekiel	23	2	( A ) “ Son of man , there were ( B ) two women , the daughters of one mother .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	3	( C ) They played the whore in Egypt ; ( D ) they played the whore ( E ) in their youth ; there their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms [ a ] handled .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	4	Oholah was the name of the elder and Oholibah the name of her sister . ( F ) They became mine , and they ( G ) bore sons and daughters . As for their names , Oholah is ( H ) Samaria , and Oholibah is Jerusalem .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	5	“ Oholah played the whore ( I ) while she was mine , and ( J ) she lusted after her lovers ( K ) the Assyrians , warriors
ESV	Ezekiel	23	6	clothed in purple , ( L ) governors and commanders , ( M ) all of them desirable young men , ( N ) horsemen riding on horses .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	7	She bestowed her whoring upon them , the choicest men of Assyria all of them , and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone after whom she lusted .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	8	,
ESV	Ezekiel	23	9	Therefore ( P ) I delivered her into the hands of her lovers , into the hands of the Assyrians , after whom she lusted .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	10	( Q ) These uncovered her nakedness ; ( R ) they seized her sons and her daughters ; and as for her , they killed her with the sword ; and she became ( S ) a byword among women , ( T ) when judgment had been executed on her .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	11	( U ) “ Her sister Oholibah saw this , and she became ( V ) more corrupt than her sister [ b ] in her lust and in her whoring , which was worse than that of her sister .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	12	She lusted after the Assyrians , governors and commanders , warriors clothed in full armor , horsemen riding on horses , ( W ) all of them desirable young men .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	13	And I saw that she was defiled ; they both took the same way .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	14	But she carried her whoring further . She saw men ( X ) portrayed on the wall , the ( Y ) images of ( Z ) the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion ,
ESV	Ezekiel	23	15	wearing belts on their waists , with flowing turbans on their heads , all of them having the appearance of officers , a likeness of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	16	When she saw them , she lusted after them and ( AA ) sent messengers to them ( AB ) in Chaldea .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	17	And the Babylonians came to her ( AC ) into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their whoring lust . And after she was defiled by them , ( AD ) she turned from them in disgust .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	18	When she carried on her whoring so openly and flaunted her nakedness , I turned in disgust from her , as I had turned in disgust from her sister .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	19	Yet she increased her whoring , ( AE ) remembering the days of her youth , when she played the whore in the land of Egypt
ESV	Ezekiel	23	20	and lusted after her lovers there , whose members were like those of donkeys , and whose issue was like that of horses .

ESV	Ezekiel	23	22	Therefore , O Oholibah , thus says the Lord God : “ Behold , I will stir up against you your lovers ( AF ) from whom you turned in disgust , ( AG ) and I will bring them against you from every side :
ESV	Ezekiel	23	24	And they shall come against you from the north [ d ] with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples . ( AK ) They shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler , shield , and helmet ; and ( AL ) I will commit the judgment to them , and ( AM ) they shall judge you according to their judgments .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	25	And I will direct my jealousy against you , ( AN ) that they may deal with you in fury . They shall cut off your nose and your ears , and your survivors shall fall by the sword . ( AO ) They shall seize your sons and your daughters , and your survivors shall be devoured by fire .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	26	( AP ) They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	27	( AQ ) Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and ( AR ) your whoring begun in the land of Egypt , so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	28	“ For thus says the Lord God : ( AS ) Behold , I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate , ( AT ) into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust ,
ESV	Ezekiel	23	29	and ( AU ) they shall deal with you in hatred and take away all the fruit of your labor ( AV ) and leave you naked and bare , and ( AW ) the nakedness of your whoring shall be uncovered . Your lewdness and your whoring
ESV	Ezekiel	23	30	have brought this upon you , because ( AX ) you played the whore with the nations and defiled yourself with their idols .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	31	You have gone the way of your sister ; ( AY ) therefore I will give ( AZ ) her cup into your hand .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	32	Thus says the Lord God : “ You shall drink your sister 's cup that is deep and large ; you shall be laughed at and held in derision , for it contains much ;
ESV	Ezekiel	23	33	you will be filled with ( BA ) drunkenness and sorrow . ( BB ) A cup of horror and desolation , the cup of ( BC ) your sister Samaria ;
ESV	Ezekiel	23	34	( BD ) you shall drink it and drain it out , and gnaw its shards , and tear your breasts ; for I have spoken , declares the Lord God .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	35	Therefore thus says the Lord God : Because ( BE ) you have forgotten me and ( BF ) cast me behind your back , you yourself ( BG ) must bear the consequences of your lewdness and whoring. ”
ESV	Ezekiel	23	36	The Lord said to me : ( BH ) “ Son of man , ( BI ) will you judge Oholah and Oholibah ? Declare to them their abominations .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	37	For ( BJ ) they have committed adultery , ( BK ) and blood is on their hands . With their idols they have committed adultery , and they have even ( BL ) offered up [ e ] to them for food the children whom they had borne to me .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	38	Moreover , this they have done to me : ( BM ) they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and ( BN ) profaned my Sabbaths .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	39	For when ( BO ) they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols , on the same day ( BP ) they came into my sanctuary to profane it . And behold , ( BQ ) this is what they did in my house .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	40	They even sent for men to come from afar , ( BR ) to whom a messenger was sent ; and behold , they came . For them you bathed yourself , ( BS ) painted your eyes , ( BT ) and adorned yourself with ornaments .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	41	You sat on ( BU ) a stately couch , with a table spread before it ( BV ) on which you had placed my incense and ( BW ) my oil .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	42	The ( BX ) sound of a carefree multitude was with her ; and with men of the common sort , drunkards [ f ] were brought from the wilderness ; and they put ( BY ) bracelets on the hands of the women , and ( BZ ) beautiful crowns on their heads .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	43	“ Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery , ‘ Now they will continue to use her for a whore , even her ! ’ [ g ]
ESV	Ezekiel	23	44	For they have gone in to her , as men go in to a prostitute . Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah , lewd women !
ESV	Ezekiel	23	45	But righteous men ( CA ) shall pass judgment on them with the sentence of adulteresses , and with the sentence of women who shed blood , because they are adulteresses , and blood is on their hands. ”
ESV	Ezekiel	23	46	For thus says the Lord God : ( CB ) “ Bring up a vast host against them , and make them ( CC ) an object of terror and ( CD ) a plunder .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	47	( CE ) And the host shall stone them and cut them down with their swords . ( CF ) They shall kill their sons and their daughters , and ( CG ) burn up their houses .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	48	( CH ) Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land , that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done .
ESV	Ezekiel	23	49	And they shall return your lewdness upon you , and ( CI ) you shall bear the penalty for your sinful idolatry , and ( CJ ) you shall know that I am the Lord God. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 23:3 Hebrew nipples ; also verses

ESV	Ezekiel	24	2	( B ) “ Son of man , write down the name of this day , this very day . The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	3	And ( C ) utter a parable to ( D ) the rebellious house and say to them , Thus says the Lord God : “ Set on ( E ) the pot , set it on ; pour in water also ;
ESV	Ezekiel	24	4	put in it the pieces of meat , all the good pieces , ( F ) the thigh and the shoulder ; fill it with choice bones .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	5	Take the choicest one of the flock ; pile the logs [ a ] under it ; boil it well ; seethe also its bones in it .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	6	“ Therefore thus says the Lord God : ( G ) Woe to the bloody city , to ( H ) the pot whose corrosion is in it , and whose corrosion has not gone out of it ! Take out of it piece after piece , without making any choice . [ b ]
ESV	Ezekiel	24	7	For the blood she has shed is in her midst ; she put it on ( I ) the bare rock ; ( J ) she did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dust .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	8	To rouse my wrath , to take vengeance , I have set on the bare rock the blood she has shed , that it may not be covered .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	9	Therefore thus says the Lord God : Woe to the bloody city ! ( K ) I also will make the pile great .

ESV	Ezekiel	24	11	Then set it empty upon the coals , that it may become hot , and its copper may burn , ( L ) that its uncleanness may be melted in it , its corrosion consumed .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	12	( M ) She has wearied herself with toil ; [ d ] its abundant corrosion does not go out of it . Into the fire with its corrosion !
ESV	Ezekiel	24	13	On account of your unclean lewdness , because I would have cleansed you and you were not cleansed from your uncleanness , ( N ) you shall not be cleansed anymore till ( O ) I have satisfied my fury upon you .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	14	( P ) I am the Lord . I have spoken ; it shall come to pass ; I will do it . I will not go back ; ( Q ) I will not spare ; ( R ) I will not relent ; ( S ) according to your ways and your deeds you will be judged , declares the Lord God. ” Ezekiel 's Wife Dies
ESV	Ezekiel	24	15	The word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	24	16	( T ) “ Son of man , behold , I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you at a stroke ; yet you shall not mourn or weep , nor shall your tears run down .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	17	Sigh , but not aloud ; make no mourning for the dead . ( U ) Bind on your turban , and ( V ) put your shoes on your feet ; do not cover your lips , ( W ) nor eat the bread of men. ”
ESV	Ezekiel	24	18	So I spoke to the people in the morning , and ( X ) at evening my wife died . And on the next morning I did ( Y ) as I was commanded .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	19	And ( Z ) the people said to me , “ Will you not tell us what these things mean for us , that you are acting thus ? ”
ESV	Ezekiel	24	20	Then I said to them , “ The word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	24	21	‘ Say to the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord God : ( AA ) Behold , I will profane my sanctuary , the pride of your power , the delight of your eyes , and the yearning of your soul , and ( AB ) your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	22	And ( AC ) you shall do as I have done ; ( AD ) you shall not cover your lips , ( AE ) nor eat the bread of men .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	23	( AF ) Your turbans shall be on your heads and your shoes on your feet ; you shall not mourn or weep , but ( AG ) you shall rot away in your iniquities and groan to one another .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	25	“ As for you , ( AK ) son of man , surely on the day when I take from them ( AL ) their stronghold , their joy and glory , the delight of their eyes and their soul 's desire , and also their sons and daughters ,
ESV	Ezekiel	24	26	( AM ) on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news .
ESV	Ezekiel	24	27	On that day your mouth ( AN ) will be opened to the fugitive , and you shall speak and be no longer mute . ( AO ) So you will be a sign to them , and ( AP ) they will know that I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 24:5 Compare verse

ESV	Ezekiel	26	26	( A ) In the eleventh year , on the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	26	2	( B ) “ Son of man , because ( C ) Tyre said concerning Jerusalem , ( D ) ‘ Aha , the gate of the peoples is broken ; it has swung open to me . I shall be replenished , now that she is laid waste , ’
ESV	Ezekiel	26	3	therefore thus says the Lord God : ( E ) Behold , I am against you , O Tyre , and will bring up ( F ) many nations against you , ( G ) as the sea brings up its waves .
ESV	Ezekiel	26	4	They shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers , and I will scrape her soil from her and ( H ) make her a bare rock .
ESV	Ezekiel	26	5	She ( I ) shall be in the midst of the sea a place for the spreading of nets , ( J ) for I have spoken , declares the Lord God . And she shall become plunder for the nations ,
ESV	Ezekiel	26	6	and her daughters on the mainland shall be killed by the sword . ( K ) Then they will know that I am the Lord .
ESV	Ezekiel	26	7	“ For thus says the Lord God : ( L ) Behold , I will bring against Tyre ( M ) from the north Nebuchadnezzar [ a ] king of Babylon , ( N ) king of kings , with horses and chariots , and with horsemen and a host of many soldiers .
ESV	Ezekiel	26	8	He will kill with the sword ( O ) your daughters on the mainland . ( P ) He will set up a siege wall against you and throw up a mound against you , and raise ( Q ) a roof of shields against you .
ESV	Ezekiel	26	9	( R ) He will direct the shock of his battering rams against your walls , and with his axes he will break down your towers .
ESV	Ezekiel	26	10	His horses will be so many that their dust will cover you . Your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen and wagons and chariots , when he enters your gates as men enter a city that has been breached .

ESV	Ezekiel	26	14	( X ) I will make you a bare rock . ( Y ) You shall be a place for the spreading of nets . You shall never be rebuilt , ( Z ) for I am the Lord ; I have spoken , declares the Lord God .
ESV	Ezekiel	26	15	“ Thus says the Lord God to Tyre : Will not ( AA ) the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall , ( AB ) when the wounded groan , when slaughter is made in your midst ?
ESV	Ezekiel	26	16	Then all ( AC ) the princes of the sea will step down from their thrones and ( AD ) remove their robes and strip off their embroidered garments . They will clothe themselves with trembling ; ( AE ) they will sit on the ground and ( AF ) tremble every moment and ( AG ) be appalled at you .
ESV	Ezekiel	26	17	And they will ( AH ) raise a lamentation over you and say to you , “ ‘ How you have perished , you who were inhabited from the seas , O city renowned , ( AI ) who was mighty on the sea ; she and her inhabitants ( AJ ) imposed their terror on all her inhabitants !
ESV	Ezekiel	26	18	Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall , and the coastlands that are on the sea are dismayed at your passing. ’
ESV	Ezekiel	26	19	“ For thus says the Lord God : When I make you a city laid waste , like the cities that are not inhabited , ( AK ) when I bring up the deep over you , and the great waters cover you ,
ESV	Ezekiel	26	20	then ( AL ) I will make you go down with those who go down to the pit , to the people of old , and I will make you to dwell in the world below , among ruins from of old , ( AM ) with those who go down to the pit , so that you will not be inhabited ; but I will set beauty ( AN ) in the land of the living .

ESV	Ezekiel	28	28	The word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	28	2	( A ) “ Son of man , say to ( B ) the prince of Tyre , Thus says the Lord God : ( C ) “ Because your heart is proud , and ( D ) you have said , ‘ I am a god , I sit in the seat of the gods , in the heart of the seas , ’ yet ( E ) you are but a man , and no god , ( F ) though you make your heart like the heart of a god—
ESV	Ezekiel	28	3	( G ) you are indeed wiser ( H ) than ( I ) Daniel ; no secret is hidden from you ;
ESV	Ezekiel	28	4	by your wisdom and your understanding ( J ) you have made wealth for yourself , and have gathered gold and silver into your treasuries ;
ESV	Ezekiel	28	5	by your great wisdom in your trade you have increased your wealth , and ( K ) your heart has become proud in your wealth—
ESV	Ezekiel	28	6	therefore thus says the Lord God : ( L ) Because you make your heart like the heart of a god ,
ESV	Ezekiel	28	7	therefore , behold , I will bring ( M ) foreigners upon you , the most ruthless of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against ( N ) the beauty of your wisdom and defile ( O ) your splendor .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	8	( P ) They shall thrust you down into the pit , ( Q ) and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	9	( R ) Will you still say , ‘ I am a god , ’ in the presence of those who kill you , though ( S ) you are but a man , and no god , in the hands of those who slay you ?
ESV	Ezekiel	28	10	( T ) You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners ; ( U ) for I have spoken , declares the Lord God. ” A Lament over the King of Tyre
ESV	Ezekiel	28	11	Moreover , the word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	28	12	( V ) “ Son of man , ( W ) raise a lamentation over ( X ) the king of Tyre , and say to him , Thus says the Lord God : “ You were the signet of perfection , [ a ] ( Y ) full of wisdom and ( Z ) perfect in beauty .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	13	You were in ( AA ) Eden , the garden of God ; ( AB ) every precious stone was your covering , ( AC ) sardius , topaz , and diamond , beryl , onyx , and jasper , sapphire , [ b ] ( AD ) emerald , and carbuncle ; and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings . [ c ] ( AE ) On the day that you were created they were prepared .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	14	You were an anointed ( AF ) guardian cherub . I placed you ; [ d ] you were on ( AG ) the holy mountain of God ; in the midst of the stones of fire you walked .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	15	You were blameless in your ways ( AH ) from the day you were created , till unrighteousness was found in you .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	16	In the abundance of ( AI ) your trade you were filled with violence in your midst , and you sinned ; so I cast you as a profane thing from ( AJ ) the mountain of God , and I destroyed you , [ e ] ( AK ) O guardian cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	17	( AL ) Your heart was proud because of ( AM ) your beauty ; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor . I cast you to the ground ; I exposed you before kings , to feast their eyes on you .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	18	By the multitude of your iniquities , in the unrighteousness of your trade you profaned your sanctuaries ; so ( AN ) I brought fire out from your midst ; it consumed you , and I turned you to ashes on the earth ( AO ) in the sight of all who saw you .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	19	All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you ; ( AP ) you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever. ” Prophecy Against Sidon
ESV	Ezekiel	28	20	The word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	28	21	( AQ ) “ Son of man , ( AR ) set your face toward ( AS ) Sidon , and ( AT ) prophesy against her
ESV	Ezekiel	28	22	and say , Thus says the Lord God : “ Behold , ( AU ) I am against you , O Sidon , and ( AV ) I will manifest my glory in your midst . And ( AW ) they shall know that I am the Lord ( AX ) when I execute judgments in her and ( AY ) manifest my holiness in her ;
ESV	Ezekiel	28	23	for I will send ( AZ ) pestilence into her , and blood into her streets ; and the slain shall fall in her midst , by the sword that is against her on every side . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	24	“ And for the house of Israel ( BA ) there shall be no more a brier to prick or ( BB ) a thorn to hurt them among all their neighbors ( BC ) who have treated them with contempt . Then they will know that I am the Lord God . Israel Gathered in Security
ESV	Ezekiel	28	25	“ Thus says the Lord God : ( BD ) When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered , and ( BE ) manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations , ( BF ) then they shall dwell in their own land that I gave to my servant Jacob .
ESV	Ezekiel	28	26	( BG ) And they shall dwell securely in it , and they shall build houses and plant vineyards .

ESV	Ezekiel	29	29	( A ) In the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twelfth day of the month , the word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	29	2	( B ) “ Son of man , ( C ) set your face against ( D ) Pharaoh king of Egypt , ( E ) and prophesy against him and ( F ) against all Egypt ;
ESV	Ezekiel	29	3	speak , and say , Thus says the Lord God : ( G ) “ Behold , I am against you , Pharaoh king of Egypt , ( H ) the great dragon that lies in the midst of his streams , ( I ) that says , ‘ My Nile is my own ; I made it for myself. ’
ESV	Ezekiel	29	4	I will ( J ) put hooks in your jaws , and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales ; and I will draw you up out of the midst of your streams , with all the fish of your streams that stick to your scales .
ESV	Ezekiel	29	5	( K ) And I will cast you out into the wilderness , you and all the fish of your streams ; you shall fall ( L ) on the open field , and ( M ) not be brought together or gathered . To the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens ( N ) I give you as food .
ESV	Ezekiel	29	6	Then all the inhabitants of Egypt ( O ) shall know that I am the Lord . “ Because you [ a ] have been ( P ) a staff of reed to the house of Israel ,
ESV	Ezekiel	29	7	( Q ) when they grasped you with the hand , you broke and tore all their shoulders ; and when they leaned on you , you broke and made all their loins to shake . [ b ]
ESV	Ezekiel	29	8	Therefore thus says the Lord God : ( R ) Behold , I will bring a sword upon you , and will cut off from you man and beast ,
ESV	Ezekiel	29	9	and the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste . ( S ) Then they will know that I am the Lord . ( T ) “ Because you [ c ] said , ‘ The Nile is mine , and I made it , ’
ESV	Ezekiel	29	10	therefore , ( U ) behold , I am against you and ( V ) against your streams , and ( W ) I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation , ( X ) from Migdol to Syene , as far as the border of Cush .
ESV	Ezekiel	29	11	( Y ) No foot of man shall pass through it , and no foot of beast shall pass through it ; it shall be uninhabited forty years .
ESV	Ezekiel	29	12	( Z ) And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries , and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste . ( AA ) I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and disperse them through the countries .
ESV	Ezekiel	29	13	“ For thus says the Lord God : At the end of forty years ( AB ) I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered ,
ESV	Ezekiel	29	14	and ( AC ) I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to ( AD ) the land of Pathros , the land of their origin , and there they shall be a lowly kingdom .
ESV	Ezekiel	29	15	It shall be the most lowly of the kingdoms , ( AE ) and never again exalt itself above the nations . And I will make them so small that they will never again rule over the nations .
ESV	Ezekiel	29	16	And it shall never again be ( AF ) the reliance of the house of Israel , recalling their iniquity , when they turn to them for aid . ( AG ) Then they will know that I am the Lord God. ”
ESV	Ezekiel	29	17	( AH ) In the twenty-seventh year , in the first month , on the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	29	18	( AI ) “ Son of man , ( AJ ) Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre . Every head was made bald , and every shoulder was rubbed bare , yet neither he nor his army got anything from Tyre to pay for the labor that he had performed against her .
ESV	Ezekiel	29	19	Therefore thus says the Lord God : ( AK ) Behold , I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ; ( AL ) and he shall carry off its wealth [ d ] ( AM ) and despoil it and plunder it ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
ESV	Ezekiel	29	20	( AN ) I have given him the land of Egypt as his payment for which he labored , because they worked for me , declares the Lord God .

ESV	Ezekiel	31	31	( A ) In the eleventh year , in the third month , on the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	31	2	( B ) “ Son of man , say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to ( C ) his multitude : ( D ) “ Whom are you like in your greatness ?
ESV	Ezekiel	31	3	Behold , ( E ) Assyria was a ( F ) cedar in ( G ) Lebanon , with beautiful branches and ( H ) forest shade , ( I ) and of towering height , its top among the clouds . [ a ]
ESV	Ezekiel	31	4	The waters nourished it ; the deep made it grow tall , making ( J ) its rivers flow around the place of its planting , sending forth its streams to all the trees of the field .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	5	So ( K ) it towered high above all the trees of the field ; its boughs grew large and its branches long from ( L ) abundant water in its shoots .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	6	( M ) All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs ; under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth to their young , and under its shadow lived all great nations .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	7	It was ( N ) beautiful in its greatness , in the length of its branches ; ( O ) for its roots went down to abundant waters .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	8	( P ) The cedars ( Q ) in the garden of God could not rival it , nor the fir trees equal its boughs ; neither were the plane trees like its branches ; no tree ( R ) in the garden of God was its equal in beauty .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	9	I made it beautiful in the mass of its branches , and all the trees of ( S ) Eden envied it , that were in the garden of God .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	10	“ Therefore thus says the Lord God : Because ( T ) it [ b ] towered high and set its top among the clouds , [ c ] and ( U ) its heart was proud of its height ,
ESV	Ezekiel	31	11	I will give it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations . He shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves . I have cast it out .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	12	( V ) Foreigners , ( W ) the most ruthless of nations , have cut it down and left it . ( X ) On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen , and its boughs have been broken in all ( Y ) the ravines of the land , and ( Z ) all the peoples of the earth have gone away from its shadow and left it .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	13	( AA ) On its fallen trunk dwell all the birds of the heavens , and on its branches are all the beasts of the field .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	14	( AB ) All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to towering height or set their tops among the clouds , [ d ] and that no trees that drink water may reach up to them in height . For they are all given over to death , ( AC ) to the world ( AD ) below , among the children of man , [ e ] with those who go down to the pit .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	15	“ Thus says the Lord God : On the day ( AE ) the cedar [ f ] went down to Sheol I caused mourning ; I closed the deep over it , and restrained its rivers , and many waters were stopped . I clothed Lebanon in gloom for it , and all the trees of the field fainted because of it .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	16	( AF ) I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall , ( AG ) when I cast it down to Sheol with those who go down to the pit . ( AH ) And all the trees of Eden , the choice and best of Lebanon , all that drink water , ( AI ) were comforted in the world below .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	17	They also went down to Sheol with it , ( AJ ) to those who are slain by the sword ; yes , ( AK ) those who were its arm , ( AL ) who lived under its shadow among the nations .
ESV	Ezekiel	31	18	( AM ) “ Whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness ( AN ) among the trees of Eden ? ( AO ) You shall be brought down with ( AP ) the trees of Eden to the world below .

ESV	Ezekiel	33	4	then if anyone who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning , and the sword comes and takes him away , ( F ) his blood shall be upon his own head .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	5	( G ) He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning ; his blood shall be upon himself . But if he had taken warning , he would have saved his life .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	6	( H ) But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet , so that the people are not warned , and the sword comes and takes any one of them , ( I ) that person is taken away in his iniquity , but his blood I will require at the watchman 's hand .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	7	( J ) “ So you , ( K ) son of man , I have made a watchman for the house of Israel . ( L ) Whenever you hear a word from my mouth , you shall give them warning from me .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	8	( M ) If I say to the wicked , O wicked one , you shall surely die , ( N ) and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way , ( O ) that wicked person shall die in his iniquity , but his blood I will require at your hand .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	9	( P ) But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way , and he does not turn from his way , ( Q ) that person shall die in his iniquity , ( R ) but you will have delivered your soul . Why Will You Die , Israel ?
ESV	Ezekiel	33	10	“ And you , ( S ) son of man , say to the house of Israel , Thus have you said : ‘ Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us , and ( T ) we rot away because of them . ( U ) How then can we live ? ’
ESV	Ezekiel	33	11	Say to them , ( V ) As I live , declares the Lord God , ( W ) I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked , but that the wicked turn from his way and live ; ( X ) turn back , turn back from your evil ways , ( Y ) for why will you die , O house of Israel ?
ESV	Ezekiel	33	12	( Z ) “ And you , son of man , say to ( AA ) your people , ( AB ) The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him when he transgresses , ( AC ) and as for the wickedness of the wicked , he shall not fall by it when he turns from his wickedness , ( AD ) and the righteous shall not be able to live by his righteousness [ a ] when he sins .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	13	Though I say to the righteous that he shall surely live , yet ( AE ) if he trusts in his righteousness and does injustice , none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered , but in his injustice that he has done he shall die .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	14	Again , ( AF ) though I say to the wicked , ( AG ) ‘ You shall surely die , ’ yet ( AH ) if he turns from his sin and does what is just and right ,
ESV	Ezekiel	33	15	if the wicked ( AI ) restores the pledge , ( AJ ) gives back what he has taken by robbery , and walks ( AK ) in the statutes of life , not doing injustice , he shall surely live ; he shall not die .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	16	( AL ) None of the sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him . He has done what is just and right ; he shall surely live .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	17	“ Yet ( AM ) your people say , ( AN ) ‘ The way of the Lord is not just , ’ when it is their own way that is not just .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	18	( AO ) When the righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice , he shall die for it .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	19	And ( AP ) when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right , he shall live by this .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	20	Yet you say , ‘ The way of the Lord is not just. ’ O house of Israel , ( AQ ) I will judge each of you according to his ways. ” Jerusalem Struck Down
ESV	Ezekiel	33	21	In the ( AR ) twelfth year ( AS ) of our exile , in the tenth month , on the fifth day of the month , ( AT ) a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me and said , ( AU ) “ The city has been struck down. ”
ESV	Ezekiel	33	22	( AV ) Now ( AW ) the hand of the Lord had been upon me the evening before the fugitive came ; and he had opened my mouth by the time the man came to me in the morning , so my mouth was opened , and I was no longer mute .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	23	The word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	33	24	( AX ) “ Son of man , the inhabitants of these ( AY ) waste places in the land of Israel keep saying , ( AZ ) ‘ Abraham was only one man , yet he got possession of the land ; but ( BA ) we are many ; the land is surely given us to possess. ’
ESV	Ezekiel	33	25	Therefore say to them , Thus says the Lord God : ( BB ) You eat flesh with the blood and ( BC ) lift up your eyes to your idols and ( BD ) shed blood ; shall you then possess the land ?
ESV	Ezekiel	33	26	( BE ) You rely on the sword , ( BF ) you commit abominations , and ( BG ) each of you defiles his neighbor 's wife ; shall you then possess the land ?
ESV	Ezekiel	33	27	Say this to them , Thus says the Lord God : ( BH ) As I live , surely those who are in ( BI ) the waste places shall fall by ( BJ ) the sword , and whoever is in the open field I will give to ( BK ) the beasts to be devoured , and those who are in ( BL ) strongholds and in caves shall die by ( BM ) pestilence .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	28	( BN ) And I will make the land a desolation and a waste , and ( BO ) her proud might shall come to an end , and ( BP ) the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that none will pass through .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	29	( BQ ) Then they will know that I am the Lord , when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	30	“ As for you , ( BR ) son of man , ( BS ) your people who talk together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses , say to one another , each to his brother , ‘ Come , and hear what the word is that comes from the Lord. ’
ESV	Ezekiel	33	31	( BT ) And they come to you as people come , and they sit before you as my people , and they hear what you say but they will not do it ; for ( BU ) with lustful talk in their mouths they act ; their heart is set on their gain .
ESV	Ezekiel	33	32	And behold , you are to them like one who sings lustful songs with a beautiful voice and ( BV ) plays [ b ] well on an instrument , for ( BW ) they hear what you say , but they will not do it .

ESV	Ezekiel	34	34	The word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	34	2	( A ) “ Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel ; prophesy , and say to them , even to the shepherds , Thus says the Lord God : ( B ) Ah , shepherds of Israel ( C ) who have been feeding yourselves ! ( D ) Should not shepherds feed the sheep ?
ESV	Ezekiel	34	3	( E ) You eat the fat , you clothe yourselves with the wool , ( F ) you slaughter the fat ones , but you do not feed the sheep .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	4	( G ) The weak you have not strengthened , the sick you have not healed , ( H ) the injured you have not bound up , ( I ) the strayed you have not brought back , ( J ) the lost you have not sought , and with force and ( K ) harshness you have ruled them .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	5	( L ) So they were scattered , because there was no shepherd , and ( M ) they became food for all the wild beasts . My sheep were scattered ;
ESV	Ezekiel	34	6	they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill . My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth , ( N ) with none to search or seek for them .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	7	“ Therefore , you shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
ESV	Ezekiel	34	8	( O ) As I live , declares the Lord God , surely because ( P ) my sheep have become a prey , and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts , since there was no shepherd , and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep , but the shepherds have fed themselves , and have not fed my sheep ,
ESV	Ezekiel	34	9	therefore , you shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
ESV	Ezekiel	34	10	Thus says the Lord God , ( Q ) Behold , I am against the shepherds , and ( R ) I will require my sheep at their hand and ( S ) put a stop to their feeding the sheep . ( T ) No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves . ( U ) I will rescue my sheep from their mouths , that they may not be food for them . The Lord God Will Seek Them Out
ESV	Ezekiel	34	11	“ For thus says the Lord God : ( V ) Behold , I , I ( W ) myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	12	As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered , so will I seek out my sheep , and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on ( X ) a day of clouds and ( Y ) thick darkness .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	13	And I will bring them out from the peoples ( Z ) and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land . And I will feed them on ( AA ) the mountains of Israel , by the ravines , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	14	( AB ) I will feed them with good pasture , and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land . ( AC ) There they shall lie down in good grazing land , and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	15	( AD ) I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep , ( AE ) and I myself will make them lie down , declares the Lord God .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	16	( AF ) I will seek the lost , ( AG ) and I will bring back the strayed , and I will bind up the injured , and I will strengthen the weak , and ( AH ) the fat and the strong I will destroy . [ a ] I will feed them in justice .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	17	“ As for you , my flock , thus says the Lord God : ( AI ) Behold , I judge between sheep and sheep , between rams and ( AJ ) male goats .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	18	Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture , that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture ; and to drink of ( AK ) clear water , that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet ?
ESV	Ezekiel	34	19	And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet , and drink what you have muddied with your feet ?
ESV	Ezekiel	34	20	“ Therefore , thus says the Lord God to them : Behold , I , I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	21	Because you push with side and shoulder , and ( AL ) thrust at all the ( AM ) weak with your horns , till you have scattered them abroad ,
ESV	Ezekiel	34	22	I will rescue [ b ] my flock ; ( AN ) they shall no longer be a prey . And I will judge between sheep and sheep .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	23	And ( AO ) I will set up over them one shepherd , ( AP ) my servant David , and he shall feed them : he shall feed them and be their shepherd .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	24	And ( AQ ) I , the Lord , will be their God , and my servant David shall be prince among them . ( AR ) I am the Lord ; I have spoken . The Lord 's Covenant of Peace
ESV	Ezekiel	34	25	( AS ) “ I will make with them a covenant of peace and ( AT ) banish wild beasts from the land , ( AU ) so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	26	And I will make them and the places all around my hill ( AV ) a blessing , and ( AW ) I will send down the showers in their season ; they shall be ( AX ) showers of blessing .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	27	( AY ) And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit , and the earth shall yield its increase , ( AZ ) and they shall be secure in their land . And ( BA ) they shall know that I am the Lord , when ( BB ) I break the bars of their yoke , and ( BC ) deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	28	( BD ) They shall no more be a prey to the nations , ( BE ) nor shall the beasts of the land devour them . ( BF ) They shall dwell securely , and none shall make them afraid .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	29	And I will provide for them ( BG ) renowned plantations so that ( BH ) they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land , and no longer ( BI ) suffer the reproach of the nations .
ESV	Ezekiel	34	30	And they shall know that ( BJ ) I am the Lord their God with them , and that they , the house of Israel , are my people , declares the Lord God .

ESV	Ezekiel	36	16	The word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	36	17	( AJ ) “ Son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , ( AK ) they defiled it by their ways and their deeds . Their ways before me were ( AL ) like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity .

ESV	Ezekiel	38	38	The word of the Lord came to me :
ESV	Ezekiel	38	2	( A ) “ Son of man , ( B ) set your face toward ( C ) Gog , of the land of ( D ) Magog , the ( E ) chief prince of ( F ) Meshech [ a ] and ( G ) Tubal , and ( H ) prophesy against him
ESV	Ezekiel	38	3	and say , Thus says the Lord God : Behold , ( I ) I am against you , O Gog , chief prince of Meshech [ b ] and Tubal .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	4	( J ) And I will turn you about and ( K ) put hooks into your jaws , and I will bring you out , and ( L ) all your army , horses and horsemen , all of them clothed in full armor , a great host , all of them with buckler and shield , wielding swords .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	5	( M ) Persia , ( N ) Cush , and ( O ) Put are with them , all of them with shield and helmet ;
ESV	Ezekiel	38	6	( P ) Gomer and all his ( Q ) hordes ; ( R ) Beth-togarmah from ( S ) the uttermost parts of the north with all his hordes— ( T ) many peoples are with you .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	7	( U ) “ Be ready and keep ready , you and all your hosts that are assembled about you , and be a guard for them .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	8	( V ) After many days you will be mustered . ( W ) In the latter years you will go against ( X ) the land that is restored from war , the land whose people ( Y ) were gathered from many peoples upon ( Z ) the mountains of Israel , which had been a continual waste . Its people were brought out from the peoples and ( AA ) now dwell securely , all of them .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	9	You will advance , coming on ( AB ) like a storm . You will be ( AC ) like a cloud covering the land , you and all your ( AD ) hordes , and many peoples with you .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	10	“ Thus says the Lord God : On that day , ( AE ) thoughts will come into your mind , and you will devise an evil scheme
ESV	Ezekiel	38	11	and say , ‘ I will go up against ( AF ) the land of unwalled villages . I will fall upon ( AG ) the quiet people who dwell securely , all of them dwelling without walls , and having no bars or gates , ’
ESV	Ezekiel	38	12	to seize spoil and carry off plunder , to turn your hand against ( AH ) the waste places that are now inhabited , and ( AI ) the people who were gathered from the nations , who have acquired livestock and goods , ( AJ ) who dwell at the center of the earth .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	13	( AK ) Sheba and ( AL ) Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all ( AM ) its leaders [ c ] will say to you , ‘ Have you come to seize spoil ? Have you assembled your hosts to carry off plunder , to carry away silver and gold , to take away livestock and goods , to seize great spoil ? ’
ESV	Ezekiel	38	14	“ Therefore , ( AN ) son of man , prophesy , and say to ( AO ) Gog , Thus says the Lord God : On that day when my people Israel are ( AP ) dwelling securely , ( AQ ) will you not know it ?
ESV	Ezekiel	38	15	You will come from your place out of ( AR ) the uttermost parts of the north , you and ( AS ) many peoples with you , ( AT ) all of them riding on horses , a great host , a mighty army .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	16	You will come up against my people Israel , ( AU ) like a cloud covering the land . ( AV ) In the latter days I will bring you against my land , that the nations may know me , when through you , O Gog , ( AW ) I vindicate my holiness before their eyes .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	17	“ Thus says the Lord God : Are you ( AX ) he of whom I spoke in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel , who in those days prophesied for years that I would bring you against them ?
ESV	Ezekiel	38	18	But on that day , the day that Gog shall come against the land of Israel , declares the Lord God , ( AY ) my wrath will be roused in my anger .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	19	For ( AZ ) in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare , On that day ( BA ) there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	20	( BB ) The fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep on the ground , and all the people who are on the face of the earth , ( BC ) shall quake at my presence . And ( BD ) the mountains shall be thrown down , and the cliffs shall fall , and every wall shall tumble to the ground .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	21	( BE ) I will summon a sword against Gog [ d ] on all my mountains , declares the Lord God . ( BF ) Every man 's sword will be against his brother .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	22	With pestilence and bloodshed ( BG ) I will enter into judgment with him , and ( BH ) I will rain upon him and ( BI ) his hordes and the many peoples who are with him ( BJ ) torrential rains and hailstones , ( BK ) fire and sulfur .
ESV	Ezekiel	38	23	So I will show my greatness and my ( BL ) holiness and ( BM ) make myself known in the eyes of many nations . Then ( BN ) they will know that I am the Lord .

ESV	Ezekiel	39	28	( BL ) Then they shall know that I am the Lord their God , because I sent them into exile among the nations and then assembled them into their own land . I will leave none of them remaining among the nations anymore .

ESV	Daniel	1	1	In the third year of ( A ) the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it .
ESV	Daniel	1	2	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , with some of ( B ) the vessels of the house of God . And he brought them to ( C ) the land of Shinar , to the house of his god , ( D ) and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god .
ESV	Daniel	1	3	Then the king commanded Ashpenaz , ( E ) his chief eunuch , to bring some of the people of Israel , both of the royal family [ a ] and of ( F ) the nobility ,
ESV	Daniel	1	4	youths without ( G ) blemish , of good appearance and ( H ) skillful in all wisdom , endowed with knowledge , understanding learning , and competent to stand in the king 's palace , and to ( I ) teach them the literature and language of the ( J ) Chaldeans .
ESV	Daniel	1	5	The king assigned them a daily portion of ( K ) the food that the king ate , and of ( L ) the wine that he drank . They were to be educated for ( M ) three years , and at the end of that time they were to ( N ) stand before the king .
ESV	Daniel	1	6	Among these were ( O ) Daniel , ( P ) Hananiah , ( Q ) Mishael , and ( R ) Azariah of the tribe of Judah .
ESV	Daniel	1	7	And ( S ) the chief of the eunuchs ( T ) gave them names : ( U ) Daniel he called Belteshazzar , Hananiah he called Shadrach , Mishael he called Meshach , and Azariah he called Abednego . Daniel 's Faithfulness
ESV	Daniel	1	8	But Daniel ( V ) resolved that he would not ( W ) defile himself with ( X ) the king 's food , or with ( Y ) the wine that he drank . Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to ( Z ) defile himself .
ESV	Daniel	1	9	( AA ) And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs ,
ESV	Daniel	1	10	and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel , “ I fear my lord the king , who assigned your food and your drink ; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age ? So you would endanger my head with the king. ”
ESV	Daniel	1	11	Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ,
ESV	Daniel	1	12	“ Test your servants for ( AB ) ten days ; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink .
ESV	Daniel	1	13	Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat ( AC ) the king 's food be observed by you , and deal with your servants according to what you see. ”
ESV	Daniel	1	14	So he listened to them in this matter , and tested them for ten days .
ESV	Daniel	1	15	At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate ( AD ) the king 's food .
ESV	Daniel	1	16	( AE ) So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink , and gave them ( AF ) vegetables .
ESV	Daniel	1	17	As for these four youths , ( AG ) God gave them learning and ( AH ) skill in all literature and wisdom , and Daniel had ( AI ) understanding in all visions and dreams .
ESV	Daniel	1	18	At the end of ( AJ ) the time , when the king had commanded that they should be brought in , the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
ESV	Daniel	1	19	And the king spoke with them , and among all of them none was found like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah . Therefore ( AK ) they stood before the king .
ESV	Daniel	1	20	And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them , he found them ten times better than all ( AL ) the magicians and ( AM ) enchanters that were in all his kingdom .

ESV	Daniel	2	2	Then the king commanded that ( C ) the magicians , ( D ) the enchanters , the ( E ) sorcerers , and ( F ) the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams . So they came in and ( G ) stood before the king .
ESV	Daniel	2	3	And the king said to them , “ I had a dream , and ( H ) my spirit is troubled to know the dream. ”
ESV	Daniel	2	4	Then ( I ) the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic , [ a ] ( J ) “ O king , live forever ! Tell your servants the dream , and we will show the interpretation. ”
ESV	Daniel	2	5	The king answered and said to ( K ) the Chaldeans , “ The word from me is firm : if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation , you shall be ( L ) torn limb from limb , ( M ) and your ( N ) houses shall be laid in ruins .
ESV	Daniel	2	6	But if you show the dream and its interpretation , ( O ) you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor . ( P ) Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation. ”
ESV	Daniel	2	7	is in Aramaic - Daniel 2:15 Aramaic answered and said ; also verse
ESV	Daniel	2	8	The king answered and said , “ I know with certainty that you are trying to ( Q ) gain time , because you see that the word from me is firm—
ESV	Daniel	2	9	if you do not make the dream known to me , ( R ) there is but one sentence for you . You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till ( S ) the times change . ( T ) Therefore tell me the dream , and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation. ”
ESV	Daniel	2	10	( U ) The Chaldeans answered the king and said , “ There is not a man on earth who can meet the king 's demand , for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or ( V ) Chaldean .
ESV	Daniel	2	11	The thing that the king asks is difficult , and no one can show it to the king except ( W ) the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh. ”
ESV	Daniel	2	12	Because of this the king was angry and ( X ) very furious , and ( Y ) commanded that all ( Z ) the wise men of Babylon be destroyed .
ESV	Daniel	2	13	So the decree went out , and the wise men were about to be killed ; and they sought ( AA ) Daniel and his companions , to kill them .
ESV	Daniel	2	14	Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to ( AB ) Arioch , the ( AC ) captain of the king 's guard , who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon .
ESV	Daniel	2	15	He declared [ b ] to Arioch , the king 's captain , “ Why is the decree of the king ( AD ) so urgent ? ” Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel .
ESV	Daniel	2	16	And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time , that he might show the interpretation to the king . God Reveals Nebuchadnezzar 's Dream
ESV	Daniel	2	17	Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to ( AE ) Hananiah , ( AF ) Mishael , and ( AG ) Azariah , his companions ,
ESV	Daniel	2	18	( AH ) and told them to seek mercy from the ( AI ) God of heaven concerning this mystery , so that Daniel and his companions might not ( AJ ) be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
ESV	Daniel	2	19	Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in ( AK ) a vision of the night . Then Daniel ( AL ) blessed the ( AM ) God of heaven .
ESV	Daniel	2	20	Daniel answered and said : ( AN ) “ Blessed be the name of God forever and ever , ( AO ) to whom belong wisdom and might .
ESV	Daniel	2	21	( AP ) He changes times and seasons ; ( AQ ) he removes kings and sets up kings ; ( AR ) he gives wisdom to the wise ( AS ) and knowledge to those who have understanding ;
ESV	Daniel	2	22	( AT ) he reveals deep and hidden things ; ( AU ) he knows what is in the darkness , ( AV ) and the light dwells with him .
ESV	Daniel	2	23	To you , O ( AW ) God of my fathers , ( AX ) I give thanks and praise , for ( AY ) you have given me wisdom and might , and have now made known to me what ( AZ ) we asked of you , for you have made known to us the king 's matter. ”
ESV	Daniel	2	24	Therefore Daniel went in to ( BA ) Arioch , whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon . He went and said thus to him : “ Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon ; bring me in before the king , and I will show the king the interpretation. ”
ESV	Daniel	2	25	Then ( BB ) Arioch brought in Daniel before the king ( BC ) in haste and said thus to him : “ I have found ( BD ) among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation. ”
ESV	Daniel	2	26	- Daniel 2:43 Aramaic by the seed of men The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	Daniel	2	27	Daniel answered the king and said , “ No wise men , ( BG ) enchanters , ( BH ) magicians , or ( BI ) astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked ,
ESV	Daniel	2	28	but ( BJ ) there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries , and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar ( BK ) what will be in the latter days . Your dream and ( BL ) the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these :
ESV	Daniel	2	29	To you , O king , as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this , ( BM ) and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be .
ESV	Daniel	2	30	But ( BN ) as for me , this mystery has been revealed to me , not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living , but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king , and that ( BO ) you may know the thoughts of your mind . Daniel Interprets the Dream
ESV	Daniel	2	31	“ You saw , O king , and behold , a great image . This image , mighty and of exceeding brightness , stood before you , and its appearance was frightening .
ESV	Daniel	2	32	( BP ) The head of this image was of fine gold , ( BQ ) its chest and arms of silver , its middle and ( BR ) thighs of bronze ,
ESV	Daniel	2	33	( BS ) its legs of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of clay .
ESV	Daniel	2	34	As you looked , a stone was cut out ( BT ) by no human hand , and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay , and ( BU ) broke them in pieces .
ESV	Daniel	2	35	Then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and the gold , all together were broken in pieces , and became ( BV ) like the chaff of the summer threshing floors ; and the wind carried them away , so that ( BW ) not a trace of them could be found . But the stone that struck the image became ( BX ) a great mountain ( BY ) and filled the whole earth .
ESV	Daniel	2	36	“ This was the dream . Now we will tell the king its interpretation .
ESV	Daniel	2	37	You , O king , ( BZ ) the king of kings , to whom ( CA ) the God of heaven ( CB ) has given the kingdom , the power , and the might , and the glory ,
ESV	Daniel	2	38	and into whose hand he has given , wherever they dwell , the children of man , ( CC ) the beasts of the field , and the birds of the heavens , making you rule over them all—you are ( CD ) the head of gold .
ESV	Daniel	2	39	( CE ) Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you , and yet a third kingdom ( CF ) of bronze , ( CG ) which shall rule over all the earth .
ESV	Daniel	2	40	And ( CH ) there shall be a fourth kingdom , strong as iron , because iron ( CI ) breaks to pieces and shatters all things . And like iron that crushes , it shall ( CJ ) break and crush all these .
ESV	Daniel	2	41	And as you saw ( CK ) the feet and toes , partly of potter 's clay and partly of iron , it shall be a divided kingdom , but some of the ( CL ) firmness of iron shall be in it , just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay .
ESV	Daniel	2	42	And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay , so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle .
ESV	Daniel	2	43	As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay , so they will mix with one another in marriage , [ c ] but they will not hold together , just as iron does not mix with clay .
ESV	Daniel	2	44	And in the days of those kings ( CM ) the God of heaven will set up ( CN ) a kingdom that shall never be destroyed , nor shall the kingdom be left to another people . ( CO ) It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end , and ( CP ) it shall stand forever ,
ESV	Daniel	2	45	just as ( CQ ) you saw that ( CR ) a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand , and that ( CS ) it broke in pieces the iron , the bronze , the clay , the silver , and the gold . A ( CT ) great God has made known to the king what shall be after this . The dream is certain , and its interpretation sure. ” Daniel Is Promoted
ESV	Daniel	2	46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar ( CU ) fell upon his face and ( CV ) paid homage to Daniel , and commanded that ( CW ) an offering and ( CX ) incense be offered up to him .
ESV	Daniel	2	47	The king answered and said to Daniel , “ Truly , your ( CY ) God is God of gods and ( CZ ) Lord of kings , and ( DA ) a revealer of mysteries , for you have been able to reveal this mystery. ”
ESV	Daniel	2	48	Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great ( DB ) gifts , and made him ruler over the whole ( DC ) province of Babylon and ( DD ) chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon .
ESV	Daniel	2	49	Daniel made a request of the king , and he ( DE ) appointed ( DF ) Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego over the affairs of ( DG ) the province of Babylon . But Daniel ( DH ) remained at the king 's court . Footnotes - Daniel 2:4 The text from this point to the end of chapter

ESV	Daniel	3	3	Then ( E ) the satraps , the prefects , and the governors , the counselors , the treasurers , the justices , the magistrates , and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up .

ESV	Daniel	3	2	Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather ( C ) the satraps , the prefects , and ( D ) the governors , the counselors , the treasurers , the justices , the magistrates , and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
ESV	Daniel	3	4	And the herald ( F ) proclaimed aloud , “ You are commanded , O ( G ) peoples , nations , and languages ,
ESV	Daniel	3	5	that when you hear the ( H ) sound of the horn , pipe , lyre , trigon , harp , bagpipe , and every kind of music , you ( I ) are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up .

ESV	Daniel	3	8	Therefore at that time certain ( L ) Chaldeans ( M ) came forward and maliciously accused the Jews .
ESV	Daniel	3	9	They declared [ b ] to King Nebuchadnezzar , “ O king , live forever !
ESV	Daniel	3	10	You , O king , ( N ) have made a decree , that every man who ( O ) hears the sound of the horn , pipe , lyre , trigon , harp , bagpipe , and every kind of music , ( P ) shall fall down and worship the golden image .
ESV	Daniel	3	11	And whoever does not fall down and worship ( Q ) shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace .
ESV	Daniel	3	12	There are certain Jews whom you have ( R ) appointed over the affairs of ( S ) the province of Babylon : ( T ) Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . These men , O king , ( U ) pay no attention to you ; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up. ”
ESV	Daniel	3	13	Then Nebuchadnezzar ( V ) in furious rage commanded that ( W ) Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego be brought . So they brought these men before the king .
ESV	Daniel	3	14	Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them , “ Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up ?
ESV	Daniel	3	15	Now if you are ready when ( X ) you hear the sound of the horn , pipe , lyre , trigon , harp , bagpipe , and every kind of music , to fall down and worship the image that I have made , well and good . [ c ] But if you do not worship , ( Y ) you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace . And ( Z ) who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands ? ”
ESV	Daniel	3	16	( AA ) Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego answered and said to the king , “ O Nebuchadnezzar , we have no need to answer you in this matter .

ESV	Daniel	3	20	And he ordered some of the mighty men of his army ( AF ) to bind ( AG ) Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
ESV	Daniel	3	21	Then these men were ( AH ) bound in their cloaks , their tunics , [ e ] their hats , and their other garments , and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace .
ESV	Daniel	3	22	Because the king 's order was ( AI ) urgent and the furnace overheated , the flame of the fire killed those men who took up ( AJ ) Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego .
ESV	Daniel	3	23	And these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , fell ( AK ) bound into the burning fiery furnace .

ESV	Daniel	4	5	I saw a dream that made me afraid . As I lay in bed the fancies and ( J ) the visions of my head alarmed me .
ESV	Daniel	4	6	So ( K ) I made a decree that ( L ) all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
ESV	Daniel	4	7	Then ( M ) the magicians , the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the astrologers came in , and I told them the dream , but ( N ) they could not make known to me its interpretation .
ESV	Daniel	4	8	At last Daniel came in before me—he who was named ( O ) Belteshazzar after the name of my god , and in whom is ( P ) the spirit of the holy gods [ c ] —and I told him the dream , saying ,
ESV	Daniel	4	9	,
ESV	Daniel	4	10	( U ) The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these : I saw , and ( V ) behold , a tree in the midst of the earth , and its height was great .
ESV	Daniel	4	11	( W ) The tree grew and became strong , and its top reached to heaven , and it was visible to the end of the whole earth .
ESV	Daniel	4	12	( X ) Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant , and in it was food for all . ( Y ) The beasts of the field found shade under it , and ( Z ) the birds of the heavens lived in its branches , and all flesh was fed from it .
ESV	Daniel	4	13	“ I saw in ( AA ) the visions of my head as I lay in bed , and behold , ( AB ) a watcher , ( AC ) a holy one , came down from heaven .
ESV	Daniel	4	14	He ( AD ) proclaimed aloud and said thus : ( AE ) ‘ Chop down the tree and ( AF ) lop off its branches , ( AG ) strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit . ( AH ) Let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches .
ESV	Daniel	4	15	But leave the stump of its roots in the earth , bound with a band of iron and bronze , amid the tender grass of the field . Let him be wet with the dew of heaven . Let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth .
ESV	Daniel	4	16	Let his mind be changed from a man 's , and let a beast 's mind be given to him ; ( AI ) and let seven periods of time ( AJ ) pass over him .
ESV	Daniel	4	17	The sentence is by the decree of ( AK ) the watchers , the decision by the word of ( AL ) the holy ones , to the end that the living may know that the Most High ( AM ) rules the kingdom of men ( AN ) and gives it to whom he will and ( AO ) sets over it the lowliest of men. ’

ESV	Daniel	4	19	Then Daniel , whose name was ( AS ) Belteshazzar , was ( AT ) dismayed for a while , and ( AU ) his thoughts alarmed him . The king answered and said , “ Belteshazzar , let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you. ” Belteshazzar answered and said , “ My lord , ( AV ) may the dream be for those who hate you ( AW ) and its interpretation for your enemies !
ESV	Daniel	4	20	( AX ) The tree you saw , which grew and became strong , so that its top reached to heaven , and it was visible to the end of the whole earth ,
ESV	Daniel	4	21	( AY ) whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant , and in which was food for all , under which beasts of the field found shade , and in whose branches the birds of the heavens lived—
ESV	Daniel	4	22	( AZ ) it is you , O king , who have grown and become strong . ( BA ) Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven , ( BB ) and your dominion to the ends of the earth .
ESV	Daniel	4	23	And because the king saw ( BC ) a watcher , a holy one , coming down from heaven and saying , ( BD ) ‘ Chop down the tree and destroy it , but leave the stump of its roots in the earth , bound with a band of iron and bronze , in the tender grass of the field , and let him be wet with the dew of heaven , and let his portion be with the beasts of the field , till ( BE ) seven periods of time pass over him , ’
ESV	Daniel	4	24	this is the interpretation , O king : It is a decree of the Most High , which has come upon my lord the king ,
ESV	Daniel	4	25	( BF ) that you shall be driven from among men , and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field . You shall be made ( BG ) to eat grass like an ox , and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven , and ( BH ) seven periods of time shall pass over you , till ( BI ) you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will .
ESV	Daniel	4	26	And as it was commanded ( BJ ) to leave the stump of the roots of the tree , your kingdom shall be confirmed for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules .
ESV	Daniel	4	27	Therefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable to you : break off your sins by ( BK ) practicing righteousness , ( BL ) and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed , ( BM ) that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your prosperity. ” Nebuchadnezzar 's Humiliation
ESV	Daniel	4	28	All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar .
ESV	Daniel	4	29	At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon ,
ESV	Daniel	4	30	and the king answered and said , ( BN ) “ Is not this great Babylon , which I have built by ( BO ) my mighty power as a royal residence and for ( BP ) the glory of my majesty ? ”
ESV	Daniel	4	31	( BQ ) While the words were still in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from heaven , “ O King Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : The kingdom has departed from you ,
ESV	Daniel	4	32	( BR ) and you shall be driven from among men , and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field . And you shall be made to eat grass like an ox , and seven periods of time shall pass over you , ( BS ) until you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will. ”
ESV	Daniel	4	33	Immediately the word was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar . ( BT ) He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles ' feathers , and his nails were like birds ' claws . Nebuchadnezzar Restored
ESV	Daniel	4	34	( BU ) At the end of the days I , Nebuchadnezzar , lifted my eyes to heaven , and ( BV ) my reason returned to me , and I blessed the Most High , and praised and honored ( BW ) him who lives forever , ( BX ) for his dominion is an everlasting dominion , and ( BY ) his kingdom endures from generation to generation ;
ESV	Daniel	4	35	( BZ ) all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing , and ( CA ) he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth ; ( CB ) and none can stay his hand or ( CC ) say to him , “ What have you done ? ”
ESV	Daniel	4	36	At the same time ( CD ) my reason returned to me , and for ( CE ) the glory of my kingdom , ( CF ) my majesty and splendor returned to me . ( CG ) My counselors and ( CH ) my lords sought me , and I was established in my kingdom , and still more greatness was ( CI ) added to me .
ESV	Daniel	4	37	Now I , Nebuchadnezzar , ( CJ ) praise and extol and honor the ( CK ) King of heaven , ( CL ) for all his works are right and his ways are just ; and ( CM ) those who walk in pride he is able to humble .

ESV	Daniel	5	5	( I ) Immediately ( J ) the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king 's palace , opposite the lampstand . And the king saw ( K ) the hand as it wrote .
ESV	Daniel	5	2	( D ) Belshazzar , when he tasted the wine , commanded that ( E ) the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father [ a ] had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought , that the king and his lords , his wives , and his concubines might drink from them .
ESV	Daniel	5	3	Then they brought in ( F ) the golden vessels that had been taken out of the temple , the house of God in Jerusalem , and the king and his lords , his wives , and his concubines drank from them .
ESV	Daniel	5	4	They drank wine and ( G ) praised the ( H ) gods of gold and silver , bronze , iron , wood , and stone .
ESV	Daniel	5	6	( L ) Then the king 's color changed , ( M ) and his thoughts alarmed him ; ( N ) his limbs gave way , and ( O ) his knees knocked together .
ESV	Daniel	5	7	( P ) The king called loudly to bring in ( Q ) the enchanters , the ( R ) Chaldeans , and ( S ) the astrologers .

ESV	Daniel	5	8	Then all the king 's wise men came in , but ( V ) they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation .
ESV	Daniel	5	9	Then King Belshazzar was greatly ( W ) alarmed , and his ( X ) color changed , and his ( Y ) lords were perplexed .

ESV	Daniel	5	12	( AF ) because an excellent spirit , knowledge , and ( AG ) understanding ( AH ) to interpret dreams , explain riddles , and ( AI ) solve problems were found in this Daniel , ( AJ ) whom the king named Belteshazzar . Now let Daniel be called , and he will show the interpretation. ” Daniel Interprets the Handwriting
ESV	Daniel	5	13	,
ESV	Daniel	5	14	I have heard of you that ( AL ) the spirit of the gods [ e ] is in you , and that ( AM ) light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
ESV	Daniel	5	15	Now ( AN ) the wise men , the ( AO ) enchanters , have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation , but ( AP ) they could not show the interpretation of the matter .
ESV	Daniel	5	16	( AQ ) But I have heard that you can give interpretations and ( AR ) solve problems . ( AS ) Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation , ( AT ) you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck and ( AU ) shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. ”
ESV	Daniel	5	17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king , ( AV ) “ Let your gifts be for yourself , and give your rewards to another . Nevertheless , I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation .
ESV	Daniel	5	18	- Daniel 5:7 Aramaic answered and said ; also verse
ESV	Daniel	5	19	And because of the greatness that he gave him , ( BA ) all peoples , nations , and languages ( BB ) trembled and feared before him . Whom he would , he killed , and whom he would , he kept alive ; whom he would , he raised up , and whom he would , he humbled .
ESV	Daniel	5	20	But ( BC ) when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly , ( BD ) he was brought down from his kingly throne , and his glory was taken from him .
ESV	Daniel	5	21	( BE ) He was driven from among the children of mankind , and his mind was made like that of a beast , and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys . He was fed grass like an ox , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven , ( BF ) until he knew that the ( BG ) Most High God rules the kingdom of mankind and sets over it whom he will .
ESV	Daniel	5	22	And you his son , [ f ] ( BH ) Belshazzar , ( BI ) have not humbled your heart , though you knew all this ,
ESV	Daniel	5	23	but you have lifted up yourself against ( BJ ) the Lord of heaven . And ( BK ) the vessels of his house have been brought in before you , and you and your lords , your wives , and your concubines have drunk wine from them . ( BL ) And you have praised the gods of silver and gold , of bronze , iron , wood , and stone , which do not see or hear or know , ( BM ) but the God in whose hand is your breath , and ( BN ) whose are all your ways , ( BO ) you have not honored .
ESV	Daniel	5	24	“ Then from his presence ( BP ) the hand was sent , and this writing was inscribed .
ESV	Daniel	5	25	And this is the writing that was inscribed : Mene , Mene , Tekel , and Parsin .
ESV	Daniel	5	26	This is the interpretation of the matter : Mene , God has numbered [ g ] the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end ;
ESV	Daniel	5	27	Tekel , ( BQ ) you have been weighed [ h ] in the balances and found wanting ;
ESV	Daniel	5	28	Peres , your kingdom is divided and given to ( BR ) the Medes and ( BS ) Persians. ” [ i ]
ESV	Daniel	5	29	Then ( BT ) Belshazzar gave the command , and Daniel ( BU ) was clothed with purple , a chain of gold was put around his neck , and a proclamation was made about him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
ESV	Daniel	5	30	( BV ) That very night ( BW ) Belshazzar the ( BX ) Chaldean king was killed .

ESV	Daniel	6	6	Then these ( O ) high officials and ( P ) satraps came by agreement [ a ] to the king and said to him , “ O ( Q ) King Darius , live forever !
ESV	Daniel	6	120	( B ) satraps , to be throughout the whole kingdom ;
ESV	Daniel	6	2	and over them ( C ) three high officials , of whom Daniel was one , to whom these ( D ) satraps should give account , so that the king might suffer no loss .
ESV	Daniel	6	3	Then this Daniel became ( E ) distinguished above all ( F ) the other high officials and ( G ) satraps , because ( H ) an excellent spirit was in him . And the king planned ( I ) to set him over the whole kingdom .
ESV	Daniel	6	4	Then ( J ) the high officials and ( K ) the satraps ( L ) sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom , ( M ) but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault , because he was faithful , ( N ) and no error or fault was found in him .
ESV	Daniel	6	5	Then these men said , “ We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God. ”
ESV	Daniel	6	7	All the ( R ) high officials of the kingdom , the prefects and the satraps , the ( S ) counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an ( T ) injunction , that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days , except to you , O king , shall be cast into the den of lions .
ESV	Daniel	6	8	Now , O king , establish ( U ) the injunction and sign the document , so that it can not be changed , according to ( V ) the law of ( W ) the Medes and the Persians , ( X ) which can not be revoked. ”
ESV	Daniel	6	9	Therefore King Darius signed the document and ( Y ) injunction .
ESV	Daniel	6	10	When Daniel knew that the document had been signed , he went to his house where ( Z ) he had windows in his upper chamber open ( AA ) toward Jerusalem . He got down on his knees ( AB ) three times a day and prayed and ( AC ) gave thanks before his God , as he had done previously .
ESV	Daniel	6	11	,
ESV	Daniel	6	12	Then they ( AD ) came near and said before the king , concerning the injunction , “ O king ! Did you not sign ( AE ) an injunction , that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you , O king , shall be cast into the den of lions ? ” The king answered and said , “ The thing stands fast , according to the law of ( AF ) the Medes and Persians , ( AG ) which can not be revoked. ”
ESV	Daniel	6	13	Then they answered and said before the king , ( AH ) “ Daniel , who is one ( AI ) of the exiles ( AJ ) from Judah , ( AK ) pays no attention to you , O king , or ( AL ) the injunction you have signed , but makes his petition ( AM ) three times a day. ”
ESV	Daniel	6	14	Then ( AN ) the king , when he heard these words , ( AO ) was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel . And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him .
ESV	Daniel	6	15	- Daniel 6:16 Aramaic answered and said ; also verse
ESV	Daniel	6	16	Then the king commanded , and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions . The king declared [ b ] to Daniel , “ May ( AQ ) your God , whom you serve continually , deliver you ! ”
ESV	Daniel	6	17	( AR ) And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den , ( AS ) and the king sealed it ( AT ) with his own signet and with the signet of his ( AU ) lords , that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
ESV	Daniel	6	18	Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting ; ( AV ) no diversions were brought to him , and ( AW ) sleep fled from him .
ESV	Daniel	6	19	Then , at break of day , the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions .
ESV	Daniel	6	20	The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :
ESV	Daniel	6	21	Then Daniel said to the king , ( BA ) “ O king , live forever !
ESV	Daniel	6	22	My God ( BB ) sent his angel ( BC ) and shut the lions ' mouths , and they have not harmed me , because I was found blameless ( BD ) before him ; ( BE ) and also before you , O king , I have done no harm. ”
ESV	Daniel	6	23	Then the king was exceedingly glad , and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den . So Daniel was taken up out of the den , and ( BF ) no kind of harm was found on him , because he had trusted in his God .
ESV	Daniel	6	24	And the king commanded , and ( BG ) those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions—they , their children , and their wives . And before they reached the bottom of the den , the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces .
ESV	Daniel	6	25	Then King Darius wrote to all ( BH ) the peoples , nations , and languages ( BI ) that dwell in all the earth : ( BJ ) “ Peace be multiplied to you .
ESV	Daniel	6	26	( BK ) I make a decree , that in all my royal dominion ( BL ) people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel , for ( BM ) he is ( BN ) the living God , enduring forever ; his kingdom shall never be destroyed , ( BO ) and his dominion shall be ( BP ) to the end .
ESV	Daniel	6	27	He delivers and rescues ; he works ( BQ ) signs and wonders in heaven and on earth , he who has ( BR ) saved Daniel from the power of the lions. ”

ESV	Daniel	7	7	After this I saw in the night visions , and behold , a fourth beast , ( I ) terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong . It had great iron teeth ; ( J ) it devoured and broke in pieces ( K ) and stamped what was left with its feet . It was different from all the beasts that were before it , and ( L ) it had ten horns .
ESV	Daniel	7	2	Daniel declared , [ a ] “ I saw in my vision by night , and behold , ( D ) the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea .
ESV	Daniel	7	3	And four great beasts ( E ) came up out of the sea , different from one another .
ESV	Daniel	7	4	The first was like a lion and had eagles ' wings . Then as I looked its wings were plucked off , and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man , and the mind of a man was given to it .
ESV	Daniel	7	5	And behold , ( F ) another beast , a second one , like a bear . It was raised up on one side . It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth ; and it was told , ‘ Arise , devour much flesh. ’
ESV	Daniel	7	6	After this I looked , and behold , another , like a ( G ) leopard , with four wings of a bird on its back . And the beast had four heads , and ( H ) dominion was given to it .
ESV	Daniel	7	8	I considered the horns , and behold , ( M ) there came up among them another horn , a little one , ( N ) before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots . And behold , in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man , and ( O ) a mouth speaking great things . The Ancient of Days Reigns
ESV	Daniel	7	9	“ As I looked , ( P ) thrones were placed , and the ( Q ) Ancient of Days took his seat ; ( R ) his clothing was white as snow , and ( S ) the hair of his head like pure wool ; his throne was fiery flames ; ( T ) its wheels were burning fire .
ESV	Daniel	7	10	( U ) A stream of fire issued and came out from before him ; ( V ) a thousand thousands ( W ) served him , ( X ) and ten thousand times ten thousand ( Y ) stood before him ; the ( Z ) court sat in judgment , and ( AA ) the books were opened .
ESV	Daniel	7	11	“ I looked then because of the sound of ( AB ) the great words that the horn was speaking . And as I looked , ( AC ) the beast was killed , and its body destroyed ( AD ) and given over to be burned with fire .
ESV	Daniel	7	12	As for the rest of the beasts , ( AE ) their dominion was taken away , but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time . The Son of Man Is Given Dominion
ESV	Daniel	7	13	“ I saw in the night visions , and ( AF ) behold , with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man , and he came to the ( AG ) Ancient of Days and was presented before him .
ESV	Daniel	7	14	( AH ) And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom , that all ( AI ) peoples , nations , and languages should serve him ; ( AJ ) his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed . Daniel 's Vision Interpreted
ESV	Daniel	7	15	“ As for me , Daniel , my spirit within me [ b ] was anxious , and ( AK ) the visions of my head alarmed me .
ESV	Daniel	7	16	I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this . So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things .
ESV	Daniel	7	17	( AL ) ‘ These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth .
ESV	Daniel	7	18	But ( AM ) the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever , forever and ever. ’
ESV	Daniel	7	19	“ Then I desired to know the truth about ( AN ) the fourth beast , which was different from all the rest , exceedingly terrifying , with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze , and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet ,
ESV	Daniel	7	20	( AO ) and about the ten horns that were on its head , and the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell , the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things , and that seemed greater than its companions .
ESV	Daniel	7	21	As I looked , this horn ( AP ) made war with the saints and prevailed over them ,
ESV	Daniel	7	22	until the ( AQ ) Ancient of Days came , and ( AR ) judgment was given for the saints of the Most High , and the time came when ( AS ) the saints possessed the kingdom .
ESV	Daniel	7	23	“ Thus he said : ‘ As for ( AT ) the fourth beast , there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth , which shall be different from all the kingdoms , and it shall devour the whole earth , and trample it down , and break it to pieces .
ESV	Daniel	7	24	As for the ten horns , out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise , and another shall arise after them ; he shall be different from the former ones , and shall put down three kings .
ESV	Daniel	7	25	( AU ) He shall speak words against the Most High , and shall wear out the saints of the Most High , and shall think to ( AV ) change the times and the law ; and they shall be given into his hand for ( AW ) a time , times , and half a time .
ESV	Daniel	7	26	( AX ) But the court shall sit in judgment , and ( AY ) his dominion shall be taken away , to be consumed and destroyed ( AZ ) to the end .
ESV	Daniel	7	27	( BA ) And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of ( BB ) the saints of the Most High ; ( BC ) his kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom , and all dominions shall serve and obey him. ’ [ c ]

ESV	Daniel	8	8	Then ( W ) the goat ( X ) became exceedingly great , but when he was strong , the great horn was broken , and instead of it there came up four ( Y ) conspicuous horns toward ( Z ) the four winds of heaven .
ESV	Daniel	8	2	And I saw in the vision ; and when I saw , I was in ( D ) Susa the citadel , which is in the province of ( E ) Elam . And ( F ) I saw in the vision , ( G ) and I was at the ( H ) Ulai canal .
ESV	Daniel	8	3	I raised my eyes and saw , and behold , ( I ) a ram standing on the bank of the canal . It had two horns , and both horns were high , but one was higher than the other , and the higher one came up last .
ESV	Daniel	8	4	I saw ( J ) the ram charging westward and northward and southward . No ( K ) beast ( L ) could stand before him , ( M ) and there was no one who could rescue from his power . ( N ) He did as he pleased and ( O ) became great .
ESV	Daniel	8	5	As I was considering , behold , a ( P ) male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth , without touching the ground . And the goat had ( Q ) a conspicuous horn between his eyes .
ESV	Daniel	8	6	He came to ( R ) the ram with the two horns , which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal , ( S ) and he ran at him in his powerful wrath .
ESV	Daniel	8	7	I saw him come close to the ram , ( T ) and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns . ( U ) And the ram had no power to stand before him , but he ( V ) cast him down to the ground and trampled on him . And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power .
ESV	Daniel	8	9	Out of one of them came ( AA ) a little horn , which grew exceedingly great toward ( AB ) the south , toward the east , and toward ( AC ) the glorious land .
ESV	Daniel	8	10	( AD ) It grew great , ( AE ) even to the host of heaven . And some of the host ( AF ) and some [ a ] of ( AG ) the stars it threw down to the ground and ( AH ) trampled on them .
ESV	Daniel	8	11	( AI ) It became great , even as great as ( AJ ) the Prince of the host . ( AK ) And the regular burnt offering was taken away from him , and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown .
ESV	Daniel	8	12	And a host will be given over to it together with the regular burnt offering because of transgression , [ b ] and it will throw truth to the ground , and ( AL ) it will act and prosper .
ESV	Daniel	8	13	Then I heard ( AM ) a holy one speaking , and another holy one said to the one who spoke , ( AN ) “ For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering , ( AO ) the transgression that makes desolate , and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot ? ”
ESV	Daniel	8	14	And he said to me , [ c ] “ For 2,300 ( AP ) evenings and mornings . Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state. ” The Interpretation of the Vision
ESV	Daniel	8	15	When I , Daniel , had seen the vision , I ( AQ ) sought to understand it . And behold , there stood before me one having ( AR ) the appearance of a man .
ESV	Daniel	8	16	( AS ) And I heard a man 's voice ( AT ) between the banks of the ( AU ) Ulai , and it called , ( AV ) “ Gabriel , make this man understand the vision. ”
ESV	Daniel	8	17	So he came near where I stood . And when he came , ( AW ) I was frightened ( AX ) and fell on my face . But he said to me , “ Understand , ( AY ) O son of man , that the vision is for ( AZ ) the time of the end. ”

ESV	Daniel	9	9	( V ) To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness , for we have rebelled against him
ESV	Daniel	9	2	in the first year of his reign , I , Daniel , perceived in the books the number of years that , according to ( E ) the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet , must pass before the end of the desolations of Jerusalem , namely , seventy years .
ESV	Daniel	9	3	Then I turned my face to the Lord God , seeking him by ( F ) prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes .
ESV	Daniel	9	4	I prayed to the Lord my God and ( G ) made confession , saying , ( H ) “ O Lord , the ( I ) great and awesome God , who ( J ) keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments ,
ESV	Daniel	9	5	( K ) we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly ( L ) and rebelled , turning aside from your commandments and rules .
ESV	Daniel	9	6	( M ) We have not listened to ( N ) your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to ( O ) our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
ESV	Daniel	9	7	To you , ( P ) O Lord , belongs righteousness , but to us open shame , as at this day , to the men of Judah , to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to all Israel , ( Q ) those who are near and ( R ) those who are far away , in ( S ) all the lands to which you have driven them , because of ( T ) the treachery that they have committed against you .
ESV	Daniel	9	8	To us , O Lord , belongs open shame , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers , because ( U ) we have sinned against you .
ESV	Daniel	9	10	( W ) and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by walking in his laws , which he set before us by ( X ) his servants the prophets .
ESV	Daniel	9	11	( Y ) All Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside , ( Z ) refusing to obey your voice . ( AA ) And the curse and oath ( AB ) that are written in the Law of ( AC ) Moses the servant of God have been poured out upon us , because ( AD ) we have sinned against him .
ESV	Daniel	9	12	He has confirmed his words , which he spoke against us and against ( AE ) our rulers who ruled us , [ a ] by ( AF ) bringing upon us a great calamity . ( AG ) For under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what has been done against Jerusalem .
ESV	Daniel	9	13	( AH ) As it is written in the Law of Moses , all this calamity has come upon us ; yet we have not entreated the favor of the Lord our God , ( AI ) turning from our iniquities and gaining insight by your truth .
ESV	Daniel	9	14	( AJ ) Therefore the Lord has kept ready the calamity and has brought it upon us , ( AK ) for the Lord our God is righteous in all the works that he has done , and ( AL ) we have not obeyed his voice .
ESV	Daniel	9	15	And now , O Lord our God , who brought your people out of the land of Egypt ( AM ) with a mighty hand , and ( AN ) have made a name for yourself , as at this day , ( AO ) we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
ESV	Daniel	9	16	“ O Lord , ( AP ) according to all your righteous acts , let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem , ( AQ ) your holy hill , ( AR ) because for our sins , and for ( AS ) the iniquities of our fathers , ( AT ) Jerusalem and your people have become ( AU ) a byword among all who are around us .
ESV	Daniel	9	17	Now therefore , O our God , listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy , and for your own sake , O Lord , [ b ] ( AV ) make your face to shine upon ( AW ) your sanctuary , which is desolate .
ESV	Daniel	9	18	( AX ) O my God , incline your ear and hear . Open your eyes and see ( AY ) our desolations , and ( AZ ) the city that is called by your name . For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness , but because of your great mercy .
ESV	Daniel	9	19	O Lord , hear ; O Lord , forgive . O Lord , pay attention and act . ( BA ) Delay not , ( BB ) for your own sake , O my God , because ( BC ) your city and ( BD ) your people are called by your name. ” Gabriel Brings an Answer
ESV	Daniel	9	20	( BE ) While I was speaking and praying , confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my plea before the Lord my God for ( BF ) the holy hill of my God ,
ESV	Daniel	9	21	while I was speaking in prayer , the man ( BG ) Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the first , ( BH ) came to me in swift flight at ( BI ) the time of the evening sacrifice .
ESV	Daniel	9	22	( BJ ) He made me understand , speaking with me and saying , “ O Daniel , I have now come out to give you ( BK ) insight and understanding .
ESV	Daniel	9	23	( BL ) At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out , ( BM ) and I have come to tell it to you , for ( BN ) you are greatly loved . Therefore consider the word ( BO ) and understand the vision . The Seventy Weeks
ESV	Daniel	9	24	( BP ) “ Seventy weeks [ c ] are decreed about your people and ( BQ ) your holy city , to finish ( BR ) the transgression , to put an end to sin , ( BS ) and to atone for iniquity , ( BT ) to bring in everlasting righteousness , to seal both vision and prophet , and ( BU ) to anoint a most holy place .

ESV	Daniel	10	10	And behold , ( Y ) a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees .
ESV	Daniel	10	2	In those days I , Daniel , was mourning for ( F ) three weeks .
ESV	Daniel	10	3	I ate no delicacies , no meat or wine entered my mouth , nor did I ( G ) anoint myself at all , for ( H ) the full three weeks .
ESV	Daniel	10	4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month , as I was standing ( I ) on the bank of the great river ( ( J ) that is , the Tigris )
ESV	Daniel	10	5	( K ) I lifted up my eyes and looked , and behold , ( L ) a man clothed in linen , ( M ) with a belt of fine ( N ) gold from Uphaz around his waist .
ESV	Daniel	10	6	His body was like ( O ) beryl , his face ( P ) like the appearance of lightning , ( Q ) his eyes like flaming torches , his arms and ( R ) legs like the gleam of burnished bronze , and ( S ) the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude .
ESV	Daniel	10	7	( T ) And I , Daniel , alone saw the vision , for the men who were with me did not see the vision , but a great trembling fell upon them , and they fled to hide themselves .
ESV	Daniel	10	8	So I was left alone and saw this great vision , and ( U ) no strength was left in me . My radiant appearance was fearfully changed , [ b ] ( V ) and I retained no strength .
ESV	Daniel	10	9	Then I heard the sound of his words , ( W ) and as I heard the sound of his words , I fell on my face in deep sleep ( X ) with my face to the ground .
ESV	Daniel	10	11	And he said to me , “ O Daniel , ( Z ) man greatly loved , ( AA ) understand the words that I speak to you , and ( AB ) stand upright , for ( AC ) now I have been sent to you. ” And when he had spoken this word to me , I stood up trembling .
ESV	Daniel	10	12	Then he said to me , ( AD ) “ Fear not , Daniel , for from the first day that you ( AE ) set your heart to understand and ( AF ) humbled yourself before your God , ( AG ) your words have been heard , ( AH ) and I have come because of your words .
ESV	Daniel	10	13	( AI ) The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me ( AJ ) twenty-one days , but ( AK ) Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me , for I was left there with the kings of Persia ,
ESV	Daniel	10	14	( AL ) and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people ( AM ) in the latter days . For ( AN ) the vision is for days yet to come. ”
ESV	Daniel	10	15	When he had spoken to me according to these words , ( AO ) I turned my face toward the ground ( AP ) and was mute .
ESV	Daniel	10	16	And behold , ( AQ ) one in the likeness of the children of man ( AR ) touched my lips . Then I opened my mouth and spoke . I said to him who stood before me , “ O my lord , by reason of the vision pains have come upon me , and ( AS ) I retain no strength .
ESV	Daniel	10	17	How can my lord 's servant talk with my lord ? For now no strength remains in me , and no breath is left in me. ”
ESV	Daniel	10	18	Again ( AT ) one having the appearance of a man ( AU ) touched me and strengthened me .
ESV	Daniel	10	19	And he said , ( AV ) “ O man greatly loved , ( AW ) fear not , peace be with you ; be strong and of good courage. ” And as he spoke to me , I was strengthened and said , “ Let my lord speak , for you have strengthened me. ”
ESV	Daniel	10	20	Then he said , “ Do you know why I have come to you ? But now I will return to fight against the ( AX ) prince of Persia ; and when I go out , behold , the prince of ( AY ) Greece will come .
ESV	Daniel	10	21	But I will tell you ( AZ ) what is inscribed in the book of truth : there is none who contends by my side against these except ( BA ) Michael , your prince .

ESV	Daniel	11	11	Then the king of the south , ( P ) moved with rage , shall come out and fight against the king of the north . ( Q ) And he shall raise a great multitude , but it shall be given into his hand .
ESV	Daniel	11	2	“ And now I will show you ( C ) the truth . Behold , three more kings shall arise in Persia , and a fourth shall be far richer than all of them . And when he has become strong through his riches , he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece .
ESV	Daniel	11	3	Then ( D ) a mighty king shall arise , who shall rule with great dominion and ( E ) do as he wills .
ESV	Daniel	11	4	And as soon as he has arisen , ( F ) his kingdom shall be broken and divided ( G ) toward the ( H ) four winds of heaven , but ( I ) not to his posterity , nor according to the authority with which he ruled , for his kingdom shall be plucked up and go to others besides these .
ESV	Daniel	11	5	“ Then the king of the south shall be strong , but one of his princes shall be stronger than he ( J ) and shall rule , and his authority shall be a great authority .
ESV	Daniel	11	6	After some years ( K ) they shall make an alliance , and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement . But she shall not retain the strength of her arm , and he and his arm shall not endure , but she shall be given up , and her attendants , he who fathered her , and he who supported [ a ] her in those times .
ESV	Daniel	11	7	“ And from a branch from her roots one shall arise in his place . He shall come against the army and enter the ( L ) fortress of the king of the north , and he shall deal with them and shall prevail .
ESV	Daniel	11	8	He shall also carry off to Egypt their gods with their metal images and their precious ( M ) vessels of silver and gold , and for some years he shall refrain from attacking the king of the north .
ESV	Daniel	11	9	Then the latter shall come into the realm of the king of the south but shall return to his own land .
ESV	Daniel	11	10	“ His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces , which shall keep coming ( N ) and overflow and pass through , and again shall carry the war as far as his ( O ) fortress .
ESV	Daniel	11	12	And when the multitude is taken away , his heart shall be exalted , and he shall cast down tens of thousands , but he shall not prevail .
ESV	Daniel	11	13	For the king of the north shall again ( R ) raise a multitude , greater than the first . And ( S ) after some years [ b ] he shall come on with a great army and abundant supplies .
ESV	Daniel	11	14	“ In those times many shall rise against the king of the south , and the violent among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision , but ( T ) they shall fail .
ESV	Daniel	11	15	Then the king of the north shall come and ( U ) throw up siegeworks and take a well-fortified city . And the forces of the south shall not stand , or even his best troops , for there shall be no strength to stand .
ESV	Daniel	11	16	But he who comes against him shall ( V ) do as he wills , and ( W ) none shall stand before him . And he shall stand in ( X ) the glorious land , with destruction in his hand .
ESV	Daniel	11	17	He shall ( Y ) set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom , and he shall bring terms of an agreement and perform them . He shall give him the daughter of women to destroy the kingdom , [ c ] but it shall not stand or be to his advantage .
ESV	Daniel	11	18	Afterward he shall turn his face to the coastlands and shall capture many of them , but a commander shall put an end to his insolence . Indeed , [ d ] he ( Z ) shall turn his insolence back upon him .
ESV	Daniel	11	19	Then he shall turn his face back toward the ( AA ) fortresses of his own land , but he shall ( AB ) stumble and fall , ( AC ) and shall not be found .
ESV	Daniel	11	20	“ Then shall arise in his place one who shall send an ( AD ) exactor of tribute for the glory of the kingdom . But within a few days he shall be broken , neither in anger nor in battle .
ESV	Daniel	11	21	In his place shall arise a contemptible person to whom royal majesty has not been given . ( AE ) He shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom ( AF ) by flatteries .
ESV	Daniel	11	22	Armies shall be ( AG ) utterly swept away before him and broken , even the prince of the covenant .
ESV	Daniel	11	23	And from the time that an alliance is made with him he shall act deceitfully , and he shall become strong with a small people .
ESV	Daniel	11	24	( AH ) Without warning he shall come into ( AI ) the richest parts [ e ] of the province , and he shall do what neither his fathers nor his fathers ' fathers have done , scattering among them plunder , spoil , and goods . He shall devise plans against strongholds , but only for a time .
ESV	Daniel	11	25	And he shall stir up his power and his heart against ( AJ ) the king of the south with a great army . And the king of the south shall wage war with an exceedingly great and mighty army , but he shall not stand , for plots shall be devised against him .
ESV	Daniel	11	26	Even those who eat his food shall break him . His army shall be ( AK ) swept away , and many shall fall down slain .
ESV	Daniel	11	27	And as for the two kings , their hearts shall be bent on doing evil . They shall speak lies at the same table , but to no avail , for ( AL ) the end is yet to be at the time appointed .
ESV	Daniel	11	28	And he shall return to his land with great wealth , but his heart shall be set against the holy covenant . And he shall work his will and return to his own land .
ESV	Daniel	11	29	“ At the time appointed he shall return and come into the south , but it shall not be this time as it was before .
ESV	Daniel	11	30	For ships of ( AM ) Kittim shall come against him , and he shall be afraid and withdraw , and shall turn back and ( AN ) be enraged and ( AO ) take action against the holy covenant . He shall turn back and pay attention to those who forsake the holy covenant .
ESV	Daniel	11	31	Forces from him shall appear and ( AP ) profane the temple and fortress , and shall take away the regular burnt offering . And ( AQ ) they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate .
ESV	Daniel	11	32	He shall seduce with flattery those who violate the covenant , but the people who know their God shall stand firm and take action .
ESV	Daniel	11	33	( AR ) And the wise among the people shall make many understand , though for some days they shall stumble by sword and flame , by captivity and plunder .
ESV	Daniel	11	34	When they stumble , they shall receive a little help . And many shall join themselves to them with flattery ,
ESV	Daniel	11	35	and some of the wise shall stumble , so that they may be refined , ( AS ) purified , and ( AT ) made white , until ( AU ) the time of the end , ( AV ) for it still awaits the appointed time .
ESV	Daniel	11	36	“ And the king shall ( AW ) do as he wills . ( AX ) He shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god , ( AY ) and shall speak astonishing things against ( AZ ) the God of gods . ( BA ) He shall prosper ( BB ) till the indignation is accomplished ; for what is decreed shall be done .
ESV	Daniel	11	37	He shall pay no attention to the gods of his fathers , or to the one beloved by women . He shall not pay attention to any other god , for ( BC ) he shall magnify himself above all .
ESV	Daniel	11	38	He shall honor the god of fortresses instead of these . A god whom his fathers did not know he shall honor ( BD ) with gold and silver , with precious stones and costly gifts .
ESV	Daniel	11	39	He shall deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god . Those who acknowledge him he shall load with honor . He shall make them rulers over many and ( BE ) shall divide the land for a price . [ f ]
ESV	Daniel	11	40	( BF ) “ At the time of the end , the king of the south shall attack [ g ] him , but the king of the north shall rush upon him ( BG ) like a whirlwind , with chariots and horsemen , and with many ships . And he shall come into countries and ( BH ) shall overflow and pass through .
ESV	Daniel	11	41	He shall come into ( BI ) the glorious land . And tens of thousands shall fall , but these shall be delivered out of his hand : ( BJ ) Edom and ( BK ) Moab and the main part of the ( BL ) Ammonites .
ESV	Daniel	11	42	He shall stretch out his hand against the countries , and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
ESV	Daniel	11	43	He shall become ruler of the treasures of gold and of silver , and all the precious things of Egypt , and the ( BM ) Libyans and the ( BN ) Cushites shall follow in his train .
ESV	Daniel	11	44	But news from the east and the north shall alarm him , and he shall go out with great fury to destroy and devote many to destruction .

ESV	Hosea	1	2	When the Lord first spoke through Hosea , the Lord said to Hosea , ( C ) “ Go , take to yourself a wife of whoredom and have ( D ) children of whoredom , for ( E ) the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the Lord. ”

ESV	Hosea	2	3	lest ( E ) I strip her naked and make her as ( F ) in the day she was born , and ( G ) make her like a wilderness , and make her like a parched land , and kill her with thirst .
ESV	Hosea	2	4	( H ) Upon her children also I will have no mercy , ( I ) because they are children of whoredom .
ESV	Hosea	2	5	For ( J ) their mother has played the whore ; she who conceived them has acted shamefully . For ( K ) she said , ‘ I will go after my lovers , who ( L ) give me my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , my oil and my drink. ’
ESV	Hosea	2	6	Therefore ( M ) I will hedge up her [ d ] way with thorns , and ( N ) I will build a wall against her , so that she can not find her paths .
ESV	Hosea	2	7	She shall pursue her lovers but not overtake them , and she shall seek them but shall not find them . ( O ) Then she shall say , ‘ I will go and return to ( P ) my first husband , ( Q ) for it was better for me then than now. ’

ESV	Hosea	13	13	( AB ) The pangs of childbirth come for him , but he is an unwise son , for at the right time he does not present himself ( AC ) at the opening of the womb .
ESV	Hosea	13	2	And now they sin more and more , and ( C ) make for themselves metal images , idols skillfully made of their silver , ( D ) all of them the work of craftsmen . It is said of them , “ Those who offer human sacrifice ( E ) kiss calves ! ”
ESV	Hosea	13	3	Therefore they shall be ( F ) like the morning mist or ( G ) like the dew that goes early away , ( H ) like the chaff that swirls from the threshing floor or ( I ) like smoke from a window .
ESV	Hosea	13	4	But ( J ) I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt ; ( K ) you know no God but me , and ( L ) besides me there is no savior .
ESV	Hosea	13	5	( M ) It was I who knew you in the wilderness , in the land of drought ;
ESV	Hosea	13	6	( N ) but when they had grazed , [ a ] they became full , ( O ) they were filled , and their heart was lifted up ; ( P ) therefore they forgot me .
ESV	Hosea	13	7	So ( Q ) I am to them like a lion ; ( R ) like a leopard I will lurk beside the way .
ESV	Hosea	13	8	I will fall upon them ( S ) like a bear robbed of her cubs ; I will tear open their breast , and there I will devour them like a lion , ( T ) as a wild beast would rip them open .
ESV	Hosea	13	9	He destroys [ b ] you , O Israel , for you are against me , against ( U ) your helper .
ESV	Hosea	13	10	( V ) Where now is your king , to save you in all your cities ? Where are all your rulers— those of whom ( W ) you said , “ Give me a king and princes ” ?
ESV	Hosea	13	11	( X ) I gave you a king in my anger , and ( Y ) I took him away in my wrath .
ESV	Hosea	13	12	The iniquity of Ephraim is ( Z ) bound up ; his sin is ( AA ) kept in store .
ESV	Hosea	13	14	( AD ) I shall ransom them from the power of Sheol ; ( AE ) I shall redeem them from Death . [ c ] ( AF ) O ( AG ) Death , where are your plagues ? ( AH ) O ( AI ) Sheol , where is your sting ? ( AJ ) Compassion is hidden from my eyes .
ESV	Hosea	13	15	Though ( AK ) he may flourish among his brothers , ( AL ) the east wind , the wind of the Lord , shall come , rising from the wilderness , ( AM ) and his fountain shall dry up ; his spring shall be parched ; it shall strip ( AN ) his treasury of every precious thing .
ESV	Hosea	13	16	[ d ] Samaria ( AO ) shall bear her guilt , because ( AP ) she has rebelled against her God ; they shall fall by the sword ; ( AQ ) their little ones shall be dashed in pieces , and their ( AR ) pregnant women ripped open .

ESV	Hosea	14	2	Take with you words and return to the Lord ; say to him , “ Take away all iniquity ; accept ( C ) what is good , and we will pay with bulls ( D ) the vows [ a ] of our lips .
ESV	Hosea	14	3	( E ) Assyria shall not save us ; ( F ) we will not ride on horses ; and ( G ) we will say no more , ‘ Our God , ’ to the work of our hands . ( H ) In you the orphan finds mercy. ”
ESV	Hosea	14	4	I ( I ) will heal their apostasy ; ( J ) I will love them freely , for my anger has turned from them .
ESV	Hosea	14	5	( K ) I will be like the dew to Israel ; ( L ) he shall blossom like the lily ; he shall take root like the trees ( M ) of Lebanon ;
ESV	Hosea	14	6	his shoots shall spread out ; his beauty shall be ( N ) like the olive , and his fragrance like Lebanon .
ESV	Hosea	14	7	They shall return and ( O ) dwell beneath my [ b ] shadow ; they shall flourish like the grain ; they shall blossom like the vine ; their fame shall be like the wine of Lebanon .
ESV	Hosea	14	8	O ( P ) Ephraim , what have I to do with idols ? It is I who answer and look after you . [ c ] I am like an evergreen cypress ; ( Q ) from me comes your fruit .

ESV	Joel	1	1	The word of the Lord that came to Joel , the son of Pethuel : An Invasion of Locusts
ESV	Joel	1	2	( A ) Hear this , ( B ) you elders ; give ear , ( C ) all inhabitants of the land ! ( D ) Has such a thing happened in your days , or in the days of your fathers ?
ESV	Joel	1	3	( E ) Tell your children of it , and let your children tell their children , and their children to another generation .
ESV	Joel	1	4	What ( F ) the cutting locust left , ( G ) the swarming locust has eaten . What the swarming locust left , ( H ) the hopping locust has eaten , and what the hopping locust left , ( I ) the destroying locust has eaten .
ESV	Joel	1	5	Awake , you drunkards , and weep , and ( J ) wail , all you drinkers of wine , because of ( K ) the sweet wine , for it is cut off from your mouth .
ESV	Joel	1	6	For ( L ) a nation has come up against my land , ( M ) powerful and beyond number ; ( N ) its teeth are lions ' teeth , and it has the fangs of a lioness .
ESV	Joel	1	7	It has laid waste my vine and splintered my ( O ) fig tree ; it has stripped off their bark and thrown it down ; their branches are made white .
ESV	Joel	1	8	Lament like a virgin [ a ] ( P ) wearing sackcloth for the bridegroom of her youth .
ESV	Joel	1	9	( Q ) The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off from the house of the Lord . ( R ) The priests mourn , ( S ) the ministers of the Lord .

ESV	Joel	1	11	( W ) Be ashamed , [ b ] O tillers of the soil ; wail , O vinedressers , for the wheat and the barley , ( X ) because the harvest of the field has perished .
ESV	Joel	1	12	The vine dries up ; ( Y ) the fig tree languishes . Pomegranate , palm , and apple , all the trees of the field are dried up , and ( Z ) gladness dries up from the children of man . A Call to Repentance
ESV	Joel	1	13	( AA ) Put on sackcloth and lament , ( AB ) O priests ; ( AC ) wail , O ministers of the altar . Go in , ( AD ) pass the night in sackcloth , ( AE ) O ministers of my God ! ( AF ) Because grain offering and drink offering are withheld from the house of your God .
ESV	Joel	1	14	( AG ) Consecrate a fast ; ( AH ) call a solemn assembly . Gather ( AI ) the elders and ( AJ ) all the inhabitants of the land to the house of the Lord your God , and cry out to the Lord .
ESV	Joel	1	15	Alas for the day ! ( AK ) For the day of the Lord is near , and as destruction from the Almighty [ c ] it comes .
ESV	Joel	1	16	Is not the food cut off before our eyes , ( AL ) joy and gladness from the house of our God ?
ESV	Joel	1	17	( AM ) The seed shrivels under the clods ; [ d ] the storehouses are desolate ; the granaries are torn down because ( AN ) the grain has dried up .
ESV	Joel	1	18	How ( AO ) the beasts groan ! The herds of cattle are perplexed because there is no pasture for them ; even the flocks of sheep suffer . [ e ]

ESV	Joel	2	2	( E ) a day of darkness and gloom , ( F ) a day of clouds and thick darkness ! Like blackness there is spread upon the mountains ( G ) a great and powerful people ; ( H ) their like has never been before , nor will be again after them through the years of all generations .
ESV	Joel	2	3	( I ) Fire devours before them , and behind them a flame burns . The land is like ( J ) the garden of Eden before them , but ( K ) behind them a desolate wilderness , and nothing escapes them .
ESV	Joel	2	4	( L ) Their appearance is like the appearance of horses , and like war horses they run .
ESV	Joel	2	5	( M ) As with the rumbling of chariots , they leap on the tops of the mountains , like the crackling of ( N ) a flame of fire devouring the stubble , ( O ) like a powerful army drawn up for battle .
ESV	Joel	2	6	Before them peoples are in anguish ; ( P ) all faces grow pale .
ESV	Joel	2	7	Like warriors they charge ; like soldiers they scale the wall . They march each on his way ; they do not swerve from their paths .
ESV	Joel	2	8	They do not jostle one another ; ( Q ) each marches in his path ; they burst through the weapons and are not halted .
ESV	Joel	2	9	( R ) They leap upon the city , they run upon the walls , ( S ) they climb up into the houses , ( T ) they enter through the windows ( U ) like a thief .
ESV	Joel	2	10	( V ) The earth quakes before them ; the heavens tremble . ( W ) The sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
ESV	Joel	2	11	( X ) The Lord utters his voice before ( Y ) his army , for his camp is exceedingly great ; ( Z ) he who executes his word is powerful . ( AA ) For the day of the Lord is ( AB ) great and very awesome ; ( AC ) who can endure it ? Return to the Lord
ESV	Joel	2	12	“ Yet even now , ” declares the Lord , ( AD ) “ return to me with all your heart , ( AE ) with fasting , with weeping , and with mourning ;
ESV	Joel	2	13	and ( AF ) rend your hearts and not ( AG ) your garments. ” Return to the Lord your God , ( AH ) for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and abounding in steadfast love ; ( AI ) and he relents over disaster .
ESV	Joel	2	14	( AJ ) Who knows whether he will not turn and relent , and ( AK ) leave a blessing behind him , ( AL ) a grain offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God ?
ESV	Joel	2	15	( AM ) Blow the trumpet in Zion ; ( AN ) consecrate a fast ; call a solemn assembly ;
ESV	Joel	2	16	gather the people . ( AO ) Consecrate the congregation ; assemble the elders ; ( AP ) gather the children , even nursing infants . ( AQ ) Let the bridegroom leave his room , and the bride her chamber .
ESV	Joel	2	17	( AR ) Between the ( AS ) vestibule and the ( AT ) altar ( AU ) let the priests , the ministers of the Lord , weep and say , “ Spare your people , O Lord , and make not your heritage a reproach , a byword among the nations . [ a ] ( AV ) Why should they say among the peoples , ‘ Where is their God ? ’ ” The Lord Had Pity
ESV	Joel	2	18	( AW ) Then the Lord became jealous for his land ( AX ) and had pity on his people .
ESV	Joel	2	19	The Lord answered and said to his people , “ Behold , ( AY ) I am sending to you grain , wine , and oil , ( AZ ) and you will be satisfied ; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations .
ESV	Joel	2	20	“ I will remove the northerner far from you , and drive him into a parched and desolate land , his vanguard [ b ] into ( BA ) the eastern sea , and his rear guard [ c ] into ( BB ) the western sea ; ( BC ) the stench and foul smell of him will rise , for he has done great things .
ESV	Joel	2	21	“ Fear not , O land ; be glad and rejoice , for ( BD ) the Lord has done great things !
ESV	Joel	2	22	Fear not , ( BE ) you beasts of the field , for ( BF ) the pastures of the wilderness are green ; ( BG ) the tree bears its fruit ; the fig tree and ( BH ) vine give their full yield .
ESV	Joel	2	23	( BI ) “ Be glad , O children of Zion , and ( BJ ) rejoice in the Lord your God , for he has given ( BK ) the early rain for your vindication ; he has poured down for you abundant rain , ( BL ) the early and ( BM ) the latter rain , as before .
ESV	Joel	2	24	“ The threshing floors shall be full of grain ; the vats shall overflow with wine and oil .
ESV	Joel	2	25	I will restore [ d ] to you the years that ( BN ) the swarming locust has eaten , ( BO ) the hopper , ( BP ) the destroyer , and ( BQ ) the cutter , ( BR ) my great army , which I sent among you .
ESV	Joel	2	26	( BS ) “ You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied , and praise the name of the Lord your God , who has dealt wondrously with you . And my people ( BT ) shall never again be put to shame .
ESV	Joel	2	27	( BU ) You shall know that I am ( BV ) in the midst of Israel , and that ( BW ) I am the Lord your God ( BX ) and there is none else . And my people ( BY ) shall never again be put to shame . The Lord Will Pour Out His Spirit
ESV	Joel	2	28	[ e ] ( BZ ) “ And it shall come to pass afterward , that ( CA ) I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh ; ( CB ) your sons and ( CC ) your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , and your young men shall see visions .
ESV	Joel	2	29	( CD ) Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit .
ESV	Joel	2	30	“ And I will show ( CE ) wonders in the heavens and ( CF ) on the earth , blood and fire and columns of smoke .
ESV	Joel	2	31	( CG ) The sun shall be turned to darkness , ( CH ) and the moon to blood , ( CI ) before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes .
ESV	Joel	2	32	And it shall come to pass that ( CJ ) everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved . ( CK ) For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape , as the Lord has said , and among ( CL ) the survivors shall be those whom the Lord calls .

ESV	Amos	5	5	but do not seek ( D ) Bethel , and do not enter into ( E ) Gilgal or cross over to ( F ) Beersheba ; for ( G ) Gilgal shall surely go into exile , and ( H ) Bethel shall come to nothing. ”
ESV	Amos	5	2	“ Fallen , no more to rise , is ( B ) the virgin Israel ; forsaken on her land , with none to raise her up. ”
ESV	Amos	5	3	For thus says the Lord God : “ The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left , and that which went out a hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel. ”
ESV	Amos	5	4	For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel : ( C ) “ Seek me and live ;
ESV	Amos	5	6	( I ) Seek the Lord and live , ( J ) lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and it devour , with none to quench it for ( K ) Bethel ,
ESV	Amos	5	7	O ( L ) you who turn justice to wormwood [ a ] and cast down righteousness to the earth !
ESV	Amos	5	8	He who made the ( M ) Pleiades and Orion , and turns deep darkness into the morning and ( N ) darkens the day into night , who ( O ) calls for the waters of the sea ( P ) and pours them out on the surface of the earth , ( Q ) the Lord is his name ;
ESV	Amos	5	9	( R ) who makes destruction flash forth against the strong , so that destruction comes upon the fortress .
ESV	Amos	5	10	( S ) They hate him who reproves ( T ) in the gate , and they ( U ) abhor him who speaks the truth .
ESV	Amos	5	11	Therefore because you ( V ) trample on [ b ] the poor and you exact taxes of grain from him , ( W ) you have built houses of hewn stone , but you shall not dwell in them ; ( X ) you have planted pleasant vineyards , but you shall not drink their wine .
ESV	Amos	5	12	For I know how many are your transgressions and how great are your sins— you who afflict the righteous , who ( Y ) take a bribe , and ( Z ) turn aside the needy ( AA ) in the gate .
ESV	Amos	5	13	Therefore he who is prudent will ( AB ) keep silent in such a time , ( AC ) for it is an evil time .
ESV	Amos	5	14	( AD ) Seek good , and not evil , that you may live ; and so the Lord , ( AE ) the God of hosts , will be with you , as you have said .
ESV	Amos	5	15	( AF ) Hate evil , and love good , and establish justice ( AG ) in the gate ; ( AH ) it may be that the Lord , the God of hosts , will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph .
ESV	Amos	5	16	Therefore thus says the Lord , ( AI ) the God of hosts , the Lord : “ In all the squares ( AJ ) there shall be wailing , and in all the streets they shall say , ‘ Alas ! Alas ! ’ They shall call the farmers to mourning and ( AK ) to wailing those who are skilled in lamentation ,
ESV	Amos	5	17	and in all vineyards there shall be wailing , for ( AL ) I will pass through your midst , ” says the Lord . Let Justice Roll Down
ESV	Amos	5	18	Woe to you who desire ( AM ) the day of the Lord ! Why would you have the day of the Lord ? ( AN ) It is darkness , and not light ,
ESV	Amos	5	19	( AO ) as if a man fled from a lion , and a bear met him , or went into the house and leaned his hand against the wall , and a serpent bit him .
ESV	Amos	5	20	( AP ) Is not the day of the Lord darkness , and not light , and gloom with no brightness in it ?

ESV	Amos	5	22	( AR ) Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings , I will not accept them ; and the peace offerings of your fattened animals , I will not look upon them .
ESV	Amos	5	23	Take away from me the noise of your songs ; to ( AS ) the melody of your harps I will not listen .
ESV	Amos	5	24	But let justice roll down like waters , and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream .

ESV	Jonah	3	5	( C ) And the people of Nineveh believed God . ( D ) They called for a fast and ( E ) put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them to the least of them . The People of Nineveh Repent
ESV	Jonah	3	6	The word reached [ c ] the king of Nineveh , and ( F ) he arose from his throne , removed his robe , covered himself with sackcloth , ( G ) and sat in ashes .
ESV	Jonah	3	7	And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh , ( H ) “ By the decree of the king and his nobles : Let neither man nor ( I ) beast , herd nor flock , taste anything . Let them not feed or drink water ,

ESV	Jonah	4	4	And the Lord said , ( G ) “ Do you do well to be angry ? ”
ESV	Jonah	4	2	And he prayed to the Lord and said , “ O Lord , is not this what I said when I was yet in my country ? ( B ) That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish ; for I knew that you are a ( C ) gracious God and merciful , slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love , and ( D ) relenting from disaster .
ESV	Jonah	4	3	( E ) Therefore now , O Lord , please take my life from me , ( F ) for it is better for me to die than to live. ”
ESV	Jonah	4	5	Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and ( H ) made a booth for himself there . He sat under it in the shade , till he should see what would become of the city .
ESV	Jonah	4	6	Now the Lord God appointed a plant [ b ] and made it come up over Jonah , that it might be a shade over his head , to save him from his discomfort . [ c ] So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant .
ESV	Jonah	4	7	But when dawn came up the next day , God appointed a worm that attacked the plant , so that it withered .
ESV	Jonah	4	8	When the sun rose , God appointed a scorching ( I ) east wind , ( J ) and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he ( K ) was faint . And he asked that he might die and said , ( L ) “ It is better for me to die than to live. ”
ESV	Jonah	4	9	But God said to Jonah , ( M ) “ Do you do well to be angry for the plant ? ” And he said , “ Yes , I do well to be angry , angry enough to die. ”
ESV	Jonah	4	10	And the Lord said , “ You pity the plant , for which you did not labor , nor did you make it grow , which came into being in a night and perished in a night .
ESV	Jonah	4	11	And should not I pity ( N ) Nineveh , that great city , in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left , and also much ( O ) cattle ? ” The Holy Bible , English Standard Version . ESV® Text Edition :

ESV	Micah	1	1	The word of the Lord that came to Micah ( A ) of Moresheth ( B ) in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw ( C ) concerning ( D ) Samaria and Jerusalem . The Coming Destruction
ESV	Micah	1	2	( E ) Hear , you peoples , all of you ; [ a ] ( F ) pay attention , O earth , and all that is in it , and ( G ) let the Lord God be a witness against you , ( H ) the Lord from his holy temple .
ESV	Micah	1	3	For behold , ( I ) the Lord is coming out of ( J ) his place , and will come down and ( K ) tread upon the high places of the earth .
ESV	Micah	1	4	And ( L ) the mountains will melt under him , and the valleys will split open , like wax before the fire , like waters poured down a steep place .
ESV	Micah	1	5	All this is for ( M ) the transgression of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel . ( N ) What is the transgression of Jacob ? Is it not ( O ) Samaria ? And what is ( P ) the high place of Judah ? Is it not Jerusalem ?
ESV	Micah	1	6	Therefore I will make ( Q ) Samaria ( R ) a heap in the open country , a place for planting vineyards , and I will pour down her stones ( S ) into the valley and ( T ) uncover her foundations .
ESV	Micah	1	7	All ( U ) her carved images shall be beaten to pieces , ( V ) all her wages shall be burned with fire , and all her idols I will lay waste , for from ( W ) the fee of a prostitute she gathered them , and to the fee of a prostitute they shall return .
ESV	Micah	1	8	( X ) For this I will lament and wail ; I will go ( Y ) stripped and naked ; I will make lamentation ( Z ) like the jackals , and mourning ( AA ) like the ostriches .
ESV	Micah	1	9	( AB ) For her wound is incurable , and it has come to Judah ; it has reached to the gate of my people , to Jerusalem .
ESV	Micah	1	10	( AC ) Tell it not in ( AD ) Gath ; weep not at all ; in Beth-le-aphrah ( AE ) roll yourselves in the dust .
ESV	Micah	1	11	Pass on your way , inhabitants of Shaphir , ( AF ) in nakedness and shame ; the inhabitants of Zaanan do not come out ; the lamentation of Beth-ezel shall take away from you its standing place .
ESV	Micah	1	12	For the inhabitants of Maroth wait anxiously for good , because disaster has come down ( AG ) from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem .
ESV	Micah	1	13	Harness the steeds to the chariots , inhabitants of ( AH ) Lachish ; it was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion , for in you were found ( AI ) the transgressions of Israel .
ESV	Micah	1	14	Therefore you shall give parting gifts [ b ] to ( AJ ) Moresheth-gath ; the houses of ( AK ) Achzib shall be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel .
ESV	Micah	1	15	I will again bring ( AL ) a conqueror to you , inhabitants of ( AM ) Mareshah ; the glory of Israel shall come to ( AN ) Adullam .

ESV	Micah	2	3	Therefore thus says the Lord : behold , against ( D ) this family I am devising disaster , [ a ] from which you can not remove your necks , and you ( E ) shall not walk haughtily , ( F ) for it will be a time of disaster .
ESV	Micah	2	4	In that day ( G ) they shall take up a taunt song against you and moan bitterly , and say , “ We are utterly ruined ; ( H ) he changes the portion of my people ; ( I ) how he removes it from me ! ( J ) To an apostate he allots our fields. ”
ESV	Micah	2	5	Therefore you will have none ( K ) to cast the line by lot in the assembly of the Lord .
ESV	Micah	2	6	( L ) “ Do not preach ” —thus they preach— ( M ) “ one should not preach of such things ; ( N ) disgrace will not overtake us. ”
ESV	Micah	2	7	Should this be said , O house of Jacob ? ( O ) Has the Lord grown impatient ? [ b ] Are these his deeds ? Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly ?
ESV	Micah	2	8	But lately ( P ) my people have risen up as an enemy ; you strip the rich robe from those who pass by trustingly with no thought of war . [ c ]
ESV	Micah	2	9	The women of my people you drive out from their delightful houses ; from their young children you take away my splendor forever .
ESV	Micah	2	10	( Q ) Arise and go , for this is no ( R ) place to rest , because of ( S ) uncleanness that destroys with a grievous destruction .
ESV	Micah	2	11	If a man should go about and ( T ) utter wind and lies , saying , “ I will preach to you ( U ) of wine and strong drink , ” he would be the preacher for this people !
ESV	Micah	2	12	I will surely assemble all of you , O Jacob ; ( V ) I will gather ( W ) the remnant of Israel ; I will set them together like sheep in a fold , ( X ) like a flock in its pasture , a noisy multitude of men .

ESV	Nahum	1	2	( C ) The Lord is a jealous and avenging God ; the Lord is avenging and wrathful ; ( D ) the Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries and ( E ) keeps wrath for his enemies .
ESV	Nahum	1	3	( F ) The Lord is slow to anger and ( G ) great in power , and ( H ) the Lord will by no means clear the guilty . ( I ) His way is in whirlwind and storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
ESV	Nahum	1	4	( J ) He rebukes the sea and makes it dry ; he dries up all the rivers ; ( K ) Bashan and ( L ) Carmel wither ; the bloom of ( M ) Lebanon withers .

ESV	Nahum	1	11	From you came one ( AC ) who plotted evil against the Lord , a worthless counselor .

ESV	Habakkuk	1	1	( A ) The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw . Habakkuk 's Complaint
ESV	Habakkuk	1	2	O Lord , ( B ) how long shall I cry for help , and you will not hear ? Or cry to you ( C ) “ Violence ! ” and you will not save ?
ESV	Habakkuk	1	3	( D ) Why do you make me see iniquity , and why do you idly look at wrong ? Destruction ( E ) and violence are before me ; strife and contention arise .
ESV	Habakkuk	1	4	( F ) So the law is paralyzed , and justice never goes forth . ( G ) For the wicked surround the righteous ; so justice goes forth perverted . The Lord 's Answer
ESV	Habakkuk	1	5	( H ) “ Look among the nations , and see ; wonder and be astounded . ( I ) For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told .
ESV	Habakkuk	1	6	For behold , ( J ) I am raising up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , ( K ) who march through the breadth of the earth , ( L ) to seize dwellings not their own .
ESV	Habakkuk	1	7	They are dreaded and fearsome ; ( M ) their justice and dignity go forth from themselves .
ESV	Habakkuk	1	8	( N ) Their horses are swifter than leopards , more fierce than ( O ) the evening wolves ; their horsemen press proudly on . Their horsemen come from afar ; ( P ) they fly like an eagle swift to devour .
ESV	Habakkuk	1	9	They all come ( Q ) for violence , all their faces forward . They gather captives ( R ) like sand .
ESV	Habakkuk	1	10	At kings they scoff , and at rulers they laugh . ( S ) They laugh at every fortress , for ( T ) they pile up earth and take it .
ESV	Habakkuk	1	11	Then they sweep by like the wind and go on , ( U ) guilty men , ( V ) whose own might is their god ! ” Habakkuk 's Second Complaint
ESV	Habakkuk	1	12	Are you not ( W ) from everlasting , O Lord my God , my Holy One ? ( X ) We shall not die . O Lord , ( Y ) you have ordained them as a judgment , and you , O ( Z ) Rock , have established them for reproof .
ESV	Habakkuk	1	13	You who are ( AA ) of purer eyes than to see evil and can not look at wrong , ( AB ) why do you idly look at traitors and ( AC ) remain silent when the wicked swallows up the man more righteous than he ?
ESV	Habakkuk	1	14	You make mankind like the fish of the sea , like crawling things that have no ruler .
ESV	Habakkuk	1	15	( AD ) He [ a ] brings all of them up ( AE ) with a hook ; he drags them out with his net ; he gathers them in his dragnet ; so he rejoices and is glad .
ESV	Habakkuk	1	16	( AF ) Therefore he sacrifices to his net and makes offerings to his dragnet ; for by them he lives in luxury , [ b ] and his food is rich .

ESV	Habakkuk	2	17	( AL ) The violence ( AM ) done to Lebanon will overwhelm you , as will the destruction of the beasts that terrified them , ( AN ) for the blood of man and violence to the earth , to cities and all who dwell in them .

ESV	Zechariah	8	15	so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah ; ( Z ) fear not .

ESV	Zechariah	9	6	( K ) a mixed people [ b ] shall dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of Philistia .
ESV	Zechariah	9	7	I will take away ( L ) its blood from its mouth , and ( M ) its abominations from between its teeth ; ( N ) it too shall be a remnant for our God ; it shall be like ( O ) a clan in Judah , and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites .

ESV	Zechariah	9	10	( X ) I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and ( Y ) the war horse from Jerusalem ; and the battle bow shall be cut off , and ( Z ) he shall speak peace to the nations ; ( AA ) his rule shall be from sea to sea , and from ( AB ) the River [ c ] to the ends of the earth .
ESV	Zechariah	9	11	As for you also , because of ( AC ) the blood of my covenant with you , ( AD ) I will set your prisoners free from ( AE ) the waterless pit .

ESV	Zechariah	11	11	So it was annulled on that day , and the sheep traders , who were watching me , knew that it was the word of the Lord .
ESV	Zechariah	11	2	Wail , O cypress , for the cedar has fallen , for the glorious trees are ruined ! Wail , ( B ) oaks of Bashan , for the thick forest has been felled !
ESV	Zechariah	11	3	The sound of ( C ) the wail of ( D ) the shepherds , for their glory is ruined ! The sound of the roar of ( E ) the lions , ( F ) for the thicket of the Jordan is ruined !
ESV	Zechariah	11	4	Thus said the Lord my God : ( G ) “ Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter .
ESV	Zechariah	11	5	( H ) Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished , and those who sell them say , ‘ Blessed be the Lord , ( I ) I have become rich , ’ and their own shepherds have no pity on them .
ESV	Zechariah	11	6	For ( J ) I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land , declares the Lord . Behold , I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor , and each into the hand of his king , and they shall crush the land , and I will deliver none from their hand. ”
ESV	Zechariah	11	7	( K ) So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders . And I took two staffs , one I named ( L ) Favor , the other I named ( M ) Union . ( N ) And I tended the sheep .
ESV	Zechariah	11	8	In one month ( O ) I destroyed the three shepherds . But I became impatient with them , and they also detested me .
ESV	Zechariah	11	9	So I said , “ I will not be your shepherd . ( P ) What is to die , let it die . What is to be destroyed , let it be destroyed . And let those who are left devour the flesh of one another. ”
ESV	Zechariah	11	10	And I took ( Q ) my staff Favor , and I broke it , annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples .
ESV	Zechariah	11	12	Then I said to them , “ If it seems good to you , give me my wages ; but if not , keep them. ” And they weighed out as my wages ( R ) thirty pieces of silver .
ESV	Zechariah	11	13	Then the Lord said to me , “ Throw it to the potter ” — ( S ) the lordly price at which I was priced by them . So I took the ( T ) thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord , to the potter .
ESV	Zechariah	11	14	Then I broke ( U ) my second staff Union , annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel .
ESV	Zechariah	11	15	Then the Lord said to me , “ Take once more the equipment of ( V ) a foolish shepherd .
ESV	Zechariah	11	16	For behold , I am raising up in the land a shepherd ( W ) who does not care for those being destroyed , or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy , but ( X ) devours the flesh of the fat ones , tearing off even their hoofs .

ESV	Malachi	1	6	( G ) “ A son honors his father , and a servant his master . If then I am ( H ) a father , where is my honor ? And if I am ( I ) a master , where is my fear ? says the Lord of hosts to you , O priests , who despise my name . ( J ) But you say , ‘ How have we despised your name ? ’
ESV	Malachi	1	7	( K ) By offering polluted food upon my altar . ( L ) But you say , ‘ How have we polluted you ? ’ By saying that ( M ) the Lord 's table may be despised .
ESV	Malachi	1	8	( N ) When you offer blind animals in sacrifice , is that not evil ? And when you offer those that are lame or sick , is that not evil ? Present that to your governor ; will he accept you or show you favor ? says the Lord of hosts .
ESV	Malachi	1	9	And now ( O ) entreat the favor of God , that he may be gracious to us . With such a gift from your hand , ( P ) will he show favor to any of you ? says the Lord of hosts .
ESV	Malachi	1	10	( Q ) Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors , that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain ! I have no pleasure in you , says the Lord of hosts , ( R ) and I will not accept an offering from your hand .
